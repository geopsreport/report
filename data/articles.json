        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 The U.S. Navy\u2019s Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) program, the future sea-based leg of the nuclear triad, is plagued by significant cost overruns and production delays.\n\n-The first boat, USS District of Columbia (SSBN-826), is already over a year behind schedule and hundreds of millions over budget, with a service entry date not expected until 2031.\n\n-This delay is alarming as the aging Ohio-class boomers they are meant to replace are nearing the end of their service lives. The program\u2019s struggles highlight a broader crisis in the U.S. submarine industrial base, which is struggling to keep pace with China\u2019s rapid naval expansion.\n\nA Submarine \u2018Nightmare\u2019? The Navy\u2019s New Columbia-Class Is Billions Over Budget\n\nThis past 23 April, U.S. Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Pete Hegseth, in a speech to students at the prestigious U.S. Army War College, announced that the Pentagon was launching review of \u201call 72 active major defense acquisitions programs\u201d in accordance with President Donald J. Trump\u2019s 9 April Executive Order that that aims to modernize defense acquisitions and spurs innovation in the defense industrial base.\n\nThe Columbia-Class Submarine Dilemma\n\nThe importance of SECDEF\u2019s (and the POTUS\u2019s) objectives could hardly be overstated, as the DOD acquisition process is infamously replete with horror stories of weapons systems that look splendid on-paper but keep running afoul of the twin maladies of production delays and cost overruns.\n\nAccordingly, 19FortyFive now continues with the second in a four-part series on U.S. Navy warship programs that are thusly plagued. We started with the SSN(X) submarine program, and this time we\u2019ll stick with the submarine theme, this time covering the Columbia-class SSBNs.\n\nSemantic Clarification: SSBNs vs. SSNs\n\n\u201cSSBN\u201d stands for \u201cShip Submersible Ballistic Nuclear\u201d i.e. a nuclear-powered submarine that also packs a nuclear payload, as in submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). This distinguishes them from SSNs (\u201cSubmersible Ship Nuclear\u201d), which are general purpose attack submarine aka \u201cfast-attack\u201d boats that, though nuclear-powered, SSNs don\u2019t carry actual nuclear weapons. (Examples of the latter category include the Virginia-class, the Seawolf-class, and the Los Angeles-class (SSN 668) boats.)\n\nColumbia-Class Premise and Promise\n\nThe Columbia-class subs (previously known as the Ohio Replacement Submarine and SSBN-X Future Follow-on Submarine projects) certainly look like world beaters in concept.\n\nFor starters, their physical size alone will make them an impressive sight to behold: a hull length of 560 feet and a submerged displacement of 20,810 long tons, making them the largest submarines to come out of a US shipyard. T\n\nAs noted by the Submarine Industrial Base Council (SIBC) information page, the Columbias are designed with a 42-year service life in mind, made by a possible a reactor that eliminates for the need mid-life reactor refueling overhaul (a process that typically takes two years); conceivably, this could save an estimated $40 billion USD over the life of the class.\n\nConceivably (that word again), further significant costs savings (in the areas of construction, operations, and maintenance) would be made possible by the reconfiguration of the boats\u2019 armament configuration, with 16 SLBM launch tubes as opposed to the 24 tubes on the current Ohio-class SSBNs. Now, granted, that\u2019s a one-third reduction in the *quantity* of launch tubes, but the Columbia boats still have plenty of *quality* of armament, to the tune of Trident D5 SLBMs (starting with the ninth ship in the class, these will be upgraded to the D5LE2) and backed up by twin torpedo tubes packing the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo.\n\nErgo, ideally, it should only take 12 Columbias to replace the 14 Ohios and give more proverbial bang for the buck. So far so good, right? Sounds ideal, right?\n\nColumbia-Class Drama: Problems with the Program\n\nNonetheless, as our ever-savvy readers have undoubtedly already figured out from the opening segment of this article (as well as the previous article in this series), the Columbia program that sounds marvelous in theory is drowning and flailing in practice due to massive expenses and production delays.\n\nJust how severe are these delays and expenses? As one of my 19FortyFive colleagues, Dr. Brent M. Eastwood notes in a 25 March 2025 article titled \u201cThe Navy Wants More Columbia-Class Missile Submarines (But There\u2019s a Catch),\u201d \u201cThe Navy plans to spend $130 billion to purchase 12 Columbia-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. However, the first submarine is estimated to arrive over a year behind schedule and cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than planned.\u201d\n\nAs for the production delays, construction on the first ship of the class, the USS District of Columbia (SSBN-826) began on 1 October 2020, but the vessel isn\u2019t scheduled to enter service until 2031; meanwhile, the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) continues to expand and modernize its own submarine fleet.\n\nThe production delays in the Columbia class are just one variable in a larger bothersome equation affecting the US Navy\u2019s ambitions. As Indo-Pacific (INDOPACOM) Commander Admiral Samuel j. Paparo Jr. told his audience at the McCain Institute\u2019s annual Sedona Forum back on 2 May, the PLAN churns out six combat naval ships annually, compared with the 1.8 manufactured in the US; diving deeper into those sobering stats, the Admiral noted that Beijing produces two submarines a year for every 1.4 made in America.\n\nThe Navy brass is hoping to rectify these lagging numbers , via the so-called \u201c1+2+Sustainment by 2028\u201d plan and the ongoing BuildSubmarines employment recruiting push. The goal is to boost submarine production to three per year\u2014one Columbia and two Virginia-class SSNs\u2014by 2028. Time will tell if these lofty production goals are achieved.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Solution? Stick with the Ohio-Class?\n\nCancellation of the Columbias is not an option, as they\u2019re needed to upgrade the USN SSBN fleet and keep up with China and Russia. So then, can the U.S. Navy simply continue to rely on the venerable and battle-proven Ohio class boats in the meantime?\n\nThe problem, according to my 19FortyFive colleague Steve Balestrieri, is that \u201cthe Ohio-class boats will be 42 years old, possibly older.\u201d In other words, those grand old underwater behemoths are simply getting too long in the proverbial tooth.\n\nWhich just further underscores the urgency of the SECDEF\u2019s and POTUS\u2019s initiatives as well as the \u201c1+2+Sustainment by 2028\u201d plan and the BuildSubmarines effort.\n\nAbout the Author: Christian D.

        "text": "In October 2024, Iran threatened to abandon the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and pursue a nuclear weapon if attacked by Israel. If history and early assessments of Israeli and U.S. strikes are any indication, Iran was not bluffing. It is likely to pursue the bomb. However, this need not spark a regional arms race if the U.S. stays engaged.\n\nSince the strikes, debate has polarized. Hawks argue the attacks delayed Iran\u2019s progress; skeptics highlight their limitations and risk of backfiring. The truth lies in between. Strikes can damage nuclear programs directly\u2014by destroying facilities\u2014and indirectly\u2014by deterring suppliers, tightening oversight, and complicating fissile material production.\n\nThe most effective strikes, such as Israel\u2019s 2007 attack on Syria, hit early-stage programs. Attacks on advanced or dispersed efforts, like Nazi Germany\u2019s and Iraq\u2019s Osirak, were less successful. Strikes may also harden a state\u2019s resolve. The Iran strikes caused real, if temporary, disruption. Yet Iran\u2019s self-sufficiency makes it resilient, and international pressure is waning. The Majlis voted to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, weakening the NPT framework.\n\nThe Israeli and U.S. strikes dealt a blow to Iran\u2019s program but fell short of crippling it. Key enrichment sites, including Natanz and Fordow, were hit. At Natanz, surface buildings and electrical systems were destroyed, likely affecting underground operations, though buried facilities remain under repair. Fordow faced similar damage: infrastructure was hit, and U.S. bunker-busters disabled centrifuges, but the site was not fully destroyed. At Isfahan, surface damage occurred, but underground sections are intact. Iran\u2019s core capabilities appear recoverable.\n\nAt Arak, Israel damaged the reactor dome and nearby structures, but the heavy water plant remained untouched. Since the reactor was not operational, the impact was limited. Civilian reactors\u2014Bushehr and the Tehran research reactor\u2014were spared. Bushehr remains active under Russian oversight, though the departure of Russian scientists raises concerns.\n\nThese strikes may delay, but not stop, Iran\u2019s progress. The country has indigenous expertise and a centrifuge stockpile. Rebuilding will be difficult\u2014but not decades away. Estimates suggest delays from months to a few years, depending on repair and adaptation speed.\n\nIn response, Iran may turn to covert enrichment methods like electromagnetic isotope separation. Though harder to detect, these approaches are technically demanding and may slow progress. Foreign aid has been minimal in recent years; past links to the A.Q. Khan network and Russian cooperation exist, but unlike Libya, Iran\u2019s program is largely domestic, making the loss of external support negligible. The strikes also led Iran to suspend IAEA cooperation, reducing oversight and raising fears it may withdraw from the NPT\u2014escalating tensions and prompting calls for stronger diplomacy.\n\nIn sum, the strikes degraded Iran\u2019s infrastructure but did not break its resolve. Strategic success depends on sustained pressure. Iran\u2019s ambitions remain, and delays may prove temporary.\n\nHistory Unlearned\u2014and Unarmed?\n\nIf past patterns hold, Iran will likely accelerate its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Israel\u2019s 1981 Osirak strike delayed Iraq\u2019s program but led Saddam to double down on uranium enrichment. Nazi Germany accelerated its efforts after Allied attacks until strikes on Norway\u2019s heavy water plant slowed progress. These examples suggest strikes may delay but rarely deter determined proliferators.\n\nIn contrast, Operation Orchard succeeded. In 2007, Israel destroyed Syria\u2019s nearly operational Al Kibar reactor. No enrichment or reprocessing facilities were found. The IAEA confirmed reactor traces, but Syria\u2019s concealment impeded full verification.\n\nWill Iran\u2019s Acceleration Trigger Regional Proliferation?\n\nFormer Secretary of State George Shultz warned, \u201cProliferation begets proliferation.\u201d While this is a concern in the Middle East, two factors may reduce the risk: credible U.S. security guarantees and economic incentives.\n\nAmerica\u2019s protection reduces the security dilemma for Iran\u2019s neighbors. Guarantees have historically curbed proliferation, not only in the Middle East but also in Asia. Moreover, major regional powers\u2014Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar\u2014prioritize foreign investment and trade. Nuclear programs, costly, rich in rents and likely to attract economic sanctions, undermine these goals and deter international investors.\n\nThe effectiveness of military strikes on nuclear programs is not binary. Their direct and indirect effects shape a program\u2019s trajectory. If history is a guide, limited damage may prompt Iran to accelerate\u2014but this need not result in a nuclear cascade if the U.S. stays engaged and regional powers are still economically outward-looking.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nAlbert B Wolf is a global fellow at Habib University.

Historical patterns suggest that such strikes may delay but not deter determined proliferators, as seen in past cases like Iraq and Nazi Germany. However, credible U.S. security guarantees and economic incentives for regional powers could mitigate the risk of a regional arms race. The effectiveness of military strikes is nuanced, and sustained diplomatic engagement is crucial to prevent further escalation.",

        "text": "In the wake of Israel\u2019s first rounds of its preemptive military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, aptly named \u201cOperation Rising Lion,\u201d commentators rushed to share their analyses of the operation and the effect it might have on larger geopolitics. Viewers and readers of these analyses had to dig through many word salads to find the genuinely helpful nuggets of commentary.\n\nSome analyses, however, were not only fundamentally flawed but also dangerous in the way they might shape the American understanding of the unfolding events. The takes that should draw particular scrutiny are those which refer to the events as \u201cIran\u2019s Pearl Harbor.\u201d\n\nNo historical analogy is perfect, but labeling attacks on our adversaries their \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d sends the wrong message about what happened and who has consistently been the provocateur.\n\nAttacks of Infamy\n\nOn \u201cthe day which will live in infamy,\u201d the Japanese caught the United States flat-footed. The aerial strike on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, destroyed 188 aircraft and sank or damaged 21 US warships within two hours. It was an incredibly large preemptive blow to American capabilities and was cause for much rejoicing throughout the Axis nations. Perhaps it is due to the element of surprise and the elimination of such significant capabilities in a short period that commentators refer to the events of Operation Rising Lion as \u201cIran\u2019s Pearl Harbor.\u201d\n\nDuring the initial strikes of Operation Rising Lion, there was indeed some element of surprise, though the possibility of action had been telegraphed for days beforehand. The operation also caused a great deal of damage to the Iranian nuclear program in its initial hours, including strikes against Natanz, a key site for producing fissile material for nuclear weaponry.\n\nIf by referring to Operation Rising Lion as the \u201cIranian Pearl Harbor,\u201d commentators wish to convey the notion that the Israeli military surprised the Iranian regime and simultaneously reduced its ability to wield hard power through the threat of nuclear enrichment, they are, for the most part, accurate.\n\nInfamous Adversary\n\nHowever, the destruction of military capability and the element of surprise are not initially where the minds of everyday Americans go when they remember Pearl Harbor.\n\nMost Americans indeed know it was a surprise attack that caused a great deal of damage to the military. Still, more importantly, they understand that this attack happened when the United States was not at war and that the attack was executed at the hands of an aggressive adversary. The assault on Pearl Harbor was a declaration of war in the minds of Americans.\n\nIt is here where we find the \u201cIranian Pearl Harbor\u201d to be a misnomer. The Iranian regime is far from a neutral party, not yet engaged in a war. Instead, Iran has been the perpetrator of an aggressive campaign against Israel by utilizing its regional proxies to conduct terror attacks, all while it continues to pursue the creation of a nuclear weapon to use to destroy both Israel and the United States. A preemptive strike is not to be confused with an unprovoked strike. Israel\u2019s Operation Rising Lion is a defensive action against a bellicose regime responsible for starting the conflict.\n\nMost importantly, when Americans remember Pearl Harbor, they think about the 2,400 Americans who died that day, including 68 civilians and another 1,178 wounded. We have a \u201cI don\u2019t care about the battleship; I care about the kid on it and his mother at home\u201d mentality that makes it difficult to separate the tactical events of the day and the grave loss we felt as a country.\n\nIn sharp contrast, Operation Rising Lion targeted only the nuclear scientists and political and military heads responsible for terror attacks and the continued pursuit of nuclear weapons. By calling Operation Rising Lion the \u201cIranian Pearl Harbor,\u201d we risk the Americans\u2019 fundamental misunderstanding of what we are trying to communicate in a way that may engender a sense that the Iranian regime is a victim. The bloody Iranian regime is no victim.\n\nPearl Harbor was a tragedy not because of the number of ships and aircraft lost, but because the surprise assault took the lives of many Americans. Not only is labeling significant attacks on a member of the axis of adversaries their \u201cPearl Harbor\u201d an imperfect historical analogy, but it also fundamentally misunderstands how Americans think about Pearl Harbor.\n\nWe should exercise great caution when using historical analogies from the American story to describe current events, as this may fundamentally alter America\u2019s narrative.\n\nAbout the Author: Anne Lord\n\nAnne Lord currently serves as the Vandenberg Coalition\u2019s Director of Government Affairs.

        "text": "The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed Donald Trump\u2019s major legislation, which he calls the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d Act.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate after Vice President J.D. Vance broke a 50-50 tie on the bill, in which all of the Democrats voted against, and they were joined by three Republicans: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). Tillis has already announced that he won\u2019t be seeking re-election, after Trump reacted to his no vote by vowing to back a primary challenge.\n\nThe House and Senate have both passed their versions of the bill, which are very different from one another, and both passed their respective chambers very narrowly. So, the two will have to be reconciled in such a way that can pass both chambers, to meet the president\u2019s goal of having a bill to sign by July 4.\n\nThere are several knocks against the bill, one of which is that it would almost certainly add to the deficit and national debt.\n\nA Debt Bomb?\n\nThe White House issued a fact sheet on Monday, citing its own Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), stating that the bill \u201cslashes deficits, national Debt while unleashing economic growth.\u201d\n\nThe fact sheet stated that the total deficit in 2034 \u201cis cut nearly in half\u2026 saving the country $1.1 trillion in that year alone,\u201d while primary deficits are seen flipping to surpluses by 2034.\n\n\u201cAn accurate budget score for the OBBB, inclusive of economic growth unleashed by President Trump\u2019s policies, is deficit reduction of $755 billion relative to the CBO\u2019s tax hike baseline and deficit reduction of $4.5 trillion relative to the current policy baseline,\u201d the fact sheet says, relying on extremely rosy projections of economic growth.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, however, sees things very differently.\n\nAccording to a CBO report issued on June 29, as cited by Axios, the Senate version of the bill would add $3.3 trillion in new debt. This is even more than the $2.8 trillion that would be added by the version that passed the House.\n\nThe Axios report added that the White House\u2019s interpretation of the data is \u201can outlier forecast compared to CBO and other models.\u201d\n\nIn addition, per CNN, the House version of the bill would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, with the Senate version raising it by $5 trillion.\n\nMusk vs. Debt\n\nAnother prominent voice is sounding the alarm about the debt that would be added by the One Big Beautiful Bill: Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and Trump\u2019s \u201cspecial government employee\u201d until recently.\n\nMusk, on social media, has been threatening to fund primary challenges against lawmakers who vote for the bill \u2014 meaning nearly every Republican in both the House and Senate \u2014 and even about starting a third party. He later narrowed the threat to merely those who had marketed themselves as fiscal conservatives.\n\n\u201cEvery member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!,\u201d Musk said on X. \u201cAnd they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?,\u201d he said of the hardline Freedom Caucus.\n\nTrump, for his part, was asked if he would consider deporting Musk, and answered that he would \u201clook into\u201d taking such an action. Musk has long been a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u201cDOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn\u2019t that be terrible?,\u201d Trump said of the threats, per the New York Times. Later, on Truth Social, Trump ripped the electric-vehicle mandates that have long benefited Musk\u2019s Tesla, and are scheduled to go away in the new bill.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nStephen Silver is an award-winning journalist, essayist and film critic, and contributor to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Broad Street Review and Splice Today.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 The U.S. Navy\u2019s next-generation attack submarine program, the SSN(X), is facing significant delays and cost challenges, raising concerns about a future capability gap.\n\n-Designed to combine the best attributes of the Seawolf and Virginia classes, the first SSN(X) is not expected to be procured until FY2040, a five-year slip from previous plans.\n\n-With an estimated cost of $7-8 billion per boat and a strained U.S. submarine industrial base struggling to meet current production goals for the Virginia and Columbia classes, the ambitious SSN(X) program is under intense scrutiny as the Navy tries to counter China\u2019s rapidly growing undersea fleet.\n\nSSN(X): The Cursed Navy Submarine Program?\n\nThis past April, U.S. Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Pete Hegseth, in a speech to students at the U.S. Army War College, announced the launch of a review of \u201call 72 active major defense acquisitions programs\u201d in accordance with President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order that that aims to transform how the U.S. government purchases equipment and services for military and Department of Defense (DOD) civilian personnel alike.\n\nThe importance of the SECDEF\u2019s (and the POTUS\u2019s) objectives cannot be overstated, as the DOD acquisition process is infamous for multiple stories of weapons systems that look highly impressive on-paper but keep running afoul of the twin maladies of production delays and cost overruns. Accordingly, 19FortyFive now starts a four-part series on four U.S. Navy programs that are thusly plagued. We start with the SSN(X) submarine program.\n\nSSN(X) Premise and Promise\n\nThe SSN(X) certainly sounds like a great concept. As noted by my 19FortyFive colleague Reuben Johnson in a February 9, 2025 article titled \u201cThe Navy\u2019s New SSN(X) Submarine Will Fight Anything and Everywhere,\u201d this sub-class combines \u201cthe stealth of the Virginia-class, the firepower of the Seawolf-class, and the endurance of the Columbia-class. This next-generation attack submarine will feature electric drive propulsion, enhanced sensors, and the ability to counter enemy unmanned underwater vehicles.\u201d\n\nNOTE: \u201cSSN\u201d stands for \u201cSubmersible Ship Nuclear,\u201d i.e. a nuclear-powered general purpose attack submarine aka \u201cfast-attack\u201d boat. Though nuclear-powered, SSNs don\u2019t carry actual nuclear weapons, i.e. submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs); that doomsday duty is instead tasked to SSBNs (\u201cShip Submersible Ballistic Nuclear\u201d) aka \u201cboomers\u201d such as the Ohio-class and Columbia-class boats.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Congressional Research Service (CRS) explains, the \u201cX\u201d designation indicates that the exact design of the boat is still to be determined.\n\nAs far as augmenting\u2014and presumably eventually replacing\u2014the Seawolf-class SSNs, it\u2019s worth remembering that only three Seawolves in service (USS Seawolf [SSN-21], USS Connecticut [SSN-22], and USS Jimmy Carter [SSN-23]), commissioned between 1997 and 2005. The program was cancelled in 1995.\n\nMeanwhile, the first of the Virginia-class SSNs, USS Virginia (SSN-774), was commissioned in October 2004\u2014whilst the newest, USS Iowa (SSN-797; obviously not to be confused with the legendary USN battleship [BB-61]) was commissioned this past April (coincidentally the same month as the aforementioned SECDEF announcement and POTUS executive order on military acquisitions).\n\nLast but not least, the venerable time-honored Los Angeles-class (SSN 668) fast-attack subs were commissioned between 1976 and 1996.\n\nHence, the extra sense of urgency for getting the SSN(X) up and running sooner rather than later.\n\nSo far so good, right? Sounds ideal, right?\n\nSSN(X) Problems\n\nNonetheless, as our ever-savvy readers have undoubtedly already figured out from the opening segment of this article, the SSN(X) program, which sounds great in theory, is floundering in practice due to massive expenses and production delays.\n\nJust how bad are these delays and expenses? According to another one of my 19FortyFive colleagues, Dr. Brent M. Eastwood\u2014in a November 28, 2024 article titled \u201cThe U.S. Navy\u2019s SSN(X) Submarine Nightmare Explained in 3 Words\u201d\u2014\u201dThe Navy is requesting $586.9 million for SSN(X) design work in FY25, up from the $544.7 million asked for FY24. So, we are talking over half a billion dollars to get this project off the ground.\u201d\n\nMind you, those figures are just for research & development (R&D). In other words, not even factoring in how much it would cost for the actual hands-on, nitty-gritty, physical labor that would go into building the boats at the shipyard, from the keel-laying to the launching, not to mention post-assembly growing pains such as commissioning, sea trials, and so forth.\n\nTo make matters worse, as both Brent and Reuben also point out, the SSN(X) has not yet received clear and unequivocal Congressional backing.\n\nRegarding the production delays, hands-on shipyard labor is unlikely to begin until 2031, and the boats may not be operational until the 2040s. In other words, a lag time of at least 15 years, with the current USN SSN fleet continues to not get any younger and China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) continues to expand and modernize its own submarine fleet.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Solution? More Virginia-Class Submarines?\n\nSo then, can the U.S. Navy simply build more Virginia-class boats instead (at least in the interim)? That sounds great in theory, since the Virginia-class is already well established, with 23 of these boats having already been commissioned.\n\nHowever, this potential solution would in turn be beset by a problem of its own: shipbuilding capacity in the United States is a shell of its former self, and this is especially true of the submarine program. Back on May 2, 2025, Indo-Pacific (INDOPACOM) Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo told the McCain Institute\u2019s annual Sedona Forum that the PLAN churns out six combat naval ships annually, compared with the 1.8 manufactured in the US; diving deeper into those sobering stats, the Admiral noted that Beijing produces two submarines a year for every 1.4 made in America.\n\nThe Navy brass is hoping to rectify these lagging numbers. Back in November 2024, they announced a goal to boost submarine production to three per year\u2014one Columbia and two Virginias\u2014by 2028, via the so-called \u201c1+2+Sustainment by 2028\u201d plan.\n\nA key component of this plan is the ongoing BuildSubmarines employment recruiting push. However, whether this laudable and ambitious goal of more than doubling American submarine production can be achieved in three years remains to be seen. Time will tell.\n\nAbout the Author: Christian D. Orr, Defense Expert\n\nChristian D. Orr is a Senior Defense Editor for 19FortyFive.

        "text": "Question: The French Navy Only has One Aircraft Carrier. Is that a Problem?\n\nIf Paris would like to maintain its status as one of the world\u2019s few nuclear-carrier nations, continued investment in aircraft carriers in the future is crucial.\n\nFrance\u2019s current and only aircraft carrier, the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle, is Paris\u2019 primary tool for projecting power on a global scale. The carrier, commissioned into the French Navy in 2001, is the only actual carrier in European navies today, aside from the two carriers operated by the British Royal Navy (several other European nations operate smaller helicopter carriers or vertical take-off and landing ships.\n\nIt takes more than a single aircraft carrier to maintain a continuous presence at sea. During routine maintenance or longer overhauls, a single carrier would not be able to put to sea, which would leave the French Navy without an available carrier strike group.\n\nEven nuclear-powered ships, such as the United States Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers, cannot be out at sea for an indefinite period of time, as they must periodically take on foodstuffs, medical items, and other consumable supplies. Indeed, the Charles de Gaulle\u2019s midlife refit in 2017 and 2018 left French operations at sea significantly curtailed for the duration of the 18-month refit.\n\nFrance is also a country with commitments and responsibilities that span the entire globe from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, with significant territory throughout the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nWhen considering French overseas departments in the Indian Ocean as well, the number of French citizens living there and in the Pacific expands to 1.5 million people. This also means that France has the world\u2019s second-largest Exclusive Economic Zone, and protecting those assets is of high importance.\n\nFrance\u2019s strategy of power projection and presence, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, relies heavily on air power at sea or the ability to project strikes by naval aviation within the protection coverage of a robust air defense umbrella. Without a carrier strike group at sea, it would not be possible to conduct these kinds of expeditionary missions.\n\nShow Me the Money\n\nProjecting power far out at sea doesn\u2019t come cheaply, however. France\u2019s upcoming PANG aircraft carrier, an acronym for the French \u201cPorte-avions de nouvelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ration,\u201d will cost around \u20ac8 to \u20ac10 billion just for the carrier\u2019s construction costs.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the French defense budget is around \u20ac50 billion. When considering the other investment needs of the French Navy, which also aims to allocate resources for new frigates, the costs are remarkable.\n\nThe high upfront costs of building the new PANG aircraft will necessitate acute budgetary trade-offs that could escalate in the event of budget overruns or unanticipated expenses.\n\nThe cost of operating the carrier would also eat into the Navy\u2019s budget\u2014and this at a time when there is an argument for investing in long-range anti-ship weaponry, drones, or other conventional systems, such as submarines, which makes a strong case for tight defense Euros.\n\nThe Defense Industrial Base\n\nAircraft carrier shipbuilding supports the French defense industrial base and, consequently, the country\u2019s strategic independence. Nuclear propulsion, the aerospace sector, and French shipbuilders all gain through aircraft carrier building.\n\nFinalizing a build would inject research and development funding into a vital French nuclear ecosystem. The decision would, in essence, be as much an industrial policy as it would be a purely naval question with significant implications and knock-on effects.\n\nThough French shipyards would not be able to compete hull-for-hull with, say, China\u2019s shipyards, being a carrier power in the Indo-Pacific\u2014but with just a single carrier\u2014would be a challenging game to play.\n\nThe Critique\n\nSimilar to the United States, the idea of an expanded French aircraft carrier presence has sustained criticisms that the carrier is too large and too expensive a target to justify in the era of increasingly long-range anti-ship and area-denial weaponry. The amount of money that could be spent on submarines, underwater drones, or other assets makes a strong argument.\n\nHowever, given France\u2019s relations with other carrier powers, namely the United States and Great Britain, the French Navy could likely count on the support of those navies, as well as other friends and allies.\n\nOne of the French strengths at sea is their advanced nuclear submarines, the Barracuda-class SSNs, as well as the Triomphant-class of ballistic missile submarines. Euro for euro, those platforms may offer a more potent area-denial capability than their larger aircraft carrier counterparts.\n\nWhat Happens Now for France and Its Aircraft Carrier?\n\nStill, there is no viable alternative now for the capabilities that an aircraft carrier brings to the table, particularly in terms of range, endurance, and firepower. The concerns that evolving technology, rising costs, and vulnerability are all valid arguments that address essential critiques. However, if France would like to remain one of the world\u2019s few nuclear carrier-capable powers, continued investment in these platforms would be strategically important.\n\nAbout the Author: Caleb Larson\n\nCaleb Larson is an American multiformat journalist based in Berlin, Germany.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 Despite being China\u2019s premier fifth-generation stealth aircraft, the Chengdu J-20 is fundamentally different from and likely less capable than the American F-35.\n\n-According to experts, the J-20\u2019s design has stealth deficiencies, particularly in its rear aspect, and it lacks the ability to carry air-to-ground munitions internally, limiting it to an air superiority role.\n\n-More importantly, the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force\u2019s rigid, top-down command culture constrains pilot autonomy, preventing J-20 pilots from acting as independent \u201cbattle-space managers\u201d\u2014a core function of the F-35. This doctrinal gap means the J-20 cannot match the F-35\u2019s versatility.\n\nThe Chengdu J-20: How Is It Not Like an F-35A\n\nMore than 20 years ago, a colleague of mine at Lockheed Martin was explaining the projected mission profile for the F-35.\n\nThe picture he painted was of a next-generation jet, first and foremost, following in the footsteps of the F-117 in penetrating enemy radar networks, attacking high-value targets, and then still being able to return to base without being shot down by an air defense battery or an enemy fighter.\n\nBut that was not all, he continued. \u201cWith the many abilities of the aircraft, the pilot is able to function as a battle-space manager\u2014almost like a smaller-scale AWACS in some respects. Among other previously unheard-of capabilities of this next-generation fighter, the pilot can receive data directly from a satellite. The information is not being \u2018processed\u2019 or \u2018filtered\u2019, etc. to decide what the pilot \u2018needs to know\u2019. It is a direct link.\u201d\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this battle management functionality is intended to be a feature of the first stealthy aircraft produced in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Chengdu Aerospace J-20. However, it may also never be able to perform this function\u2014regardless of how many years the aircraft remains in service or how many upgrades it receives.\n\nIn comparing the two aircraft, one notices several differences that would lead most airpower analysts to conclude that the American aircraft is the more versatile and multi-role of the two.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s Chengdu J-20 fighter jet, despite its advanced capabilities, falls short in comparison to the U.S.-made F-35 jet,\u201d an expert has argued in a Newsweek report that was published early in June. He spoke to the publication about ten days before the F-35\u2019s opening, once appearing at the Le Bourget air show outside Paris.\n\nJ-20: Third to the Race\n\nWith its first flight of the J-20 in January 2011, the PRC became only the third nation in the world, after the US and Russia, to design and build a fifth-generation stealth fighter that could evade enemy radar detection. Several years then passed before the J-20 Introduced in 2017. Today, there are various estimates, but most indicate that there are approximately 250 J-20 models in service with the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).\n\nOn the surface, J-20 appears to be a fighter with a blended-body, stealthy-type shape. The aircraft is also designed like other stealth aircraft, featuring diverterless supersonic inlets, which is another necessary basic feature of a low radar cross-section (RCS) aircraft. The design also features moveable canard foreplanes and root extensions on the wing\u2019s leading edge.\n\nBut stealthy design technique has some very extreme and unforgiving requirements, which some observers say the aircraft has yet to meet. Specialists who have viewed the aircraft up close comment that the J-20 manufacturing methods produce exposed rivets and shoddy workmanship. It\u2019s shoddy in that some panels do not match up precisely, which can compromise the low-observable surface of a stealthy aircraft.\n\nThere are also\u2014as there is with Russia\u2019s Sukhoi Su-57\u2014problems with the signature of the aircraft in its exhaust nozzle section and rear hemisphere in general. (It compares very poorly with the US F-22 and F-35 in this respect.) This has historically been one of the most challenging aspects of stealthy aircraft design.\n\nWhere is the Quarterback?\n\nBut the biggest reason is that the J-20 will never be thrust into the kind of mission roles that one is seeing the aircraft performing with the US and Israeli air forces in the current conflict with Iran.\n\n\u201cThe J-20 has a larger internal fuel payload than the F-35, but it is also larger. The J-20\u2019s range will be similar to or shorter than the F-35\u2019s. Also, unlike the F-35, the J-20 cannot carry air-to-ground bombs internally, which is a fundamental limitation,\u201d Kim Minseok, a research fellow at the Korea Defense and Security Forum, told Newsweek in an interview this June.\n\nThe J-20 is not only unable to carry the kind of air-to-ground mission, but the problem for many years, according to a 2016 RAND report, is not the aircraft itself but the culture and general limitations placed on its pilots:\n\n\u201cPLAAF pilots still lack the ability to adapt to rapidly changing battlefield conditions and make autonomous decisions on the fly. Such skills remain new to many PLAAF pilots accustomed to having almost all of their tactical maneuvers dictated by commanders in the control tower. For example, one Kongjun Bao report noted this deficiency in flight leads taking over from ground control.\u201d\n\n\u201cGround commands often are not able to keep up with the complex and changeable air situation. Pilots relied too much on the commands and guidance from the ground, which was not conducive to enhancing the enthusiasm and initiative of airborne combatants. Our findings also highlight an inability among some PLAAF pilots to hit ground targets successfully upon receiving inflight changes to flight trajectories or plans, as well as a reluctance among pilots to take risks for fear of making mistakes or out of safety concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur report supports the notion that the PLAAF is fully aware of its shortcomings in pilot combat skills and is taking steps to rectify many of these deficiencies. However, cultivating true pilot autonomy in unscripted scenarios takes decades to hone and demands a training system that encourages honest assessments of mistakes. While the PLAAF appears to have undertaken major reform in how it trains its pilots, success will ultimately depend on breaking the service\u2019s deep-seated institutional and cultural barriers.\u201d\n\nThe J-20 Fighter Falls Short\n\nUnfortunately, the paranoia, institutional barriers, and the long-standing imperative that dictates the Chinese Communist Party keeping the PLA on a short lease remain \u201crule number one in the PLA,\u201d said one US military analyst of the PRC and former intelligence officer. These habits do not align with the freedom of decision-making required of a pilot, who is supposed to be that of a quarterback or battle-space manager, he explained.\n\n\u201cFor as long as the current regime is in power in Beijing, this mismatch will continue to be what holds the J-20 back from achieving its full potential,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThe F-35 is likely to remain dominant as a consequence.\u201d\n\nAbout the Author: Reuben F.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 Russia\u2019s T-14 Armata, despite being touted as a revolutionary main battle tank, is a deeply troubled program with an uncertain future.\n\n-On paper, its features are impressive, including an unmanned turret, a heavily armored crew capsule for survivability, and the Afghanit active protection system.\n\n-However, the program has been plagued by extreme costs and technical difficulties, resulting in fewer than 20 tanks being delivered.\n\n-Its conspicuous absence from the main 2025 Moscow Victory Day parade and official statements about its high cost preventing deployment to Ukraine have led many analysts to believe the project is effectively paused or canceled.\n\nRussia\u2019s T-14 Armata Tank Is In Trouble\n\nThe T-14 Armata is currently one of the most controversial tanks in existence.\n\nWhen it was first unveiled in 2015, Analysts were shocked by the number of innovative features the tank boasted. However, ten years later, it seems that the tank is no closer to seeing combat than it was when it was first showed off in the 2015 Victory Day parade.\n\nAnalysts argue that the Armata was always smoke and mirrors, while others suggest that the tank is simply to sophisticated for Russia\u2019s industrial base to handle.\n\nRussia\u2019s Most Advanced Tank\n\nWestern Analysts like to give the T-14 a lot of grief, and for good reason. However, at the time of its introduction, the T-14 introduced a number of genuine innovative design changes. Unlike conventional tanks where the crew operates the main gun from within the turret, the T-14\u2019s turret is fully automated and remotely controlled. The crew, consisting of a commander, gunner, and driver, is housed in a heavily armored capsule located in the front of the hull.\n\nThis design significantly enhances crew survivability by isolating them from the ammunition and fuel compartments, which are typically the most vulnerable areas in a tank during combat. The concept of an unmanned turret is a radical departure from traditional tank design and has not yet been adopted by any other major military power.\n\nThe T-14 is equipped with the Afghanit Active Protection System, which includes radar and electro-optical sensors designed to detect and neutralize incoming threats such as anti-tank guided missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. This system is considered one of the most advanced in the world and is a key component of the T-14\u2019s defensive capabilities.\n\nIn addition to active protection, the tank features passive stealth measures, including reduced radar and thermal signatures, making it more difficult to detect and target.\n\nBuilt to Fight Future Wars\n\nThe tank\u2019s sensor suite provides 360-degree situational awareness through a combination of cameras, thermal imaging, and radar systems. This comprehensive sensor array allows the crew to monitor the battlefield in real time and respond to threats more effectively. The T-14\u2019s fire control system is also highly advanced, incorporating artificial intelligence to assist in target acquisition and prioritization. This reduces the cognitive load on the crew and enhances the tank\u2019s combat efficiency.\n\nAnother key aspect of the T-14 is its integration into network-centric warfare systems. The tank is designed to operate as part of a larger digital battlefield, sharing data with other units, drones, and command centers in real time.\n\nThis connectivity allows for coordinated operations and enhances the overall effectiveness of military engagements. The T-14\u2019s digital systems are intended to support future upgrades, including the potential for autonomous or remotely operated variants.\n\nThis forward-looking approach reflects Russia\u2019s ambition to modernize its armed forces and maintain technological parity with NATO.\n\nA Massive Step in the Right Direction\n\nIn terms of firepower, the T-14 is outfitted with a 125mm 2A82-1M smoothbore cannon, capable of firing a wide range of munitions including armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot rounds, high-explosive anti-tank rounds, and guided missiles. There are also plans to eventually equip the tank with a 152mm gun, which would make it the most heavily armed tank in the world. Secondary armament includes a 12.7mm Kord machine gun and a 7.62mm PKTM machine gun, both of which are remotely operated. These weapons provide additional firepower for engaging infantry and light vehicles.\n\nThe T-14 is powered by a ChTZ 12N360 diesel engine that produces up to 1,500 horsepower. This gives the tank a top speed of approximately 80 kilometers per hour on roads and a range of about 500 kilometers. The tank also features a hydropneumatic suspension system, which allows it to adjust its ground clearance and improves its mobility across various terrains. This level of mobility, combined with its advanced protection and firepower, positions the T-14 as a formidable presence on the battlefield.\n\nT-14 Armata: When Ambition Meets Reality\n\nDespite its impressive capabilities, the T-14 has faced numerous challenges in production and deployment.\n\nRussia initially planned to procure over 2,300 units by 2020, but as of 2025, only a limited number have been produced and deployed. The high cost of the tank, estimated between $3.7 and $5 million per unit, has been a significant barrier, especially in light of Russia\u2019s economic constraints and the financial demands of ongoing military operations. These issues have led to delays and a reduction in the scale of the T-14 program.\n\nBecause of its manufacturing troubles, there are likely less than 20 operational T-14\u2019s in existence. While the tank has been showcased in military parades and used in training exercises, claims of the tank being sent to combat in Ukraine have since been disproven. Some unverified accounts suggest that the T-14 may have been tested in conflict zones, but these claims remain speculative. Russia has also attempted to market the T-14 to foreign buyers, including India, Egypt, and Algeria, but no confirmed export deals have been finalized. The high cost and unproven battlefield performance have likely deterred potential customers.\n\nWhere is the T-14 Armata Now?\n\nThe T-14 has not been without its critics. Concerns have been raised about its mechanical reliability, with reports of issues during trials. Even in Russia, some analysts question whether the tank\u2019s high cost is justified by its performance, especially when compared to upgraded versions of the T-90, which are significantly cheaper and already in widespread use. The limited number of T-14s in service also raises questions about its strategic impact, as it is unlikely to significantly alter the balance of power on the battlefield in its current numbers.\n\nCurrently, the T-14 is sitting in development hell. While it embodies the cutting edge of Russian tank design, its future success will depend on the ability to overcome production challenges, reduce costs, and demonstrate reliability in real-world conditions.\n\nRussia has indicated plans to develop unmanned variants of the T-14 and integrate it with drone swarms and robotic support vehicles, suggesting that the Armata platform may serve as a foundation for future autonomous systems.\n\nHowever, the fate of Moscow\u2019s \u201csuper tank\u201d will likely be decided after the end of the Ukraine war.\n\nAbout the Author: Isaac Seitz\n\nIsaac Seitz, a Defense Columnist, graduated from Patrick Henry College\u2019s Strategic Intelligence and National Security program.

        "paragraph_summary": "The T-14 Armata, Russia's ambitious main battle tank, is facing significant challenges that cast doubt on its future. Despite its innovative features, such as an unmanned turret, a heavily armored crew capsule, and the advanced Afghanit active protection system, the program has been plagued by high costs and technical difficulties, resulting in fewer than 20 tanks being delivered. Its absence from major events like the 2025 Moscow Victory Day parade and official statements citing cost issues preventing its deployment to Ukraine suggest the project may be paused or canceled. While the T-14 boasts impressive capabilities, including advanced firepower, mobility, and integration into network-centric warfare, its production and deployment have been hindered by economic constraints and manufacturing troubles. Analysts question whether its high cost is justified compared to the more affordable and widely used T-90. The T-14's future hinges on overcoming production challenges and proving its reliability in real-world conditions, with potential plans for unmanned variants and integration with autonomous systems.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 Operation \u201cMidnight Hammer\u201d was a bold demonstration of U.S. airpower, with nine B-2 stealth bombers striking Iranian targets. But beneath the success lies a troubling reality: America\u2019s strategic bomber fleet is too small for modern great-power warfare. With only 20 B-2s and aging B-1s and B-52s, the U.S. lacks the mass needed to sustain strikes against well-defended adversaries like China.\n\nBottom line: Experts now urge the Pentagon to more than double the planned B-21 Raider buy to 200 or more. With rising threats and stretched resources, expanding stealth bomber capacity is essential to deter conflict and project power in the 21st century.\n\nThe B-21 Raider Won\u2019t Be Enough Without a Bigger U.S. Bomber Fleet\n\nOperation \u201cMidnight Hammer\u201d showcased American strategic airpower for the world to behold. And while it was truly impressive, it showcased air tech essentially from the 1986 Top Gun-era and not that of Top Gun: Maverick in the 2020\u2019s.\n\nThe military operation also exposed the shockingly small fleet size of one of America\u2019s most capable power projection platforms: the stealthy B-2 bomber.\n\nScary but true is that America\u2019s B-2 fleet is large enough for a raid. Not a battle, and certainly not a war.\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s limited capacity to sustain strategic air operations against more capable and vast adversaries like China or Russia is a glaring weakness that, if unaddressed, will invite opportunism and aggression.\n\nNine B-2s\u2014nearly half the entire fleet\u2014were deployed from Whiteman Air Force Base. Seven flew east to strike, supported by tankers, electronic warfare aircraft, and other assets, while two flew west to generate deceptive open-source intelligence activity.\n\nThis impressive display of combat power also revealed concerning limitations. It took nearly half of America\u2019s most advanced heavy bombers to destroy a single target (albeit a complicated and gigantic one) in a country with limited air defenses. Our bombers relied on airspace access previously cleared by Israeli strikes.\n\nAmerica\u2019s also-aging B-52s and B-1s were not viable alternatives, as they are vulnerable in environments even as minimally contested as a battered Iran and air superiority. In addition, one of the B-2s sent west got stuck in Hawaii after having to make an emergency diversion. Washington can only hope that it doesn\u2019t end up like the damaged B-2 that was retired last year after it was determined to be too expensive to repair.\n\nThe B-2 fleet\u2019s small size is a legacy of post-Cold War decisions. Originally intended to number 132, only 21 were built due to cost overruns and the \u201cend of history\u201d after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, which justified the procurement holiday from which the Air Force has never recovered.\n\nToday, the Air Force plans to acquire just 100 B-21 Raiders, the next-generation stealth bomber. Yet, as the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments noted in 2020, the total bomber fleet is shrinking while its age is ever-increasing. The U.S. bomber fleet size has stagnated while its average age exceeds 40 years. By 2030, CSBA projects a total fleet of just 172 bombers, dominated by aging B-52s and B-1s\u2014platforms unsuitable for modern contested airspaces.\n\nA limited stealth bomber force may suffice against weakened states like Iran but is inadequate for high-end warfare with peer adversaries. This gap emboldens enemies and increases the risk of future conflict.\n\nChina has recently increased production of bombers that can strike Guam and beyond. Their mainstay H-6N bomber, on deployment to the disputed and strategically located Paracel Islands, can carry a payload of 6 cruise missiles with which to menace American and allied assets. In addition the Chinese air force is building a stealthy bomber, the H-20, that could be a counter to the B-2 and the B-21.\n\nTo deter major powers suffciently, experts argue the U.S. must significantly expand its stealth bomber fleet. Mark Gunzinger and colleagues advocate for more than doubling the planned B-21 buy to build a nearly 400-strong strategic bomber force.\n\nDr. Rebecca Grant of the Lexington Institute concurs, suggesting at least 200 B-21s and establishing a second production site. Importantly, this recommendation is supported by Air Force Global Strike leadership. Congress must act decisively to invest in the mass and stealth needed to restore conventional deterrence.\n\nThankfully, the defense budget is poised to support the momentum needed for a large scale up. In the current fiscal year 2025, $2.7 billion was enacted for B-21 RDT&E and $1.9 billion for procurement. For the White House\u2019s 2026 discretionary budget request, Raider R&D funds clock in at $2.3 billion and procurement $2.6 billion.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill draft reconciliation bill using mandatory money seeks $2.4 billion for RDT&E and $2.1 billion for Raider procurement. We have a relatively flat trajectory in the baseline discretionary funding and a one-time infusion that is relatively stiff.\n\nThis reconciliation jumpstart to crank up B-21 production is an excellent sign that the importance of scaling is understood. However, to achieve the fleet size that global reality will surely require, continued funding at sustained higher amounts will be necessary in 2027 and 2028.\n\nSimilarly, the munitions the B-21 will be capable of carrying need to increase. Given that it is a medium bomber, the expectation is that the Raider will only be able to onboard one 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator at a time; not two like the B-2. Should another raid like Midnight Hammer occur in the near future, it would place a bigger burden on the Raider fleet given their size and weight differences.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the Raider is a dual-use, conventional and nuclear-capable bomber means it must perform the work of many aircraft in one. Being a utility infielder bomber, it is clear that 100 B-21s will not be enough. Especially given the force generation demands highlighted to pound Iran\u2019s nuke site. When ready aircraft are in operational use, most of the rest are in work up and maintenance to take their place. The few that remain are mostly offline entirely given the age of this antique-plated fleet.\n\nThe defense budget request for the next fiscal year is on the right track to grow the B-21 program and select munitions accounts. It will be essential to maintain those higher levels of funds for the next half decade to deliver the same strategic effects against a more capable enemy with sophisticated weaponry and mass.\n\nAbout the Author: Mackenzie Eaglen\n\nNow a 19FortyFive Contributing Editor, Mackenzie Eaglen is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where she works on defense strategy, defense budgets, and military readiness.

        "url": "https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/golden-dome-americas-answer-to-chinas-space-weapons/",
        "text": "The Trump administration\u2019s recent unveiling of the Golden Dome, a sweeping missile defense architecture, has invoked swift condemnation from China.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin issued a joint rebuke\u2014timed, pointedly, on the 80th anniversary of World War II\u2019s end. As tanks and soldiers rolled through Red Square, the mood felt less like commemoration and more like a throwback to Cold War brinkmanship. The irony was hard to miss.\n\nThat irony only deepened with the content of the statement. In it, China voiced concerns about the system\u2019s space-based capabilities, accusing the U.S. of turning \u201couter space into a new arena for armed confrontation\u201d and \u201cdeeply destabilizing\u201d the global order. Beijing also claimed the proposal violates long-established international norms.\n\nBut these accusations are not only unfounded, they\u2019re deeply hypocritical. The Golden Dome is a defensive system, developed in response to the rapid expansion of military space programs by China and other adversarial powers. Its purpose is to serve as a shield, designed to intercept a range of inbound threats, including ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST), a product of the original Space Race, remains the cornerstone of international space law. It lays out broad principles governing military activity in space and explicitly prohibits the deployment of weapons of mass destruction. Both the U.S. and China are signatories.\n\nUnder the framework of that treaty, the Golden Dome is entirely permissible. It is neither a nuclear weapon nor an offensive system. Rather, the program would expand the existing constellation of satellites used for early detection and interception\u2014tools of defense, not aggression.\n\nParadoxically, it\u2019s not U.S. ambition that makes the Golden Dome necessary, it\u2019s China\u2019s. Between 2018 and 2024, China tripled its number of intelligence satellites in orbit. In 2021, the Chinese military began exploring the revival of the \u201cfractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS),\u201d a Cold War-era space technology designed to evade early warning radars.\n\nIf fully developed, FOBS will give the U.S. endlessly sleepless nights. They are orbital platforms capable of dropping weapons\u2014including, nuclear weapons, which China has contemplated\u2014from space onto terrestrial targets with little to no tactical warning. FOBS can launch attacks from any direction, obscure their true target, and, alarmingly, operate without range limitations.\n\nThe fact that China is even considering fielding such capabilities is deeply troubling. According to U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessments, if China decided to pursue such means, they could develop 60 operational FOBS by 2035.\n\nThe Chinese Aerospace Studies Institute, a think tank under the U.S. Air Force, translated several Chinese military doctrinal documents, revealing that FOBS \u201ccould increase PLA power projection capabilities against bases and territories globally, including targets in the 50 states.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s development and apparent intent to deploy advanced offensive missile capabilities suggest ambitions beyond mere deterrence. A 2024 Department of Defense report found that Chinese leaders have shown a \u201cgrowing willingness to use military coercion to achieve foreign policy aims.\u201d If Chinese offensive systems severely outpace U.S. defensive capabilities, the risk isn\u2019t just theoretical, we could see missile-based threats used to coerce or constrain U.S. decision-making in future crises.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, China\u2019s demand that the U.S. limit its defensive systems is not just contradictory\u2014it\u2019s absurd. The current American missile defense network, built around interceptors like the Patriot-3, THAAD-ER, Standard Missile-6, and the emerging Glide Phase Interceptor, already requires significant upgrades to keep pace with China\u2019s rapidly advancing hypersonic capabilities. That need becomes even more urgent considering China\u2019s hypersonic missiles are now capable of reaching global targets within 30 minutes, a sobering reality for U.S. defense planners.\n\nInterestingly, it appears that China does not hold all countries to the same, unreasonable standard. Last year, after intelligence indicated Russia might be developing a nuclear anti-satellite weapon, the U.S. put forth a UN draft resolution explicitly reaffirming OST principles and restricting nuclear weapon deployment in outer space.\n\nTo be clear: anti-satellite weapons are offensive by design. Russia\u2019s reported push to nuclearize them would be a blatant violation of the OST. Yet when the U.S. introduced the UN resolution to reaffirm those very principles, China didn\u2019t stand up. Days later, Beijing even signaled deeper cooperation with Moscow, offering to collaborate on an automated nuclear power plant on the Moon.\n\nChina isn\u2019t concerned about the militarization of space; it\u2019s concerned that the U.S. might finally build something that works. In a world made more perilous by authoritarian regimes, led by Beijing, the Golden Dome represents the kind of comprehensive defensive shield America urgently needs. That\u2019s not destabilizing\u2014that\u2019s deterrence.\n\nAbout the Author: Allen Zhang\n\nAllen Zhang is a researcher in the Asian Studies Center of the Heritage Foundation.",

        "text": "The Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback: Anatomy of Russia\u2019s Fighter-Bomber\n\nIntroduction \u2013 A Cold War Platypus in a 21st Century World\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-34, known to NATO as the \u201cFullback,\u201d is an aircraft of inherent contradictions. Officially entering service with the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) in 2014, it presents as a modern, 4++ generation strike platform.\n\nYet, its conceptual DNA is deeply rooted in the final, turbulent years of the Soviet Union, a product of a military requirement from a bygone era.\n\nThis protracted, 24-year journey from its maiden flight to full operational status is not merely a historical footnote; it is the central factor that defines the Su-34\u2019s unique strengths, its glaring weaknesses, and its complex, often controversial, combat record.\n\nIt is, in essence, a machine conceived to fight one war, which found itself fighting a very different one decades later.\n\nThe Soviet Requirement\n\nThe story of the Su-34 begins in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the Soviet Air Force sought a modern, long-range successor to its aging fleet of tactical bombers.\n\nThe primary aircraft to be replaced was the venerable swing-wing Sukhoi Su-24 \u201cFencer,\u201d but the new platform was also envisioned to take over missions performed by the MiG-27 \u201cFlogger\u201d ground-attack aircraft and the heavily armored Su-25 \u201cFrogfoot\u201d close air support jet.\n\nThe requirement called for a versatile, all-weather aircraft capable of deep penetration into enemy airspace, precision strikes against ground and naval targets, and robust self-defense capabilities to operate in a hostile environment.\n\nThe Flanker as a Foundation\n\nTo meet this demanding set of requirements, the Sukhoi Design Bureau selected its highly successful Su-27 \u201cFlanker\u201d air superiority fighter as the foundational airframe.\n\nThe choice was logical; the Su-27 possessed exceptional range, a large payload capacity, and impressive maneuverability, providing a robust and proven starting point for a new fighter-bomber variant.\n\nThe project, known internally as T-10V, commenced with the modification of an Su-27UB two-seat trainer, which was transformed into the first prototype, designated the Su-27IB (Istrebitel-Bombardirovshchik, or \u201cFighter-Bomber\u201d).\n\nA Protracted Birth\n\nThis prototype, T-10V-1, made its maiden flight on April 13, 1990, with pilot Anatoly Ivanov at the controls.\n\nHowever, what should have been the start of a relatively swift development and production cycle was catastrophically derailed by the political and economic turmoil of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. The program stalled for over a decade due to a severe lack of funding, with state trials only concluding in 2003 and full-scale production at the Novosibirsk aircraft plant beginning in earnest around 2008.\n\nThe Su-34 was finally commissioned into formal service on March 14, 2014, nearly a quarter-century after it first took to the skies.\n\nThis immense delay created a fundamental mismatch between the aircraft\u2019s core design and the threats it would ultimately face. The Su-34 was conceived as a heavily armored, low-level penetrator designed to survive the dense but technologically simpler NATO air defenses of the 1980s.\n\nWhen the program was revitalized in the 2000s, modern avionics were essentially integrated into this older airframe concept.\n\nThe result was a hybrid platform that was neither a clean-sheet 21st-century design nor a simple legacy upgrade. This inherent tension helps explain why the aircraft performed well in the low-threat environment of Syria, which more closely mirrored its original design parameters, but struggled against the modern, networked, and electronically sophisticated air defenses it encountered in Ukraine. The subsequent and urgent development of the modernized Su-34M variant is not a routine upgrade, but a reactive attempt to correct this foundational mismatch and adapt the aircraft to a battlefield its original designers could not have fully anticipated.\n\nIts unique physical appearance, born from its specialized role, earned it the affectionate Russian nickname Utkonos (\u201cPlatypus\u201d) or Utyonok (\u201cDuckling\u201d) due to its distinctive flattened nose cone, while NATO assigned it the more imposing reporting name \u201cFullback\u201d.\n\nAnatomy of a Hellduck: Design, Technology, and Crew Endurance\n\nThe Su-34\u2019s design is a masterclass in trade-offs, where every major feature is optimized for its primary role as a long-range, survivable strike platform. This specialization makes it a formidable weapon system within its intended operational envelope but also creates vulnerabilities when it is forced to operate outside of it.\n\nAirframe and Aerodynamics\n\nWhile based on the Flanker, the Su-34\u2019s airframe features significant modifications. It retains the basic wing structure, tail, and engine nacelles of the Su-27/Su-30 family but incorporates a \u201cthree-surface\u201d aerodynamic layout with canard foreplanes.\n\nThese canards, similar to those on the Su-30MKI and Su-33, increase static instability for higher maneuverability and provide additional lift, which enhances stability during low-altitude flight and reduces trim drag.\n\nIn a key departure from the high-altitude Su-27, the Su-34 uses fixed-geometry air inlets. This design choice sacrifices peak performance at high Mach numbers and high altitudes in favor of optimizing efficiency for low-to-medium altitude penetration missions.\n\nTo support a significantly higher maximum takeoff weight of up to 45,100 kg, the landing gear was substantially reinforced, featuring a twin-wheel nose unit and robust main gear with tandem wheels on each strut, enabling operations from less-prepared or austere airfields.\n\nThe Armored Office: A Cockpit Built for Endurance\n\nThe most radical and defining feature of the Su-34 is its cockpit.\n\nThe traditional tandem seating of the Su-27UB was replaced with an entirely new, wider forward fuselage that accommodates the pilot and weapon systems officer (WSO) in a side-by-side configuration.\n\nThis arrangement was chosen to improve crew communication and coordination during complex, long-duration missions and to avoid the duplication of certain instruments and displays.\n\nEmbodying the \u201cflying tank\u201d design philosophy, the entire cockpit is constructed as an all-welded titanium armored \u201ctub\u201d or capsule.\n\nThis structure, reportedly 17 mm thick and weighing nearly 1,500 kg, is designed to protect the crew and critical avionics from small-arms fire and missile fragments, a feature intended to enhance survivability during low-level attack runs.\n\nReflecting its intended role as a long-range bomber that could replace even the Tu-22M, the cabin is designed for crew endurance. It is pressurized to allow operation up to 10,000 meters without the constant use of oxygen masks, which are reserved for combat or emergencies.\n\nThe space behind and between the K-36DM ejection seats is large enough for a crew member to stand up, stretch, or even lie down during long flights.\n\nTo facilitate missions that could last many hours, the aircraft is equipped with a small galley (including a microwave and water heater) and a lavatory in the form of a hand-held urinal.\n\nAccess to this unique cockpit is not via a conventional canopy, but through a hatch in the floor, with a built-in ladder that extends down from the nosewheel bay.\n\nAvionics and Sensor Suite\n\nThe Su-34\u2019s avionics suite was advanced for its time of design, though some elements have been surpassed by more modern Western systems.\n\nForward Radar: The primary sensor is the Leninets Sh141/V004, a large passive electronically scanned array (PESA) multimode radar housed in the distinctive \u201cplatypus\u201d nose. This system is heavily optimized for air-to-ground work, featuring terrain-following and terrain-avoidance modes for safe, high-speed, low-level flight. It is claimed to have a detection range of 200\u2013250 km against large surface targets like a naval vessel and up to 120 km against fighter-sized aerial targets.\n\nRearward Radar: The elongated tail \u201cstinger,\u201d which also houses an auxiliary power unit (APU), contains a rearward-facing warning radar. This system, initially the N012 and planned to be upgraded to the Kopyo-DL on the Su-34M, is designed to detect and warn the crew of pursuing aircraft or missiles, cueing the defensive systems.\n\nTargeting System: For precision strikes, the aircraft is fitted with the Platan electro-optical targeting system. This is a retractable unit housed in the fuselage belly that contains a television camera and a laser designator for guiding munitions. While effective in clear, daytime conditions, its capability is limited by its lack of a thermal imaging channel, making it less effective at night or in adverse weather compared to modern Western targeting pods like Sniper or Damocles.\n\nElectronic Warfare (EW): A key element of the Su-34\u2019s survivability is its Khibiny (L-175V) electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite. This system, which includes internal components and distinctive torpedo-shaped pods on the wingtips, is designed to jam enemy radar systems and the seekers of incoming missiles. It functions by delaying detection, creating false targets, and distorting the adversary\u2019s radar picture, with its manufacturer claiming it increases aircraft survivability by a factor of 25 to 30.\n\nThe Su-34\u2019s design philosophy is clear: it is a specialist, not a generalist. The heavy armor, crew amenities, and fixed engine inlets sacrifice air-to-air agility and top speed for endurance and survivability in its primary ground-attack role. This deliberate focus made it a highly effective tool in the permissive air environment over Syria, where its long range and heavy payload could be used to full effect. However, in the contested, high-tech battlespace over Ukraine, these same design choices contributed to its vulnerabilities.\n\nModern air defenses more easily detect its large, non-stealthy airframe and PESA radar. At the same time, the lack of advanced precision-guided munitions forced it into dangerous low-level attack profiles where its armor was tested\u2014and often defeated.\n\nTable 1: Su-34 Fullback Key Specifications\n\nFeature Specification Crew 2 (Pilot and Weapon Systems Officer) Length 23.34 m (76 ft 7 in) Wingspan 14.7 m (48 ft 3 in) Height 6.09 m (20 ft) Empty Weight 22,500 kg (49,600 lb) Max Takeoff Weight 45,100 kg (99,430 lb) Powerplant 2 x Saturn AL-31FM1 afterburning turbofans Max Speed Mach 1.8 (1,900 km/h) at altitude Mach 1.2 (1,400 km/h) at sea level Combat Range 1,100 km (680 mi) with typical weapons load Ferry Range 4,000 km (2,500 mi) Service Ceiling 15,000 m (49,200 ft) g-limit +9g\n\nClaws of the Fullback: A Deep and Versatile Arsenal\n\nThe Su-34\u2019s value as a strike platform is defined by its ability to carry a massive and diverse array of ordnance. With 12 external hardpoints, it can be configured for a wide spectrum of missions, from close air support to standoff strategic strikes. Its maximum payload is cited by various sources as being between 8,000 kg and 14,000 kg.\n\nInternal Cannon\n\nFor strafing and self-defense, the aircraft is equipped with the powerful 30mm Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 autocannon, a weapon common to the Flanker family, supplied with 150 to 180 rounds of ammunition.\n\nAir-to-Surface Munitions (The Primary Role)\n\nThe Su-34\u2019s primary purpose is to deliver ordnance onto ground and naval targets. Its arsenal represents a mix of Soviet-era brute force and modern precision.\n\nUnguided \u201cDumb\u201d Bombs: The aircraft can carry a huge variety of unguided bombs, including the 250 kg FAB-250, 500 kg FAB-500, and the massive 1,500 kg FAB-1500 general-purpose bombs. It can also deploy OFAB high-explosive fragmentation bombs and ZB-500 incendiary devices.\n\nGuided \u201cSmart\u201d Bombs: For precision strikes, the Su-34 employs the KAB series of guided bombs. These include the KAB-500 and KAB-1500, which can be fitted with laser (L), television (Kr), or satellite (S) guidance systems. This capability has been critically augmented in the Ukraine conflict by the widespread adoption of the UMPK (Unifitsirovannyi Modul Planirovaniya i Korrektsii), a kit that attaches wings and a guidance system to standard dumb bombs, converting them into standoff glide weapons.\n\nGuided Missiles: The Fullback\u2019s standoff strike capability rests on its extensive suite of guided missiles:\n\nAnti-Radiation Missiles (ARM): For Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions, it can carry the Kh-31P/PD (NATO: AS-17 Krypton) to home in on and destroy enemy radar emitters.\n\nAnti-Ship Missiles (AShM): For maritime strike, its arsenal includes the Kh-31A, the Kh-35U, and the large, long-range Kh-59M \u201cOvod\u201d.\n\nTactical Land-Attack Missiles: A wide range of missiles for striking ground targets includes the heavy Kh-29L/T (laser/TV-guided), the smaller Kh-25ML (laser-guided), and the more modern Kh-38M family.\n\nUnguided Rockets: For saturating area targets, the Su-34 can be armed with pods for S-8, S-13, and heavy S-25 rockets.\n\nAir-to-Air Munitions (For Self-Defense)\n\nAlthough it is a bomber first and foremost, the Su-34 is not defenseless. It is equipped to carry a formidable air-to-air loadout, allowing it to engage hostile fighters and protect itself without relying entirely on a dedicated escort.\n\nShort-Range: Vympel R-73 (NATO: AA-11 Archer) infrared-homing missiles, known for their high off-boresight capability and agility in a dogfight.\n\nMedium/Long-Range: Vympel R-27 (NATO: AA-10 Alamo) missiles in semi-active radar (R/ER) and infrared (T/ET) variants, and the more modern Vympel R-77 (NATO: AA-12 Adder), an active radar-homing \u201cfire-and-forget\u201d missile comparable to the American AMRAAM.4\n\nThis extensive documented arsenal, however, represents a powerful potential that has not always translated into reality. The Su-34\u2019s combat employment has revealed a significant gap between its designed capabilities and its actual use, particularly in Ukraine. Its reliance on unguided bombs and the subsequent emergency adoption of the UMPK glide-bomb kits is not a sign of tactical flexibility, but rather a symptom of a critical failure in the Russian defense-industrial base.\n\nAnalysis of downed Russian equipment has shown a heavy dependence on Western-made microelectronics for precision-guided munitions (PGMs). With these components cut off by international sanctions, Russia has been unable to produce its advanced PGMs in sufficient quantities. The UMPK is a direct consequence of this shortage\u2014a low-cost, technologically simple stopgap to give unguided bombs a standoff capability. This adaptation allows the Su-34 to remain relevant by staying outside the range of many air defenses, but it reveals a systemic weakness: Russia\u2019s most advanced tactical bomber is operationally constrained by its own country\u2019s limited high-tech manufacturing capacity.\n\nTable 2: Su-34 Armament Suite\n\nCategory Designation Type / Guidance Cannon GSh-30-1 30mm Autocannon Air-to-Air Missiles R-73 (AA-11 Archer) Short-Range, Infrared Homing R-27R/ER (AA-10 Alamo-A/C) Medium-Range, Semi-Active Radar Homing R-27T/ET (AA-10 Alamo-B/D) Medium-Range, Infrared Homing R-77 (AA-12 Adder) Medium-Range, Active Radar Homing Air-to-Surface Missiles Kh-29L/T (AS-14 Kedge) Tactical, Laser/TV Guided Kh-38M Tactical, Modular Guidance Kh-25ML (AS-10 Karen) Tactical, Laser Guided Kh-31P/PD (AS-17 Krypton) Anti-Radiation (SEAD) Kh-31A (AS-17 Krypton) Anti-Ship Kh-35U (AS-20 Kayak) Anti-Ship Kh-59M (AS-18 Kazoo) Standoff / Anti-Ship Guided Bombs KAB-500L/Kr/S 500 kg, Laser/TV/Satellite Guided KAB-1500L/Kr 1,500 kg, Laser/TV Guided UMPK Glide Bombs Unguided bombs with standoff glide kit Unguided Bombs FAB-250/500/1500 250/500/1,500 kg General Purpose OFAB Series High-Explosive Fragmentation Rockets S-8, S-13, S-25 80mm, 122mm, 266mm Unguided Rockets\n\nSection 4: Trial by Fire: Combat Performance from Syria to Ukraine\n\nThe Su-34\u2019s operational history is a tale of two vastly different conflicts, which have painted starkly contrasting pictures of the aircraft\u2019s effectiveness. Its performance in Syria created a narrative of a highly capable, modern strike platform, while the war in Ukraine provided a brutal reality check that exposed its vulnerabilities and the doctrinal flaws of the force that operates it.\n\nThe Syrian Proving Ground (2015-Present): A Narrative of Success\n\nThe Su-34 made its combat debut in September 2015 as part of Russia\u2019s military intervention in the Syrian Civil War.\n\nAn initial deployment of just four aircraft to Khmeimim Airbase was later reinforced as the campaign progressed.\n\nIn the largely permissive air environment over Syria, where opposition forces lacked any significant air defense capabilities, the Su-34 was able to operate largely as its designers had intended.\n\nIts primary mission profile consisted of precision strikes from medium to high altitudes (often above 5,000 meters) against fixed targets such as command centers, ammunition depots, training camps, and fortified bunkers.\n\nIn this role, it successfully employed a range of PGMs, most notably the KAB-500S satellite-guided bomb, demonstrating its capacity for accurate, all-weather strikes.\n\nThe Syrian campaign became a powerful marketing and propaganda tool for the Su-34. It was hailed by Russian defense officials as the most advanced and effective aircraft in the theater and was seen as instrumental in ensuring the survival of the Assad regime.\n\nThis perceived success likely played a significant role in securing Russia\u2019s first export order for the aircraft from Algeria.\n\nThe Ukrainian Crucible (2022-Present): A Brutal Reality Check\n\nIf Syria was the Su-34\u2019s showcase, Ukraine has been its crucible. The high-intensity conflict against a well-equipped and determined adversary has been devastating for the Fullback fleet. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia possessed an estimated 125 to 140 Su-34s.\n\nAs of mid-2024, open-source intelligence analysis has visually confirmed the loss of at least 36 of these aircraft, with Ukrainian forces claiming to have downed dozens more.\n\nThese losses have been sustained not only from enemy fire in the air but also from Ukrainian long-range drone and sabotage attacks on Russian airbases deep behind the front lines.\n\nThe war has exposed critical tactical vulnerabilities:\n\nForced Low-Altitude Attacks: The chronic shortage of PGMs forced VKS pilots to fly low-altitude missions to have any chance of accurately delivering unguided \u201cdumb\u201d bombs. This tactic brought the large, non-stealthy Su-34 directly into the lethal engagement envelope of Ukraine\u2019s highly effective and mobile short-range air defenses (SHORAD), including man-portable systems (MANPADS) like the Stinger and RBS-70, and self-propelled anti-aircraft guns like the German-made Gepard. Vulnerability to Advanced SAMs: When operating at medium altitudes to stay above the SHORAD threat, the Su-34 proved vulnerable to more sophisticated, long-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems. Ukrainian forces, using Western-supplied systems like the MIM-104 Patriot, have successfully conducted tactical \u201cSAMbushes,\u201d downing multiple Su-34s in short periods by moving the launchers to unexpected locations near the front. Ineffective Electronic Warfare: The vaunted Khibiny ECM suite, despite its impressive on-paper specifications, has proven insufficient against modern, networked air defense systems employing advanced electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) and missiles with sophisticated seekers. The high loss rate suggests a significant gap between its theoretical capabilities and its real-world performance in a dense, contested electronic environment.\n\nThese losses are not solely the fault of the aircraft\u2019s design. They are symptomatic of broader VKS doctrinal and logistical failures, including an inability to conduct an effective Suppression/Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD/DEAD) campaign in the opening phase of the war, a persistent lack of coordination, and a tendency to fly predictable routes.\n\nAttacks are often conducted by small formations of one or two aircraft rather than large, integrated strike packages, making them easier to intercept.\n\nThe primary Russian tactical adaptation to this lethal environment has been the mass deployment of UMPK glide bomb kits. This innovation allows the Su-34 to release its heavy FAB-500 and FAB-1500 bombs from standoff ranges of 35-45 km or more, keeping the launch aircraft outside the reach of most of Ukraine\u2019s frontline air defenses.\n\nWhile this has reduced the attrition rate of the Su-34 fleet, it has transformed the aircraft\u2019s role into that of a relatively indiscriminate glide bomb \u201ctruck,\u201d a far cry from the high-tech precision striker it was designed to be.\n\nA Tale of Two Philosophies: Su-34 Fullback vs. F-15E Strike Eagle\n\nTo fully understand the Su-34, it is essential to compare it with its closest conceptual counterpart in the West: the American F-15E Strike Eagle.\n\nWhile both are two-seat, twin-engine aircraft designed for deep-strike missions, they are the products of vastly different design philosophies, technological capabilities, and military doctrines.\n\nCore Design Philosophy\n\nThe fundamental difference lies in their origins.\n\nSu-34: The Bomber That Can Fight. The Su-34 is, at its core, a tactical bomber. Its design heavily prioritizes payload, range, and crew survivability (via its armored cockpit) for long, deep-penetration missions into hostile territory. Its air-to-air capabilities, while robust, are primarily for self-defense rather than offensive counter-air operations.\n\nThe Su-34 is, at its core, a tactical bomber. Its design heavily prioritizes payload, range, and crew survivability (via its armored cockpit) for long, deep-penetration missions into hostile territory. Its air-to-air capabilities, while robust, are primarily for self-defense rather than offensive counter-air operations. F-15E: The Fighter That Can Bomb. The F-15E is a true multirole fighter. It was developed from one of the world\u2019s most successful air superiority platforms, the F-15 Eagle, and it retains nearly all of its parent\u2019s formidable air-to-air lethality. Its air-to-ground capability was added without fundamentally compromising its performance as a fighter.\n\nPerformance and Technology Comparison\n\nThis philosophical divergence is reflected in their performance metrics and technology.\n\nSpeed and Agility: The F-15E holds a clear advantage. It is significantly faster (capable of Mach 2.2+ versus the Su-34\u2019s Mach 1.8) and far more maneuverable, boasting a much higher thrust-to-weight ratio (approximately 0.93 compared to the Su-34\u2019s 0.68). An F-15E, if forced into a dogfight, can perform as a lethal air superiority fighter; an Su-34 would be at a severe disadvantage against a dedicated fighter platform.\n\nRange and Payload: Here, the aircraft are more comparable, reflecting the Su-34\u2019s focus as a bomber. The Fullback has a slightly greater ferry range on internal fuel and can carry a marginally heavier maximum ordnance load (up to 12,000-14,000 kg vs. 10,400 kg for the Strike Eagle). However, in practical combat loadouts, the F-15E often has a superior combat radius.48\n\nAvionics and Sensors: The F-15E has a distinct technological edge. Modernized Strike Eagles are equipped with Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars like the AN/APG-82, which are generations ahead of the Su-34\u2019s PESA system in terms of range, resolution, multi-targeting capability, and resistance to electronic jamming. Furthermore, the F-15E\u2019s integration with advanced targeting pods like the Sniper ATP provides superior imaging and targeting capabilities compared to the Su-34\u2019s internal Platan system.\n\nOperational Conclusion\n\nThe F-15E is a more flexible, technologically advanced, and capable multirole platform. The Su-34 is a more specialized, rugged, heavy-payload strike aircraft. In a one-on-one air-to-air engagement, the F-15E would be overwhelmingly favored. In an uncontested air-to-ground scenario, the Su-34\u2019s ability to haul a massive bomb load over long distances makes it a formidable bomber.\n\nHowever, in the complex, networked battlefields of the 21st century, the Strike Eagle\u2019s superior sensor fusion, data links, and true multirole flexibility give it a decisive advantage.\n\nTable 3: Su-34 vs. F-15E: A Comparative Overview\n\nMetric Su-34 Fullback F-15E Strike Eagle Design Philosophy Tactical bomber with self-defense capability Multirole fighter with strike capability Max Speed Mach 1.8 Mach 2.2+ Thrust/Weight Ratio ~0.68 ~0.93 Combat Radius ~1,100 km (680 mi) ~1,270 km (790 mi) Max Payload 12,000 \u2013 14,000 kg 10,400 kg Radar Type PESA (Passive Electronically Scanned Array) AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) Air-to-Air Capability Primarily defensive; retains Flanker missiles Excellent; retains F-15\u2019s full lethality\n\nConclusion \u2013 The Future of a Battle-Scarred Fleet\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback will remain a cornerstone of Russia\u2019s tactical aviation for decades to come, but its role has been irrevocably altered by the brutal lessons of the war in Ukraine. The \u201cflying tank\u201d designed for low-level penetration has been forced to evolve into a standoff missileer, a transformation that reflects the lethal realities of modern air warfare. Its long-term viability now depends less on its armored cockpit and more on the sophistication of its sensors, weapons, and the electronic warfare systems that shield it from afar.\n\nThe modernization program that produced the Su-34M variant is not a routine, pre-planned life extension but a direct and urgent reaction to the combat vulnerabilities exposed since 2022.\n\nThe upgrades are squarely focused on correcting these deficiencies by enhancing standoff capabilities.\n\nThis includes the integration of new, more capable reconnaissance and targeting pods (developed under the \u201cSych\u201d program), an upgraded Khibiny EW suite to better counter modern threats, and an expanded arsenal of new precision weapons to close the PGM gap that has plagued its operations.\n\nThere are also reports that the Su-34M may be fitted with the more powerful Saturn AL-41F1S engines from the Su-35 program, likely to improve performance when carrying the heavy glide bomb loads that have become its new primary armament.\n\nDespite heavy attrition, Russia continues to produce new Su-34s at the Novosibirsk plant to replenish its fleet, with new batches delivered in 2023 and 2024.\n\nHowever, while airframes can be replaced, the experienced and highly trained crews lost over Ukraine represent a far more significant and long-lasting blow to the VKS\u2019s combat capability.\n\nUltimately, the Su-34\u2019s story is a cautionary tale about the nature of military evolution. An aircraft conceived in the final days of the Cold War, delayed by a nation\u2019s collapse, and celebrated in a low-intensity conflict, was ultimately found wanting when tested in the fires of a major peer-level war.\n\nIts future, embodied by the Su-34M, is one of adaptation driven by necessity. It will continue to serve as a vital heavy payload carrier, but its effectiveness will be perpetually defined by a tense competition between the reach of its standoff weapons and the ever-advancing capabilities of enemy air defenses.\n\nAbout the Author: Harry J.

        "one_sentence_summary": "The Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback, a Russian fighter-bomber with a design rooted in the late Soviet era, is a specialized aircraft optimized for long-range, low-level strike missions, but its outdated airframe and avionics limit its effectiveness against modern, sophisticated air defenses, necessitating updates like the Su-34M variant to address these challenges.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The Sukhoi Su-34 \"Fullback\" is a Russian fighter-bomber that embodies a blend of Cold War-era design and modern technology, officially entering service in 2014 after a protracted development period that began in the late 1970s. Originally conceived to replace older Soviet tactical bombers like the Su-24, the Su-34 was designed for long-range, all-weather operations with capabilities for deep penetration into enemy airspace. Its development was delayed by the Soviet Union's collapse, resulting in a hybrid aircraft that combines older airframe concepts with modern avionics. The Su-34 features a distinctive design with a heavily armored cockpit, advanced avionics, and a robust payload capacity, making it effective in low-threat environments like Syria. However, its performance in Ukraine has highlighted vulnerabilities against modern air defenses, exacerbated by a shortage of precision-guided munitions due to international sanctions on Russia. The Su-34's operational history reflects its strengths in specific roles but also underscores the challenges of adapting an aircraft designed for past conflicts to contemporary warfare.",

        "text": "Europe\u2019s increasingly stodgy and intolerant political establishment continues to celebrate an unexpected electoral triumph in Romania. It was a badly needed victory for the beleaguered elite, but it remains surrounded by more than a few suspicious circumstances.\n\nWorse still, a pseudo-democratic model for retaining political control through less-than-savory means appears to be gaining strength throughout the continent.\n\nEuropean Political Landscape\n\nThe European Union (EU) and its staunchest supporters were shaken to their core in multiple countries during late 2024 and early 2025.\n\nPopulist conservative factions surged in popularity, a development that to some extent reflected Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. In the first round of Romania\u2019s presidential election on November 24, 2024, Calin Georgescu, the candidate of a right-wing populist party, unexpectedly led the field. In addition to his populist social views, Georgescu was an outspoken critic of NATO. His apostasy on that issue made him especially unpalatable to Romania\u2019s political establishment and its supporters in both the United States and Europe.\n\nElection results and political trends in other European countries were equally disconcerting to entrenched centrist and center-left factions. The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party vastly improved on its previous election performances in the country\u2019s February 2025 parliamentary balloting. The AfD finished in second place, just a few percentage points behind the Christian Democrats, who would be the leading party in Germany\u2019s new governing coalition.\n\nPolls regarding France\u2019s forthcoming presidential election in 2027 also contained bad news for both left-wing and centrist political forces. Those polls showed Marine Le Pen, a longtime conservative populist leader, as the leading candidate and probable winner.\n\nOne worrisome response of center and center-left political factions to such unsettling developments has been the intensification of their efforts to ban \u201cextremist\u201d right-wing parties and candidates. French authorities convicted Le Pen of violating campaign finance laws and imposed as one of the penalties a 5-year prohibition on her running for office. In late June 2025, Le Pen called on her political prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jordan Bardella, to prepare for the 2027 presidential election. \u201cI accept that I cannot run. Jordan accepts that he must step in.\u201d In yet another \u201cdemocratic\u201d European country, the strongest, most popular conservative candidate has been forced aside.\n\nPerhaps the most significant and controversial of the punitive electoral restraints is the growing campaign in Germany to outlaw the AfD as supposedly fascist or neo-Nazi. That effort is significant given the party\u2019s performance in the latest parliamentary elections. Outlawing the second-largest political party in a major European democratic country would be a considerable change.\n\nUnderstanding Romania\n\nMatters involving the adoption of undemocratic measures in the name of protecting democracy first came to a head in Romania.\n\nThe country\u2019s governing duopoly\u2014the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL)\u2014did not react well to Georgescu\u2019s unexpectedly strong showing in the first round of the presidential balloting. They used their dominant positions on both Romania\u2019s election commission and Constitutional Court to invalidate the election result and reschedule the first round for May 4, 2025. Subsequently, those bodies disqualified Georgescu from the rerun and threatened him with criminal prosecution. The official justification was illicit \u201cforeign (i.e., Russian) interference.\u201d The evidence authorities cited for that allegation was extraordinarily weak and inconclusive, but Georgescu was nevertheless removed from the ballot.\n\nMuch to the dismay of the establishment parties, though, another conservative nationalist, George Simion, led the new first round with 41 percent of the vote after receiving Georgescu\u2019s endorsement. A supposed political \u201cindependent\u201d Bucharest mayor, Nicusor Dan, edged out the joint PSD and PNL candidate, Crin Antonescu, to take second place and win the other spot in the May 18, 2025, runoff.\n\nSimion was widely expected to win the runoff, given the extent of widespread disgust with the governing parties and, in many circles, with the EU as well. Instead, Dan scored a modestly decisive victory (53.6 percent to 46.4 percent) that was greeted with wild enthusiasm by most European Union governments and Western NGOs. The circumstances surrounding that victory, though, have fueled more than a few suspicions and complaints.\n\nOne notable feature is that Dan\u2019s victory margin apparently was heavily dependent on votes from individuals who held dual Romanian and Hungarian citizenship or Romanian and Moldovan citizenship. The latter might have been especially significant since \u201cpro-democracy\u201d groups in the United States, such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), as well as similar factions in the EU, had subsidized favored groups in both Romania and Moldova for years as part of a campaign to thwart Moscow\u2019s influence. Indeed, an especially hypocritical element of Romania\u2019s original decision to void Georgescu\u2019s victory in the presidential election\u2019s first round was that even if Russian interference had taken place, it amounted at most to a few hundred thousand dollars\u2014a sum dwarfed by Washington\u2019s financial involvement.\n\nThere are growing indications that Europe\u2019s establishment parties intend to use the methods that ultimately prevailed in Romania as a model strategy to defeat populist electoral challenges in other countries, even if the Trump administration is unsympathetic to that approach. Cynics have long contended that unethical insurance companies frequently resort to a shameful but effective approach when dealing with troublesome claims: \u201cdelay, deny, and wait for the policyholder to die.\u201d The political variant that Europe\u2019s establishment factions use when confronting troublesome populist parties seems to be \u201csmear, disqualify, and overwhelm the weakened survivors.\u201d\n\nThere is little reason to celebrate the outcome of Romania\u2019s political battle. Nicosur Dan\u2019s election falls far short of being a victory for genuine democracy. It is a tainted triumph at best. Real democracy must mean something more than guaranteed political dominance for centrist and socialist factions. Yet that is what took place in Romania and threatens to become the norm throughout the European continent. It is a cynical fa\u00e7ade\u2014a Potemkin structure concealing rule by a corrupt oligarchy that pretends to revere democratic norms even as the members make a mockery of those values.\n\nAbout the Author: Ted Galen Carpenter\n\nTed Galen Carpenter is a senior fellow at the Randolph Bourne Institute and a contributing editor at 19FortyFive.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 The US Air Force\u2019s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber proved its enduring value in \u201cOperation Midnight Hammer,\u201d a 36-hour, non-stop mission from Missouri to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\n\n-With a 7,000-mile range and a payload capacity of 40,000 lbs, the B-2 is the only aircraft capable of delivering the 30,000-pound GBU-57 \u201cbunker buster\u201d bomb, which was critical to the operation\u2019s success against hardened underground targets.\n\n-First flown in 1989 and now with only 19 operational aircraft, the B-2 remains at the forefront of America\u2019s long-range strike capability until it is eventually replaced by the B-21 Raider.\n\nMeet the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber\n\nA few days ago, the U.S. military launched a precision strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nSeven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers delivered GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), the largest non-nuclear munitions in the world, against the Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Soon thereafter, a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine launched a salvo of approximately 30 Tomahawk missiles against the nuclear research facility at Isfahan.\n\nThe bombing damage assessment is still ongoing, but one thing is certain: Iran\u2019s nuclear program suffered a major blow.\n\nThe B-2 Spirit\u2019s impressive capabilities are the main reason behind the success of Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nThe strategic bomber\u2019s operational range shone during Operation Midnight Hammer. The strike package took off from Whiteman Air Force Base, in Missouri, and flew for 18 hours to the target area. The distance between the base and the target was approximately 7,000 miles. The B-2s not only flew that distance and struck their target successfully, but they also immediately flew back to their base. Throughout that journey, the strike package refueled midair several times.\n\nThe B-2 is designed for deep penetration strikes against high-value targets in semi-permissive and non-permissive areas. The strategic bomber\u2019s stealth capabilities mean that it can stay hidden from enemy radars for long periods of time. To achieve such results, the B-2 relies on a combination of onboard sensors, structural design, special paint, and pilot skills.\n\nWhen it comes to the specific capabilities of the stealth bomber, the B-2 has the ability to carry approximately 40,000 lbs of munitions. As part of that payload, it can carry both conventional and nuclear munitions. It is the only aircraft in the U.S. Air Force\u2019s arsenal that can carry the massive GBU-57 MOP, a bunker-busting bomb that weighs 30,000 pounds.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by four General Electric F118-GE-100 engines that have the ability to produce a combined thrust of 68,000 pounds and can achieve maximum speeds of about 700 miles per hour (or Mach 0.9). The B-2 has a crew of two which allows pilots to alternate for longer missions, such as Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\nThe B-2 Is Getting Old Fast\n\nNevertheless, the B-2 Spirit is getting old. The aircraft first flew in 1989 and entered service with the Air Force four years later in 1993. The B-2 fleet achieved full operational capability in 2003. Initially, the Air Force had grand plans about the B-2 and envisioned a fleet of hundreds of aircraft.\n\nIn the end, however, it ended up only buying 21 bombers. Today, 19 are operational.\n\nDespite the aircraft\u2019s usefulness in old age, the Air Force is already planning its succession. The B-21 Raider, a similar-looking but far more advanced stealth strategic bomber, is under development. The Air Force expects the B-21 to enter service in the next few years.\n\nUntil then, the B-2 fleet is getting some upgrades and remains at the tip of the spear of America\u2019s global strike capabilities.\n\nThis first appeared in Sandboxx.",

        "text": "The Su-35S Flanker-E: Russia\u2019s Apex Predator of the 4th Generation\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-35S, designated \u201cFlanker-E\u201d by NATO, represents the zenith of conventional 4th-generation fighter design and a cornerstone of the modern Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS).\n\nIt is not merely an incremental upgrade of its legendary progenitor, the Su-27, but a comprehensive \u201cdeep modernization\u201d that resulted in a profoundly more capable multi-role combat aircraft.\n\nThe Su-35S is a strategic asset born from the crucible of post-Soviet economic realities and the protracted development of Russia\u2019s 5th-generation Su-57 program, for which it serves as a critical technological and operational bridge.\n\nThe aircraft is defined by a triad of core capabilities: extreme \u201csupermaneuverability\u201d endowed by powerful thrust-vectoring engines, a suite of advanced long-range sensors, and a formidable multi-role weapons payload that allows it to contest air superiority and execute precision strikes.\n\nThe Su-35S serves as a crucial stopgap for the VKS, furnishing a high-end capability to counter advanced Western 4th-generation fighters while the more complex and costly Su-57 program matures and scales.\n\nIts combat deployments in Syria and, more significantly, Ukraine have provided the VKS with invaluable operational experience, serving as both a live-fire testing ground for tactics and technology and a high-stakes marketing showcase for potential export customers.\n\nThis report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Su-35S, examining its developmental lineage, technical specifications, comparative performance, combat history, and its strategic role in Russian military doctrine and foreign policy.\n\nA Flanker Forged Anew: From Su-27M to Su-35S\n\nThe evolutionary path from the original Su-27 to the modern Su-35S is not a simple, linear upgrade but a complex story of ambition, collapse, and pragmatic resurrection.\n\nIt encompasses two distinct design phases separated by the dissolution of the Soviet Union, with the final Su-35S benefiting from technologies refined in parallel programs that were never intended for it.\n\nThe Soviet Precursor (Su-27M)\n\nThe genesis of an advanced Flanker began in the early 1980s, culminating in the Su-27M program, which first took to the skies on June 28, 1988.\n\nThis aircraft represented a significant leap beyond the baseline Su-27\u2019s pure air superiority mission, aiming for a true multi-role capability. Key features included the addition of canard foreplanes for enhanced maneuverability and stability, a new N011 multi-mode radar with ground-mapping capabilities, a modernized glass cockpit with CRT displays, and an in-flight refueling probe to extend its operational reach.\n\nIn a bid to capture international interest and funding, the Sukhoi Design Bureau marketed this advanced variant as the \u201cSu-35\u201c.\n\nHowever, within the Soviet military, its official designation remained Su-27M. Despite its promising capabilities, the program fell victim to the economic chaos and political disintegration of the Soviet Union. Mass production was never initiated, and the program was effectively terminated after only a small number of prototypes and demonstrators\u2014sources suggest between 12 and 14\u2014were constructed.\n\nOne of these airframes, T10M-11, was later fitted with experimental thrust-vectoring engines and redesignated the Su-37 \u201cTerminator,\u201d serving as a crucial technology demonstrator that would heavily influence future Flanker developments.\n\nThe \u201cDeep Modernization\u201d (Su-35BM/Su-35S)\n\nThe Su-27M\u2019s failure to enter production created a significant capability gap for the newly formed Russian Air Force. As the 1990s progressed, it became clear that Russia\u2019s fifth-generation fighter programs, the MiG 1.44 and Su-47, were stalled, and the subsequent PAK FA program (which would eventually produce the Su-57) faced a long and uncertain development timeline.\n\nIn 2003, Sukhoi launched a new, privately funded initiative to create a heavily upgraded Flanker that could serve as a powerful interim solution. This project was designated Su-35BM, meaning Bolshaya Modernizatsiya, or \u201cBig Modernization.\u201d\n\nThis was not a simple revival of the Su-27M. Instead, it was a more radical redesign that leveraged nearly two decades of technological progress. It integrated key technologies that had been matured on the successful Su-30MKI export program for India, such as advanced avionics and thrust-vectoring, while also incorporating systems being developed for the nascent Su-57.\n\nThe first Su-35BM prototype performed its maiden flight on February 19, 2008. The Russian Aerospace Forces became the launch customer, placing their first order in 2009, with the production version designated Su-35S (Stroyevoy, or \u201cCombatant\u201d). The aircraft officially entered service in February 2014.\n\nThe evolution of the Su-35S is a clear illustration of pragmatic adaptation in the face of geopolitical and economic upheaval. The Su-27M represented the Soviet Union\u2019s peak ambition for a fourth-generation multi-role fighter, an ambition that was cut short by the state\u2019s collapse.\n\nThis left the Russian Air Force with a looming capability gap as Western air forces continued to advance. The Su-30MKI, developed for a foreign customer, became an unexpected technological lifeline, allowing Sukhoi to refine and prove key systems like digital flight controls and thrust vectoring that were too costly to pursue domestically at the time.\n\nThe Su-35S program then masterfully re-integrated these matured technologies, along with advanced sensor and engine elements from the Su-57 program, back into the proven Flanker airframe.11 The Su-35S is therefore not just an \u201cupgraded Su-27\u201d; it is the beneficiary of two decades of parallel, and at times divergent, development paths, resurrected to fill a strategic void left by both the Soviet collapse and the slow pace of Russia\u2019s fifth-generation ambitions. It is a powerful, pragmatic solution born directly from necessity.\n\nAnatomy of a Super Flanker: A Technical Deep Dive\n\nThe Su-35S is a fundamentally different machine from its predecessors, featuring extensive modifications to its airframe, a new generation of powerplants, and a completely overhauled sensor and avionics architecture. These changes collectively produce an aircraft with a flight envelope and combat capability far exceeding any previous Flanker variant.\n\nAirframe and Aerodynamics\n\nThe Su-35S airframe, while retaining the iconic Flanker silhouette, underwent a significant redesign to enhance performance, increase service life, and reduce its radar signature.\n\nThe structure was reinforced, with extensive use of titanium alloys and an increased share of composite materials, which extended its service life to 6,000 flight hours or 30 years of operation.\n\nA key aerodynamic and visual distinction is the removal of the canard foreplanes that were a defining feature of the Su-27M and Su-30MKI.\n\nThe large dorsal airbrake found on the Su-27 was also eliminated. Braking functions are now performed by the differential deflection of the twin rudders.\n\nThis cleaner aerodynamic configuration was made possible by two key advancements. First, the development of a more sophisticated quadruple-redundant digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, the KSU-35, provided the necessary stability and control authority without the need for canards. Second, the introduction of powerful thrust-vectoring engines allowed for a shift in the aircraft\u2019s center of gravity and provided exceptional control, rendering the canards redundant.\n\nEngineers also took steps to reduce the aircraft\u2019s radar cross-section (RCS). While not a stealth aircraft, the Su-35S incorporates radar-absorbent materials (RAM) in critical areas like the engine inlets and the leading edges of the wings. These measures, combined with a smoother airframe, are reported to reduce its frontal RCS to between 1 and 3 square meters, a significant reduction compared to the Su-27.\n\nTo enhance its range and endurance, the internal fuel capacity was increased by over 20% to 11,500 kg.\n\nFurthermore, the Su-35S became the first single-seat Flanker variant designed from the outset to be compatible with external fuel tanks, capable of carrying two 2,000-liter drop tanks.\n\nPropulsion and Supermaneuverability\n\nThe heart of the Su-35S\u2019s performance is its pair of Saturn AL-41F1S (Izdeliye 117S) afterburning turbofan engines.\n\nThese are not entirely new powerplants but are heavily upgraded derivatives of the venerable AL-31F engine family. They share a common core with the first-stage AL-41F1 engine developed for the Su-57 stealth fighter, differing primarily in the engine control system.\n\nEach engine can produce up to 86.3 kN of dry thrust and a formidable 142.2 kN (approximately 32,000 lbf) with afterburner in an emergency power setting.\n\nThis gives the aircraft a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1:1 at normal combat weight, enabling exceptional acceleration and a rate of climb exceeding 280 m/s (55,000 ft/min).\n\nThe engines\u2019 most defining feature is their three-dimensional thrust-vectoring control (TVC) nozzles. These nozzles can deflect independently in both pitch and yaw, granting the Su-35S its signature \u201csupermaneuverability\u201d.\n\nThis capability allows the aircraft to perform extreme post-stall maneuvers at very low airspeeds\u2014such as the Pugachev\u2019s Cobra, the Kulbit (somersault), and the flat spin\u2014that are impossible for conventional fighters. While their direct combat utility is debated, these maneuvers can be used to change the aircraft\u2019s pointing direction rapidly or to break an opponent\u2019s radar lock.\n\nFurthermore, the power and efficiency of the AL-41F1S engines enable the Su-35S to achieve a limited supercruise capability. This allows the aircraft to sustain supersonic flight at speeds of Mach 1.1 or higher, without the significant fuel consumption associated with afterburners, providing a substantial tactical advantage. This advantage increases engagement range and reduces reaction time for both offensive and defensive maneuvers.\n\nThe Digital Hunter: Avionics and Sensor Suite\n\nThe Su-35S is equipped with a completely new sensor and avionics suite that represents a generational leap over the Su-27.\n\nIrbis-E Radar: The primary sensor is the N035 Irbis-E (\u201cSnow Leopard\u201d), a powerful X-band Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar developed by the Tikhomirov NIIP institute. Its 900mm antenna is mounted on a two-step electro-hydraulic drive. This hybrid system combines the rapid beam steering of electronic scanning (\u00b160\u00b0) with mechanical movement of the entire array (another \u00b160\u00b0), giving it an exceptionally wide total field of regard of \u00b1120\u00b0 in azimuth. The radar is extremely powerful, with a peak output of 20 kW. This allows it to detect a fighter-sized target (3m\u00b2 RCS) at ranges up to 400 km in a narrow search sector. It can track up to 30 airborne targets and simultaneously engage up to eight. It also possesses advanced air-to-surface modes, including high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mapping.\n\nOLS-35 IRST: Complementing the radar is the OLS-35, an advanced Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system housed in the traditional Flanker position forward of the cockpit, offset to the starboard side. This system provides passive (non-emitting) detection and tracking of aerial targets, a critical capability for operating in a radar-silent mode or against stealth aircraft. It has a claimed detection range against a non-afterburning fighter of up to 90 km from the rear hemisphere and 50 km from the front. The OLS-35 also integrates a television camera and a laser rangefinder/target designator for both air and ground targets.\n\nDefensive Systems: The aircraft\u2019s survivability is enhanced by the integrated L175M Khibiny-M electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite. This system includes a sophisticated radar warning receiver (RWR), digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jammers, and flare/chaff dispensers to defeat and deceive enemy radar and missile threats.\n\nThe avionics architecture of the Su-35S reveals a distinct Russian design philosophy that contrasts sharply with its Western contemporaries. While fighters like the F-15EX and F-35 prioritize Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars and highly integrated sensor fusion for low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) operations and networked data sharing, the Su-35S employs a more direct, power-focused approach. The Irbis-E PESA radar is designed to be overwhelmingly powerful, capable of \u201cburning through\u201d enemy electronic jamming and detecting targets at extreme ranges. This is paired with the long-range passive detection of the OLS-35 IRST.\n\nThis combination reflects a doctrine that values raw detection power and a mix of active and passive sensing over the networked stealth and data-centric warfare that are central to Western 5th-generation concepts. It represents a \u201cbrute force\u201d method of achieving situational awareness, aiming to overwhelm an opponent\u2019s countermeasures rather than to remain entirely undetected.\n\nClaws of the Flanker: Armament and Mission Capabilities\n\nThe Su-35S\u2019s transition to a true multi-role platform is most evident in its vast and modernized arsenal. With 12 external hardpoints and a maximum payload of 8,000 kg, it can be configured for a wide spectrum of missions, from air superiority to standoff strikes.\n\nAir-to-Air Dominance\n\nIn the air-to-air role, the Su-35S leverages a layered missile capability to engage targets from beyond visual range to close-in dogfights.\n\nVery Long-Range: The aircraft\u2019s most formidable air-to-air weapon is the R-37M (NATO: AA-13 \u2018Axehead\u2019). This massive missile, originally developed for the MiG-31 interceptor, has a reported range approaching 400 km and a hypersonic speed of Mach 6.15 While designed to target high-value assets like AWACS, tankers, and bombers, it has been used with notable effect against Ukrainian fighters from extreme standoff distances. The Su-35S can carry up to four R-37M missiles.\n\nMedium-Range: The primary beyond-visual-range (BVR) weapon is the R-77-1 (AA-12 \u2018Adder\u2019). This is an active radar-homing \u201cfire-and-forget\u201d missile with a range of approximately 110 km. The Su-35S can carry up to 12 R-77-1s, giving it a potent multiple-engagement capability against maneuvering fighters.\n\nShort-Range: For within-visual-range (WVR) combat, the aircraft is armed with the highly agile R-73 (AA-11 \u2018Archer\u2019) and its improved successor, the R-74. These are infrared-homing missiles with a high off-boresight capability, meaning they can be cued by the pilot\u2019s helmet-mounted sight to lock onto targets at extreme angles from the aircraft\u2019s nose.\n\nLegacy Systems: Due to large existing stockpiles, the VKS frequently arms the Su-35S with the older R-27 (AA-10 \u2018Alamo\u2019) family of semi-active radar-homing missiles. While less advanced than the R-77, the extended-range R-27ER/ET variants still possess an impressive range of up to 130 km.\n\nAir-to-Surface Strike\n\nUnlike its Su-27 predecessor, the Su-35S is a highly capable strike aircraft.\n\nAnti-Radiation Missiles: For Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions, the aircraft can deploy a range of anti-radiation missiles, including the Kh-31P/PD and the long-range Kh-58UShE, to target enemy radar installations.\n\nTactical and Anti-Ship Missiles: The Su-35S can carry a variety of tactical air-to-surface missiles, such as the laser-guided Kh-29L and TV-guided Kh-29TE.11 Its anti-shipping arsenal is particularly robust, including the supersonic Kh-31A/AD, the subsonic Kh-35U, and even heavy cruise missiles like the Kh-59MK, 3M-54 Kalibr, and P-800 Oniks.\n\nGuided Bombs: For precision strikes, the Su-35S is compatible with the KAB-500 and KAB-1500 series of bombs, which feature TV, laser, and satellite guidance options.\n\nInternal Cannon: For strafing and close-range engagements, a single 30mm Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 cannon with 150 rounds is fitted in the starboard wing root.\n\nDesignation (NATO Name) Type Guidance Max Range (km) Primary Mission Air-to-Air R-37M (AA-13 \u2018Axehead\u2019) Very Long-Range AAM Active Radar Homing ~400 Anti-AWACS, Anti-Tanker, BVR R-77-1 (AA-12 \u2018Adder\u2019) Medium-Range AAM Active Radar Homing ~110 BVR Combat R-27ER/ET (AA-10 \u2018Alamo\u2019) Medium-Range AAM Semi-Active Radar / IR ~130 BVR Combat R-73/R-74 (AA-11 \u2018Archer\u2019) Short-Range AAM Infrared Homing 30-40 WVR / Dogfight Air-to-Surface Kh-31P/PD (AS-17 \u2018Krypton\u2019) Anti-Radiation Missile Passive Radar Homing ~110 SEAD Kh-58UShE (AS-11 \u2018Kilter\u2019) Anti-Radiation Missile Passive Radar Homing ~200 SEAD Kh-29L/TE (AS-14 \u2018Kedge\u2019) Tactical Missile Semi-Active Laser / TV 10-12 Ground Strike Kh-31A/AD (AS-17 \u2018Krypton\u2019) Anti-Ship Missile Active Radar Homing 70-160 Maritime Strike Kh-59MK (AS-18 \u2018Kazoo\u2019) Standoff Missile Active Radar Homing ~285 Land/Maritime Strike KAB-500L/Kr Guided Bomb Laser / TV ~9 Precision Strike\n\nMeasuring the Apex Predator: A Comparative Analysis\n\nThe Su-35S\u2019s capabilities are best understood when measured against its direct predecessor, the Su-27, and its primary Western and Russian contemporaries. This comparison reveals a fundamental divergence in design philosophies, pitting the Su-35S\u2019s emphasis on supreme agility and raw sensor power against the Western focus on stealth and networked data fusion.\n\nGenerational Leap (vs. Su-27)\n\nThe Su-35S is not merely an upgrade but a generational leap beyond the original Su-27 \u2018Flanker-B\u2019.\n\nAirframe & Performance: The Su-35S features a lighter, more durable airframe with a higher percentage of composites and titanium, a significantly higher thrust-to-weight ratio, three-dimensional thrust vectoring, and supercruise capability. These combine to give it a flight performance envelope that is vastly superior to the Su-27.\n\nAvionics: The most critical difference lies in the sensor suite. The Su-27\u2019s 1980s-era N001 mechanically scanned radar, with a detection range of around 80 km against a fighter target, is completely outclassed by the Su-35S\u2019s Irbis-E PESA, which can detect a similar target at up to 400 km. The OLS-35 IRST nearly doubles the detection range of the Su-27\u2019s OLS-27 (90 km vs. 50 km).\n\nArmament & Role: The Su-27 was a dedicated air superiority fighter with only a rudimentary capability to drop unguided bombs. The Su-35S, by contrast, is a true multi-role platform, capable of deploying a vast arsenal of advanced, standoff air-to-surface munitions, transforming it into a potent strike aircraft.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Engagements\n\nvs. F-15EX Eagle II: This is a classic matchup of 4++ generation heavy fighters. The F-15EX holds an advantage in its advanced AESA radar and potentially superior processing power and sensor fusion, adhering to the Western emphasis on information dominance. The Su-35S possesses a clear edge in close-in maneuverability due to its thrust-vectoring nozzles. Both aircraft have comparable top speeds and thrust-to-weight ratios and can carry a heavy load of up to 12 air-to-air missiles. A potential engagement would likely be decided by the effectiveness of their respective electronic warfare suites, BVR missile performance, and ultimately, pilot skill.\n\nvs. F-22 Raptor: This comparison highlights the generational divide. The F-22\u2019s all-aspect stealth, superior sensor fusion, and networked capabilities are designed to give it a decisive advantage in beyond-visual-range combat. The doctrine is to achieve \u201cfirst look, first shot, first kill,\u201d engaging the Su-35S long before it can be detected. While the Su-35S\u2019s supermaneuverability would make it a formidable opponent in a hypothetical within-visual-range dogfight, the F-22 is also extremely agile and its tactical doctrine is predicated on avoiding such a merge entirely. Anecdotal reports from encounters over Syria, though not definitive, suggest that F-22 pilots felt confident in their ability to dominate the engagements.\n\nvs. Eurofighter Typhoon: This presents a very close matchup between two highly agile, non-stealthy fighters. The Typhoon was designed with an emphasis on supercruise and high-supersonic agility, enabling a BVR combat doctrine of \u201cshoot and scoot\u201d\u2014firing long-range missiles and then using its speed and energy retention to disengage and re-engage on its own terms. The Su-35S, with its thrust vectoring, likely holds an advantage in low-speed, post-stall maneuvering for close-in combat. The Typhoon, with its lighter airframe and different aerodynamic design, may have superior energy retention in high-G turns at speed. The outcome would depend heavily on the specific engagement scenario and tactical execution.\n\nThe comparative analysis of the Su-35S against its peers reveals a fundamental divergence in modern fighter design philosophy. The Su-35S represents the ultimate expression of kinetic performance\u2014a design that seeks to win engagements through superior speed, power, and extreme agility, coupled with a powerful \u201cbrute force\u201d sensor suite.\n\nIn contrast, Western fifth-generation aircraft like the F-22 and F-35 prioritize information dominance through all-aspect stealth, advanced sensor fusion, and networked warfare.\n\nTheir doctrine is to control the battlespace by remaining unseen, making kinematic performance a secondary, albeit still important, attribute. The F-15EX and Eurofighter Typhoon occupy a middle ground, blending robust kinematics with advanced AESA radars and networking, but lacking the comprehensive stealth of their fifth-generation counterparts.\n\nThe Su-35S is thus Russia\u2019s most potent answer to the advanced fourth-generation threat, but its effectiveness against a truly networked, fifth-generation opponent remains one of the most critical and debated questions in modern air power.\n\nAircraft Max Speed (Mach) Service Ceiling (ft) Thrust/Weight Ratio Radar Type Max AAM Load Su-35S 2.25 59,000 1.13 PESA (Irbis-E) 12 F-15EX 2.5 60,000 1.29 AESA (APG-82) 12 F-22A Raptor 2.25 >65,000 >1.18 AESA (APG-77) 8 Eurofighter Typhoon 2.0+ 65,000 1.15 AESA (Captor-E) 10\n\nTrial by Fire: Operational History and Combat Record\n\nThe Su-35S is not merely a theoretical powerhouse; it has been tested and refined through extensive combat operations in two of the 21st century\u2019s most demanding air environments: Syria and Ukraine.\n\nSyrian Debut (2016-Present)\n\nThe Su-35S made its combat debut in January 2016, with the deployment of four aircraft to Khmeimim Airbase in Syria. This deployment was a direct response to the November 2015 shootdown of a Russian Su-24 bomber by a Turkish F-16, signaling Russia\u2019s intent to establish air superiority and protect its assets.\n\nThe primary missions for the Su-35S in Syria were providing top cover for Russian strike packages, conducting armed combat air patrols, and acting as a deterrent to Turkish and Israeli air operations. While they were seen carrying unguided bombs, their main role was air-to-air, and they were the first Russian fighters deployed to Syria seen carrying modern R-77-1 active radar-guided missiles.\n\nThroughout 2019, Su-35s were frequently scrambled to intercept Israeli and Turkish aircraft. On multiple occasions, Russian and Syrian sources claimed these interceptions forced attacking aircraft to abort their missions over Syrian territory. There were also numerous close encounters with US aircraft, including anecdotal reports of simulated dogfights with F-22 Raptors. While Russian-affiliated sources claimed the Su-35S performed well, US pilots and analysts maintain that the F-22\u2019s stealth and situational awareness provided a decisive advantage.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, the Syrian deployment was a success for Russia. It allowed the VKS to test the aircraft\u2019s systems, particularly its avionics and engines, in a real-world combat environment, leading to software and hardware refinements.\n\nThe deployment also served as a powerful marketing tool, showcasing the aircraft\u2019s capabilities to potential customers in the region and beyond. Russian officials reported that the Su-35S demonstrated reliability rates three to four times higher than standard, a key selling point.\n\nThe Proving Ground of Ukraine (2022-Present)\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine has provided the most intense and revealing test of the Su-35S\u2019s capabilities and vulnerabilities. It has emerged as the VKS\u2019s most critical air superiority platform in the conflict, adapting its tactics to a highly contested and lethal air defense environment.\n\nThe aircraft\u2019s most significant contribution has been its role as a long-range interceptor. Flying high-altitude combat air patrols (CAPs) from the relative safety of Russian-controlled airspace, Su-35S pilots have employed the very-long-range R-37M \u201cAxehead\u201d air-to-air missile to devastating effect.\n\nThis tactic leverages the Su-35\u2019s powerful Irbis-E radar to detect Ukrainian aircraft at extreme distances, allowing the Mach 6 R-37M to engage them long before they can get within range to fire their own weapons. This has posed a severe threat to the Ukrainian Air Force, which has struggled to counter these standoff attacks.\n\nHowever, the Su-35S has not been invulnerable. While initial claims of losses were high, open-source intelligence has confirmed the destruction of at least eight Su-35S jets by mid-2025.\n\nThese losses have been attributed primarily to sophisticated Western-supplied ground-based air defense systems (GBADS), particularly the MIM-104 Patriot. In at least one instance, a Su-35S was downed deep inside Russian territory, highlighting the reach and effectiveness of Ukraine\u2019s evolving air defense network.\n\nThere have also been credible reports of losses due to friendly fire, a persistent problem for Russian forces in the conflict.\n\nThe performance of the Su-35S in Ukraine presents a nuanced and complex picture of modern air combat. On one hand, its successful employment of the R-37M missile demonstrates a potent tactical adaptation by the VKS to a high-threat environment. By avoiding direct penetration of heavily defended airspace and leveraging its powerful sensors and long-range weapons, the Su-35S has established itself as Russia\u2019s most effective air-to-air asset in the war.\n\nOn the other hand, its confirmed losses to advanced SAMs like the Patriot underscore the profound vulnerability of even highly advanced, non-stealthy 4++ generation fighters in the face of a modern, layered Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).\n\nThe war in Ukraine is thus a live-fire demonstration of the relentless competition between advanced combat aircraft and the systems designed to destroy them, proving that while the Su-35S may be dominant against other aircraft in its preferred engagement envelope, it cannot guarantee its own survival against a capable and adaptive ground-based threat.\n\nStrategic Calculus: Doctrine, Exports, and the Future\n\nThe Su-35S is more than just a collection of advanced systems; it is a strategic instrument that reflects Russia\u2019s military doctrine, its geopolitical ambitions, and its place in the global arms market. Its future, and that of the VKS, is intrinsically linked to the progress of the Su-57 program and the shifting dynamics of international relations.\n\nThe Flanker\u2019s Place in Russian Doctrine\n\nWithin the Russian Aerospace Forces, the Su-35S serves as the premier air superiority workhorse, a role it is expected to hold until the fifth-generation Su-57 becomes available in operationally significant numbers.\n\nThe VKS employs a mixed-fleet strategy, where Su-35S fighters often provide air cover and escort for Su-34 strike bombers and Su-25 ground-attack aircraft.\n\nFurthermore, it has been tested in advanced command-and-control roles, networking with the Su-57 to share sensor data in experimental \u201cswarm\u201d teaming exercises.\n\nThis doctrinal approach emphasizes kinetic engagement and supermaneuverability, a philosophy that prioritizes winning a direct confrontation through superior flight performance, which stands in contrast to the Western focus on stealth, data fusion, and network-centric warfare.\n\nThe Geopolitics of Export\n\nThe export history of the Su-35S serves as a clear barometer of the ongoing great power competition between the United States and Russia.\n\nChina: The People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) became the first export customer, signing a contract for 24 aircraft. This deal was a significant indicator of deepening Sino-Russian strategic ties and subsequently triggered U.S. sanctions against China\u2019s Equipment Development Department under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) became the first export customer, signing a contract for 24 aircraft. This deal was a significant indicator of deepening Sino-Russian strategic ties and subsequently triggered U.S. sanctions against China\u2019s Equipment Development Department under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Egypt, Algeria, and Iran: A more complex saga unfolded with a batch of over 20 Su-35s originally built for Egypt under a 2018 contract. Cairo\u2019s interest was driven by a need to counter regional rivals and by frustration over long-standing U.S. restrictions on the sale of advanced F-15s and long-range missiles. However, under intense pressure from Washington and the explicit threat of CAATSA sanctions, Egypt ultimately cancelled the deal. This left Russia with a number of \u201cwhite tail\u201d airframes already produced. These aircraft became a geopolitical tool. In early 2025, satellite imagery confirmed that some of these jets, still in their Egyptian desert camouflage, had been delivered to Algeria, a nation with a long history of purchasing Russian arms and less susceptibility to U.S. pressure. Iran has also reportedly finalized a deal for some of these aircraft, spurred by its provision of drones to Russia for the war in Ukraine, though actual deliveries have been repeatedly delayed, likely due to the complex geopolitical and logistical landscape.\n\nThe journey of these specific airframes\u2014from an assembly line in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, to a failed deal with a U.S. partner, to their eventual redirection to non-aligned or adversarial nations\u2014perfectly illustrates the Su-35\u2019s role as more than just military hardware. Its sales and transfers act as a tangible measure of a nation\u2019s geopolitical alignment, its willingness to defy U.S. foreign policy, and Russia\u2019s use of arms exports to solidify influence and generate revenue in a world increasingly defined by sanctions and strategic competition.\n\nConclusion: The Last of the Super Flankers\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-35S is, without question, the most capable and lethal conventional fighter ever derived from the legendary Flanker lineage. It stands as a testament to the fundamental excellence and adaptability of the original Su-27 airframe, pushed to the absolute limits of fourth-generation technology.\n\nIn terms of raw kinematic performance, it remains a formidable threat to any contemporary fourth-generation aircraft in the world.\n\nHowever, its long-term strategic relevance is challenged by the inexorable global shift towards fifth-generation capabilities defined by all-aspect stealth, advanced networking, and sophisticated sensor fusion.\n\nIts combat record in Ukraine is a double-edged sword: it has demonstrated devastating long-range kill potential with the R-37M missile but has also proven vulnerable to modern, integrated air defense systems. This highlights the growing difficulty for non-stealthy platforms to survive on a transparent, high-threat battlefield.\n\nThe Su-35S will likely remain the backbone of the VKS\u2019s tactical aviation for at least another decade, a powerful and versatile asset that bridges the gap to a future dominated by the Su-57 and, perhaps, uncrewed platforms.\n\nIts ultimate legacy, however, will likely be that of the ultimate \u201cSuper Flanker\u201d\u2014the final and most potent expression of a legendary fourth-generation design, perfected at the very moment the paradigm of air combat was shifting decisively toward stealth.\n\nAbout the Author: Harry J.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 The United States must accelerate production of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber by opening a second production facility and increasing the build rate from 10 to 20 aircraft per year.\n\n-The current plan to field at least 100 B-21s by the late 2030s is \u201ctoo little and too late\u201d to deter rising threats from China and Russia. Learning from the mistake of curtailing B-2 and F-22 production, the US needs a much larger fleet of at least 145 B-21s, as stated by the STRATCOM Commander.\n\n-A second plant would increase industrial capacity, reduce risk, and allow for potential foreign sales to key allies.\n\nThe B-21 Raider Bomber Fleet Must Be Expanded\n\nThe Air Force\u2019s newest strategic bomber, the B-21 Raider, is a technological marvel many years in the making. It builds on decades of stealth technology and provides vital long-range, deep-strike capability necessary to deter adversaries for the next several decades.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news: we aren\u2019t producing as many of them as quickly as we should.\n\nGiven the appropriate secrecy surrounding the program, we don\u2019t know the current B-21 inventory or production rate. However, the Air Force has stated it needs at least 100 aircraft and that it expects to procure 10 aircraft per year once in full-rate production.\n\nAt best, the nation is unlikely to have even 100 aircraft until the late 2030s. This is both too little and too late.\n\nThe nation needs a second production facility for the B-21, regardless of the final number of aircraft to be procured. The Defense Department should set a production rate of 20 aircraft per year. This demand signal will allow the B-21\u2019s producer, Northrop Grumman, to build a second production plant. Although the cost of building a second facility is likely to approach $800M, the return on investment is extraordinarily high.\n\nAn additional facility will increase the rate at which the nation can build, field, and operate the B-21 fleet. Deterring China from aggression is a long-term strategy that requires action today. Deterrence cannot be achieved without credible, survivable, and sufficient long-range conventional strike capability.\n\nThe B-21 provides this foundational capability. We simply cannot wait until the late 2030s to field sufficient capacity for this vital deterrence role.\n\nA second facility will also allow the US to increase total B-21 inventory. We must procure the number of aircraft we need, not the number that fits under some arbitrary budget topline. The Air Force has an unfortunate history of taking the opposite approach, albeit by the direction of their political masters. The F-22 Raptor and B-2 Spirit are prime examples of programs curtailed by budgetary constraints rather than strategic necessity.\n\nThe F-22, an unmatched air superiority fighter, saw its production capped at 187 aircraft, far short of the original requirement for over 700. Similarly, the B-2 Spirit was limited to a fleet of only 21 operational aircraft, falling dramatically short of the envisioned 132 units. Both decisions were driven by the incorrect belief that smaller, technologically superior forces could substitute for larger fleets.\n\nCapacity is a quality all its own. This is true for both the industrial capacity to build, and the operational capacity to deter and fight our nation\u2019s wars. US Strategic Command Commander General Tony Cotton, USAF, recently testified before Congress that the nation needs at least 145 B-21s. Some speculate that the nation will need more \u2013 at least 250.\n\nChina has ambitions of global hegemony; Russia is increasingly fixated on recreating their once-dominant Soviet power; Iran and North Korea show few signs of comity. The foundation to address 21st century challenges is sufficient force structure. A second production plant will allow the US to build, field, and operate the inventory that it needs and on a timeline that respects these threats.\n\nAdditional B-21 production capacity will also allow the US to consider sales of the aircraft to other nations. Our closest allies have signaled an interest in buying the B-21. Unlike the F-22, the F-35 was designed as a capability to be shared with allies and partners. The value of this approach increased the warfighting capability of our allies, improved operational and technical interoperability for our warfighters, bolstered the US defense industry, and signaled to our enemies the strength of US-led alliances around the world. We should strongly consider a similar approach for the B-21 and must be able to make such decisions unconstrained by self-imposed industrial capacity limitations.\n\nFinally, building a second B-21 production plant is a smart industrial policy decision. Diversification of production limits risk posed by man-made and natural disasters.\n\nIt increases workforce demands for high-pay, high-skilled labor and improves local economies outside the Palmdale, Calif. location where the B-21 is being built. The current plant in Palmdale was previously used to build the B-2. A second plant will also provide the infrastructure for follow-on industrial capacity beyond the B-21.\n\nThe B-21 Raider represents the future of America\u2019s strategic bomber force, a platform designed to ensure dominance in an era of complex and evolving threats. But the success of this program hinges not only on its advanced capabilities but also on the ability to produce it at scale and speed.\\\n\nThe House version of the reconciliation bill takes an important first step, adding $4.5 billion to help accelerate production and allow for an inventory above 100 Aircraft. But a second production facility is essential to meeting both the nation\u2019s operational requirements and the broader demands of allied collaboration.\n\nHistory has shown us the perils of settling for what seems affordable rather than what is necessary. The United States cannot afford to make the same mistake with the B-21 Raider. Quantity, as much as quality, will define the strategic balance of the 21st century. By investing in a second production line, the nation can ensure that this balance tips decisively in its favor.\n\nAbout the Authors:\n\nRobert Peters is a Senior Research Fellow for Strategic Deterrence in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Allison Center for National Security, where Shawn Barnes is a Visiting Fellow.",

Among the leaked documents are hundreds of blueprints of two of Russia\u2019s most protected nuclear missile bases.\n\nLocated by the town of Yasny in southern Russia near the Ural Mountains and close to the border with Kazakhstan, the two bases have been home to parts of Russia\u2019s most modern nuclear arsenal since 2019, when they received nuclear-capable Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nAnnounced by Russian President Vladimir Putin the year before during a speech on the modernization of the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the Avangard is launched by a conventional rocket booster from which it then separates and glides unpowered, at extremely high speeds, towards a target. It has a reported range of 6,000 kms (or 3,728 miles) allowing it to strike any European capital from Yasny.\n\nAccording to satellite imagery, the two bases underwent significant expansion in the last decade and their defensive measures were considerably augmented including with the addition of remote-controlled machine guns, automatic grenade launchers, and even air defense systems.\n\nHowever, thanks to the intelligence trove, the bases\u2019 sensitive interiors have now been brought to light in extraordinary detail.\n\n\u201cUntil now we have only been able to monitor these bases from above using satellite imagery,\u201d Hans M.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 The U.S. Navy is looking to transform its new, long-range AIM-174B Gunslinger air-to-air missile into a potent airborne interceptor for hypersonic weapons.\n\n-A new solicitation from the Missile Defense Agency seeks to develop a \u201cwide area effect\u201d warhead that can be integrated into existing weapons like the Gunslinger.\n\n-This would allow F/A-18 Super Hornets, armed with the massive AIM-174B (a derivative of the SM-6 interceptor), to create a mobile, forward-deployed defensive layer against hypersonic threats, adding crucial depth to the protection of aircraft carriers and other high-value assets.\n\nA Hypersonic Killer? Navy Wants to Turn Its Newest Missile into an Interceptor\n\nThe U.S. Navy is looking to turn its newest air-to-air missile, the massive AIM-174B Gunslinger, into an air-launched hypersonic weapon interceptor by using a new warhead designed for \u201carea effects.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Missile Defense Agency just published a new solicitation to industry, looking to develop, test, and field a new series of warheads designed specifically for hypersonic missile defense, using what it describe as \u201cwide area effect concepts.\u201d This request is specifically for warheads \u2013 and not for new weapon systems \u2013 with the intent to field service-ready capabilities that can be easily integrated into America\u2019s existing air defense apparatus.\n\nBut don\u2019t let that fool you: Despite the Navy\u2019s plug-and-play intentions, the addition of such a warhead to the AIM-174B could create an air defense capability unmatched by any system or platform. This could be done by effectively turning F/A-18 Super Hornets into roving air-defense assets capable of bringing down inbound hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe Gunslinger is already a uniquely capable weapon, with an extremely large 140\u2013pound high explosive warhead (that\u2019s more than three times the size of the AMRAAM\u2019s and nearly seven times the size of the Sidewinder\u2019s) and a maximum engagement range that may exceed 300 miles, making it one of the farthest-reaching air-to-air missiles on the planet. This weapon has such significant reach, in fact, that it\u2019s meant to gather target data from multiple sources while closing with enemy aircraft, as the missile reaches farther out than the launching fighter\u2019s radar can see.\n\nBased directly on the ship-launched SM-6 interceptor, this massive air-to-air missile stretches nearly 15.5 feet long, with a roughly 13.5 inches diameter and a total weight of 1,900 pounds. That makes it nearly two feet longer and about 900 pounds heavier than the legendary AIM-54 Phoenix missile that once equipped the Navy\u2019s F-14 Tomcats, while boasting the ability to reach targets potentially more than three times farther away.\n\nThe AIM-174B and the SM-6 it\u2019s based on were built for much more than long-distance engagements alone. They carry an enlarged radar seeker derived from the one found inside the AMRAAM, along with the datalink necessary for midcourse target updates. They sufficient propulsion to close with targets at Mach 3.5 and a combination of tail fins and canards that allow for extreme aerobatic maneuvers. As a result, in its surface-launched form (which uses a Mk 72 rocket booster to iniially get airborne) the weapon is rated for a vast array of intercepts, ranging from sea-skimming supersonic cruise missiles to just about any fixed or rotary wing aircraft and even medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phases of flight.\n\nThe weapon is so effective at intercepting fast-moving and maneuverable targets that it is currently considered to be the only air defense interceptor in the world that\u2019s rated to bring down modern hypersonic missiles, at least, in the right set of circumstances. And if all that wasn\u2019t enough, it also has a secondary capability to strike surface targets like enemy warships or ground facilities.\n\nGiven the weapon\u2019s wide array of capabilities, the Navy opted to mount it on F/A-18 Super Hornets to not only dramatically increase its potential engagement ranges but, with the development of new area-effect warheads, provide airborne hypersonic missile defense capabilities for carrier strike groups and other assets.\n\nThe F/A-18 Super Hornet, which is currently the only fighter known to carry the Gunslinger, has an unclassified combat radius \u2013 the distance it can fly out, deploy weapons, and make it back on internal fuel alone \u2013 of around 511 miles. Yet, the aircraft\u2019s combat radius is considerably less when it carries a full loadout of AIM-174Bs, AIM-120s, and AIM-9s.\n\nNonetheless, these fighters could orbit the carrier strike group \u2013 bolstered by the refueling capabilities of other Super Hornets and soon, the MQ-25 Stingray drone refueler \u2013 and at the earliest sign of an inbound hypersonic missile launch their AIM-174Bs from farther out than the Navy\u2019s SM-6s, creating what amounts to a second or even third layer of hypersonic air defense between adversary and aircraft carrier. Air defense is never a sure thing, least of all when dealing with maneuvering hypersonic weapons, so this could be a vital capability.\n\nThis could also allow the Navy to scramble fighters for hypersonic missile defense over or around other high-value targets on extremely short notice, creating temporary barriers over the battlefield until ground-based systems can be repositioned to take over the job. This could be particularly important in rapidly escalating situations as something of a hypersonic stopgap in far-flung theaters.\n\nBut in order to be really effective, the massive 140-pound warhead carried by both the SM-6 and AIM-174B must be turned into a more \u201carea effect\u201d oriented weapon. These warheads are already designed to create a large blast radius to bring down airborne targets, but a payload designed to increase that radius while maintaining enough force to take a Mach 20 missile out of the sky would dramatically improve the weapon\u2019s chances at a successful shoot-down.\n\nAbout the Author: Alex Hollings\n\nAlex Hollings is the editor of the Sandboxx blog and a former U.S. Marine that writes about defense policy and technology.

Known to NATO by the reporting name \u201cFrogfoot\u201d and to its pilots by the affectionate moniker Grach (Rook), the Su-25 is the Soviet Union\u2018s definitive jet-powered armored assault aircraft, a modern incarnation of the legendary World War II Shturmovik.\n\nIt is not merely a machine of war but a physical manifestation of a specific and enduring strand of Soviet and later Russian military thought, one that prioritizes direct, brutally effective, and, above all, survivable air support for ground forces.\n\nThe Su-25\u2019s story begins with the doctrinal echoes of the Eastern Front, tracing its conceptual lineage to the iconic Ilyushin Il-2, an aircraft Josef Stalin famously characterized as being as essential to the Red Army as \u201cair and bread\u201d.\n\nThis heritage shaped the Su-25 into a rugged, heavily armored \u201cflying tank,\u201d designed not to evade threats but to withstand them.\n\nIts decades-long combat career, stretching from the mountains of Afghanistan to the plains of Ukraine, has been a testament to this design philosophy.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Su-25\u2019s lifecycle, examining its doctrinal origins, technical design, extensive combat history, and evolution.\n\nIt also provides a critical comparison with its Western counterpart, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, and assesses its challenged legacy in the face of modern air defenses.\n\nPart I: Genesis of the Grach \u2013 Forging a Modern Shturmovik\n\nThe Doctrinal Imperative\n\nThe conceptual foundation of the Su-25 is deeply rooted in the Soviet experience of the Second World War. The conflict solidified the doctrine of the Shturmovik, or assault aircraft, as a cornerstone of combined-arms warfare.\n\nThe Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik became a symbol of Soviet air power, functioning as \u201cflying artillery\u201d to support the Red Army\u2019s advances directly.\n\nThis doctrine, prioritizing the tactical needs of the ground battle, became a defining characteristic of Soviet military thought.\n\nIn the post-war era, the advent of the jet age shifted air power priorities towards supersonic interceptors and fighter-bombers.\n\nHowever, experience revealed a critical flaw: fast jets like the Su-7 and MiG-23 were fundamentally unsuited for the close air support (CAS) mission.\n\nTheir high speeds made visual target acquisition difficult, and they lacked the armor to survive in a battlefield increasingly saturated with anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS).\n\nThis gap between the Soviet Army\u2019s need for intimate air support and the VVS\u2019s actual capability prompted the Ministry of Defence in 1968 to issue a requirement for a specialized, heavily armored, subsonic assault aircraft\u2014a conscious decision to revive the Shturmovik concept for the modern era.\n\nThe 1969 Competition\n\nThe formal competition for the new battlefield support aircraft, announced in March 1969, attracted proposals from the Soviet Union\u2019s premier design bureaus.\n\nThe contest ultimately became a competition between two different design philosophies, represented by Ilyushin\u2019s Il-102 and Sukhoi\u2019s T-8 prototype.\n\nThe Ilyushin Il-102 was a conservative, two-seat design that was a direct, jet-powered descendant of the Il-2.22 Its most anachronistic feature was a remotely-controlled, rear-facing 23 mm gun turret operated by a second crew member, a direct homage to the defensive gunner of its WWII ancestor.\n\nIn contrast, the Sukhoi T-8 was a completely new, single-seat design representing a more modern interpretation of the CAS mission.\n\nSukhoi\u2019s philosophy abandoned the defensive gunner, instead achieving survivability through a compact and agile airframe, a pilot cocooned in a titanium \u201cbathtub,\u201d separated twin engines, and extensive redundancy in its control systems.\n\nThe first T-8 prototype made its maiden flight on February 22, 1975, and was ultimately selected for production as the Su-25.\n\nThis choice marked a significant doctrinal turning point, rejecting the obsolete concept of a self-defending bomber in favor of a modern, systems-based approach to survivability that confronted the actual threats of the contemporary battlefield, namely ground-based air defenses.\n\nPart II: Anatomy of a Flying Tank\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-25 is a physical manifestation of its design brief: to be a durable, survivable, and practical battlefield support aircraft. Its engineering reflects deliberate trade-offs that prioritize ruggedness and firepower over speed and technological sophistication.\n\nThe single-seat aircraft measures 15.53 meters in length with a wingspan of 14.36 meters, and has a maximum takeoff weight of 19,300 kg.\n\nBuilt to Endure\n\nThe Su-25\u2019s design philosophy is one of damage tolerance, not damage avoidance. At its heart is the cockpit, an all-welded armored enclosure often referred to as the \u201ctitanium bathtub\u201d.\n\nThis protective shell, with thicknesses from 10 mm to 24 mm, is designed to withstand direct hits from AAA and cannon rounds.\n\nThe two Tumansky turbojet engines are housed in separate stainless-steel compartments, shielded from each other by a 5 mm-thick armored firewall to prevent a single hit from disabling both.\n\nVital systems and fuel tanks are similarly protected, with the tanks filled with polyurethane foam to suppress explosions.\n\nCritically, the flight controls are connected via heavy-duty push-rods, providing a manual reversion capability that allows the pilot to maintain control even with a total loss of hydraulic power.\n\nPropulsion and Performance\n\nThe Su-25 is powered by a pair of R-95Sh or improved R-195 non-afterburning turbojets, renowned for their simplicity and ability to run on various fuels, including diesel.\n\nThe choice of a non-afterburning engine was a crucial trade-off. While it capped the Frogfoot\u2019s top speed below Mach 1, it significantly reduced its infrared (IR) signature, a key vulnerability to its most probable threat: heat-seeking MANPADS.\n\nThe aircraft\u2019s straight, high-aspect-ratio wing provides excellent stability and maneuverability at the low speeds required for CAS missions.\n\nWith a maximum speed of 975 km/h, a service ceiling of 7,000 meters, and a combat range of 750 km, its performance is tailored for low-level battlefield support. Its robust landing gear allows operations from short, unpaved runways.\n\nSights and Armament\n\nThe original Su-25 featured a basic avionics package centered on an ASP-17 gunsight and a Klen-PS laser rangefinder, limiting it to daytime, clear-weather operations.\n\nThe specialized Su-25T variant, designed in the 1980s as a dedicated tank-hunter, introduced the sophisticated I-251 Shkval optical TV system, providing a true day/night precision attack capability with weapons like the Vikhr anti-tank missile.\n\nDue to cost, the Su-25T was never mass-produced.\n\nInstead, Russia pursued incremental upgrades for the existing fleet. The latest Su-25SM3 \u201cSuper Grach\u201d features a modern navigation and attack suite, the Vitebsk-25 electronic countermeasures system, and the SOLT-25 electro-optical targeting system, allowing it to employ a range of modern precision-guided munitions.\n\nThe Frogfoot\u2019s main gun is an internal 30mm GSh-30-2 twin-barrel cannon with 250 rounds.21 Its primary strength, however, lies in its ability to carry up to 4,400 kg of ordnance on ten hardpoints.\n\nThis typically consists of unguided FAB-series bombs and a wide variety of rocket pods (S-5, S-8, S-13) and heavy rockets (S-24, S-25), fulfilling its role as \u201cflying artillery\u201d.\n\nGuided weapons include the Kh-25ML and the heavier Kh-29L laser-guided missiles.45 For self-defense, it carries R-60 or the more capable R-73 short-range air-to-air missiles.\n\nPart III: A Legacy Forged in Fire\n\nThe Su-25\u2019s design philosophy of extreme ruggedness and battlefield utility has been tested in a remarkable number of conflicts over more than four decades. Its operational history is a story of both brutal effectiveness and stark vulnerability, providing a clear barometer of the evolving nature of ground-based air defenses.\n\nTrial by Fire in Afghanistan and Beyond\n\nThe Su-25\u2019s baptism by fire in Afghanistan cemented its legendary toughness. It flew over 60,000 sorties, proving ideal for counter-insurgency strikes in the mountainous terrain.\n\nHowever, the introduction of US-supplied FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS changed the battlefield. The Frogfoot, designed to withstand cannon fire, proved highly vulnerable to these heat-seeking missiles, and approximately 23 aircraft were lost in combat.\n\nThis \u201cStinger shock\u201d forced a rapid evolution in tactics, with pilots shifting to higher-altitude attacks and employing the first Soviet precision-guided munitions like the Kh-25 and Kh-29 from safer standoff ranges.\n\nIn the post-Soviet era, the Su-25 became a staple of regional conflicts. Iraq used it effectively in the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War, flying 900 sorties with only two losses.\n\nRussia relied on it heavily in Chechnya, where it operated in a permissive air environment.\n\nThe 2008 Russo-Georgian War, where both sides operated the type, highlighted its vulnerability to more capable SAM systems like the Buk-M1, with Russia losing three Su-25s.\n\nThe Su-25 also saw service with numerous African air forces, including Angola and Ethiopia, and was used decisively by North Macedonia during its 2001 insurgency.\n\nA Russian Su-25 was lost to a MANPADS in Syria in 2018, a potent reminder of the persistent threat.\n\nThe Grinding War in Ukraine\n\nThe 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has become the ultimate and most brutal test for the Su-25. Both Russia and Ukraine have operated the type extensively, suffering catastrophic attrition.\n\nThe battlefield is saturated with a dense array of modern air defenses, from thousands of MANPADS to advanced SAMs.\n\nIn this environment, the Su-25\u2019s traditional low-level CAS role has become suicidal.\n\nPilots on both sides have been forced to adopt \u201cloft-bombing\u201d tactics, releasing unguided rockets in a high arc from a safe distance, sacrificing all accuracy for a marginal chance of survival.\n\nThe war has demonstrated that the Su-25 is a victim of its own proliferation, flying into the teeth of the very Soviet-era air defense systems designed to counter its Western counterparts.\n\nPart IV: Comparative Analysis and Evolution\n\nFrogfoot vs. Warthog\n\nThe Su-25 and the A-10 represent distinctly different answers to the same fundamental question, shaped by the divergent military doctrines of the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nArmament and Role: The most defining difference lies in their main armament. The A-10 is famously an \u201caircraft built around a gun,\u201d its GAU-8 Avenger a specialized anti-tank weapon with over 1,100 rounds. The Su-25\u2019s GSh-30-2 cannon, with only 250 rounds, is a secondary weapon. The Frogfoot\u2019s primary role is that of a \u201cbomb and rocket truck,\u201d designed to deliver a large volume of unguided ordnance for area suppression, fulfilling the Soviet doctrine of \u201cflying artillery.\u201d\n\nSurvivability: Both are tough, but their approaches differ. The A-10 emphasizes redundancy, with widely spaced, high-mounted engines and triple-redundant flight controls. The Su-25 relies on a more compact design and the extreme protection of the pilot within its titanium \u201cbathtub.\u201d\n\nPerformance: The Su-25 is considerably faster than the A-10, reflecting a doctrine of fast-in, fast-out strikes. The A-10 was designed to loiter over the battlefield for extended periods, a mission enabled by its greater fuel efficiency.\n\nThese choices reflect their parent doctrines. The A-10 is a weapon of a dominant air force; the Su-25 is a weapon of a dominant ground army.\n\nThe Frogfoot Family\n\nThe Su-25\u2019s long service life has resulted in an extensive family of variants. Key versions include the baseline Su-25, the export Su-25K, and the two-seat Su-25UB trainer.\n\nAn ambitious leap was the Su-25T, a dedicated all-weather anti-tank platform with the Shkval targeting system. Due to cost, it was never mass-produced.\n\nInstead, Russia pursued the more pragmatic Su-25SM/SM3 modernization program, which incrementally improves the existing fleet with new digital avionics, a HUD, and enhanced self-defense systems, allowing the use of modern guided weapons.\n\nThe Twilight of the Shturmovik?\n\nThe Evolving Mission\n\nThe war in Ukraine has dramatically accelerated the evolution of the CAS mission, likely rendering the Su-25\u2019s entire operational concept obsolete. The extreme lethality of the modern air defense environment has made the Frogfoot\u2019s core tactic\u2014flying low and slow near the front lines\u2014a mission with an unacceptably high attrition rate.\n\nA new model of air support has emerged, driven by two key technologies: standoff glide bombs and tactical drones. This has led to a \u201cdisaggregation\u201d of the traditional CAS role.\n\nThe function of delivering heavy ordnance is now primarily performed by multirole fighters like the Su-34, launching UMPK glide bombs from distances of 50-70 km, far outside the range of most frontline air defenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the role of providing \u201ceyes on target\u201d and conducting precision strikes in close proximity to friendly troops has been almost entirely taken over by a vast ecosystem of low-cost FPV and tactical drones.\n\nThis new paradigm splits the Su-25\u2019s mission into two functions performed by more survivable and cost-effective platforms.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-25 Grach is one of the most significant combat aircraft of the late 20th century.\n\nBorn from a clear doctrinal need to revive the spirit of the WWII Shturmovik, it became a pure expression of Soviet design philosophy: a simple, rugged, and cost-effective tool built to absorb punishment and deliver devastating firepower in direct support of ground forces.\n\nIts combat record is extensive and varied, proving its effectiveness in permissive environments and its stark vulnerability in the face of modern, layered air defenses.\n\nHowever, the very conflicts that built its reputation have also signaled its obsolescence. The introduction of effective MANPADS in Afghanistan began a cycle of threat and response that has culminated in the skies over Ukraine.\n\nThere, the Su-25 has been forced into tactics that negate its accuracy, and it has suffered unsustainable losses. The modern battlefield, dominated by standoff weapons and attritable drones, has disaggregated the close air support mission into constituent parts that are now performed more safely and efficiently by other platforms.\n\nThe Rook\u2019s reign over the front lines is ending. While the airframe will likely continue to serve in the air forces of smaller nations and in low-intensity conflicts for years to come, its role as a frontline assault aircraft in a peer-level conventional war is over.\n\nIt is being rendered obsolete not because a better warlane has replaced it, but because the nature of the game has fundamentally changed, leaving the venerable flying tank as a powerful but ultimately outmoded relic of a bygone era of warfare.\n\nAbout the Author: Harry J.

        "text": "Key Points and Summary \u2013 The recent NATO summit in The Hague, where European allies agreed to a new 5% of GDP defense spending target by 2035 to appease President Trump, was a superficial success that papered over deep strategic confusion.\n\n-While Trump\u2019s threats of withdrawal were averted and Article 5 was reaffirmed, the summit highlighted Europe\u2019s deep dependence on US military power.\n\n-The author argues that Europe must now abandon the \u201cfantasy\u201d of \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d and reinvest in real, hard-power capabilities centered on NATO. This requires focusing on the new frontline in NATO\u2019s \u201cNortheast Corridor\u201d (Scandinavia, Baltics, Poland) and building an integrated defense industrial base.\n\nBreaking Down the NATO Summit\n\nThe NATO summit at the Hague is behind us. The worst didn\u2019t happen \u2013 President Donald Trump didn\u2019t announce America\u2019s withdrawal from the alliance, and in the final communique Russia remains the principal threat.\n\nSetting aside the fawning the Trump administration received from the European heads of state and government, observers can rub their eyes in bewilderment that the very same European allies who only a few years back claimed they could not spend at 2% of GDP on defense now have signed off on a 5% of GDP on defense deal.\n\nThroughout the meeting, there was a palpable desire across Europe to declare the summit a success, with Secretary General Mark Rutte leading the way in making it clear that Europe is ready to do what Donald Trump wants it to do.\n\nA NATO Summit of Promises\n\nThis has been a summit of promises, and as such not that different from past pledges save for the size of the promised defense spending increase. The Europeans got America\u2019s concurrence to sustaining the sanctity of Article 5, the core collective defense principle of the alliance.\n\nIt is also clear that\u2014at least for now\u2014the administration has no intent to pull US military assets out of Europe, though there is likely to be a change in the numbers of US troops stationed in Europe as part of the overall force posture review by the Pentagon. And so the United States and American taxpayers will continue to be an integral part of NATO\u2019s defenses, but the time of \u201cfree-riding\u201d by the Europeans seems to be over.\n\nOr is it?\n\nOne striking aspect of this summit has been how quickly Europe yielded to the demands presented by the Trump administration (even if Spain continues to buck the trend). There was a palpable sense of anxiety among the largest European powers, a sense that without the United States, this wealthy continent could not stand up and generate real, exercised defense capabilities.\n\nYes, the Europeans promised to pay more, but the summit reaffirmed that it will be the United States that will continue to provide the baseline of European security.\n\nThe unusually brief post-summit communique spoke of unity, of Article 5 solidarity and of the requisite 5% investment in defense by 2035 now accepted by the allies. The proof will be in the proverbial pudding, but this summit has ended with a sense that much has been promised but nothing specific enough has been agreed on, other than that the European allies showed themselves willing to bend to Washington\u2019s will.\n\nThe alliance sailed through the meeting without a major confrontation, unlike the one that took place at the 2017 NATO meeting when Donald Trump demanded that the Europeans pay for their defense\u2014at the time to the tune of 2% of GDP. This time at the Hague, the Europeans did all they could to ensure the summit was successful and that Donald Trump could declare victory\u2014here the hat\u2019s off to Secretary General Mark Rutte, a consummate politician, who ran a masterful game to stage-manage the event to its successful conclusion.\n\nWhat Will Europe Do?\n\nThe question that remains is what will happen in Europe next. The pledge to spend 5% on defense by 2035 does not have to be implemented for years. And even if the money is spent, how it will be spent is likely to become a matter of debate yet again. And the larger issue is how the NATO commitment aligns with the ongoing efforts to build a defense capability in the European Union as part of the \u201cindependence\u201d drive that figured so prominently in the discussion among European elites after the last Munich Security Conference.\n\nWhile we continue to debate the money and commitments, it is time to ask how Europe wants to interact with the United States in the coming decade, one that is likely to be critical to European and global security.\n\nSince the communique underscored the sanctity of Article 5 and showed the Europeans\u2019 willingness to spend the money, one should assume that NATO remains the center of how Europe thinks about defense.\n\nIf so, what is the point of the continued debate about \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d and building a bureaucracy in the European Union, purposed for managing defense and foreign affairs?\n\nIs the European Union now to be considered a collective defense alliance?\n\nIf so, where is the military infrastructure and the requisite headquarters?\n\nWhere are the C2 and ISR assets and high-end enablers that would allow such EU forces to operate at the requisite level of effectiveness?\n\nIs the European Union a unitary actor, with an executive center that can in fact order ready forces into battle?\n\nThese rhetorical questions are intended to show that it is way past the time for America\u2019s European allies to shed the fantasy of building \u201cstrategic autonomy,\u201d for without the United States nuclear umbrella, US naval, air, cyber, and space capabilities, etc., deterrence in Europe against Russia will not hold.\n\nA Wake-up Call\n\nThe Hague NATO summit should serve as a wake-up call to political leaders in Europe that, notwithstanding their feelings toward the US president, their countries have a vital national security interest in working closely with the United States, building an integrated system to produce a larger Western defense system centered on NATO for the coming years of protracted global instability.\n\nThis means investing in real, exercised capabilities that are required based on the regional plans adopted at the Vilnius summit \u2013 forces that SACEUR can then plug seamlessly into the plans.\n\nAnd inside NATO, there needs to be a serious conversation about how to support and sustain its new center of gravity that is the Northeast Corridor, where Scandinavian countries, Finland, the Baltic States and Poland are now the critical hub which must be supported to shore up deterrence around the Baltic and the High North.\n\nFurther south, Romania also needs to become a destination for special care and investment, while countries to the west of the Eastern frontier should focus on sustainability, reserves, and support.\n\nIn short, NATO leadership needs to think in terms of where the points of contact are, rather than where the legacy Cold War military installations are located.\n\nNATO\u2019s mission has been renewed, but this must be followed by investments that reflect the new realities of where the new frontier is and what is needed to deter aggression there effectively.\n\nWhat Happens Next to NATO?\n\nThe Hague summit should put to bed the idea of independent European defense or \u201cstrategic autonomy.\u201d It should return the allies back to the basics of hard power centered around the NATO alliance, leveraging US and European defense industrial capacity to produce weapons and munitions at speed and scale while fielding real, exercised forces to send an unequivocal message of resolve to Russia.\n\nWe shall see soon enough if that will be the case.\n\nAbout the Author: Dr. Andrew A.

        "text": "The Foxbat: Anatomy of a Cold War Speed Demon\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25, known to NATO as the \u201cFoxbat,\u201d is less an aircraft and more a Cold War legend forged in steel and secrecy.\n\nWhen it first appeared in Western reconnaissance photos, its massive wings and powerful intakes sent a shockwave through the intelligence community, suggesting a Soviet super-fighter with unparalleled speed and agility.\n\nThis perception directly fueled the development of America\u2019s premier air superiority fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.\n\nThe reality, however, was far more complex.\n\nThe MiG-25 was a product of a singular, almost brutalist design philosophy: a high-altitude, high-speed interceptor built for one purpose\u2014to climb like a rocket and destroy incoming American strategic bombers before they could unleash their nuclear payloads on the Soviet homeland.\n\nFirst flown in 1964 and entering service in 1970, the Foxbat was a marvel of focused engineering, sacrificing maneuverability, range, and low-altitude performance for raw speed and an astonishing operational ceiling.\n\nIts mystique was shattered in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to Japan, delivering the aircraft and its secrets to the West.\n\nThe analysis revealed a machine that was technologically crude yet brutally effective in its intended role. Built primarily of stainless steel and powered by colossal, fuel-guzzling engines, the Foxbat was a flawed masterpiece.\n\nIts story is a fascinating case study in Cold War strategy, technological trade-offs, and the enduring power of a myth.\n\nA Response to a Mach 3 Threat: The Genesis of the Foxbat\n\nThe MiG-25 was born from a specific and urgent fear that gripped Soviet military planners in the late 1950s: the advent of a new generation of American supersonic bombers.\n\nThe United States was fielding the Mach 2 B-58 Hustler and, more alarmingly, was deep into the development of the North American XB-70 Valkyrie, a strategic bomber designed to penetrate Soviet airspace at altitudes above 70,000 feet and at speeds exceeding Mach 3.\n\nExisting Soviet interceptors were utterly incapable of countering such a threat.\n\nThis created a critical gap in the air defenses of the Protivovozdushnaya Oborony (PVO), the Soviet Union\u2019s dedicated Air Defense Forces.\n\nIn response, the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau was tasked with creating a new interceptor that could meet this challenge head-on.\n\nFormal approval for the project, designated Ye-155, was granted in the early 1960s, leading to two parallel prototypes: the Ye-155P for the interceptor role and the Ye-155R for high-altitude reconnaissance.\n\nThe design philosophy was one of extreme specialization. The aircraft had to be able to take off, climb to extreme altitudes, and accelerate to blistering speeds in the shortest possible time to intercept a bomber before it reached its release point.\n\nThis \u201cpoint defense\u201d mission profile meant that other characteristics, such as agility and combat endurance, were secondary. 10 The result was an aircraft designed not for dogfighting, but for a single, high-speed, rocket-like pass to engage its target.\n\nDesign and Technology: A Study in Pragmatic Power\n\nWhen Viktor Belenko\u2019s MiG-25P was disassembled by Western analysts in Japan, they were stunned by what they found.\n\nInstead of the advanced titanium super-fighter they had feared, they discovered a machine built with a pragmatic, almost crude, focus on performance over finesse.\n\nAirframe: Forged in Steel\n\nThe most striking feature of the MiG-25 was its construction. Approximately 80% of the airframe was made not of advanced alloys, but of arc-welded nickel-steel.\n\nThis was a practical solution to the immense thermal stress of sustained Mach 2.8+ flight, as the Soviet Union lacked the capacity to produce titanium in the quantities required.\n\nThis choice made the aircraft incredibly heavy, with an empty weight of around 20,000 kg (44,090 lbs), which in turn necessitated its enormous wings to generate sufficient lift.\n\nThe construction was functional rather than refined, with details like exposed rivet heads and visible hand-welding shocking Western engineers accustomed to more polished manufacturing.\n\nPropulsion: The Thirsty Tumansky Engines\n\nPowering the Foxbat were two colossal Tumansky R-15B-300 single-shaft afterburning turbojets.\n\nThese engines were marvels of raw power, each generating around 110 kN (24,700 lbf) of thrust with afterburner. They could propel the MiG-25 to a sustained speed of Mach 2.83.\n\nPushing the aircraft to its fabled top speed of Mach 3.2 was an emergency-only measure that was forbidden in routine operations, as it would cause the engines to overheat and effectively destroy themselves.\n\nThe price for this incredible performance was a voracious appetite for fuel. The R-15 engines were notoriously inefficient, especially at lower altitudes, earning the Foxbat a reputation as a \u201cgas guzzler.\u201d\n\nThis severely limited its combat radius to just a few hundred miles, reinforcing its role as a short-dash interceptor rather than a long-range patrol fighter.\n\nPerformance and Handling: A Straight-Line Specialist\n\nThe MiG-25\u2019s performance envelope was a direct reflection of its design priorities. It was one of the fastest and highest-flying combat aircraft ever built, holding numerous world records for speed and altitude, including an absolute altitude record of 37,650 meters (123,523 feet) achieved in a zoom climb.\n\nHowever, it was a poor performer in any other regime. Its heavy steel airframe was structurally limited to a modest 4.5 Gs, making it dangerously unmaneuverable in a dogfight against more agile Western fighters like the F-4 Phantom.\n\nAt low altitudes, where the air was dense, the Foxbat was cumbersome and inefficient, with its wings and engines optimized for the thin air of the stratosphere.\n\nSystems and Armament: A Powerful but Blunted Sword\n\nThe MiG-25\u2019s combat systems were a microcosm of the aircraft itself: immensely powerful in some respects, yet critically flawed in others.\n\nThe Smerch-A Radar: Seeing High, But Not Low\n\nThe heart of the MiG-25P interceptor was its RP-25 Smerch-A radar, codenamed \u201cFox Fire\u201d by NATO.\n\nIt was one of the most powerful airborne radars of its era, using antiquated but robust vacuum-tube electronics to generate so much energy it could \u201cburn through\u201d the electronic jamming of enemy bombers. 10 Its detection range against a bomber-sized target was up to 100 km.\n\nHowever, the Smerch-A possessed a fatal flaw: it had no look-down/shoot-down capability.\n\nThe radar was unable to distinguish a low-flying aircraft from the background \u201cclutter\u201d of the ground, rendering it effectively blind to targets below its own altitude.\n\nThis was a catastrophic limitation, as by the time the MiG-25 entered service, NATO\u2019s strategic doctrine was already shifting from high-altitude bombing runs to low-level penetration by bombers and cruise missiles, a threat the Foxbat was never designed to counter.\n\nArmament: The R-40 \u201cAcrid\u201d\n\nThe Foxbat\u2019s primary armament consisted of four massive R-40 (NATO: AA-6 \u201cAcrid\u201d) air-to-air missiles carried on underwing pylons.\n\nThese missiles, like the aircraft that carried them, were specialized for high-altitude interception.\n\nThey came in two versions: the radar-guided R-40R and the heat-seeking R-40T.\n\nWith a range of up to 80 km and carrying a huge 100 kg warhead, the R-40 was designed to destroy large, non-maneuvering targets like strategic bombers.\n\nAgainst agile fighters, however, their effectiveness was limited.\n\nA Foxbat for Every Mission: Variants\n\nThe robust and powerful MiG-25 airframe proved to be a versatile platform, leading to the development of numerous variants for different roles beyond pure interception.\n\nInterceptor Variants:\n\nMiG-25P (Foxbat-A): The initial production interceptor, equipped with the Smerch-A radar.\n\nMiG-25PD (Foxbat-E): An upgraded version developed after the Belenko defection. It featured the new Saphir-25 pulse-doppler radar, which had a limited look-down capability, an under-nose Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sensor, and the ability to carry the more agile R-60 short-range missile.\n\nMiG-25PDS (Foxbat-E): A designation for original MiG-25P airframes that were upgraded to the PD standard.\n\nReconnaissance & Strike Variants:\n\nMiG-25R (Foxbat-B): The initial high-altitude reconnaissance version, equipped with cameras and sensors.\n\nMiG-25RB (Foxbat-B/D): A series of reconnaissance-bomber variants that added a high-altitude bombing capability, using the \u201cPeleng\u201d navigation system for targeting.\n\nMiG-25RBK/RBS/RBSh (Foxbat-D): Specialized Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) platforms designed to map enemy radar installations.\n\nMiG-25BM (Foxbat-F): A dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) variant, designed to destroy enemy radar sites with up to four Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles.\n\nTrainer Variants\n\nMiG-25PU/RU (Foxbat-C): Two-seat conversion trainers for the interceptor and reconnaissance versions, respectively. They featured a distinctive new nose with a separate cockpit for the instructor placed in front of and below the student\u2019s cockpit.\n\nOperational History: A Fearsome but Flawed Record\n\nThe MiG-25\u2019s combat legacy is as complex as its design. Its extreme performance made it a potent psychological weapon and a highly effective reconnaissance platform, but its limitations were exposed when pitted against modern Western fighters.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Soviet-piloted MiG-25R reconnaissance variants deployed to Egypt flew multiple sorties over Israeli-held Sinai. Flying at speeds and altitudes that Israeli F-4 Phantoms could not reach, they operated with complete impunity, demonstrating the platform\u2019s value for intelligence gathering.\n\nThe Indian Air Force later used its MiG-25RBs to similar effect, conducting unchallenged reconnaissance flights deep into Pakistani airspace.\n\nThe Iran-Iraq War saw the Iraqi Air Force use its MiG-25s extensively for both interception and bombing missions. Iraqi Foxbats claimed several kills against Iranian aircraft, including F-4 and F-5 fighters.\n\nThe 1991 Gulf War provided the Foxbat\u2019s most high-profile test. On the first night of the war, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down a U.S. Navy F/A-18C Hornet, scoring one of the Iraqi Air Force\u2019s few aerial victories of the conflict.\n\nLater in the war, in what became known as the Samurra Air Battle, two Iraqi MiG-25s were vectored to engage two American F-15Cs. In the ensuing beyond-visual-range engagement, missiles were fired by both sides, but no aircraft were shot down.\n\nThe engagement was a tactical draw, but it proved that even a third-world air force could use the Foxbat to challenge the world\u2019s most advanced air superiority fighter. 37 However, the Foxbat also suffered losses during the conflict, with several being shot down by U.S. Air Force F-15s.\n\nIn 1992, an Iraqi MiG-25 was shot down by a U.S. F-16, marking the first-ever air-to-air kill with the new AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.\n\nFeature MiG-25PD \u201cFoxbat-E\u201d F-15C \u201cEagle\u201d Primary Mission High-Altitude Interception Air Superiority Max Speed Mach 2.83 Mach 2.5 Service Ceiling ~20,700 m (67,900 ft) ~20,000 m (65,000 ft) Thrust/Weight Ratio ~0.41 ~1.03 Maneuverability 4.5 G Limit 9 G Limit Radar Saphir-25 (Pulse-Doppler) AN/APG-63 (Pulse-Doppler) Look-down/Shoot-down Limited Full Primary AAM 4x R-40 \u201cAcrid\u201d 4x AIM-7 Sparrow, 4x AIM-9 Sidewinder Gun None 1x 20mm M61 Vulcan Table 1: A comparative analysis of the upgraded MiG-25PD and its primary Western rival, the F-15C Eagle.\n\nConclusion: The Enduring Legacy of a Speed Demon\n\nThe MiG-25 Foxbat stands as a singular achievement in aviation history. It was the ultimate expression of a highly specialized design philosophy, created to counter a threat that never fully materialized.\n\nIts existence terrified Western military planners, forcing the United States to develop the F-15 Eagle, an aircraft that would define air superiority for a generation.\n\nThe Belenko defection shattered the Foxbat\u2019s myth, revealing a machine that was less a technological marvel and more a testament to Soviet pragmatism and brute-force engineering.\n\nIts profound flaws\u2014particularly its lack of look-down/shoot-down capability and poor maneuverability\u2014were as extreme as its strengths. These very shortcomings, however, directly informed the design of its successor, the far more capable MiG-31 Foxhound, which rectified nearly all of the MiG-25\u2019s weaknesses.\n\nWith production ending in 1984 after 1,190 aircraft had been built, the Foxbat\u2019s time as a front-line interceptor had passed.\n\nYet, it remains an icon of the Cold War, a symbol of an era when speed was king and the fear of a high-altitude nuclear bomber attack drove the creation of one of the fastest, most intimidating, and most deeply flawed combat aircraft ever to take to the skies.\n\nAbout the Author: Harry J.

        "text": "The MiG-31 Foxhound at Fifty: An Analysis of the MiG-31 Interceptor\u2019s Enduring Legacy and Future\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Mikoyan MiG-31, known to NATO as the \u201cFoxhound,\u201d represents the zenith of a highly specialized design philosophy: the dedicated, high-speed, long-range homeland defense interceptor.\n\nBorn from the specific shortcomings of its famous predecessor, the MiG-25 \u201cFoxbat,\u201d the MiG-31 was not merely an upgrade but a doctrinal and technological revolution.\n\nIts development in the 1970s, leading to a maiden flight in September 1975 and entry into service in 1981, was driven by the urgent need to protect the vast, sparsely covered regions of the Soviet Union against a new generation of low-flying NATO bombers and cruise missiles.\n\nThe introduction of the world\u2019s first fighter-mounted phased-array radar, coupled with extreme speed, altitude, and range, created a unique area-denial capability that has allowed it to remain strategically relevant for nearly half a century.\n\nAs one of the fastest operational combat aircraft in the world, its role has evolved dramatically, from hunting Cold War reconnaissance aircraft to launching hypersonic missiles in 21st-century conflicts.\n\nThe Foxhound\u2019s story is one of remarkable adaptation and enduring, if niche, dominance.\n\nA New Threat, A New Guardian: The Genesis of the MiG-31\n\nThe strategic necessity for the MiG-31 is best understood by examining the operational and technological gaps left by its predecessor in the face of evolving NATO threats.\n\nThe MiG-31 was not just a better aircraft; it was the answer to a problem the MiG-25 was never designed to solve.\n\nThe Limitations of the \u201cFoxbat\u201d\n\nThe Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 \u201cFoxbat\u201d was a fearsome symbol of Soviet air power, designed with a singular purpose: to intercept high-altitude, high-speed American strategic bombers like the B-58 Hustler and the anticipated, though ultimately cancelled, XB-70 Valkyrie.\n\nIts blistering speed and operational ceiling, first observed by the West in the late 1960s, sent shockwaves through Western intelligence communities and directly spurred the development of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.7 However, this extreme specialization was also its greatest weakness.\n\nWhen Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to Japan with his MiG-25P in 1976, Western analysts were finally able to examine the aircraft up close. They discovered that its impressive performance masked technological crudeness\u2014it was built primarily of heavy nickel-steel alloy and relied on antiquated vacuum-tube electronics\u2014and, more importantly, it suffered from critical operational deficiencies.\n\nThe Foxbat\u2019s most significant flaw was its Smerch-A radar, which possessed no look-down/shoot-down capability. This meant the radar was effectively blind to targets flying below the interceptor, as it could not distinguish an aircraft from the background \u201cclutter\u201d of the ground.\n\nThis rendered it useless against the emerging NATO threat of low-level penetrating bombers and cruise missiles, which were designed specifically to fly \u201cunder the radar\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, the MiG-25\u2019s airframe, optimized for the thin air of the stratosphere, performed poorly at low altitudes. It was cumbersome, had a high wing loading, and was structurally limited to a modest 4.5 Gs, making it an ineffective dogfighter against more agile Western aircraft.\n\nIts Tumansky R-15 turbojet engines, while immensely powerful, were also incredibly fuel-thirsty, severely limiting the aircraft\u2019s combat radius and patrol endurance. This relegated the MiG-25 to a \u201cpoint defense\u201d role, capable of a rapid dash to intercept a known target but lacking the legs for wide-area patrol.\n\nPushing the engines to their fabled Mach 3.2 limit was an emergency-only measure that would result in their destruction.\n\nThe PVO\u2019s Dilemma: A Shift in Doctrine\n\nThese limitations created a critical dilemma for the Soviet Air Defence Forces, the Protivovozdushnaya Oborony (PVO), a separate branch of the military tasked with defending the homeland\u2019s airspace.18 Soviet defensive doctrine was shaped by its geography: a vast, contiguous landmass with immense, sparsely populated territories, particularly in the Arctic, which was the most direct attack vector for US bombers.\n\nThis geography demanded \u201carea defense\u201d interceptors with immense range and endurance, a role filled inadequately by older aircraft like the Tupolev Tu-128 \u201cFiddler\u201d.11\n\nWhen NATO shifted its strategic bombing doctrine in the late 1960s and early 1970s away from high-altitude dashes to low-level penetration, the PVO\u2019s premier interceptor, the MiG-25, was suddenly optimized to solve the previous war\u2019s problem.\n\nThe emergence of agile fighters like the F-15 and low-flying threats like the B-1 bomber and air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) like the AGM-86B created a complex, multi-axis threat that the one-dimensional MiG-25 could not counter.\n\nThis doctrinal pivot by NATO necessitated a corresponding pivot by the PVO. A new type of interceptor was required, one that could:\n\nOperate with long range and endurance over the vast northern territories where ground-based radar coverage was minimal. Possess a powerful look-down/shoot-down radar to detect and engage low-flying cruise missiles and bombers against the challenging backdrop of the earth\u2019s surface. Operate semi-autonomously, networked with other aircraft to form a \u201cflying radar\u201d barrier, reducing the reliance on the traditional Soviet method of rigid ground-controlled interception (GCI).\n\nThis new requirement led directly to the development of the Ye-155MP prototype, which began detailed design work in 1969. After its first flight on September 16, 1975, it would evolve into the production MiG-31, an aircraft designed not merely as a technical upgrade, but as the solution to a fundamentally new strategic challenge.\n\nThe MiG-31 was the Soviet answer to both the B-1 and the F-15, embodying a systemic shift from point defense to wide-area denial.\n\nAnatomy of a High-Speed Hunter: Design and Technology\n\nThe MiG-31\u2019s design represents a tightly integrated system of advanced technologies, where each component\u2014airframe, propulsion, and avionics\u2014was synergistically developed to fulfill its unique and demanding mission profile.\n\nAirframe and Propulsion: Strength at Speed\n\nWhile bearing a strong family resemblance to the MiG-25, the MiG-31\u2019s airframe is a fundamentally new and more robust design.\n\nIts material composition marked a significant evolution from the Foxbat\u2019s heavy, 80% nickel-steel construction. The Foxhound\u2019s airframe is a sophisticated blend of 49% arc-welded nickel steel, 33% light metal alloy, 16% titanium, and 2% composites.\n\nThis stronger, more advanced structure, combined with a reinforced three-spar wing and the addition of leading-edge root extensions (LERX), endowed the MiG-31 with capabilities its predecessor lacked. It could sustain supersonic flight at low altitude, reaching Mach 1.23 (1,500 km/h), and was stressed for a higher load factor of 5 Gs, a modest but important improvement.\n\nPropulsion is provided by a pair of Soloviev D-30F6 afterburning turbofans, the first two-spool engines with an afterburner to be used on a Soviet fighter.\n\nThese were a revolutionary improvement over the MiG-25\u2019s thirsty R-15 turbojets. The D-30F6 offered vastly better specific fuel consumption (SFC of 0.72 kg.kp\u207b\u00b9.h\u207b\u00b9 on maximum military power), which was a critical factor in achieving the long range and endurance required for the area-denial mission.\n\nEach engine produces 93.16 kN (20,900 lbf) of dry thrust and a massive 152 kN (34,000 lbf) with afterburner.\n\nThis power allows the 46-ton aircraft to reach a top speed that is redlined at Mach 2.83 (3,000 km/h) to preserve engine and airframe life, though it is capable of higher bursts.\n\nA distinctive feature reflecting its intended operational environment is its landing gear: the main gear units feature two wheels arranged in a staggered tandem configuration, which improves weight distribution and allows for operations from the unprepared or ice-covered airfields common in Russia\u2019s northern regions.\n\nThe Zaslon Revolution: The World\u2019s First Fighter PESA\n\nThe heart of the MiG-31 weapon system is the RP-31 N007 Zaslon (NATO reporting name: \u201cFlash Dance\u201d), the world\u2019s first Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar to enter service on a fighter aircraft.\n\nThis was a revolutionary leap beyond the mechanically scanned antennas of its contemporaries. Developed by the Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design (NIIP), the Zaslon\u2019s large, 1.1-meter fixed antenna could steer its radar beam electronically in just 1.2 milliseconds, a near-instantaneous process compared to the 12-14 seconds a traditional mechanical radar needed to complete a full scan.\n\nThis technological advantage translated into unprecedented capabilities. Its primary function was true look-down/shoot-down performance, enabling it to detect and track small, low-flying targets like cruise missiles against the challenging backdrop of ground clutter.\n\nEarly tests demonstrated its ability to detect a target with a radar cross-section (RCS) of 1 m\u00b2 from an altitude of 6,000 meters.\n\nThe original Zaslon had a detection range of 200 km against a bomber-sized target (16-19 m\u00b2 RCS) and could track up to 10 targets while simultaneously engaging four with its R-33 missiles\u2014a capability matched in the West only by the US Navy\u2019s F-14 Tomcat and its AWG-9/AIM-54 Phoenix combination.28\n\nThis powerful radar underpinned a doctrinal foresight that was decades ahead of its time. The MiG-31 was equipped with an APD-518 datalink that enabled a form of network-centric warfare long before the term was coined.\n\nA flight of four MiG-31s could establish a coordinated patrol line 800-900 km wide, automatically sharing target data via the secure link.\n\nIn this formation, one MiG-31 could act as a \u201cmini-AWACS,\u201d illuminating targets and guiding the missiles of other fighters (including Su-27s or MiG-29s) whose own radars remained off, providing a massive tactical advantage and a degree of passive engagement.\n\nThis concept of distributed lethality, where the group acts as a single weapon system, is a central tenet of modern air combat that was a foundational principle of the MiG-31\u2019s operational concept forty years ago.\n\nThe Two-Crew Cockpit\n\nThe immense complexity of managing the Zaslon radar and the associated datalinks during long-duration, semi-autonomous patrols necessitated a two-person crew, a major departure from the single-seat MiG-25P interceptor.\n\nThe pilot occupies the front cockpit, focusing on flying the aircraft, while a dedicated Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) sits in the rear cockpit, responsible for managing the powerful radar, datalinks, and weapons employment.\n\nThe WSO\u2019s cockpit has very limited external visibility, with only small side windows, forcing reliance on the radar display and a retractable periscope for situational awareness.11 This design deliberately focuses the WSO\u2019s attention on the electronic battle. The rear station features a basic set of flight controls for emergency use, and both crew members are equipped with Zvezda K-36DM \u201czero-zero\u201d ejection seats, renowned for their safety and reliability.\n\nThe Long Lance: Armament and Evolving Mission Sets\n\nThe MiG-31\u2019s weaponry has evolved in lockstep with its airframe and avionics, transforming the platform from a pure interceptor into a multi-role asset and even a strategic strike weapon.\n\nThe R-33 \u201cAmos\u201d \u2013 A Purpose-Built Weapon\n\nThe Vympel R-33 (NATO: AA-9 \u201cAmos\u201d) long-range air-to-air missile was not merely an armament option for the MiG-31; it was developed in parallel as part of a single, integrated weapon system with the aircraft and its Zaslon radar.\n\nIt is a very large and heavy missile, weighing 490 kg and measuring 4.15 meters in length, explicitly designed to destroy high-value, high-speed targets like the SR-71 Blackbird, B-1 Lancer, and B-52 Stratofortress from extreme range.\n\nThe R-33\u2019s guidance system was a product of its time, employing a combination of inertial navigation for the initial flight phase, mid-course updates from the MiG-31\u2019s datalink, and semi-active radar homing (SARH) for the terminal attack.\n\nThis SARH guidance required the Zaslon radar to continuously illuminate the target until the missile impacted, a potential vulnerability as it forced the MiG-31 to maintain its course. The Foxhound carries four R-33s in semi-recessed ejector pylons under its fuselage, a configuration reminiscent of the F-14\u2019s carriage of AIM-54 Phoenix missiles.\n\nThe improved R-33S variant, introduced with the upgraded MiG-31B, featured a more advanced digital seeker and an extended range of 160 km, compared to the original\u2019s 120 km.\n\nModern Munitions: The R-37M \u201cAxehead\u201d\n\nThe comprehensive modernization of the Foxhound fleet to the MiG-31BM/BSM standard introduced a far more lethal weapon: the Vympel R-37M (NATO: AA-13 \u201cAxehead\u201d). A direct descendant of the R-33 and the ambitious R-37 missile developed for the cancelled MiG-31M program, the R-37M dramatically enhances the Foxhound\u2019s combat potential.\n\nThe missile boasts an astonishing engagement range, variously cited as being between 300 km and 400 km, far outstripping its Western counterparts.\n\nIts most critical feature is an active radar homing (ARH) seeker. This \u201cfire-and-forget\u201d capability is a tactical game-changer. Unlike the R-33, the R-37M does not require the launch aircraft to maintain a radar lock for the entire duration of the engagement. The MiG-31 can launch the missile and immediately perform defensive maneuvers, significantly increasing its survivability.\n\nThis combination of extreme range, high speed, and ARH guidance, launched from the MiG-31\u2019s high-altitude, high-speed perch, has proven to be a devastatingly effective system in the Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nThe Kinzhal Carrier: From Interceptor to Strategic Striker\n\nThe most profound evolution in the MiG-31\u2019s four-decade career is its modification into the MiG-31K, a dedicated launch platform for the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal (NATO: AS-24 \u201cKilljoy\u201d) air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM).\n\nThis transformation represents a complete inversion of the platform\u2019s original purpose. Conceived as the ultimate defensive shield for the Soviet homeland, the MiG-31K has become a potent offensive strategic strike weapon.\n\nThe MiG-31 was selected as the Kinzhal\u2019s carrier for its unique performance envelope. Its ability to climb to altitudes above 15 km and accelerate to speeds approaching Mach 3 provides the perfect high-energy launch state for the missile.\n\nThis launch profile acts as a \u201cfirst stage\u201d for the Kinzhal, imparting significant initial kinetic and potential energy, which extends its effective range to a claimed 2,000 km (a figure that includes the aircraft\u2019s own combat radius) and helps it achieve a terminal velocity of up to Mach 10.\n\nThe conversion to a MiG-31K is substantial. The airframe is structurally reinforced with new attachment points to carry the massive 4,300 kg Kinzhal on a single centerline pylon.\n\nThe standard air-to-air fire-control system is removed or heavily modified; the MiG-31K is a dedicated strike aircraft and cannot perform its interceptor role while armed with the Kinzhal.\n\nNew avionics, digital computers, and datalink systems are installed, allowing the WSO to input target coordinates and manage the complex launch sequence, with some reports suggesting an ability to retarget the missile after launch.\n\nThis repurposing is a cost-effective method for Russia to field a new strategic capability, leveraging the unparalleled performance of a proven, if aging, airframe without the expense of developing a new bomber. This new role as a tool of strategic asymmetry allows Russia to hold high-value targets at risk from unpredictable attack vectors, stressing and complicating the calculus for even the most advanced Western air defense systems.\n\nThe Modernized Foxhound: A Lineage of Upgrades\n\nThe MiG-31\u2019s longevity is a direct result of continuous, albeit sometimes reactive, modernization programs designed to keep the aging but capable platform relevant against evolving threats.\n\nEarly Evolution: MiG-31DZ and MiG-31B/BS\n\nThe first significant production enhancement was the MiG-31DZ, which introduced a semi-retractable in-flight refueling probe on the port side of the fuselage, dramatically increasing the aircraft\u2019s patrol time and operational range.\n\nA more critical upgrade followed in 1990 with the MiG-31B. This new variant was a direct response to a major security breach: the compromise of the original Zaslon radar\u2019s secrets to the West by Phazotron engineer Adolf Tolkachev.\n\nThis reactive modernization was essential to restore the system\u2019s integrity. The MiG-31B featured a new, more secure version of the radar, improved electronic countermeasures (ECM) and electronic warfare (EW) suites, and compatibility with the upgraded R-33S missile.\n\nConcurrently, baseline MiG-31s were upgraded to a similar standard and designated MiG-31BS; the primary difference was that most BS models lacked the refueling probe.\n\nThe \u201cDeep Modernization\u201d: MiG-31BM and BSM\n\nBy the 2000s, the threat environment had shifted again, with advanced Western fighters, new missile technologies, and stealth becoming primary concerns. This prompted a proactive and comprehensive upgrade known as the Bolshaya Modernizatsiya (\u201cDeep Modernization\u201d), resulting in the MiG-31BM, the cornerstone of the modern Foxhound fleet.\n\nThis program was a forward-looking enhancement designed to expand the aircraft\u2019s capabilities and ensure its utility for decades.\n\nThe MiG-31BM features a completely revamped avionics suite, replacing the 1970s-era analog \u201csteam gauges\u201d with modern liquid-crystal multi-function displays (MFDs) for both crew members, Hands-On-Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) controls, and a new, faster Baget-55 series central computer.\n\nThe radar is upgraded to the Zaslon-AM standard, which increases the detection range against fighter-sized targets to 320 km and can track up to 24 targets while engaging eight simultaneously\u2014a doubling of its original engagement capability. The upgrade also integrates the potent R-37M missile and adds a true multi-role capability, allowing the Foxhound to employ a range of air-to-ground munitions.\n\nThe MiG-31BSM is a parallel upgrade applied to the older BS airframes, bringing them to a standard largely identical to the BM.\n\nThe BSM upgrade adds the refueling probe, new heat-resistant canopy glass for safer sustained high-speed flight, and a distinctive rear-view periscope mounted above the pilot\u2019s canopy. Today, the vast majority of Russia\u2019s active Foxhound fleet has been brought up to the advanced BM or BSM standard.\n\nSpecialized and Aborted Variants\n\nThe history of the MiG-31 also includes ambitious projects that highlight its potential. The MiG-31M \u201cSuper Foxhound,\u201d which first flew in 1985, was a radically improved version featuring a more powerful Zaslon-M radar with a larger 1.4-meter antenna, more powerful D-30F6M engines, and carriage for six of the then-new R-37 missiles.\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union and subsequent economic collapse prevented it from entering production, but much of its advanced technology was later incorporated into the BM modernization program.\n\nAnother specialized variant was the MiG-31D, developed in 1987 as a dedicated anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon carrier. Designed to launch the large 79M6 \u201cKontakt\u201d missile, its radar was replaced with a specialized upward-looking sensor system. Though only two prototypes were built, this program established the Foxhound\u2019s potential for space-related roles.\n\nFeature MiG-31 (baseline) MiG-31B / BS MiG-31BM / BSM MiG-31K In-Service Date 1981 1990 2008 / 2014 2018 Distinguishing Feature No refueling probe Refueling probe (B), no probe (BS) Refueling probe, rear periscope (BSM) Centerline pylon for Kinzhal Radar System Zaslon-A Zaslon-A (upgraded) Zaslon-AM Modified/removed for strike role Max Detection Range ~200 km (bomber) ~200 km (bomber) 320 km (fighter), 400 km (bomber) N/A Track/Engage Channels 10 / 4 10 / 4 24 / 8 N/A Primary AAM Armament 4x R-33 4x R-33S 4x R-37M, R-77 None (when carrying Kinzhal) Special Armament None None Guided bombs, anti-radiation missiles 1x Kh-47M2 Kinzhal ALBM Cockpit Analog Analog Digital MFDs Digital MFDs Table 1: A summary of key features across major MiG-31 variants, compiled from multiple sources.\n\nIn Service: Doctrine, Confrontation, and Combat\n\nThe MiG-31\u2019s operational history spans the height of the Cold War to the front lines of modern conflict, consistently demonstrating the effectiveness of its specialized design.\n\nGuardian of the North: Cold War Operations\n\nUpon entering service with the PVO in 1981, the MiG-31 immediately assumed its intended role as the primary defender of the Soviet Union\u2019s vast and vulnerable northern and far-eastern frontiers.\n\nDeployed in networked groups of four, they created a formidable defensive screen hundreds of kilometers long, capable of engaging any intruder, from high-altitude strategic bombers to low-level cruise missiles.\n\nThe Foxhound quickly proved it was the first Soviet interceptor to be a credible threat to the legendary Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. While the MiG-25 was unable to effectively intercept the high-flying, Mach 3+ reconnaissance plane, MiG-31 crews recorded multiple successful intercepts where they achieved a weapons-quality radar lock.\n\nIn a notable encounter on January 31, 1986, a MiG-31 pilot locked onto an SR-71 from 120 km away.\n\nAn even more famous incident occurred on October 6, 1986, when six MiG-31s executed a coordinated, multi-axis intercept, effectively bracketing an SR-71 and subjecting it to a simulated all-aspect missile attack.\n\nWhile no shots were ever fired, these encounters demonstrated a viable tactical solution to the previously untouchable spy plane and reportedly forced a change in SR-71 mission profiles, validating the effectiveness of the MiG-31 system.\n\nA Tale of Two Interceptors: Foxhound vs. Tomcat\n\nOn paper, the MiG-31 and the Grumman F-14 Tomcat appear to be direct counterparts: large, two-seat, twin-engine interceptors armed with long-range missiles. In reality, they are products of fundamentally different strategic requirements and design philosophies.\n\nThe MiG-31 is a land-based \u201cArea Defense Interceptor\u201d built for the PVO. Its design unapologetically prioritizes raw speed (Mach 2.83) and altitude (over 20 km) to cover vast distances over the Soviet landmass as quickly as possible.\n\nIt was never intended for close-in combat, as evidenced by its 5G structural limit.\n\nIts strength lay in the power of its radar and its ability to function as part of a networked defensive barrier.\n\nThe F-14 Tomcat, by contrast, was a carrier-based \u201cFleet Defense Fighter\u201d for the US Navy. Its design was optimized for long loiter times on Combat Air Patrol (CAP) stations, using its powerful AWG-9 radar and up to six AIM-54 Phoenix missiles to protect an aircraft carrier battle group from swarms of Soviet bombers and anti-ship missiles.\n\nCrucially, unlike the MiG-31, the F-14 was also designed from the outset to be a world-class dogfighter. Its variable-sweep wings provided exceptional maneuverability across a wide flight envelope, making it a true air superiority fighter, not just an interceptor.\n\nThe Tomcat was a versatile, multi-role naval fighter; the Foxhound was a pure, land-based interceptor.\n\nMetric MiG-31BM F-14D Super Tomcat Primary Mission Area Defense Interception Fleet Air Defense / Air Superiority Design Philosophy Speed/Altitude Dominance Versatility / Maneuverability Max Speed (High Alt) Mach 2.83 (3,000 km/h) Mach 2.34 (2,485 km/h) Max Speed (Low Alt) Mach 1.23 (1,500 km/h) Mach 1.2 Service Ceiling 20,600 m (67,600 ft) 15,200 m (50,000 ft) Combat Radius 720 km (at Mach 2.35) ~900 km Thrust/Weight Ratio 0.85 0.92 Maneuverability 5 G Limit 7.5+ G Limit Radar System PESA (Zaslon-AM) Pulse-Doppler (AN/AWG-9) Max AAM Range ~300-400 km (R-37M) ~185 km (AIM-54C) AAM Guidance ARH (R-37M) ARH (AIM-54) Guns 1x 23mm GSh-6-23 1x 20mm M61 Vulcan Table 2: A comparative analysis of the MiG-31 and its closest Western contemporary, the F-14 Tomcat, highlighting their divergent design priorities.\n\nTrial by Fire: The Russo-Ukrainian War\n\nThe 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has provided the first major combat test for the MiG-31, where it has emerged as one of Russia\u2019s most formidable aerial assets.\n\nOperating from a high-altitude, high-speed sanctuary, MiG-31BMs armed with the very-long-range R-37M missile have engaged Ukrainian aircraft with virtual impunity.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force\u2019s fleet of Su-27s and MiG-29s lack the performance or missile range to effectively challenge the Foxhound in a beyond-visual-range (BVR) engagement, creating a significant asymmetric threat that has resulted in a number of claimed Ukrainian aircraft losses and has forced their pilots to fly dangerously low to avoid detection.\n\nSimultaneously, the MiG-31K variant has had a profound strategic and psychological impact. Every sortie by a Kinzhal-armed Foxhound triggers nationwide air raid alerts across Ukraine, disrupting civilian life and the economy, earning it the moniker of a \u201cterror weapon\u201d.\n\nWhile Ukrainian forces have demonstrated the ability to intercept the Kinzhal missile using advanced Western air defense systems like the MIM-104 Patriot, each engagement requires the expenditure of extremely valuable and scarce interceptor missiles.\n\nHowever, the Foxhound fleet is not invulnerable. Its greatest strength\u2014its reliance on a small number of specialized, high-performance airframes\u2014is also its greatest weakness. As the aircraft is no longer in production, every loss is irreplaceable.\n\nUkraine has logically countered the MiG-31\u2019s aerial dominance by targeting the aircraft on the ground. Successful long-range missile and drone strikes on Russian airbases, such as Belbek in occupied Crimea and Savasleyka deep inside Russia, have resulted in the confirmed destruction of several MiG-31s.\n\nThis strategy bypasses the need to challenge the Foxhound in the air and instead attacks its logistical base, turning the conflict into a battle of attrition between Ukrainian precision-strike capabilities and Russian airbase defenses.\n\nSunset or New Dawn? The Future of the Fleet\n\nWith its airframes aging, the MiG-31 fleet is facing the twilight of its service life, prompting questions about its long-term viability and the ambitious, perhaps unrealistic, program intended to replace it.\n\nThe Challenge of Age: Fleet Life Extension\n\nThe last MiG-31 rolled off the production line at the Sokol plant in 1994, meaning the youngest airframes are now three decades old.\n\nRussia has embarked on extensive life-extension programs, with the intensive BM/BSM modernizations intended to keep the aircraft in service until at least 2030, and possibly longer.\n\nThese overhauls require the aircraft to be completely disassembled to check for structural fatigue before being rebuilt with modern systems.\n\nThis effort faces significant logistical hurdles. The powerful D-30F6 engines have a notoriously short time between overhauls, reportedly just 300 flight hours, which places an immense maintenance burden on the force.\n\nWhile Russia has claimed to have large stockpiles of spare engines, recent official discussions about restarting the production line suggest this inventory may be dwindling.\n\nWith a finite number of airframes\u2014perhaps 130-150 operational or in reserve out of ~500 built\u2014the fleet is a dwindling asset. Stored aircraft are often cannibalized for spare parts to keep the active fleet flying, a practice that is unsustainable in the long term.\n\nThe Successor: PAK DP / MiG-41\n\nRecognizing the MiG-31\u2019s eventual retirement, Russia has initiated the Perspektivny Aviatsionny Kompleks Dal\u2019nego Perekhvata (PAK DP) program to develop a successor, unofficially designated the MiG-41.\n\nThis is envisioned as a sixth-generation stealth interceptor designed to carry the Foxhound\u2019s mission into the mid-21st century.\n\nThe claimed capabilities for the MiG-41 are extraordinary, including speeds of Mach 4-4.3, operation in \u201cnear space,\u201d the ability to intercept hypersonic weapons, and an anti-satellite role.\n\nHowever, the PAK DP program is viewed with considerable skepticism by Western analysts. Russia has struggled with the production of its fifth-generation Su-57 fighter and currently lacks a production engine capable of powering a Mach 4+ aircraft.\n\nGiven these industrial and technological challenges, many view the MiG-41 as more of a long-term aspiration or propaganda project than a viable program with a realistic timeline to replace the MiG-31 in the 2030s.\n\nThis creates a potential \u201ccapability chasm\u201d for Russian air defense. As the MiG-31 fleet inevitably reaches the end of its structural life, it is highly unlikely that the MiG-41 will be ready to replace it in sufficient numbers.\n\nNo other aircraft in the Russian inventory, including the Su-57, can replicate the Foxhound\u2019s unique combination of speed, range, and altitude.21 This suggests Russia will face a period where its ability to conduct its long-held doctrine of wide-area air defense over its northern territories will be significantly degraded.\n\nConclusion and Expert Assessment\n\nThe Mikoyan MiG-31 \u201cFoxhound\u201d is an aviation paradox: a relic of a specific Cold War doctrine that has proven uniquely and brutally effective in a 21st-century conflict.\n\nIt is the ultimate realization of the pure interceptor, a design that sacrificed maneuverability and versatility for unparalleled dominance in speed, altitude, and sensor reach. Its introduction of the Zaslon PESA radar and its networked operational concept were genuinely revolutionary, presaging the network-centric warfare of the future.\n\nIts core performance attributes remain formidable. The ability to sustain supersonic cruise at Mach 2.35 and dash to Mach 2.83 at altitudes exceeding 67,000 feet, combined with the extreme range of its modernized Zaslon-AM radar and R-37M missiles, creates a sphere of influence that few modern aircraft can challenge directly.\n\nHowever, its lack of agility makes it highly vulnerable in any close-range engagement, and its high operational cost and the immense maintenance burden of its aging, out-of-production airframes make it a fragile, finite, and ultimately irreplaceable asset.\n\nThe MiG-31\u2019s continued relevance highlights a crucial lesson in military aviation: while the dominant trend is towards flexible multi-role platforms, overwhelming performance in a specific niche can still create decisive tactical and strategic advantages. Yet, the Foxhound\u2019s story is also a cautionary tale about the long-term risks of over-specialization. The Soviet decision to invest in this highly specialized platform paid dividends for decades, but now presents Russia with a critical single point of failure.\n\nAs the fleet ages towards an inevitable retirement, Russia faces the monumental challenge of replacing a unique capability that is central to its defense doctrine\u2014a task for which there is no easy or guaranteed solution on the horizon.\n\nThe future of the dedicated heavy interceptor concept itself hangs in the balance, likely to fade with the last of the Foxhounds.\n\nAbout the Author: Harry J.

        "text": "The Tupolev PAK DA: Russia\u2019s High-Stakes Gambit for a New Era of Strategic Airpower\n\nIntroduction: The Dawn of a New Bomber Era\n\nThe Tri-Polar Strategic Challenge \u2013 In the unfolding landscape of 21st-century geopolitics, the strategic bomber has re-emerged as a paramount symbol and instrument of global power.\n\nA new, high-stakes arms race is underway, defined not by the sheer numbers of the Cold War but by the technological sophistication of low-observable, or \u201cstealth,\u201d platforms capable of holding any target on the globe at risk.\n\nThis contest is dominated by three principal actors: the United States, with its operational Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit and its successor, the B-21 Raider, now in flight testing; the People\u2019s Republic of China, with its developing Xian H-20; and the Russian Federation.\n\nIt is into this formidable arena that Russia projects its own next-generation contender: the Tupolev PAK DA.\n\nThis report is a comprehensive look at the PAK DA, pulling together all available information into one, comprehensive analysis.\n\nAmbition vs. Reality\n\nThe Tupolev PAK DA (an acronym for Perspektivnyi Aviatsionnyi Kompleks Dalney Aviatsii, or \u201cProspective Aviation Complex for Long-Range Aviation\u201d), officially codenamed Poslannik (Envoy), represents a monumental and necessary doctrinal shift in Russian military aviation.\n\nThe program signals a decisive break from the Soviet-era emphasis on supersonic speed as the primary means of survival, embracing instead a modern paradigm that prioritizes stealth, extended range, and the use of advanced standoff weaponry.\n\nThis ambitious vision, however, is tethered to a starkly different reality. The PAK DA program is fundamentally constrained by a cascade of formidable and interconnected obstacles: deep-seated technological deficits in critical areas like stealth materials and microelectronics, a beleaguered and under-resourced industrial base, the crippling effect of sustained international sanctions, and the immense resource drain of the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nThe PAK DA is, therefore, more than a military hardware project; it is a high-stakes test of the modern Russian state\u2019s ability to conceive, fund, and execute a technologically revolutionary program on par with its global rivals under conditions of unprecedented and sustained pressure.\n\nIts trajectory will serve as a crucial bellwether for the future of Russia\u2019s high-tech defense sector and its standing as a top-tier military power.\n\nFrom \u2018Blackjack\u2019 Successor to \u2018Spirit\u2019 Competitor: A Doctrinal Evolution\n\nPost-Soviet Origins and Supersonic Dreams \u2013 The conceptual genesis of a next-generation Russian bomber dates to the late 1990s, with the first formal technical and tactical requirements being issued to the venerable Tupolev Design Bureau in 2007 and program financing commencing in 2008.\n\nEarly concepts for the PAK DA were heavily influenced by Russia\u2019s existing bomber doctrine, which prized speed and altitude. Initial plans envisioned a platform heavily based on an evolution of the supersonic Tupolev Tu-160 \u201cBlackjack,\u201d a swing-wing strategic bomber that remains the heaviest and fastest of its kind.\n\nThis approach reflected a deeply ingrained Soviet-era philosophy that high speed was a key component of a bomber\u2019s survivability, allowing it to dash through or outrun enemy defenses.\n\nThe Subsonic Pivot: Acknowledging a New Reality\n\nBy 2013, the program underwent a profound and decisive transformation. The Russian Defence Ministry announced that the selected design for the PAK DA would be a subsonic \u201cflying wing,\u201d explicitly abandoning the pursuit of supersonic speed in favor of low observability (stealth), extended range, and greater payload capacity.\n\nThis pivot represented a fundamental change in Russian strategic thought, an implicit acknowledgment that in the face of modern, sophisticated Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS), stealth had become a more viable survival mechanism than speed. The new design paradigm drew clear inspiration from the only operational stealth bomber at the time, the American B-2 Spirit, signaling Russia\u2019s intent to compete directly in the domain of low-observable technology.\n\nThis doctrinal shift and the concurrent decision to restart production of the modernized supersonic Tu-160M2 are two sides of the same coin, revealing a pragmatic, if reluctant, admission by the Russian military establishment of its technological and financial limitations.\n\nThe immense cost and complexity of developing a platform that is both supersonic and truly stealthy\u2014a challenge that led the United States to field separate B-1 and B-2 bombers\u2014likely proved insurmountable. This dual-track approach represents a strategic compromise: the Tu-160M2 addresses the continuing need for a modern supersonic standoff platform, freeing the PAK DA to focus exclusively on the technically demanding challenge of achieving stealth.\n\nA History of Shifting Timelines\n\nThe PAK DA\u2019s development has been characterized by a consistent pattern of ambitious announcements followed by significant and repeated delays. Initial projections in the late 2000s and early 2010s suggested a first flight between 2015 and 2019, with serial production beginning as early as 2023.\n\nHowever, this schedule has slipped continuously. The projected first flight was pushed to 2023, then to 2024, and is now tentatively slated for 2025 at the earliest.\n\nConsequently, the start of serial production has been postponed to 2027-2030, with many Western analysts believing even this timeline is optimistic.\n\nThese persistent delays were a primary driver behind the 2015 decision to restart production of the Tu-160 as the modernized Tu-160M2, a crucial stopgap measure to ensure Russia\u2019s Long-Range Aviation branch did not suffer a critical capability gap while awaiting the PAK DA.\n\nAnatomy of the \u2018Poslannik\u2019: Technical Specifications and Core Technologies\n\nAirframe and Design Philosophy \u2013 The PAK DA is based on a \u201cflying wing\u201d aerodynamic configuration, a design inherently suited for reducing an aircraft\u2019s radar cross-section (RCS) by eliminating the large, reflective vertical and horizontal tail surfaces of a traditional airframe.\n\nRenderings and mock-ups depict a design featuring blended wing-body construction, with engine intakes seamlessly integrated into the upper fuselage to shield them from ground-based radar.\n\nThe design is heavily inspired by the U.S. B-2 Spirit and B-21 Raider, which have established the flying wing as the optimal shape for a penetrating stealth bomber.\n\nThe following table consolidates the most frequently cited projected specifications for the PAK DA, drawn from a combination of official statements, state media reports, and expert analysis.\n\nCharacteristic Projected Specification Design Subsonic Flying Wing Crew 4 Max Takeoff Weight 145 tonnes Payload Capacity 30-35 tonnes Propulsion 2 x \u201cIzdeliye RF\u201d / NK32-02 derivative turbofans Speed Subsonic, ~800 km/h (Mach 0.65) cruise Range 12,000 km \u2013 15,000 km Endurance Up to 30 hours Service Ceiling ~20,000 m (65,600 ft)\n\nPropulsion: The \u2018Izdeliye RF\u2019 Engine\n\nPowering the PAK DA is a new engine, reportedly designated \u201cIzdeliye RF\u201d (Product RF), developed by the UEC-Kuznetsov company.\n\nThis powerplant is understood to be a non-afterburning derivative of the powerful NK-32 Tier 2 engine used on the modernized Tu-160M2 bomber, but heavily optimized for subsonic fuel efficiency to achieve the bomber\u2019s demanding range and endurance requirements.\n\nDevelopment has been underway for several years, with reports of prototypes beginning bench tests in late 2020 and continuing through 2022.\n\nKey design goals for the engine are not only performance but also extreme resilience, with specifications calling for a long service life of 12 to 21 years and the ability to operate in harsh environments and withstand the electromagnetic and thermal effects of a nuclear explosion.\n\nThe Stealth Conundrum: Coatings vs. Composites\n\nA critical examination of Russia\u2019s approach to stealth technology reveals what may be the PAK DA\u2019s most significant vulnerability. Abundant evidence suggests that Russian industry continues to rely on applying external radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and appliques to an aircraft\u2019s surface after the primary structure is built.\n\nThis technique stands in stark contrast to the more advanced and effective Western method, used in platforms like the B-2 and B-21, where stealth properties are \u201cbaked in\u201d to the airframe itself through the use of specialized, structurally integrated composite materials.\n\nThis technological gap is a core challenge for the PAK DA program.\n\nExternal coatings are generally less effective across the broad spectrum of radar frequencies, less durable in harsh operational conditions, and create significant, time-consuming maintenance burdens\u2014all factors that could compromise the bomber\u2019s survivability and operational availability.\n\n\u201cSixth-Generation\u201d Aspirations: Avionics, EW, and AI\n\nDespite these underlying technological challenges, the PAK DA is being officially marketed by Russia as a \u201csixth-generation\u201d platform.\n\nThis branding is used to associate the bomber with a suite of next-generation capabilities. These include claims of a highly automated cockpit to reduce crew workload, a powerful new electronic warfare (EW) suite designed to jam and suppress enemy air defenses, and full network-centric warfare capabilities allowing it to share data across the battlespace.12\n\nMore speculative claims about its future potential include the ability for unmanned operation, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for mission management, \u201cloyal wingman\u201d drone-teaming, and even the future installation of directed-energy laser weapons for defense or anti-satellite missions.\n\nThe stark contrast between these ambitious \u201csixth-generation\u201d claims and Russia\u2019s documented struggles with fundamental \u201cfifth-generation\u201d technologies, such as integrated stealth composites, suggests a significant propaganda dimension to the PAK DA program. The \u201csixth-gen\u201d label appears to be a strategic messaging tool aimed at projecting technological parity with the American B-21 Raider, regardless of the underlying technical reality.\n\nThe Standoff Arsenal: Armament, Mission Profile, and Strategic Role\n\nDoctrine of the Standoff Bomber \u2013 The PAK DA\u2019s design and intended armament point toward a primary mission profile as a long-range, high-payload \u201cmissile truck\u201d.\n\nIts operational concept appears to de-emphasize deep penetration into heavily contested airspace, a mission reserved for platforms with assured, all-aspect stealth like the B-21. Instead, the PAK DA is designed to operate from the relative safety of permissive or semi-permissive airspace, using its vast payload and long range to launch salvos of advanced standoff weapons from hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.\n\nThis doctrine is a direct reflection of the potential limitations in its own stealth capabilities; it leverages Russia\u2019s acknowledged strengths in advanced missile technology to compensate for potential weaknesses in stealth airframe manufacturing.\n\nThe survivability of the mission is thus transferred from the platform itself to the long-range, high-speed weapons it carries.\n\nA Formidable Internal Payload\n\nA defining feature of the PAK DA is its massive internal weapons bay, designed to accommodate a payload of 30 to 35 tonnes. This capacity significantly exceeds that of the B-2 Spirit (approx. 20 tonnes) and the B-21 Raider (projected at approx. 15 tonnes), allowing the PAK DA to carry an unparalleled arsenal of Russia\u2019s most advanced strategic munitions.\n\nWeapon Category Specific Munitions (estimated based on current data available Hypersonic Missiles Kh-47M2 Kinzhal derivatives; Kh-95 (newly developed for PAK DA) Long-Range Cruise Missiles Kh-101/Kh-102 (conventional/nuclear stealthy cruise missiles); Kh-555; new Kh-BD (reported 6,500 km range) Precision-Guided Bombs Various guided bombs for conventional strike Self-Defense Missiles Reports indicate the planned inclusion of air-to-air missiles, a departure from previous Russian bomber designs\n\nSpeculative Missions: Anti-Satellite (ASAT) and Space Control\n\nAdding a potentially destabilizing dimension to its strategic role are reports that the PAK DA could be tasked with counter-space missions.\n\nThis capability could manifest in several ways, from launching kinetic direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missiles to employing onboard directed-energy weapons, such as lasers, to \u201cdazzle\u201d or permanently disable the sensitive optical sensors of low-earth orbit (LEO) reconnaissance and communication satellites.\n\nIf realized, this would transform the PAK DA from a purely terrestrial strike platform into a tool of space warfare, capable of blinding an adversary\u2019s critical space-based intelligence and communication networks at the outset of a conflict.\n\nA Program Under Siege: Sanctions, Industrial Limits, and the Shadow of War\n\nThe Sanctions Bite \u2013 The PAK DA program has been developing under the shadow of Western sanctions for its entire existence, with restrictions intensifying dramatically following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions have severely restricted Russia\u2019s access to the critical dual-use technologies indispensable for a modern aerospace program.\n\nThis includes high-performance microelectronics and processors for avionics and flight control computers, precision machine tools required for manufacturing components to exacting tolerances, and the precursor chemicals and materials needed to produce advanced composites and radar-absorbent coatings.\n\nWhile Russia has sought to circumvent these restrictions through alternative sourcing and developing indigenous substitutes, the sanctions have undeniably slowed progress and limited the technological ceiling of the program.\n\nRussia\u2019s Ailing Industrial Base \u2013 Beyond external pressures, the program is hampered by long-standing internal weaknesses within Russia\u2019s defense-industrial base. Key design bureaus like Tupolev have suffered from a \u201cbrain drain\u201d and a shortage of engineers with the highly specialized skills needed for a project of this complexity, particularly in areas like flight control software for an unstable flying wing design.\n\nFurthermore, production facilities, including the Kazan Aircraft Plant (KAPO) designated for final assembly and the Kuznetsov engine plant, reportedly suffer from outdated machinery and shortfalls in the resources needed for series production of such an advanced aircraft.\n\nThe Paradox of the Ukraine War \u2013 The ongoing war in Ukraine has created a dual, conflicting pressure on the PAK DA program. On one hand, the conflict has dramatically increased the urgency for the bomber. Successful Ukrainian drone strikes on airbases deep inside Russia have exposed the vulnerability of the legacy Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bomber fleets, highlighting the critical need for a more survivable, modern strategic platform.\n\nOn the other hand, the war is consuming a vast proportion of Russia\u2019s defense budget, industrial capacity, and material resources, diverting them away from long-term, capital-intensive R&D projects like the PAK DA toward the immediate needs of the battlefield.\n\nThe program is thus caught in a vicious cycle: the very events that prove its necessity are the same events that make its timely completion less likely by strangling the required resources. This strategic trap poses a significant long-term challenge to the modernization of Russia\u2019s strategic air arm.\n\nThe Competitive Landscape: A Tri-Polar Bomber Race\n\nPAK DA vs. B-21 Raider: A Clash of Philosophies \u2013 A direct comparison between the PAK DA and its primary American competitor, the B-21 Raider, reveals two fundamentally different approaches to the challenge of 21st-century strategic strike.\n\nThe B-21 Raider is conceived as a true penetrating strike platform. Its design prioritizes all-aspect, broadband stealth and an advanced sensor suite, enabling it to survive deep within the most heavily defended enemy airspace. This allows it to deliver smaller, more numerous, and less expensive direct-attack munitions with high precision, making it a cost-effective tool for dismantling an enemy\u2019s warfighting infrastructure from within.\n\nThe PAK DA, in contrast, is emerging as a standoff strike platform. Its design prioritizes immense payload capacity and intercontinental range. It is intended to function as a survivable \u201cmagazine,\u201d launching hypersonic and very-long-range cruise missiles from the periphery of contested airspace.\n\nThis doctrine leverages Russia\u2019s lead in missile technology to hold targets at risk without requiring the bomber itself to face the most advanced layers of enemy air defense.\n\nComparative Metric Tupolev PAK DA (Projected) Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider (Projected) Primary Doctrine Standoff Missile Carrier Penetrating Striker Payload Capacity 30-35 tonnes ~15 tonnes Key Armament Hypersonic Missiles, Long-Range Cruise Missiles Direct-Attack Bombs, Standoff Munitions Stealth Technology External RAM Coatings/Appliques Integrated Structural Composites Development Status Prototype Construction, Delayed Flight Testing, Initial Production\n\nStrategic Implications for NATO and Global Security\n\nThe introduction of a hypersonic-armed PAK DA would significantly alter the strategic threat landscape. Hypersonic weapons, with their combination of extreme speed and maneuverability, compress defensive decision-making timelines and challenge the effectiveness of existing missile defense architectures.\n\nEven a small fleet of PAK DAs, operating as part of a modernized nuclear triad alongside the Tu-160M2 and new generations of ICBMs and SLBMs, would provide Russia with a more flexible, survivable, and potent strategic deterrent.\n\nOutlook: A Future Threat or a Paper Plane?\n\nSynthesizing Potential and Pitfalls \u2013 The Tupolev PAK DA program is a study in contrasts. On paper, it represents a formidable future threat: a long-range, high-endurance bomber with an enormous payload of Russia\u2019s most advanced conventional and nuclear standoff weapons. In practice, its development is beset by profound and persistent challenges spanning technology, industrial capacity, and geopolitics.\n\nThe reality of the PAK DA is likely to fall somewhere between the Kremlin\u2019s ambitious proclamations and the most skeptical Western assessments. It is neither a guaranteed super-weapon nor mere \u201cvaporware.\u201d\n\nA Realistic Projection \u2013 The official timeline projecting serial production by 2027-2030 appears highly improbable given the program\u2019s history of delays and the compounding pressures of sanctions and war. A more realistic scenario involves a continued, slow-burn development cycle, with a potential entry into service in very limited numbers in the mid-to-late 2030s. The most likely outcome is not a one-for-one replacement of the entire legacy fleet, but rather the production of a small, elite squadron of PAK DA bombers.\n\nThese aircraft would serve as a niche, high-end capability reserved for the most critical strategic tasks, while modernized Tu-160M2s and life-extended Tu-95s continue to form the backbone of Russia\u2019s Long-Range Aviation for the foreseeable future.\n\nFinal Assessment\n\nThe PAK DA Poslannik is the physical embodiment of Russia\u2019s 21st-century strategic ambitions and its accompanying limitations.\n\nWhile its final form, operational numbers, and ultimate service entry date remain shrouded in uncertainty, the doctrine it represents is clear and enduring.\n\nRussia\u2019s strategic aviation is firmly committed to a future centered on long-range, high-speed standoff attack. Therefore, Western defense planners must prepare for the advanced weapon systems the PAK DA is designed to carry\u2014particularly long-range cruise and hypersonic missiles\u2014even if the bomber platform itself remains a distant and uncertain prospect.\n\nIn the modern strategic equation, the threat is increasingly defined by the missile as much as, if not more than, the plane that carries it.\n\nAbout the Author: Harry J.

        "text": "F-35A Introduction: More Than a Fighter\n\nThe Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II is not merely a new fighter jet; it represents a fundamental, and fiercely debated, paradigm shift in air power doctrine.\n\nIt is simultaneously the technological centerpiece of 21st-century global security for the United States and its allies and a case study in the immense complexities, costs, and controversies of modern defense procurement.\n\nConceived to replace a vast and aging array of legacy aircraft with a single, versatile family of fighters, its journey from concept to combat readiness has been defined by both revolutionary innovation and persistent challenges.\n\nThis report provides an exhaustive analysis of the F-35A, arguing that its strategic value is derived not from traditional metrics of fighter performance but from its revolutionary capabilities as a networked, stealthy sensor node.\n\nThis technological ambition, however, has come at the cost of its foundational goal of affordability.\n\nThis has created a persistent tension between its immense potential and its practical, real-world challenges, including cost, reliability, and sustainment, that will define its legacy.\n\nThe Genesis of a Global Workhorse: The Joint Strike Fighter Program\n\nThe Strategic Imperative: Replacing an Aging and Disparate Fleet\n\nThe origins of the F-35 lie in the strategic realities of the post-Cold War era.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) faced the daunting task of replacing a wide range of specialized, aging aircraft across its services.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force needed a successor to its workhorse, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the venerable A-10 Thunderbolt II, a close air support aircraft.\n\nThe U.S. Navy required a replacement for its carrier-based F/A-18 Hornet variants, while the Marine Corps needed to replace its unique AV-8B Harrier vertical takeoff jets and its own F/A-18s. Key allies, like the United Kingdom, faced similar block obsolescence with their Harrier and Tornado fleets.\n\nThe prospect of developing, procuring, and sustaining separate, bespoke aircraft for each of these roles was deemed financially unsustainable. This reality was underscored by the 1991 cancellation of the Navy\u2019s A-12 Avenger II stealth attack aircraft program due to severe cost and schedule overruns, which created a critical capability gap and served as a powerful catalyst for a new, joint approach to aircraft development.\n\nFrom CALF and JAST to JSF: The Birth of a Megaproject\n\nThe solution that emerged was the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, formed from the merger of two preceding initiatives.\n\nThe first was the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF), a DARPA-led project initially focused on developing a Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps, which the Air Force later joined to seek a replacement for the F-16. The second was the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program, established in 1993 to develop common aircraft, weapons, and sensor technologies for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.\n\nA key philosophical shift of the JAST/JSF program was to treat cost as a variable independent of other factors.\n\nLearning from the failures of past programs where performance requirements drove costs to unsustainable levels, the JSF program involved warfighters early in the design process to make crucial trade-offs between capability and cost. This was a direct attempt to avoid the pitfalls of earlier joint programs, such as the 1960s TFX, which attempted to build a universal airplane that ultimately performed poorly for all its intended users.\n\nHowever, this very ambition of creating a single platform to meet the disparate needs of three services\u2014a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) version for the Air Force, a STOVL version for the Marines, and a carrier-based version for the Navy\u2014introduced immense technical complexity that would ultimately challenge its core goal. The engineering solution for the F-35B\u2019s vertical lift system, a complex shaft-driven lift fan, dictated a wider fuselage cross-section.\n\nThis fundamental design constraint was inherited by the F-35A, making it physically larger and less aerodynamically optimized than a pure CTOL design might have been. This compromise, driven by the \u201cjoint\u201d requirement, added weight and complexity across the entire aircraft family, which directly translated into higher manufacturing and operational costs, creating a paradox where the pursuit of \u201cjointness\u201d undermined the foundational goal of \u201caffordability.\u201d\n\nThe X-Plane Fly-Off: Lockheed Martin\u2019s X-35 vs. Boeing\u2019s X-32\n\nIn November 1996, the DoD awarded contracts to two industry teams, led by Lockheed Martin and Boeing, to build and fly concept demonstrator aircraft. Lockheed Martin proposed the X-35, which featured a more conventional fighter design and a novel, separate shaft-driven lift fan for its STOVL variant. This system proved to be a more robust and lower-risk solution for vertical flight.\n\nBoeing\u2019s X-32 was a more radical design, featuring a large, single-piece delta wing and a direct-lift engine configuration that required complex reconfiguration for STOVL flight. After a rigorous competition, the DoD announced on October 26, 2001, that Lockheed Martin\u2019s X-35 had won.\n\nThe program then advanced into the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, and the aircraft was officially designated the F-35.\n\nThe Promise of International Partnership\n\nA core tenet of the JSF program was to mitigate its enormous cost by sharing development expenses among key allies. The United Kingdom was the first and most significant partner, contributing $200 million to the concept demonstration phase alone.\n\nA consortium of other nations, including Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Norway, soon followed it.\n\nThis global enterprise was designed not only to distribute costs but also to create a vast production base, leveraging economies of scale to drive down unit prices while ensuring a high degree of interoperability among allied air forces for decades to come.\n\nAnatomy of a Networked Predator: F-35A Technical Specifications and Core Systems\n\nAirframe, Propulsion, and Kinematic Performance\n\nThe F-35A is a single-seat, single-engine fighter designed for a multitude of roles. Its performance characteristics reflect a design philosophy that prioritizes stealth, sensor integration, and situational awareness over raw kinematic performance. It is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 afterburning turbofan, the most powerful fighter engine in the world, capable of producing 43,000 pounds of thrust.\n\nThis gives the aircraft excellent acceleration and energy. While its top speed of Mach 1.6 is lower than some 4th-generation fighters it replaces, such as the F-16, this figure is achievable with a full internal weapons load.\n\nThis is a critical distinction, as legacy fighters carrying external weapons and fuel tanks suffer from significant parasitic drag that degrades their performance, a penalty the F-35A avoids in its stealth configuration.\n\nThe aircraft is also highly agile, capable of performing 9g maneuvers, putting it on par with other elite fighters.\n\nThis deliberate design trade-off is central to understanding the aircraft. The F-35A is not intended to be the fastest or highest-climbing fighter, ceding pure kinematic superiority to dedicated air-to-air platforms like the F-22 Raptor.\n\nIts true \u201cperformance\u201d is computational. Official literature consistently emphasizes capabilities like \u201csensor fusion,\u201d \u201cnetwork-enabled operations,\u201d and \u201cunprecedented situational awareness\u201d.\n\nThe aircraft is frequently described as a \u201cquarterback of the skies,\u201d a node whose primary role is to see, decide, and direct the battle, often for other assets.\n\nThe value proposition is to win a fight by employing superior information to utilize weapons from a position of advantage, making a traditional close-range dogfight\u2014where kinematics are king\u2014a scenario the F-35 is engineered to avoid entirely.\n\nJudging the F-35A on traditional fighter metrics like top speed is to misunderstand its design philosophy fundamentally; its power lies in its advanced \u201cbrain\u201d (sensors and fusion), not its \u201cbrawn\u201d (raw speed and agility).\n\nMetric Specification Primary Function Multirole Fighter Prime Contractor Lockheed Martin Power Plant Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 Thrust (with afterburner) 43,000 lbs / 191 kN Length 51.4 ft / 15.7 m Height 14.4 ft / 4.38 m Wingspan 35 ft / 10.7 m Max Takeoff Weight ~70,000 lbs / 31,800 kg Internal Fuel Capacity 18,498 lbs / 8,278 kg Max Speed (with internal load) Mach 1.6 (~1,200 mph) Combat Radius (internal fuel) >590 nm / >1,093 km Service Ceiling >50,000 ft / 15 km Max G-Rating 9.0g\n\nThe Pillars of 5th-Generation Capability\n\nThe F-35A\u2019s combat effectiveness is built on a foundation of interconnected, next-generation technologies that define it as a 5th-generation fighter.\n\nVery Low Observability (Stealth): The F-35\u2019s airframe shape, advanced composite materials, and internal weapons carriage are all meticulously designed to minimize its radar cross-section. This stealth capability is not invisibility, but rather a means to delay or deny detection by enemy air defense systems, allowing it to penetrate heavily contested airspace and engage targets before the adversary can effectively react. This is its primary survival mechanism, a departure from the speed, altitude, or armor of legacy aircraft.\n\nAdvanced Sensor Suite: The heart of the F-35 is its integrated suite of powerful electronic sensors.\n\nAN/APG-81 AESA Radar: Developed by Northrop Grumman, this Active Electronically Scanned Array radar provides remarkable long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground tracking of multiple targets. It can also function as a potent electronic warfare aperture, capable of jamming enemy radars and disrupting attacks.\n\nAN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS): This system consists of six infrared cameras mounted around the airframe to provide the pilot with a complete 360-degree spherical view of the surrounding environment. The DAS automatically detects and tracks incoming aircraft and missiles from any direction, and its imagery can be projected onto the pilot\u2019s helmet display, allowing them to effectively \u201csee through\u201d the floor of the cockpit.\n\nAN/AAQ-40 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS): Mounted internally under the aircraft\u2019s nose, the EOTS provides precision targeting capabilities without compromising the F-35\u2019s stealth profile. It combines forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and infrared search-and-track (IRST) functions, enabling long-range detection and targeting of both air and ground threats.\n\nSensor Fusion and Situational Awareness: The truly revolutionary aspect of the F-35 is not just the power of its individual sensors, but its ability to process and fuse the vast amounts of data they collect\u2014along with information piped in from off-board sources like AWACS, satellites, and other F-35s\u2014into a single, coherent, and intuitive picture of the battlespace. This fused data is displayed on the pilot\u2019s advanced helmet-mounted display, providing unprecedented situational awareness and dramatically reducing the pilot\u2019s cognitive workload, allowing them to make faster and better tactical decisions.\n\nThe Claws of the Lightning: Armament and Weapon Systems\n\n\u201cStealth Mode\u201d vs. \u201cBeast Mode\u201d: The Loadout Trade-Off\n\nThe F-35A\u2019s lethality is intrinsically linked to a critical mission trade-off between stealth and firepower. To maintain its very low observable profile, the aircraft must carry all of its fuel and weapons internally within two weapons bays. In this \u201cstealth mode,\u201d a typical loadout for a strike mission consists of two medium-range air-to-air missiles and two precision-guided air-to-ground bombs.\n\nWhen operating in less contested airspace where stealth is not the primary concern, the F-35A can utilize six external hardpoints on its wings and fuselage. This configuration, colloquially known as \u201cbeast mode,\u201d allows it to carry a much larger payload, with a maximum ordnance capacity of up to 22,000 pounds. This provides significant mission flexibility, allowing it to function as a heavy bomb truck when needed, but at the cost of its stealth characteristics.\n\nAir-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Arsenal\n\nThe F-35A is certified to carry a wide and growing array of advanced munitions from the U.S. and allied inventories.\n\nAir-to-Air: The primary beyond-visual-range (BVR) weapon is the Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile), carried internally. For close-range, within-visual-range engagements, it can carry the AIM-9X Sidewinder high-off-boresight missile on its external wingtip stations. Lockheed Martin is developing a \u201cSidekick\u201d adapter that will allow the F-35A to carry six internal AMRAAMs, increasing its BVR lethality while remaining in stealth mode.\n\nAir-to-Ground: The aircraft\u2019s strike capability is centered on precision-guided munitions. It can internally carry 2,000-pound GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and smaller GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs). Ongoing Block 4 software and hardware upgrades will integrate new weapons, including the developmental Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) for targeting enemy air defenses and the Joint Strike Missile (JSM) anti-ship missile. Critically, the F-35A was certified in October 2023 to carry the B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb, making it a dual-capable tactical aircraft.\n\nThe GAU-22/A Cannon: A Troubled History\n\nThe F-35A is the only variant with an internally mounted gun: a four-barreled 25mm GAU-22/A Gatling cannon located in the left wing root to preserve stealth. The weapon has a high rate of fire at 3,300 rounds per minute, but its ammunition capacity is extremely limited at just 180 rounds, providing only about three seconds of total firing time. The gun program has been plagued by significant issues for years.\n\nEarly testing revealed unacceptable inaccuracy, with rounds missing targets due to misalignments in the gun mounts that caused the barrel to shift during firing. Furthermore, the software symbology used for aiming in the pilot\u2019s helmet display was initially deemed \u201coperationally unusable and potentially unsafe\u201d. While the Pentagon now considers the gun \u201ceffective\u201d after software fixes and structural modifications, its limited ammunition and long-standing problems have fueled intense debate about the F-35A\u2019s suitability for the close air support (CAS) role, where a reliable and accurate gun is often considered essential.\n\nConfiguration Internal Bay Stations (4) External Stations (6) Internal Gun Total Payload Stealth Mode 2x AIM-120 AMRAAM 2x GBU-31 JDAM None 1x GAU-22/A (180 rounds) ~5,700 lbs \u201cBeast Mode\u201d 2x AIM-120 AMRAAM 2x GBU-31 JDAM 2x AIM-9X Sidewinder + Additional Bombs/Missiles 1x GAU-22/A (180 rounds) Up to 22,000 lbs\n\nFrom Test Flights to Combat Skies: Operational History and Global Deployment\n\nDevelopmental Timeline: A Long Road to Readiness\n\nThe F-35A\u2019s path from its first flight to full combat capability has been a long and arduous one, marked by both major milestones and significant setbacks. The first prototype, designated AA-1, made its maiden flight on December 15, 2006.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force officially declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the F-35A on August 2, 2016, with the 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, becoming the first combat-ready unit.\n\nThis journey was far from smooth. The program\u2019s reliance on \u201cconcurrency\u201d\u2014building production aircraft while development and testing were still ongoing\u2014led to costly retrofits when design flaws were discovered. Early in the program, significant weight problems required a major, 18-month redesign that cost billions. Software development proved to be a persistent bottleneck, pushing back timelines repeatedly.\n\nThe protracted nature of this development cycle is starkly illustrated by the fact that the decision to authorize full-rate production\u2014a milestone signifying program maturity\u2014was not made until March 12, 2024, more than 22 years after Lockheed Martin was first awarded the contract.\n\nTrial by Fire: The F-35A\u2019s First Combat Employment\n\nWhile the Israeli Air Force was the first to use any F-35 variant in combat in 2018, the U.S. Air Force\u2019s F-35A had its own trial by fire a year later. On April 30, 2019, two F-35As conducted the variant\u2019s first-ever combat employment.\n\nThe mission involved an airstrike against an entrenched Islamic State (ISIS) tunnel network and weapons cache in the Hamrin Mountains of Iraq.\n\nThe aircraft used Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) to destroy the target. This inaugural combat sortie was launched from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, as part of the F-35A\u2019s first deployment to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility.\n\nThe Global Enterprise: A Network of Operators\n\nThe F-35A is the most common variant of the Lightning II and has become a cornerstone of air power for a large and growing coalition of nations. This widespread adoption fulfills one of the JSF program\u2019s central strategic goals: ensuring deep interoperability among allied forces. Beyond the U.S. Air Force, which plans to procure 1,763 F-35As, the aircraft is operated by numerous international partners and Foreign Military Sales customers.\n\nThis global user base creates a shared logistics and training network, reinforcing the program\u2019s collaborative foundation.\n\nCountry Operating Service Aircraft (Operational/Planned) Primary Operational Bases Australia Royal Australian Air Force 72 / 72 RAAF Base Williamtown, RAAF Base Tindal Canada Royal Canadian Air Force 0 / 88 Delivery from 2026 Denmark Royal Danish Air Force 17 / 27 Skrydstrup Air Base Germany German Air Force (Luftwaffe) 0 / 35 B\u00fcchel Air Base Italy Italian Air Force 17+ / 75 Amendola Air Base, Ghedi Air Base Japan Japan Air Self-Defense Force 40+ / 105 Misawa Air Base Netherlands Royal Netherlands Air Force 39 / 52+ Leeuwarden Air Base, Volkel Air Base Norway Royal Norwegian Air Force 52 / 52 \u00d8rland Air Station, Evenes Air Station South Korea Republic of Korea Air Force 39 / 60 Cheongju Air Base United Kingdom Royal Air Force (Operates F-35B) RAF Marham\n\nThe Trillion-Dollar Fighter: A Deep Dive into F-35A Program Costs\n\nThe F-35 is the most expensive weapons system in history, and its costs are subject to intense scrutiny and frequent misunderstanding. The total cost can be broken down into three main categories: flyaway cost, operational cost, and total lifecycle cost.\n\nThe Flyaway Cost: A Story of Decline and Resurgence\n\nThe \u201cflyaway cost\u201d refers to the price of a single, finished aircraft including its engine and mission systems. This has been a major focus of the program office and Lockheed Martin. Early low-rate initial production (LRIP) lots saw F-35A costs exceeding $200 million per unit.Through significant manufacturing efficiencies and the benefits of economies of scale as production ramped up, the program successfully drove this cost down dramatically, reaching a low of approximately $78 million per aircraft in Lot 14.\n\nHowever, this downward trend has reversed. The contract for Lots 15-17 saw the average F-35A flyaway cost rise to $82.5 million.\n\nThis increase is attributed to several factors, including lower annual production quantities, persistent inflation, and the integration of more complex and capable hardware associated with the Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) upgrade, which is necessary for future capabilities.\n\nThe Cost Per Flight Hour (CPFH): A Stubborn Challenge\n\nWhile the flyaway cost is a one-time expense, the Cost Per Flight Hour (CPFH) represents the ongoing burden of operating and supporting the aircraft. This has been one of the program\u2019s most persistent and critical problems. The original, ambitious target was a CPFH of $25,000 (in 2012 dollars), which would have been comparable to the F-16 it replaces.\n\nThe reality has been far different. The actual CPFH has remained stubbornly high, with various government and independent reports citing figures ranging from $33,600 to $42,000 in different fiscal years.\n\nAccording to a 2023 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, the Air Force\u2019s annual cost to operate and sustain an individual F-35A is estimated at $6.6 million, significantly higher than its original affordability target of $4.1 million.\n\nA subsequent estimate for the 2024 Annual Cost Estimate projects this figure will rise further to $7.5 million.\n\nThis high CPFH has direct consequences, forcing the military services to fly their aircraft less than planned to stay within budget, which in turn impacts pilot proficiency and overall fleet readiness.\n\nThe Total Program Lifecycle Cost: Deconstructing the $2 Trillion Figure\n\nThe most sensational figure associated with the F-35 is its total lifecycle cost, which is now estimated to exceed $2 trillion.\n\nThis staggering number is often presented without context. It represents the total estimated cost for the entire planned U.S. procurement of nearly 2,500 aircraft across all three services, and includes all development, production, and\u2014most significantly\u2014all sustainment and operational costs over the program\u2019s entire lifespan, which is projected to run through the year 2088.\n\nThe sustainment portion alone accounts for the vast majority of this total, at an estimated $1.58 trillion.\n\nFurthermore, approximately half of the $2 trillion estimate\u2014around $1 trillion\u2014is the projected effect of inflation over this 94-year period.\n\nWhile the figure is immense, the F-35 program is one of the first to attempt such a comprehensive, cradle-to-grave cost forecast from its outset.\n\nThis has led to what can be described as an \u201caffordability shell game.\u201d The GAO has reported that the military services have managed to meet their revised \u201caffordability targets\u201d for the F-35A, but not by fundamentally reducing the aircraft\u2019s high operating costs. Instead, this has been achieved on paper through two primary administrative maneuvers. First, the services have drastically reduced the number of hours they plan to fly each jet annually; the Air Force, for instance, cut its planned F-35A flight hours at steady state by 21%, from 230 to 187 hours per year. Second, the services have increased the budget they say they can \u201cafford.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force raised its affordability target from $4.1 million per plane per year to $6.8 million. By flying less (reducing expenditures) and increasing the budget (raising the spending ceiling), the program can appear to be meeting its goals. However, this is an accounting solution, not a cost-saving one, with the dangerous third-order effect of potentially degrading pilot training and combat readiness.\n\nTrials and Tribulations: Program Challenges and Enduring Criticisms\n\nThe \u201cConcurrency\u201d Gamble: Building While Designing\n\nA core strategy of the F-35 program was \u201cconcurrency\u201d\u2014the practice of starting low-rate production before development and testing were complete. This was intended to accelerate the delivery of aircraft to the warfighter. However, the gamble proved to be enormously expensive. Design flaws and performance issues discovered in test aircraft had to be fixed not only in future designs but also retrofitted onto production jets that were already built or on the assembly line, a process that added billions to the program\u2019s cost and contributed to years of delays.\n\nReliability and Availability: The Achilles\u2019 Heel\n\nDespite being in operational service for years, the F-35 fleet has consistently failed to meet its own readiness targets. Multiple reports have shown the fleet\u2019s full mission capable rate\u2014the percentage of aircraft ready to perform any and all assigned missions at a given time\u2014to be well below its goals, with some reports citing rates of less than 50%.\n\nThe GAO has confirmed that none of the F-35 variants are meeting their availability goals. The problems are multifaceted, ranging from the stealth coating being difficult and time-consuming to maintain, to a persistent shortage of spare parts, inadequate depot capacity, and ongoing engine reliability issues.\n\nThe Software Quagmire: ALIS, ODIN, and TR-3\n\nThe F-35\u2019s advanced capabilities are defined by its software, which has proven to be one of the most complex and troubled aspects of the program. The original logistics system, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), was intended to be the digital backbone for managing the global supply chain, maintenance, and diagnostics. In practice, it was notoriously buggy, slow, and according to the Pentagon\u2019s own testing office, \u201cimpeded, rather than facilitated, effective maintenance\u201d.\n\nIts planned cloud-based replacement, the Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN), has also faced its own development stalls and funding cuts. More recently, the crucial Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) upgrade, which provides the advanced computer core and memory required for all future Block 4 capabilities, is years behind schedule due to software stability issues. This delay became so critical that it forced the Pentagon to halt deliveries of newly built F-35s for nearly a year, creating a costly backlog of completed aircraft that could not be accepted by the military.\n\nThe CAS Debate: Is the F-35A a Worthy A-10 Replacement?\n\nOne of the most heated and enduring debates surrounding the F-35A is whether it can effectively replace the legendary A-10 \u201cWarthog\u201d for the Close Air Support (CAS) mission. Critics point to the F-35A\u2019s significant disadvantages in this specific role: a smaller weapons load, very limited cannon ammunition, a lack of armor and redundant systems, and a reliance on high-altitude flight for survival. This is in stark contrast to the A-10, which was designed from the ground up to be a rugged, low-flying tank-killer that can absorb significant battle damage and bring its pilot home.\n\nComparative fly-off tests between the two aircraft, though heavily redacted, revealed that it would take more F-35 sorties to attack the same number of targets as an A-10, and that A-10 pilots demonstrated better bombing accuracy, in part because their aircraft\u2019s survivability allowed them to fly closer to the target. Proponents of the F-35A argue that in a modern, high-threat environment with advanced surface-to-air missiles, the A-10 is too vulnerable to survive, and that the F-35A\u2019s stealth and advanced sensors allow it to perform the CAS mission from a safer distance.\n\nMetric F-35A Lightning II F-16C Fighting Falcon A-10C Thunderbolt II Primary Role Multirole Stealth Fighter Multirole Fighter Close Air Support (CAS) Flyaway Cost (Approx.) $82.5 Million ~$60 Million ~$19.5 Million CPFH (Approx.) ~$35,000+ ~$25,500 ~$20,000 (Varies) Max Speed Mach 1.6 Mach 2.0+ Mach 0.75 Cannon / Ammo 1x 25mm / 180 rounds 1x 20mm / 511 rounds 1x 30mm / 1,150-1,350 rounds Key Advantage Stealth, Sensor Fusion Agility, Cost-Effectiveness Survivability, Firepower Key Disadvantage High Operating Cost, Complexity Lacks Stealth Vulnerable to Modern Air Defenses\n\nConclusion: An Analytical Outlook on the F-35A\u2019s Role in Future Air Combat\n\nThe F-35A Lightning II is a machine of profound dualities: it is at once a technological marvel and a cautionary tale of unchecked ambition. On one hand, it has successfully delivered a revolutionary capability in stealth and information dominance that will form the cornerstone of U.S. and allied air power for decades. Its ability to penetrate the most advanced air defenses and act as a \u201cseeing eye\u201d for the entire joint force is a capability that no 4th-generation aircraft can replicate. However, this was achieved by sacrificing its initial promise of affordability and by embracing a level of technological complexity that continues to challenge its day-to-day reliability and sustainment.\n\nThe ultimate success of the F-35A will not be measured in the turning performance of a dogfight, a scenario it is designed to render obsolete, but in its ability to enable and elevate the entire joint force. Its true value lies in its function as a survivable, networked sensor and shooter. The critical challenge ahead is not in its design philosophy, which has proven potent, but in the monumental task of making its operation affordable and sustainable. The program\u2019s ability to solve the deeply entrenched problems of high cost-per-flight-hour and low availability rates will determine its ultimate legacy.\n\nIt will decide whether the F-35A truly fulfills its intended role as the versatile workhorse of 21st-century air combat, or if its expense relegates it to a high-end, niche capability used more sparingly than its designers ever intended. The future of Western air dominance is inextricably linked to the answer.\n\nAbout the Author: Harry J. Kazianis\n\nHarry J.

Designed to replace a wide range of aging aircraft with a single, versatile family of fighters, the F-35A's development has been marked by revolutionary innovation and persistent challenges. Its strategic value lies in its capabilities as a networked, stealthy sensor node rather than traditional fighter performance metrics. However, this ambition has come at the cost of affordability, creating tension between its potential and practical challenges, including cost, reliability, and sustainment. The Joint Strike Fighter program, which birthed the F-35, aimed to replace disparate fleets with a unified platform, but this ambition introduced technical complexities that challenged its affordability goal. The F-35A's design prioritizes stealth, sensor integration, and situational awareness over raw kinematic performance, positioning it as a \"quarterback of the skies\" rather than a traditional dogfighter. Despite its high costs, the F-35A has become a cornerstone of air power for the U.S. and its allies, fostering interoperability among a global network of operators. However, the program's costs,",

        "text": "How Israel\u2019s version of the F-35 has made a difference in its attack on Iran\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Israel began working towards procuring F-35 jets. That country eventually gained permission to customize the jets into a version called the F-35I \u201cAdir.\u201d Israel made their first order for the jets in 2010, ordering more in 2015 and 2017.\n\nAnd now, that jet has played a key part in Israel\u2019s ongoing air campaign in Iran- something that seems to have redeemed the F-35\u2019s good name, at a time when some have questioned its continued efficacy.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that the recent strikes on Iran involved over 200 Israeli jets, some of which were the F-35I. According to BI, the strikes in Iran represent \u201cthe most difficult operations the jet has ever flown in.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli military, per BI, has not commented specifically on the missions in which the F-35 was involved. However, Justin Bronk, an airpower expert at the London-based Royal United Services Institute, told BI that every indication is that \u201cthe F-35I has been a critical and highly successful leading edge capability in the overall Israeli air campaign at every stage.\u201d\n\nCustom Jets\n\nIsrael has uniquely customized the jets.\n\n\u201cThe Israeli Air Force is the only foreign service which has gained permission to extensively customise the aircraft and integrate indigenous avionics,\u201d Military Watch Magazine said in an analysis published this week.\n\n\u201cThis was insisted on by the Israeli Defence Ministry largely due to concerns that the F-35\u2019s stealth capabilities could not be relied on exclusively to ensure the aircraft\u2019s survivability, as improvements in radar, infrared tracking, and data sharing technologies would over the fighter\u2019s lifetime increase adversaries\u2019 ability to target it.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Haaretz reported at the time, Israel launched the first-ever air strike using an F-35 stealth fighter, during that year\u2019s war in Gaza, in which Iran was also involved.\n\nNo Tank Support Needed?\n\nMeanwhile, a report from The Aviationist stated that those modifications may have made it possible to strike Iran without tanker support.\n\nThe Aviationist had previously reported that Israel had a \u201cdesire\u201d to modify the jets for \u201cextended range capabilities through additional fuel tanks,\u201d although it\u2019s not confirmed that Israel has done so successfully. Israel had claimed in 2022 that its F-35 fleet was capable of reaching Iran without refueling, although it\u2019s not clear if that benchmark has been achieved.\n\nF-35 Mocked by Musk\n\nDoubts have been raised about the continuing effectiveness of the F-35 in the age of drone warfare, including by Elon Musk.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, Musk, back in November, ripped the F-35 as \u201cobsolete\u201d and a \u201cjack of all trades, master of none.\u201d Those comments came at a time, during the presidential transition, when it looked like Musk was going to be a major decision maker in the second Trump Administration, which he was, for what turned out to be a brief time.\n\nNewsweek argues that Israel\u2019s usage of the jets in the Iran campaign has proved Musk wrong.\n\n\u201cDuring Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive against Iran, F-35I Adir fighters\u2014Israel\u2019s variant of the American-made stealth jet\u2014have executed dozens of long-range strikes against fortified air defense systems, missile sites, and nuclear facilities. Israeli officials say the aircraft flew deep into Iranian territory, encountered little resistance, and returned without a single recorded loss,\u201d Newsweek said.\n\n\u201cThose who suggest that uncrewed systems alone can replace what fighter aircraft do fundamentally do not understand what makes them such a flexible and potentially decisive military tool,\u201d Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told Newsweek.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to simulate uncrewed aircraft doing dogfighting in a clean, test environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another to trust them in the electromagnetic chaos of modern combat, where jamming, deception, and dense airspace demand flexibility.\u201d\n\nAbout the Author\n\nStephen Silver is an award-winning journalist, essayist, and film critic, and contributor to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Broad Street Review and Splice Today.

        "text": "Key Points \u2013 Vladimir Putin is highly unlikely to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, despite his threatening rhetoric and updated nuclear doctrine.\n\n-The primary constraints are the risk of looking desperate to his own people and, crucially, alienating key partners like China, which has repeatedly warned against nuclear escalation.\n\n-Instead, Russia\u2019s strategy has devolved into a war of attrition, relying on overwhelming Ukraine with mass conventional strikes from its vast arsenal of drones and missiles.\n\n-Therefore, the most effective strategy to contain Russia is not fearing its nuclear bluff but continuing to bolster Ukraine\u2019s layered and innovative air defense systems to neutralize these conventional attacks.\n\nVlad Won\u2019t Nuke Ukraine, But Air Defenses Vital to Containment\n\nSunday\u2019s barrage of 499 one-way attack drones and missiles launched by Russia against Ukraine was yet more retaliation by Putin for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cOperation Spiderweb\u201d strategic attack on Russian bombers and bases.\n\nThe volleys have gone from nights with 350 drones and missiles in late May to the 479 launches on May 31 and now the peak of 499.\n\nIn this chapter of the war, containing Russia depends on air defenses. Mixed packages of drones and missiles have become Putin\u2019s weapon of choice. The pattern for the big salvos has been to expend a few dozen missiles combined with hundreds of drones. A few missiles are air-launched; for example, a MiG-31K flung out a Kinzhal missile in one of the June attacks.\n\nNuclear Escalation\n\nPutin is walloping Ukraine in part because he does not dare use nuclear weapons.\n\nOf course, Putin wants the world rattled by his nuclear weapons. In September 2024, Putin oversaw a nuclear doctrine change, seemingly giving himself three new scenarios for using nuclear weapons. The first new condition was that \u201caggression against Russia from any non-nuclear state but involving or supported by any nuclear state\u201d would be treated like a joint attack. That tried to tie in NATO nuclear nations Britain, France, and the US.\n\nThe second new condition was a threat of launch on warning, specifically, \u201cUpon receipt of reliable information of a massive launch of air and space attack weapons and their crossing of the state border.\u201d Condition three declared that \u201cthe case when the enemy, using conventional weapons, creates a critical threat to our sovereignty\u201d would justify Russian nuclear retaliation.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Defense\n\nYet these updates actually left Putin plenty of off-ramps. Notice Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was scrupulous in his claim that Ukraine acted alone in crafting and carrying out the June 1 drone strike on Russia.\n\nDespite the doctrinal update, Putin\u2019s hands are tied regarding nuclear retaliation. He can\u2019t risk using a tactical nuclear weapon because it will make him look desperate in the eyes of the Russian people\u2014and China. Putin\u2019s response so far has been to launch mass drone attacks and label the airbase attacks as terrorism. This is a proven narrative, echoing Putin\u2019s war against the Chechens, which solidified his political power in 2000. Putin downplayed Ukraine\u2019s invasion of the Kursk region last year with similar language. His war mythology portrays Russia as \u201cwinning\u201d even as the number of casualties mounts.\n\nPutin Against a Chinese Wall\n\nBeyond this, Putin has known for years that China will not tolerate the use of tactical nuclear weapons. China is the top dog in the \u201cunlimited friendship,\u201d and Xi Jinping also warned Putin to knock off the nuclear threats as far back as November 4, 2022. A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, DC, repeated the warning about \u201cno escalation\u201d last week.\n\nRussia\u2019s Big Missile Threat\n\nWith nukes off the table, Putin has invested in the rapid production of drones to carry out mass conventional attacks.\n\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has a stockpile of over 13,000 missiles, including roughly 11,000 missiles for the S-300/400 air defense systems, which Russia has already used in ground attack mode. Add in 600 Iskander ballistic missiles and an estimated 1,700 cruise missiles, including the air-launched Kalibr cruise missiles, ground-launched Oniks, and others. At this rate, Putin can fire missiles at Ukraine for years as long as Russia can keep producing drones.\n\nBy far, the most considerable volume by type comes from the Shahed 136/131 drones of Iran\u2019s design. Russia produces Shahed drones at several locations. Near one factory, a freight train from China reportedly delivers drone engine parts each week.\n\n\u201cRussia is willing to sustain the high costs of a prolonged war in Ukraine,\u201d SACEUR Gen. Christopher Cavoli warned in his April testimony. \u201cNow entangled in an extended, largescale war, the Russian regime has refashioned its military, economic, and social structures to sustain what it describes as a long-term confrontation with the West\u2014systemic changes that illustrate Russia\u2019s intention to confront us into the foreseeable future,\u201d Cavoli said. He estimated Russia can produce 250 Iskanders per year.\n\nUkrainian intelligence says Putin aims to set a buffer zone along the border and reignite a land drive for Kyiv in 2026. Whatever Putin\u2019s gameplan, air defense for Ukraine, including its air force bases and energy infrastructure, is essential. The combination of the long-range Patriots, short-range NASAMs, and many other systems has enabled Ukraine to shoot down the majority of the weapons in Russia\u2019s attacks. The Frankensam conversion of the Soviet-era Sa-11 Gadfly launcher, which fires US-made AIM-7 type Sparrow air-to-air missiles, is one improvisational success. Air defense over Ukraine will remain paramount in containing Putin.\n\nAbout the Author: Dr. Rebecca Grant\n\nDr. Rebecca Grant, a Vice President at the Lexington Institute, is a national security analyst based in Washington, DC, specializing in defense and aerospace research and national security consulting.

        "text": "As Sir Niall Ferguson has written, it is far too easy to ridicule President Trump and his Administration\u2019s statements and policies on Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. Worse yet, Trump and those around him continue to make statements showing a failure to grasp the most elementary aspects of this war, e.g., that it is a war of aggression started by Vladimir Putin.\n\nBeyond Ukraine: Russia Hides Imperialistic Demands\n\nNevertheless, those of us who believe this war engages the vital interests of the US and its European allies must continue to attack the \u201cmass mind\u201d of those who have argued that this is not our war or that Ukraine \u201chas no cards,\u201d or that it cannot win. Neither is it worth waiting for Vladimir Putin to indicate whether or not he will negotiate in good faith.\n\nHere again, the answer is evident to all, for at the most recent session of \u201ctalks\u201d with Ukraine, the Russian delegation presented what amounts to an ultimatum going beyond what it proposed at the original session. It demanded privileged rights for the Russian Orthodox Church, a centuries-old avatar of the Russian state\u2019s imperialism, the Russian language, and elections as if Ukraine were a conquered province. Indeed, American officials expected this presentation.\n\nTherefore, once again, we must endeavor to set the record straight. First, this is not only a war of aggression. Instead, it is an attempted genocide, and one cannot negotiate with genocidaires. The abduction of at least twenty thousand Ukrainian children, another centuries-old Russian tactic in war, indicates Putin\u2019s true aims. Allowing such tactics to continue without punishment invites not just more foreign wars but also more genocides, i.e., not a destruction of the international order but of the fundamental global moral order.\n\nAnd if we speak the complex, cold language of Realpolitik, it is no less vital from the standpoint of our geostrategic interests that Russia be defeated. Moscow, despite being fully engaged with Ukraine, is now demanding the stationing of 10,000 troops in Moldova\u2019s breakaway Transnistria province that it controls while also trying to destabilize Moldova\u2019s elections and intimidate it into surrender.\n\nWere Moscow successful in achieving these results in Moldova, a territory that it has long coveted, it would hardly stop trying to increase its imperial reach at the expense of the Balkan states and European security more generally. Even as Russia launched its campaign of intimidation against Moldova, it interfered a great deal in Bulgaria, which has undergone eight elections in the last five years, in no small measure due to Russian influence activities.\n\nExpansion Plans\n\nNeither is the Russian threat confined to the Balkans. Numerous European governments and intelligence agencies have publicly voiced fears that because Russia has militarized its economy and government, within two-to-10 years, notwithstanding whatever the results of the present war are, Russia will be ready to attack them.\n\nEven as our allies are now making visible progress towards enhancing defense capabilities, it is clear that it will take years of careful execution of their defense plans for Europe to be able to defend itself without US participation, assuming that to be the goal of the Administration. In other words, for the better part of the next decade, if not longer, we must be engaged, even if our role diminishes, in the defense of Europe.\n\nSince we fought two world wars and the Cold War primarily to liberate Europe from the threat of authoritarian imperialism and geography has not changed, the defense of America against a recrudescence of that threat remains among our most vital interests.\n\nThis has been a vital interest since the days of the founding fathers, as any study of Washington\u2019s foreign policy can tell us. Thomas Jefferson warned, for example, that a European empire would make England a \u201cbreakfast for Bonaparte\u201d and a threat to the fledgling US. Today, allowing Ukraine to become Putin\u2019s lunch would similarly threaten all of Europe and call the utility and viability of NATO into question.\n\nBut the threat does not end there. Even if China is the primary and pacing threat to the US. The best and cheapest way to thwart and deter the China threat is to beat Russia, i.e., offer Ukraine constant and unstinting support even as we rebuild our defenses.\n\nTestifying before the US-China Commission, Elena Rybakova reported that without Chinese support, Russia could not afford to fight this war. Additionally, Russia would lack the necessary technology to conduct such operations. Towards the end of the Biden Administration, Secretary of State Blinken remarked about Chinese components, \u201cThose are being used to help Russia on what\u2019s an extraordinary crash course effort to make more munitions, tanks, armored vehicles, missiles. About 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports come from China.\u201d\n\nThus, this war is arguably, fast becoming a proxy war for China against the West and a \u201creconnaissance in force\u201d to probe the extent of Western fortitude, military and diplomatic capabilities. Therefore, the argument that Ukraine should be discarded in favor of strong anti-Chinese deterrence falls to the ground. Not only are we and our allies sufficiently capable, if motivated, to deter both Beijing and Moscow, beating Russia is arguably the best way to beat Beijing.\n\nTrump and his team may persist in their delusions about not pressuring Putin, but if they do, they will soon confront a two-front challenge of even grander proportions than is now the case. And they will not be able to claim that they were not warned.\n\nAbout the Author: Dr. Stephen Blank\n\nDr. Stephen J.

        "text": "Key Points \u2013 The Su-57E, Russia\u2019s export variant of its Su-57 \u201cFelon\u201d stealth fighter offered to India, differs significantly from the domestic Russian version through deep customization aimed at New Delhi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d policy.\n\n-The most crucial difference is Russia\u2019s unprecedented offer of full access to the aircraft\u2019s source code, allowing India to integrate its own domestic avionics, such as a main mission computer, and weapon systems like the Astra and Rudram missiles.\n\n-The Su-57E also features an advanced AESA radar with GaN technology, though its performance may be subject to Russian export restrictions. This tailored approach contrasts sharply with typical Western export models.\n\nSu-57 Fighter Variants: What are the Differences?\n\nOn June 4, Russia\u2019s United Aircraft Corporation (OAK) raised the ante in the Indian fighter aircraft competition by making an offer to sell the next-generation aircraft to the Indian Air Force (IAF). This entry, however, is not the first time that Russia has made an effort to make India a major customer of this program.\n\nPreviously, in 2016, the program was known as the T-50 or PAK-FA, an acronym for its Russian program and prototype development phase. At the time, India had entered into the first stage of cooperation with Russia on this aircraft, with the version for India to be called the Future Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) by the Indian Air Force (IAF).\n\nNew Delhi later withdrew from the cooperative agreement after the IAF had complained for two years about differences with Russia on several program details. These included cost-sharing plans, technology transfers, and the aircraft\u2019s other technological shortcomings from India\u2019s perspective. The aircraft India wanted would have been an almost entirely different version and would also have been a two-seat platform rather than a single-seat fighter.\n\nSo, almost a decade later, Russia is back offering India a similar\u2014but not the same\u2014aircraft that shares the same shape and basic performance as the Sukhoi Su-57. But it is instead called \u201cSu-57E\u201d.\n\nWhat is it about that jet that would make India reconsider this program after previously rejecting it? How does the \u201cE\u201d model differ from the baseline Su-57?\n\nPotential Su-57E Customers\n\nThe \u201cE\u201d suffix in the Su-57E designator literally means \u201cexport,\u201d but there is the reality that there are a limited number of countries that Moscow would offer this fighter to for sale.\n\nThat means that the Su-57E does not have to be designed and configured like a United States export F-16\u2014an aircraft that could be \u201call things to all people.\u201d\n\nInstead, it can be tailored to be sold to and built by a partner nation, with India being the most likely customer to fit the bill. In addition to India, discussions have been held about selling the aircraft to Algeria and possibly Iran.\n\nHowever, India is probably the only nation that has the industrial capacity on a scale that could both support this aircraft and potentially engage in a license-production agreement. India has already produced close to 300 Su-30MKIs at its aircraft assembly plant in Nashik, and these Indian-built aircraft contain progressively more locally made content.\n\nThe only potential candidate with a comparable level of industrial capacity would be the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). However, Beijing has shown no interest in the Su-57E aircraft and is instead focusing on the production of its own indigenously developed next-generation fighters.\n\nThe Su-57E, as offered to India, would be procured using a very similar template. The aircraft would be modified and built in India, following this model for cooperation.\n\nHow is the Su-57E Different?\n\nNoticeable differences in the Su-57E as developed for India and the baseline model produced for the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) are significant, with the major points being:\n\n\u2013 Russia, in its latest offer to India for the Su-57E, has agreed to give India full access to the source code of the software modules that are used in the aircraft. This will give India the ability to integrate any weapons it wants onto the airframe. Su-57Es are, therefore, likely to be carrying a considerable number of non-Russian weapons.\n\nOne report on the Su-57E points out that \u201cIndian officials note this [source code] latitude eclipses anything previously granted by Western suppliers. The offer collides head-on with Washington\u2019s rival F-35A [for India] pitch, sharpening Indo-Pacific rivalry.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Indian-made avionics and other onboard systems will replace Russia-made hardware in the Su-57E. This would include an Indian Main Mission Computer (MMC) and other hardware that would again mirror the type and number of India-produced components that are installed in the Su-30MKI. The use of so many Indian-made systems is important politically so that Moscow is compliant with New Delhi\u2019s mandated \u201cMake-in-India\u201d requirement in its weapon systems procurement processes.\n\n\u2013 The Su-57E features low observability modifications to the surface of the aircraft, supercruise capacity, plus advanced sensor fusion. The version being proposed to India also includes an Active Electronically-Scanning Array (AESA) radar based on Gallium Nitride (GaN) Transmit and Receive Modules (TRMs). The TRMs may be software-limited in their terms of range and the variety of modes, as they must comply with Russian export restrictions.\n\n\u2013 The Su-57E would also employ Indian-designed munitions such as the Astra Mk1 and Mk2 beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles, the Rudram anti-radiation missile, and an indigenously-produced precision-guided air-to-ground weapons. India\u2019s goal here is to reduce its dependency on foreign-supplied weaponry.\n\nOne of the rationales behind the Su-57E appears to be that the use of foreign-made onboard systems and weapons in the export version provides some relief for the Russian industry. OAK has its own troubles building enough of the aircraft to meet Moscow\u2019s own requirements.\n\nUsing an export customer to build a significant number of onboard systems enables Russia to sell the aircraft abroad in quantities that its own industry would not be capable of achieving on its own.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nReuben F.

Moscow offered India the Su-57E stealth fighter and full access to its source code.\n\nProviding India with this access would enable it to integrate home-grown avionics and weapons under its \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative. Indian officials note this latitude eclipses anything previously granted by Western suppliers. The offer collides head-on with Washington\u2019s rival F-35A pitch, sharpening Indo-Pacific rivalry.\n\nMeet Russia\u2019s Su-57E\n\nRussia\u2019s Su-57 Felon, its first fifth-generation fighter, blends stealth features with traditional Russian emphasis on supermaneuverability for close-quarters combat.\n\nThe Felon incorporates design elements such as internal weapons bays and radar-absorbent materials to reduce its frontal radar cross-section; however, its overall stealth, particularly from the rear, is considered significantly inferior to that of US counterparts like the F-22 and F-35.\n\nThe Su-57 has been used sparingly in the war against Ukrainian defenses, primarily as a long-range strike aircraft rather than a dogfighter, which would have subjected it to Ukrainian anti-aircraft defenses.\n\nProduction has been a significant issue for Russia\u2019s manufacturing industry. Thus far, they have only been able to manufacture about 20 Su-57s for the Russian Aerospace Forces. The question remains: how could they supply India with the means to deploy enough aircraft to provide their air force with the necessary number of aircraft?\n\nRussia\u2019s Bold Pitch To India\n\nRussia\u2019s offer, considered a game-changer by many experts, would allow India to customize the aircraft entirely, adding its own weapons and systems. Such deep access is rarely granted and extends far beyond what countries like the US or France typically allow when selling their fighters.\n\nIndian defense sources indicate that the Su-57E fighter jet being offered to India will feature advanced technology that matches the planned upgrades for its Su-30 MKI aircraft.\n\nThe proposed version for India includes an AESA radar utilizing Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology and an Indian-developed mission computer.\n\nMoreover, the Su-57E would be capable of operating Indian-designed munitions such as the Astra Mk1 and Mk2 beyond-visual-range missiles, Rudram anti-radiation missiles, and indigenous precision-guided air-to-ground weapons, reducing India\u2019s dependency on foreign-supplied weaponry.\n\nRussia has offered the Su-57E to a few countries with close military and strategic ties, such as Algeria, Myanmar, and Vietnam. However, thus far, no country has initiated a deal with Russia.\n\nUS Urges India to Cut Ties To Russian Aircraft Deal\n\nThe US is exerting pressure on New Delhi to curb its continued procurement of Russian defense equipment, a point of contention between India and the US that has been a leading issue since the first Donald Trump administration.\n\nUS Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on June 4 stated, while addressing the eighth U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, that President Trump had explicitly raised the issue, saying:\n\n\u201cThere were certain things that the Indian government did that generally rubbed the United States the wrong way. For instance, you generally buy your military gear from Russia. That\u2019s a way to get under the skin of America if you\u2019re going to buy your armaments from Russia.\u201d\n\nHe added that India\u2019s participation in the BRICS group, which challenged the US dollar\u2019s status in the global economy, was \u201cnot really the way to make friends and influence people in America.\u201d\n\nWhen President Trump welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House in February, he announced that the United States would make the F-35 fighter jet available to India. However, to date, India has not expressed interest in purchasing the American fighter.\n\nIt is expected that India will finalize a deal with Russia very shortly. India\u2019s small air force is reeling from losses of French-supplied Rafale fighters in early May during engagements with Pakistan\u2019s Chinese-supplied combat aircraft. It is expected to add urgency to consider Russia\u2019s Su-57 if production can be worked out for India\u2019s Air Force.\n\nThat is an issue that must be resolved as soon as possible. Russia, thus far, has only been able to supply a handful of aircraft to its own Air Force.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nSteve Balestrieri is a National Security Columnist.

        "text": "Iran is facing crunch time on its continued talks with the United States over a potential new deal regarding its nuclear program.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araqchi said on June 4 that if Iran is not allowed to continue to enrich uranium, then it would not agree to a deal with Washington. This statement came after five rounds of indirect talks with the Trump administration. Oman mediates the talks.\n\nIran\u2019s Agenda\n\nThe larger agenda of Iran in the deal talks extends beyond its nuclear program. Iran has been down this path before with the Obama administration. For Tehran, it was always about preserving its larger ambitions in the region and globally. The nuclear program is a prestige issue for Iran, as Araqchi made clear in a social media post on June 4.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s only part of the Iranian agenda. The larger agenda was laid out in May in Moscow by Ali Akbar Ahmadian, Secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council. He spoke about how \u201cnew opportunities have arisen for the creation of a new world order.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Iran or Russia have talked about a shifting global order.\n\nIn October 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, not Masoud Pezeshkian, and also spoke of a \u201cnew world order\u201d in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. Russia is the stronger partner in the Iranian-Russia relationship. However, both countries are today only part of a larger puzzle in terms of their drive for this new global order.\n\nFor instance, both are now members of BRICS, which brings together several non-Western powers in an economic bloc. In 2022, Russia\u2019s State Duma speaker suggested that Iran could become an observer at the post-Soviet Collective Security Treaty Organization, which brings together Russia and several former Soviet Republics. Iran has also joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which was founded by China in 2001 and now has ten member states.\n\nIran\u2019s global ambitions today are more clear than in the past. It has sought to entrench relations with China and Russia. It has also increased its outreach to Turkey, Pakistan, and India in recent years. As Iran shifted gears towards these countries, it also saw its influence in the Middle East weaken.\n\nFor instance, the war launched by Hamas on October 7, 2023, led Iran to encourage Hezbollah and other proxies, such as the Houthis, to strike at Israel. In this multi-front war, Israel has gained the upper hand.\n\nHezbollah was weakened and battered into a ceasefire in November 2024. The Assad regime in Syria, a key ally of Iran, fell on December 8, 2024. The Houthis continue to target Israel, but it appears a deal with the US in early May could pave the way for some de-escalation in the Red Sea.\n\nWhat matters here is that Iran is no longer on the upswing in terms of regional influence in the Middle East as it was when it signed the original JCPOA Iran deal back in 2015. Today, Iran has amicable ties with Saudi Arabia. It also sees its future in relations with countries in Asia.\n\nThis includes conducting outreach to countries with which Iran has historically had colder ties, such as Egypt. Iran\u2019s foreign minister recently flew to Cairo to strengthen those relations. What this means is that Iran is spreading its diplomatic wings outside of its role in backing Shi\u2019ite militia proxies. It\u2019s now involved in larger state-to-state relations.\n\nThis practice is prominently featured in Iranian state media, with numerous articles highlighting Iranian diplomatic outreach. For instance, Iran\u2019s president spoke with the sultan of Oman on June 4. Iran\u2019s powerful and influential Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf visited Venezuela on June 3, where he met with Venezuelan Transport Minister Ramon Velasquez. The countries have a joint economic commission, Iranian state media IRNA noted. Qalibaf also visited Cuba as part of his trip to the region and discussed strengthening ties.\n\nThe picture that is emerging is clear. Iran may be able to be more flexible on the nuclear file, as it feels it has strengthened its global ties. Although it saw the wings of its proxies clipped in the Middle East, it may feel the era of the proxies is now moving towards a kind of sunset. The proxies will remain important. However, Tehran may now feel it has the luxury and breathing space to invest in bigger plans.\n\nThis enables it to connect with markets ranging from Russia to the Persian Gulf and from China to Egypt. Iran has plans for additional north-south economic corridors, for instance, linking the Caucasus to the Gulf, as well as Central Asia to Tehran. Closer cooperation with Pakistan, which is also a friend of Turkey, could lead to ties that link Ankara to Islamabad, as well as Tehran.\n\nIn the Middle East, many countries, including traditional Western allies, are hedging their bets on this emerging new world order. What that means is that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others want to be part of non-Western economic blocs while maintaining their alliances or partnerships with the US and the West.\n\nIran wants to be well placed to exploit this, with or without a nuclear deal.\n\nAbout the Author: Seth J.

        "text": "SINGAPORE \u2013 At the May 30 through June 1 Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, senior Indian defense officials finally provided information about the early May confrontation between the Indian and Pakistani armed forces in Kashmir.\n\nIn media interviews on Saturday, May 31, India\u2019s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan admitted his Air Force had lost fighter jets on the initial day of the conflict, June 7.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is not the jet being down, but why they were being downed,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg News. \u201cWhat mistakes were made\u2014those are important. Numbers are not important. The good part is that we were able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew our jets again, targeting at long range,\u201d he explained.\n\nChauhan called Pakistan\u2019s claims that it had downed six Indian fighter aircraft \u201cabsolutely incorrect.\u201d Still, he declined to discuss any details of either the numbers or types lost in these Day One engagements.\n\nOperation Sindoor, as the Indian armed forces called it, was launched by India early on May 7 with the mission to destroy what New Delhi had labeled as \u201cnine terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\u201d\n\nThese Indian military strikes were made in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 tourists. Indian authorities have described the killings as \u201ccold-blooded\u201d murders of these tourists. Moreover, India claims they were all killed after they had been separated into groups by their religious affiliations.\n\nWhat Aircraft Were Lost\n\nEarlier in May, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif claimed his country had shot down six Indian fighter jets, three of them being the advanced French-made Dassault Rafale omnirole fighter. This claim, however, had never been independently verified.\n\nThe Indian Air Force (IAF) had previously purchased 36 of these aircraft at a cost of about US $9 billion after the aircraft had been selected as the winner of a major tender for the Medium-MultiRole Fighter Aircraft (M-MRCA) program. It is one of the most capable aircraft in IAF inventory.\n\nPakistan had sought to buttress the claim of having shot down six IAF fighters by painting up some of its Chinese-made Chengdu J-10C aircraft with \u201ckill marks\u201d on the forward fuselage below the cockpit. These silhouettes of different IAF aircraft appeared to show three Rafales, one Dassault Mirage 2000\u2014both manufactured in France\u2014and two Russian-design models: one Mikoyan MiG-29 and one Sukhoi Su-30MKI.\n\nThese kills, however, did not happen, said a long-time Indian air power expert who spoke with me. Pakistan, as he explained, is famous for \u201cdressing up their aircraft this way as part of a psychological warfare campaign\u201d\u2014an assertion made as well in Asian defense publications.\n\nThe real losses, according to this source and one other who spoke on condition of anonymity, were one Rafale, one Mirage, and one MiG-29\u2014a total of three. One of the sources said there could have possibly been a fourth\u2014an Su-30MKI\u2014lost as well \u201cas that aircraft has a fairly large radar signature,\u201d but both individuals had less confidence on that point.\n\nWhat Happened Next\n\nThe loss of a Rafale is unexpected, given the capabilities of that aircraft\u2019s electronic warfare suite. However, the same sources stated that the Rafale, the Mirage, and the MiG were almost certainly shot down as a result of a violation of the Rules of Engagement (ROE) that had long been observed between the IAF and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF). Both forces had been adhering to these restrictions until the night of May 7.\n\nThe ROE called for neither side to target and fire on the other nation\u2019s aircraft as long as they stayed on their side of the line of control. The decision by Pakistan to fire on and shoot down the IAF aircraft while still in Indian airspace was a violation of that \u201cgentlemen\u2019s agreement.\u201d\n\nThe following three days, 8-10 May, in the words of Chauhan, \u201cwe were able to do precision strikes on heavily air-defended airfields of Pakistan deep 300 kilometers inside, with the precision [CEP] of a meter.\u201d the Indian military chief said.\n\nOne source explained that the losses to Pakistan were \u201csignificant\u201d during these three days and lopsided in India\u2019s favor. Almost all the Pakistan aircraft were also supposedly destroyed while they were still on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about an aerial and situation awareness dominance on the order of the Bekaa Valley \u2018turkey shoot\u2019 [in 1982] or the Israel-Egypt Six-Day War [in 1967],\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him and the other source, the total damage done by India\u2019s counterattacks was not just the destruction of large numbers of Pakistan aircraft but also hangars, runways, and other air base facilities.\n\nThe PAF may have thought they had some bragging rights after downing the IAF fighters, they both explained, but \u201cin the end, they suffered considerable losses for the sake of just three Indian aircraft taken out. Not much of a trade-off in the end.\u201d\n\nHow Well Did Chinese Weapons Work?\n\nIn his interview in Singapore, Chauhan had also refuted Pakistan\u2019s assertions about the combat performance of the Chinese-made and other foreign weaponry they had fired against the IAF, saying that in the end, many of these Chinese systems \u201cdidn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nPreviously, sources from another Asian country had made this claim and had stated a \u201chigh percentage of the missiles fired by Pakistan at Indian targets missed and landed more or less intact on Indian territory without self-destructing. This has been a technical intelligence bonanza for the IAF.\u201d\n\nThe two Indian sources not only confirmed this fact but added that they had seen some of the recovered weaponry. These systems included not only some of the latest Chinese-made air-to-air missiles but also surface-to-air missiles employed in the HQ-9 air defense system.

They were seeing all of the same Chinese weaponry I was\u2014including these same models of missiles that were fired by Pakistan this past month and failed to detonate.\n\n\u201cThis equipment all looks impressive,\u201d one of them said. \u201cBut we are waiting to see how it actually works. From what we can see a lot of it is not \u2018battle-worthy.\u2019\u201d An assessment that apparently turns out to have been correct.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nReuben F.

Indian Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan acknowledged the loss of some aircraft but emphasized learning from tactical mistakes. He refuted Pakistan's claims, suggesting they were part of psychological warfare, and highlighted significant Indian counterattacks that inflicted heavy losses on Pakistan.

It further reported:\n\n\u201cIn Tel Aviv, 480 buildings have been damaged, many of them badly, at five separate sites. In Ramat Gan, it\u2019s 237 buildings at three sites, about 10 badly. In another Tel Aviv suburb, Bat Yam, 78 buildings were damaged by one hit; 22 will have to be razed. The Israel Tax Authority has received applications for financial assistance for nearly 33,000 damaged structures. Another 4,450 files have been opened for the loss of belongings and equipment, and another 4,119 for damaged vehicles\u201d.\n\nThe Iranian attacks killed 29 Israeli civilians and, according to a Haaretz map, 96 buildings were severely damaged.\n\nBy contrast, in the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 42 Scud missiles at Tel Aviv and Haifa, killing two Israelis and damaging 4,100 buildings, destroying 28.\n\nThe Haaretz report deals only with civilian buildings. Iran also hit a number of Israeli military bases, including Kirya and Camp Moshe Dayan in Tel Aviv; as well as the BAZAN oil refinery in Haifa, causing significant damage; and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, destroying two buildings.\n\nJoe Lauria is editor-in-chief of Consortium News and a former U.N. correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, and other newspapers, including The Montreal Gazette, the London Daily Mail and The Star of Johannesburg.

It\u2019s come to rule over us.\n\n\n\nBy Joe Lauria\n\nCathy Vogan, executive producer of Consortium News\u2018 webcast CN Live!, coined a new term to describe rule by psyops, or psychological operations: psyopcracy. And Consortium News\u2018 existence is devoted to fighting it.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n\u201cPsychological operations (PSYOP) are operations to convey selected information and indicators to audiences to influence their emotions, motives, and objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals. The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce or reinforce behavior perceived to be favorable to U.S. objectives.\u201d\n\nWilliam Casey, C.I.A. director under Ronald Reagan, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.\u201d\n\nThus the American people are continuously subject to a number of psychological operations otherwise known as \u201cthe news.\u201d Combating these false constructs of the world through media is Consortium News\u2018 mission.\n\nPlease Donate to the\n\nSpring Fund Drive!\n\nU.S. intelligence officials feed journalists disinformation to create a false narrative that is intended to mislead the public and cover-up what is actually taking place.\n\nThe constant reinforcement of these lies becomes entrenched in the public mind and after time comes to be accepted as unquestionable truth.\n\nHere\u2019s an explanation of how the C.I.A. did it in Vietnam:\n\nThrough such operations, the American people were led to believe for years that the United States was winning in Vietnam, when it was actually losing, as the Pentagon Papers proved.\n\nSince then, many examples have followed of completely false stories being planted into people\u2019s minds to start and keep a war going, the fake WMD narrative in Iraq perhaps the most infamous.\n\nToday the wars people are being fooled about are in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nSometimes a psyop doesn\u2019t involve inserting false information, so much as leaving out what\u2019s true.\n\nThe American people, and by extension, people around the world, have been led to believe that an unprovoked Russian madman started the war in Ukraine.\n\nThat\u2019s because they are purposely not told that the war actually began in 2014 after a U.S.-backed overthrow of the elected government in Kiev led Russian speakers in Donbass to declare independence, after which the illegitimate government militarily attacked them.\n\nOther facts are removed from the story, such as Russia\u2019s proposed treaties with the U.S. and NATO in December 2021 that would have prevented Russia\u2019s intervention in the Ukrainian civil war.\n\nAnd now the psyopcracy is deluding Western Europe into believing Russia is about to attack them.\n\nThe history of Israel\u2019s ethnic cleansing of Palestine is also whitewashed to lead the U.S. public into believing that Israel is the \u201cvictim\u201d that is only \u201cdefending itself.\u201d\n\nRobert Parry, the founder of this website, in March 2017 wrote the article, \u201cHow US Flooded the World with Psyops,\u201d in which he reported for the first time:\n\n\u201cNewly declassified documents from the Reagan presidential library help explain how the U.S. government developed its sophisticated psychological operations capabilities that \u2013 over the past three decades \u2013 have created an alternative reality both for people in targeted countries and for American citizens, a structure that expanded U.S. influence abroad and quieted dissent at home. The documents reveal the formation of a psyops bureaucracy under the direction of Walter Raymond Jr., a senior CIA covert operations specialist who was assigned to President Reagan\u2019s National Security Council staff to enhance the importance of propaganda and psyops in undermining U.S. adversaries around the world and ensuring sufficient public support for foreign policies inside the United States.\u201d\n\nSo many people are subject to psyops that telling the truth becomes a formidable task. You become the one that is out of step. You are the one that seems to be mad.\n\nConsortium News\u2018s 30-year mission since 1995 has been to fight against psychological operations that have come to rule over Americans and other peoples, convincing them of all manner of falsehoods, such as that the U.S. is motivated by humanitarian and democratic principles rather than naked greed and a lust for domination.\n\nAnd that the Ukraine war was unprovoked and Israel is just defending itself.\n\nHelp us fight the psyopcracy:\n\nPlease Donate to the\n\nSpring Fund Drive!",

Sachs and Sybil Fares\n\nOther News\n\nThe attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran had two significant effects.\n\nFirst, it once again exposed the root cause of turmoil in the region: Israel\u2019s project to \u201creshape the Middle East\u201d through regime-change, aimed at maintaining its dominance and blocking a Palestinian state. Second, it highlighted the futility and recklessness of this strategy.\n\nThe only path to peace is a comprehensive agreement that addresses Palestine\u2019s statehood, Israel\u2019s security, Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program and the economic recovery of the region.\n\nIsrael wants to topple the Iranian government because Iran has supported proxies and non-state actors aligned with the Palestinians. Israel has also consistently undermined U.S.-Iran diplomacy regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nInstead of endless wars, Israel\u2019s security can be ensured by two key diplomatic steps \u2013 ending militancy by establishing a Palestinian state with U.N. Security Council guarantees, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful and verifiable nuclear program.\n\nThe far-right Israeli government\u2019s refusal to accept a Palestinian state is the root of the problem.\n\nWhen the British empire promised a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine in 1917, the Palestinian Arabs constituted 90 percent of the population and Jews less than 10 percent of the population.\n\nIn 1947, with U.S. intense lobbying, the U.N. General Assembly voted to grant 56 percent of Palestine to a new Zionist state, while the Jews were only 33 percent of the population. Palestinians rejected this as a violation of their right to self-determination.\n\nAfter the 1948 war, Israel expanded to 78 percent of Palestine, and in 1967, occupied the remaining 22 percent \u2014 Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.\n\nInstead of returning occupied lands in exchange for peace, Israeli right-wing politicians insisted on permanent control of 100 percent of the land, with the Likud founding charter declaring in 1977 that there would be only Israeli sovereignty \u201cbetween the Sea and Jordan\u201d.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu represents this policy of domination \u2014 and has served as Israel\u2019s prime minister for a total of 17 years since 1996. When he came to power, he and his U.S. neocon allies authored the \u201cClean Break\u201d strategy to block the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nInstead of pursuing land for peace, Israel aimed to reshape the Middle East by overthrowing governments that supported the Palestinian cause. The U.S. would be the implementing partner of this strategy.\n\nThis is exactly what happened after 9/11, as the U.S. led or sponsored wars against Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon (U.S. funding and arming Israeli aggressions), Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (C.I.A. operation during 2010\u2019s), Sudan (supporting rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011) and Somalia (backing Ethiopia\u2019s invasion in 2006).\n\nContrary to the glib promises by Netanyahu to the U.S. Congress in 2002 \u2014 that regime change in Iraq would bring a new day to the Middle East \u2014 the 2003 Iraq War augured the events that were to come across the region. Iraq descended into turmoil, and since then, each new war has brought death, destruction, and economic disarray.\n\nThis month, Israel attacked Iran even as negotiations between Iran and the U.S. were underway to ensure the peaceful use of Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 repeating the same WMD propaganda that Netanyahu used to justify the Iraq War.\n\nIsrael has been claiming for more than 30 years that Iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. However, on June 18, the IAEA director general stated that there is \u201cno proof of a systematic effort\u201d by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nMore to the point, Iran and the U.S. were actively engaged in negotiations according to which the IAEA would monitor and verify the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nThe attack on Iran proves yet again the futility and nihilism of Netanyahu\u2019s approach. The Israeli and U.S. attacks accomplished nothing positive. According to most analysts, Iran\u2019s enriched uranium remains intact, but is now in a secret location rather than under IAEA monitoring. In the meantime, with Israel\u2019s ongoing genocide in Gaza \u2013 neither peace nor security have been achieved.\n\nIsrael has driven the region to a 4,000-km swash of violence from Libya to Iran through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately aimed at preventing a State of Palestine by \u201cremaking\u201d the Middle East.\n\nThe solution is clear: it is time for the United States to recognize that its own strategic interests require a decisive break from partnering in Israel\u2019s destructive strategy.\n\nPrioritizing genuine peace in the Middle East is not only a moral imperative, but a fundamental U.S. interest \u2014 one that can only be achieved through a comprehensive peace deal. The key pillar of this deal is for the U.S. to lift its veto on a Palestinian State on the borders of June 4, 1967, and to do so at the start, not in some vague distant future that never actually arrives.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Arab nations have backed a practical peace plan. So too has the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), with its 57 member countries, and the League of Arab States (LAS), with its 22 members. So too have almost all the nations in the U.N. General Assembly. So too has the International Court of Justice in its 2024 ruling that Israel\u2019s occupation is illegal. Only Israel, with support from the U.S. veto, has stood in the way.\n\nSeven-Point Peace Plan\n\nHere is a seven-point peace plan in which all parties would benefit. Israel would gain peace and security. Palestine would achieve statehood. Iran would win an end to economic sanctions. The U.S. would win an end to costly and illegal wars fought on Israel\u2019s behalf, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation if the current violence continues. The Middle East would win economic development, security and justice.\n\n\u2013 First, an immediate ceasefire would apply across the entire region \u2014 and the ceasefire would include an immediate release of all hostages and prisoners.\n\n\u2013 Second, the U.N Security Council would vote upfront to welcome Palestine as the 194th U.N. Member State on the June 4, 1967, borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel and Palestine could subsequently agree on mutually desired border adjustments.\n\n\u2013 Third, Israel would withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967. U.N.-mandated international forces would ensure a peaceful, orderly transition, a transfer of Palestinian territories to Palestinian authorities, and mutual security for both Israel and Palestine.\n\n\u2013 Fourth, territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed for Lebanon, Syria and all states in the region. All non-state armed groups would be demilitarized, and foreign troops would be withdrawn.\n\n\u2013 Fifth, the U.N. Security Council would adopt an updated nuclear agreement with Iran, including binding verification, and with all economic sanctions on Iran lifted alongside Iran\u2019s verified compliance with the peaceful uses of its nuclear program.\n\n\u2013 Sixth, Israel and all Arab and Islamic states would establish full diplomatic relations following the admission of the State of Palestine as U.N. member state.\n\n\u2013 Seventh, the Middle East nations would establish an international fund for rebuilding the war-torn parts of Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, with contributions coming from within the region and from external sources.\n\nJeffrey D.

        "text": "Shares\n\nThe final impediment to the annexation of Gaza are the Palestinians themselves. They are the primary target. Starvation is the weapon of choice.\n\n\n\nBy Chris Hedges\n\nScheerPost\n\nIsrael\u2019s weaponization of starvation is how genocides always end.\n\nI covered the insidious effects of orchestrated starvation in the Guatemalan Highlands during the genocidal campaign of Gen. Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt, the famine in southern Sudan that left a quarter of a million dead \u2014 I walked past the frail and skeletal corpses of families lining roadsides \u2014 and later during the war in Bosnia when Serbs cut off food supplies to enclaves such as Srebrencia and Gora\u017ede.\n\nStarvation was weaponized by the Ottoman Empire to decimate the Armenians. It was used to kill millions of Ukrainians in the Holodomor in 1932 and 1933.\n\nIt was employed by the Nazis against the Jews in the ghettos in World War II. German soldiers used food, as Israel does, like bait. They offered three kilograms of bread and one kilogram of marmalade to lure desperate families in the Warsaw Ghetto onto transports to the death camps.\n\n\u201cThere were times when hundreds of people had to wait in line for several days to be \u2018deported,\u2019\u201d Marek Edelman writes in The Ghetto Fights. \u201cThe number of people anxious to obtain the three kilograms of bread was such that the transports, now leaving twice daily with 12,000 people, could not accommodate them all.\u201d\n\nAnd when crowds became unruly, as in Gaza, the German troops fired deadly volleys that ripped through emaciated husks of women, children and the elderly.\n\nThis tactic is as old as warfare itself.\n\nThe report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that Israeli soldiers are ordered to shoot into crowds of Palestinians at aid hubs, with 580 killed and 4,216 wounded, is not a surprise.\n\nIt is the predictable denouement of the genocide, the inevitable conclusion to a campaign of mass extermination.\n\nICYMI: Israeli newspaper Haaretz has published shocking testimonies from soldiers who say unarmed, starving Palestinians are being shot without reason at Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid distribution sites. pic.twitter.com/GMHFXOxdh9 \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) June 29, 2025\n\nIsrael, with its targeted assassinations of at least 1,400 health care workers, hundreds of United Nations workers, journalists, police and even poets and academics, its obliteration of multi-story apartment blocks wiping out dozens of families, its shelling of designated \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d where Palestinians huddle under tents, tarps or in the open air, its systematic targeting of U.N. food distribution centers, bakeries and aid convoys or its sadistic sniper fire that guns down children, long ago illustrated that Palestinians are regarded as vermin worthy only of annihilation.\n\nThe blockade of food and humanitarian aid, imposed on Gaza since March 2, is reducing Palestinians to abject dependence. To eat, they must crawl towards their killers and beg. Humiliated, terrified, desperate for a few scraps of food, they are stripped of dignity, autonomy and agency. This is by intent.\n\nYousef al-Ajouri, 40, explained to Middle East Eye his nightmarish journey to one of four aid hubs set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The hubs are not designed to meet the needs of the Palestinians, who once relied on 400 aid distribution sites, but to lure them from northern Gaza to the south.\n\nIsrael, which on Sunday again ordered Palestinians to leave northern Gaza, is steadily expanding its annexation of the coastal strip. Palestinians are corralled like livestock into narrow metal chutes at distribution points which are overseen by heavily armed mercenaries. They receive, if they are one of the fortunate few, a small box of food.\n\nAl-Ajouri, who before the genocide was a taxi driver, lives with his wife, seven children and his mother and father in a tent in al-Saraya, near the middle of Gaza City. He set out to an aid hub at Salah al-Din Road near the Netzarim corridor, to find some food for his children, who he said cry constantly \u201cbecause of how hungry they are.\u201d\n\nOn the advice of his neighbor in the tent next to him, he dressed in loose clothing \u201cso that I could run and be agile.\u201d He carried a bag for canned and packaged goods because the crush of the crowds meant \u201cno one was able to carry the boxes the aid came in.\u201d\n\nHe left at about 9 p.m. with five other men \u201cincluding an engineer and a teacher,\u201d and \u201cchildren aged 10 and 12.\u201d They did not take the official route designated by the Israeli army. The massive crowds converging on the aid point along the official route ensure that most never get close enough to receive food.\n\nInstead, they walked in the darkness in areas exposed to Israeli gunfire, often having to crawl to avoid being seen.\n\n\u201cAs I crawled, I looked over, and to my surprise, saw several women and elderly people taking the same treacherous route as us,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cAt one point, there was a barrage of live gunfire all around me. We hid behind a destroyed building. Anyone who moved or made a noticeable motion was immediately shot by snipers. Next to me was a tall, light-haired young man using the flashlight on his phone to guide him. The others yelled at him to turn it off. Seconds later, he was shot. He collapsed to the ground and lay there bleeding, but no one could help or move him. He died within minutes.\u201d\n\nHe passed six bodies along the route who had been shot dead by Israeli soldiers.\n\nAl-Ajouri reached the hub at 2 a.m., the designated time for aid distribution. He saw a green light turned on ahead of him which signaled that aid was about to be distributed. Thousands began to run towards the light, pushing, shoving and trampling each other. He fought his way through the crowd until he reached the aid.\n\n\u201cI started feeling around for the aid boxes and grabbed a bag that felt like rice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut just as I did, someone else snatched it from my hands. I tried to hold on, but he threatened to stab me with his knife. Most people there were carrying knives, either to defend themselves or to steal from others. Eventually, I managed to grab four cans of beans, a kilogram of bulgur, and half a kilogram of pasta. Within moments, the boxes were empty. Most of the people there, including women, children and the elderly, got nothing. Some begged others to share. But no one could afford to give up what they managed to get.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. contractors and Israeli soldiers overseeing the mayhem laughed and pointed their weapons at the crowd. Some filmed with their phones.\n\n\u201cMinutes later, red smoke grenades were thrown into the air,\u201d he remembered.\n\n\u201cSomeone told me that it was the signal to evacuate the area. After that, heavy gunfire began. Me, Khalil and a few others headed to al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat because our friend Wael had injured his hand during the journey. I was shocked by what I saw at the hospital. There were at least 35 martyrs lying dead on the ground in one of the rooms. A doctor told me they had all been brought in that same day. They were each shot in the head or chest while queuing near the aid center. Their families were waiting for them to come home with food and ingredients. Now, they were corpses.\u201d\n\nGHF is a Mossad-funded creation of Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry that contracts with UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, run by former members of the C.I.A. and U.S. Special Forces. GHF is headed by Rev. Johnnie Moore, a far-right Christian Zionist with close ties to Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. The organization has also contracted anti-Hamas drug-smuggling gangs to provide security at aid sites.\n\nAs Chris Gunness, a former spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) told Al Jazeera, GHF is \u201caid washing,\u201d a way to mask the reality that \u201cpeople are being starved into submission.\u201d\n\nIsrael, along with the U.S. and European countries that provide weapons to sustain the genocide, have chosen to disregard the January 2024 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which demanded immediate protection for civilians in Gaza and widespread provision of humanitarian assistance.\n\nHaaretz, in its article headlined \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a Killing Field\u2019: IDF Soldiers Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian Aid\u201d reported that Israeli commanders order soldiers to open fire on crowds to keep them away from aid sites or disperse them.\n\n\u201cThe distribution centers typically open for just one hour each morning,\u201d the report says.\n\n\u201cAccording to officers and soldiers who served in their areas, the IDF fires at people who arrive before opening hours to prevent them from approaching, or again after the centers close, to disperse them. Since some of the shooting incidents occurred at night \u2014 ahead of the opening \u2014 it\u2019s possible that some civilians couldn\u2019t see the boundaries of the designated area.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a killing field,\u201d one soldier told Haaretz.\n\n\u201cWhere I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day. They\u2019re treated like a hostile force \u2014 no crowd-control measures, no tear gas \u2014 just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Then, once the center opens, the shooting stops, and they know they can approach. Our form of communication is gunfire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe open fire early in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters away, and sometimes we just charge at them from close range. But there\u2019s no danger to the forces,\u201d the soldier explained, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of a single instance of return fire. There\u2019s no enemy, no weapons.\u201d\n\nHe said the deployment at the aid sites is known as \u201cOperation Salted Fish,\u201d a reference to the Israeli name for the children\u2019s game \u201cRed light, green light.\u201d The game was featured in the first episode of the South Korean dystopian thriller Squid Game, in which financially desperate people are killed as they battle each other for money.\n\nIsrael has obliterated the civilian and humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza. It has reduced Palestinians, half a million of whom face starvation, into desperate herds. The goal is to break Palestinians, to make them malleable and entice them to leave Gaza, never to return.\n\nThere is talk from the Trump White House about a ceasefire. But don\u2019t be fooled. Israel has nothing left to destroy. Its saturation bombing over 20 months has reduced Gaza to a moonscape.\n\nGaza is uninhabitable, a toxic wilderness where Palestinians, living amid broken slabs of concrete and pools of raw sewage, lack food and clean water, fuel, shelter, electricity, medicine and an infrastructure to survive.\n\nThe final impediment to the annexation of Gaza are the Palestinians themselves.

        "text": "Shares\n\nIsrael sees an opportunity in a Europe rearming because of the supposed threat of Russia, writes Jessica Buxbaum.\n\n\n\nBy Jessica Buxbaum\n\nMintPress News\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius [actually] believe Russia could launch a full-scale attack on Europe by 2030, a fear that has prompted governments across the continent to prepare for war.\n\nAs European citizens are advised to stockpile food and governments ramp up military readiness, one country sees opportunity in that [trumped up] fear: Israel.\n\nThe European Union is planning to increase its military budget by \u20ac800 billion ($900 billion) over the next four years. With the United States pulling back military support for NATO, EU member states are seeking new defense partners, and Israel is stepping in, offering weapons tested on occupied and besieged populations.\n\nAs governments across Europe prepare for [what they say is] a potential Russian assault, they are deepening defense ties with Israel, buying billions in battle-tested weapons even as Israel faces genocide accusations in the International Court of Justice.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024, European arms imports increased by 155 percent compared to the previous five years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Over that same period, Israel climbed the ranks of global arms exporters, now standing eighth worldwide.\n\nThe surge in sales reflects a growing European reliance on Israeli military technology. In 2023, EU nations imported $111 million in Israeli arms. By 2024, that number jumped to $135 million, even as European governments publicly condemned Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cMilitaries often are quite interested in real-life experience witnessed by other militaries,\u201d Dr. Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence, told MintPress News. Israel\u2019s repeated assaults on Gaza and the West Bank \u2014 and its long-running campaigns in Syria and Lebanon \u2014 have become central to its marketing pitch.\n\nUnder what Australian journalist Antony Loewenstein termed the \u201cPalestine Laboratory,\u201d Israel uses the occupied Palestinian territories as a testing ground for its military technology, and then manipulates the success of its state violence to boost its ammunition sales.\n\n[WATCH: The Palestine Laboratory & Surveillance Capitalism]\n\n\u201c[Israel\u2019s] experience feeds back into its own production of weapons where they can say this is battle-tested,\u201d Overton said. He added:\n\n\u201cIf we only look at [arms transfers] through the prism of that they\u2019re battle-tested, and we don\u2019t look at it through the prism of the fact that they\u2019re often indiscriminate or they cause large numbers of civilian harm\u2026 then we might inadvertently be purchasing more lethal weapons than necessary or weapons that actually do not fit the European standards of international humanitarian law in conflict.\u201d\n\nSpain & Poland Criticize Israel, But Buy Its Weapons\n\nSpain has been one of Israel\u2019s loudest critics since the Gaza war began in October 2023. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez even called for a global arms moratorium. Yet Centre Delas, a Barcelona-based think tank, revealed in April that the Spanish government had awarded 46 contracts totaling $1.2 billion to Israeli arms manufacturers since the war began.\n\nAmong them: 12 PULS rocket launchers from Elbit Systems, 64 Predator Hawk missiles, and 168 additional missiles from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Contracts also went to Netline Communications Technologies and Guardian Homeland Security.\n\nIn Israel\u2019s largest arms sale to date, Germany purchased the U.S.-Israel jointly produced Arrow 3 missile defense system for $4.3 billion in September 2024. In February 2025, the German army bought Elbit\u2019s PULS rocket launcher artillery systems in a $57 million deal. Two months later, Germany\u2019s Defense Ministry announced it was procuring loitering munitions \u2014 commonly known as suicide drones \u2014 from Israeli firms UVision and Israel Aerospace Industries.\n\nGermany is Israel\u2019s second-largest weapons customer after the United States, and Israel is one of Germany\u2019s top arms exporters, supplying 13 percent of the country\u2019s weapons.\n\n\u201cIsraeli components are built into Germany\u2019s military capacities, and that for them is far more important than any International Court of Justice genocide ruling,\u201d said Jeff Halper, an Israeli anthropologist and author of War Against the People, which details how Israel uses its weapons technology on Palestinians.\n\nFinland signed a \u20ac316 million ($356 million) deal for Israel\u2019s David\u2019s Sling air defenses in 2023. The Nordic nation finalized the sale in November 2023, a month into Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza. Finland\u2019s president, Alexander Stubb, defended the deal in an interview with Reuters, saying the purchase wasn\u2019t related to Finland\u2019s decision not to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael and Greece have also strengthened their military partnership in recent years. In 2023, Greece purchased a $404 million package of Spike missiles and Orbiter 3 drones, produced by Israeli defense firms Rafael and Aeronautics.\n\nAt this year\u2019s DEFEA, an international defense exhibition held in Athens, Israel Aerospace Industries and Hellenic Aerospace Industry signed an agreement for IAI to supply its BlueWhale autonomous submarine system to the Hellenic Navy.\n\nFollowing the collapse of a fragile cease-fire in Gaza on March 18, 2025, the Netherlands announced it would individually assess future sales of weapons and dual-use goods to Israel.\n\nThe Dutch government said it has not exported weapons to Israel since the start of the war, a result of a February 2024 Dutch court order prohibiting the export of F-35 fighter jet parts over concerns they could be used in violation of international law in Gaza. However, the Netherlands has continued to import Israeli arms.\n\nIn September 2024, the Dutch Navy purchased two vessels equipped with drones and missiles for between $279 million and $1.1 billion. In December, the Netherlands awarded Elbit Systems a $175 million contract to supply the NATO member with systems to protect aircraft and helicopters from anti-aircraft missiles. Elbit also secured a $53 million contract in May 2024 to supply armored vehicles to Austria.\n\nSeveral countries bordering Ukraine have also increased weapons imports from Israel.\n\nPoland\u2019s new government declared in May 2024 that it would not export military equipment to Israel and had not signed any new contracts.\n\n\u201cWe will not have a hand in Israeli attacks on civilians in the Gaza Strip using Polish weapons,\u201d Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Szejna said.\n\nYet Polish media reported in February that the country would purchase 1,400 Borsuk infantry fighting vehicles armed with Rafael\u2019s Spike missile launchers.\n\nPlease Donate to the\n\nSpring Fund Drive!\n\nIn its largest arms deal with Israel, Slovakia bought the IAI-manufactured Barak MX air defense system for $583 million in December 2024. In a separate $92 million deal, Romania purchased Rafael-made Spike LR2 anti-tank missiles in February 2024. One month later, Elbit Systems won a $60 million contract to supply Romania with counter-drone systems.\n\nIn a show of solidarity, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala visited Israel after it launched its war on Gaza following the Hamas attack in October 2023. During the visit, the Czech Republic signed a contract to purchase 48 Rafael-manufactured I-Derby long-range anti-aircraft missiles for $120 million.\n\nThis year, Axon Vision, an Israeli AI provider for militaries, partnered with Czech arms company Czechoslovak Group to install its AI-based situational awareness system on Czech military armored vehicles.\n\nAt the start of 2025, Serbia finalized its purchase of Elbit Systems\u2019 PULS artillery rocket systems and Hermes 900 reconnaissance drones in a $335 million deal.\n\nAlso at the beginning of the year, the Swedish Dockworkers Union implemented a blockade against all military trade with Israel amid the ongoing war. Before the embargo, Swedish imports of Israeli military equipment had already surged, skyrocketing from $737,000 in 2023 to $23.8 million in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, Sweden signed a $36.6 million contract for Rafael Litening targeting pods for a fleet of fighter jets. Swedish defense firm BAE Systems H\u00e4gglunds also signed a $130 million deal with Elbit Systems for its Iron Fist Active Protection Systems.\n\nThis year, Sweden signed a \u20ac2 billion ($2.26 billion) agreement with European defense company KNDS for 44 advanced Leopard 2 A8 main battle tanks equipped with Israeli firm Rafael\u2019s Trophy active protection system.\n\nTreaties Ignored as Israel Arms Europe\n\nDespite the ICJ\u2019s 2024 preliminary ruling that Palestinians have a \u201cplausible right to protection from genocide,\u201d European arms deals with Israel continue unabated. And international treaties are no obstacle. Overton tells MintPress News that:.\n\n\u201cWhile the [UN Arms Trade Treaty] seeks to prevent arms transfers that could be used to commit human rights violations, its provisions are riddled with loopholes, and enforcement mechanisms remain weak.\u201d\n\nMost of the weapons Israel sells \u2014 missiles, drones, surveillance systems \u2014 don\u2019t fall under banned categories like white phosphorus, even if they\u2019re used in ways that violate humanitarian law, even if they\u2019re used in densely populated civilian areas in violation of international law.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Israeli arms exports fall within the realm of ethics and morality, not treaties,\u201d Overton said. \u201cThe question is: Should we be profiting from Israel?\u201d\n\nHe compares the situation to sanctioned states like North Korea or Russia. But unlike those countries, Israel faces few material consequences.\n\nWhile some EU nations announce embargoes or reassess trade agreements, Halper remains skeptical.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll do it on a symbolic level,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll send a message to Israel in a way that doesn\u2019t really impact its military capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no morality in international politics,\u201d Halper added.\n\nAs Europe re-arms for [what it sees as] the next global war, it is doing so with weapons tested on occupied people, in neighborhoods flattened by airstrikes, and in refugee camps targeted by one of the most technologically advanced militaries on earth. Whether symbolic sanctions will ever evolve into meaningful action remains to be seen, but for now, business is booming.\n\nJessica Buxbaum is a Jerusalem-based journalist for MintPress News covering Palestine, Israel, and Syria.

        "paragraph_summary": "The article by Jessica Buxbaum in MintPress News highlights Israel's strategic positioning as a key arms supplier to European nations amid heightened fears of a potential Russian threat by 2030. As the European Union plans to significantly boost its military budget, Israel is capitalizing on this opportunity by offering weapons that have been tested in conflict zones like Gaza, despite facing genocide accusations in the International Court of Justice. The article details how European countries, including Germany, Spain, and Finland, have increased their imports of Israeli military technology, reflecting a growing reliance on Israel's battle-tested arms. This trend persists even as some European nations publicly criticize Israel's actions in Gaza. The article also discusses the ethical implications of these arms deals, questioning whether profiting from Israel's military technology, often used in ways that may violate international humanitarian law, aligns with European values and treaties. Despite symbolic sanctions and reassessments of trade agreements, the article suggests that meaningful action against Israel's military capacity remains unlikely, as European nations continue to prioritize their defense needs.",

Those worse things, of course, include slaughtering children en masse.\n\nThe BBC apologised, calling the band\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d \u2013 more offensive, apparently, than Israel bombing and starving the children of Gaza.\n\n\u201cBut have you heard this one tho\u201d? pic.twitter.com/7pNSRn0i6l \u2014 ???? ????????? (@aldnmarki) June 30, 2025\n\nGlastonbury\u2019s organisers condemned the chant, saying there was no space for \u201chate speech or antisemitism\u201d \u2014 apparently assuming, wrongly, that all Jews identify not just with the state of Israel but with an Israeli military widely accused by genocide experts of committing genocidal violence in Gaza.\n\nI\u2019m a British Jew in England I didn\u2019t interpret #DeathToTheIDF as a call for people to kill me because 1. I\u2019m not in the IDF 2. It doesn\u2019t call for the death of individuals \u2013 the clue is in \u201cThe IDF\u201d 3. I\u2019m not brain dead \u2014 Stop The Bollocks with Mirabel (@MirabelTweets1) June 29, 2025\n\nPolice are investigating Bob Vylan, a musical duo, to see whether they have committed a criminal offence, or possibly a terrorist one. As far as we know, the same police are doing nothing to investigate some 10 British citizens known to have travelled abroad to join the Israeli military, the IDF, committing the Gaza genocide.\n\n[On Monday, the U.S. State Department cancelled the group\u2019s visas ahead of a U.S. tour scheduled to begin in the fall and United Talent Agency dropped the duo, according to The Hollywood Reporter.]\n\nOn Sunday, the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire grilled Starmer\u2019s health secretary, Wes Streeting, on remarks from the Israeli embassy in London condemning what it termed \u201cthe normalisation of extremist language\u201d and the \u201cglorification of violence\u201d at Glastonbury.\n\nUnexpectedly, Streeting avoided jumping whole-heartedly on the media outrage band-wagon, led by the Mail on Sunday, whose front page demanded the arrest of the two band members for what the paper wrongly described as a chant demanding \u201cDeath to Israelis\u201d.\n\nThe Mail, apparently, believes that all Israelis, presumably including the country\u2019s children, are currently serving in the Israeli military.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order\u201d Health Secretary Wes Streeting responds to Israel\u2019s claims on Glastonbury\u2019s \u201cglorification of violence\u201d, saying \u201cIsraeli settler terrorists\u201d carried out \u201cunwanton acts of violence\u201d#BBCLauraKhttps://t.co/v2HwddQuYEpic.twitter.com/DRoqBMrVM6 \u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) June 29, 2025\n\nThere are four important points to make about the interview between Derbyshire and Streeting:\n\n1. The Israeli embassy in London, like the Israeli government it represents, has precisely no concerns about the \u201cglorification of violence\u201d when Israel is doing either the glorifying or the violence.\n\nIsrael is currently celebrating its \u201csuccess\u201d in slaughtering and maiming hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, including huge numbers of children; attacks by its soldiers and state-backed Jewish settler militias on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank; its eradication of whole communities in Lebanon; and its bombing of residential tower blocks across Tehran, killing many hundreds.\n\nViolence has been Israel\u2019s signature policy for the past 21 months \u2014 and long before that. Israel has revelled in the carnage it has inflicted on populations across the region.\n\nIn a post on social media, the Israeli embassy additionally argued of Bob Vylan\u2019s chant:\n\n\u201cWhen speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out \u2014 especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms.\u201d\n\nAnd yet public figures from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Starmer have incited against the Palestinians, with Netanyahu comparing them to \u201cAmalek\u201d, a people the Israelites were commanded by God to exterminate, and Starmer terming the wholesale starvation of the people of Gaza an act by Israel of \u201cself-defence\u201d.\n\nIsraeli officials from Netanyahu down have advocated the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. And, even more seriously, Israel has not just threatened but repeatedly carried out the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under its belligerent rule.\n\n2. It is beyond ridiculous for the BBC to echo the Israeli government in prioritising a harsh crackdown on words at Glastonbury \u201cglorifying violence\u201d towards Israeli soldiers ahead of the actual violence of genocide being committed by those Israel soldiers.\n\nThe BBC has avoided criticising the Israeli government for its actual violence \u2014 its bombing and active starvation of Palestinian civilians \u2014 and the Starmer government for colluding in that violence, or what the International Court of Justice termed more than a year ago a \u201cplausible\u201d genocide by Israel.\n\nAs a recent report by the Centre for Media Monitoring confirmed, the BBC has dramatically skewed its language to present Israel, the aggressor, in a more favourable light than the victim, the Palestinians of Gaza. The BBC\u2019s own whistleblowing journalists have warned that the state broadcaster has all but banned the use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d, even by experts on the matter.\n\n[See: Jonathan Cook: The BBC\u2019s Complicity in Genocide]\n\nBy arming Israel, by organising spy flights over Gaza from RAF base Akrotiri on Cyprus, and by providing diplomatic cover, Starmer has effectively glorified Israel\u2019s slaughter of Palestinian children in the enclave.\n\nBob Vylan\u2019s chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d have a far more dangerous counterpart in Starmer\u2019s recital of Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend itself\u201d when that \u201cdefence\u201d involves Israel mercilessly starving Gaza\u2019s population of food, water and power.\n\nBob Vylan are a punk band; Starmer is the British prime minister, the man who directs Britain\u2019s foreign policy and directs its army.\n\nNo one, least of all the BBC, has held Israeli or British officials accountable not just for glorifying violence but for actually carrying it out on an industrial scale for nearly two years.\n\nBut the BBC is suddenly interested in holding to account two punk musicians for leading a chant \u2014 one that made a symbolic, hypothetical threat of violence \u2014 against an Israeli military carrying out the ultimate form of violence, an actual genocide.\n\nIn a serious media, Israel\u2019s supposed \u201cconcerns\u201d about the glorification of violence and extremist language would be laughed off the stage rather than respectfully aired.\n\n3. Streeting is being congratulated and condemned in equal measure on social media for refusing to be drawn into the Mail and BBC\u2019s confected outrage. \u201cI\u2019d say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order,\u201d he responded to Derbyshire. But hang on a minute. Streeting\u2019s resistance to Derbyshire\u2019s line of questioning was perhaps unexpected. But it also, let us not forget, serves the interests of both the Starmer and Israeli governments.\n\nStreeting\u2019s insistence that Israel \u201cget its house in order\u201d had, as he made clear, nothing to do with its 21-month slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. Starmer is still defining the Gaza genocide as Israel\u2019s supposed \u201cright to defend itself.\u201d\n\nIn responding to Derbyshire, Streeting expressed concern only at what he called violent \u201csettler attacks\u201d in the West Bank. He said the Israeli embassy needed to \u201cget your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and the settlers in the West Bank.\u201d\n\nThis was intended purely as deflection, designed to serve Starmer and Israel, the West\u2019s key client state in the oil-rich Middle East. It benefits the U.K. government to make an issue of West Bank settler attacks \u2014 and present them as disorganised, random violence by individual extremists that the Israeli government is not responsible for but needs to get a firmer grip on.\n\nBy highlighting problems in the West Bank, the Starmer government can avoid addressing the genocide in Gaza and the Israeli state\u2019s clear responsibility for that genocide. Which is precisely why in recent weeks Britain has made so much noise about imposing feeble penalties on a handful of extremist settlers and two fascist ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s government that represent those settlers.\n\nStarmer and Streeting\u2019s prioritising of Israel\u2019s West Bank violence over Israel\u2019s Gaza violence is a switch and bait twice over.\n\nMost of the violence in the West Bank is not coming from settler extremists, even though they are the ones being punished by the U.K. It is coming from the Israeli military, which has bulldozed thousands of homes there over the past year, driving 40,000 Palestinians off their lands.\n\nFurther, settler violence is not random. It is coordinated with Israeli field commanders, many of them settlers themselves, to uproot Palestinians so that Israel can move in Jewish settlers to colonise the land \u2014 or, in the words of successive Israeli governments, \u201cJudaise\u201d it.\n\nNone of this is new either. Israel has engineered and imposed a violent, apartheid system on Palestinians for decades to make life unbearable and encourage them to leave their homeland.\n\nSecond, Glastonbury\u2019s anger-fuelled chant against the IDF was not primarily motivated by Israel\u2019s violent actions in the West Bank. It was against the Israeli military for committing a genocide in Gaza, which the British government has been supporting.\n\nStreeting\u2019s aim was to drag the debate on to safer territory for him and Starmer: that Britain needs to deal not with a genocide in Gaza but with a handful of violent loons in the West Bank.\n\nEven in criticising the Israeli government for not doing enough to tackle settler violence, Streeting is still operating within the confines of a public discourse dictated by Israel, which prefers any criticism to be directed at individuals not at the Israeli state behind those individuals.\n\n4. The BBC, the Starmer government and the Israel lobby are all delighted to play their part in this game of deflection and deception because these kinds of moral panics obscure the real issue: that all these parties are actively colluding in Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhile the media and government can now have a long backwards and forwards about whether criticism of Israel\u2019s genocidal army needs to be defined in law as a criminal offence or \u201cterrorism\u201d, Israel will get a free pass to continue with the real terrorism: a genocide in Gaza.\n\nFamously, the black civil rights fighter Malcolm X observed of the role of the media:\n\n\u201cThey have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that\u2019s power. \u2026 If you\u2019re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.\u201d\n\nSixty years on, nothing has changed.\n\nJonathan Cook is an award-winning British journalist. He was based in Nazareth, Israel, for 20 years. He returned to the U.K. in 2021. He is the author of three books on the Israel-Palestine conflict: Blood and Religion: The Unmasking of the Jewish State (2006), Israel and the Clash of Civilisations: Iraq, Iran and the Plan to Remake the Middle East (2008) and Disappearing Palestine: Israel\u2019s Experiments in Human Despair (2008).

        "paragraph_summary": "The article by Jonathan Cook highlights the controversy surrounding a chant of \"Death to the IDF\" led by punk band Bob Vylan at Glastonbury, which has sparked outrage from figures like UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the media, who have labeled it as hate speech. Cook criticizes this reaction as a distraction from the more severe issue of the Israeli military's actions in Gaza, which he describes as genocidal violence against Palestinians. He argues that the moral panic over the chant diverts attention from the actual violence perpetrated by the Israeli military, which has been supported by Western governments, including the UK. The article also points out the hypocrisy of the Israeli government and its allies in condemning the glorification of violence while engaging in it themselves. Cook suggests that the focus on the chant serves to deflect criticism from the broader issue of Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank, which he claims are part of a long-standing policy of oppression against Palestinians.",

It belongs ultimately to Polygon Global Partners LLP, a hedge fund.\n\nAirtanker Ltd. \u2014 Direct Owner\n\nThrough a chain of seven cutout companies, which I will take you through, the direct ownership is with Airtanker Ltd., which gives its address as RAF Brize Norton.\n\nIt owns, maintains and operates the RAF\u2019s Voyager refuelling aircraft, which have been providing mid-air refuelling to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) as well as carrying, in their cargo role, munitions to the IDF.\n\nNote that Airtanker Ltd. states that five of the Voyager aircraft while available to the RAF: \u201ccan also be made available to other parties. This can include providing military capability to other nations\u2026\u201d.\n\nWhether the aircraft have been operated by the RAF on behalf of the Israelis, or whether they have been \u201cprovided to\u201d the IDF directly, is an interesting question. Is this designed to build in plausible deniability for the U.K. government?\n\nEight of the Voyager Aircraft though fully painted in RAF livery, actually are the property of Airtanker Ltd.\n\n[See: Britain\u2019s Authoritarian Ban on Palestine Action]\n\nIt is not plain whether the other six \u2014 also the property of Airtanker Ltd. but only occasionally used by the RAF \u2014 are also in RAF livery. The company does not show any photographs of jets not in RAF livery.\n\nAirtanker Holdings \u2014 Majority Control of Airtanker Ltd\n\nSo who owns Airtanker Ltd? Well, the \u201cperson with significant control\u201d on the Companies House register is Airtanker Holdings Ltd. They own over 75 percent but less than 100 percent. It would be interesting to know who owns the rest.\n\nAirbus & Equitix Capital Eurobond \u2014 Significant Shares\n\nSo who owns Airtanker Holdings Ltd? Well, it is owned \u2014 more than 25 percent and less than 50 percent \u2013 by Airbus, which provides the actual aircraft, and more than 25 percent and less than 50 percent by Equitix Capital Eurobond 6 Ltd., which presumably provides finance. As both own under 50 percent it would be interesting to know who owns the rest, and why.\n\nEquitix Holdings Ltd Owns Equitix Capital Eurobond\n\nSo who owns Equitix Capital Eurobond 6 Ltd? Well, Equitix Capital Eurobond 6 Ltd. is owned by Equitix Holdings Ltd., a company at the same address in the City of London.\n\nPace Bidco Ltd Owns Equitix Holdings Ltd\n\nSo who owns Equitix Holdings Ltd? Well, Equitix Holdings Ltd is owned by Pace Bidco Ltd, a company curiously enough also at the same address.\n\nPace Topco Ltd Owns Pace Bidco Ltd\n\nSo who owns Pace Bidco Ltd? Well, Pace Bidco Ltd is owned by Pace Topco Ltd, a company which turns out to be also at the same address!\n\nReade Griffith Owns Pace Topco Ltd\n\nSo who owns Pace Topco Ltd? Well, here, we finally get the name of a human being. It is a Mr. Reade Griffith whose address is given as Polygon Global Partners LLP, 4 Sloane St, London.\n\nOn another page of the register a Mr. Reade Eugene Griffith is given as a director of Pace Topco Ltd, presumably the same person. This would also appear to be the same individual as the E. Griffith Reade who is listed as \u2014 amongst other interests \u2014 the 10 percent owner of Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc.\n\nUnknown Investors\n\nPolygon is a hedge fund. It would appear likely from the register to be either Polygon or Griffith\u2019s umbrella hedge fund Tetragon that owns these liveried RAF aircraft. We have therefore simply no idea who the investors are. The true ownership is deliberately shrouded in secrecy.\n\nThis spaghetti tangle of ownership of RAF aircraft is rather surprising to those of us who naively believed that RAF military aircraft belonged to the RAF, and that the hundreds of billions of pounds the state lavishes on \u201cdefence\u201d was used to do things like buy military jets, rather than make rich financiers still richer.\n\nNo U.K. politician has ever proposed to increase defence spending by more than Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who wants to lift it by \u00a3120 billion a year.\n\nThe RAF\u2019s Voyager aircraft are effectively being provided under the Private Finance Initiative. Exactly how much money the hedge fund managers and this string of companies are taking out of the defence budget is hard to know.\n\nOne particularly surprising fact is that it is plain that the private companies are also providing the RAF ground crew. Who employs the flight crews is not entirely clear.\n\nSome British military personnel are in fact contracted mercenaries. It gives new context to the active RAF involvement in the genocide in Gaza.\n\nCraig Murray is an author, broadcaster and human rights activist.

        "paragraph_summary": "The article by Craig Murray reveals the complex ownership structure of the Royal Air Force's (RAF) Voyager refueling aircraft, which are not owned by the RAF but by a series of private companies ultimately controlled by Polygon Global Partners LLP, a hedge fund.

The ownership chain involves several companies, including Airbus and Equitix Capital Eurobond, with significant shares, and ultimately leads to Reade Griffith of Polygon Global Partners. This intricate web of ownership highlights how public funds intended for defense are funneled to enrich financiers, challenging assumptions about military asset ownership and raising concerns about transparency and accountability in defense spending. The article also notes that some British military personnel are effectively contracted mercenaries, adding a controversial dimension to the RAF's involvement in international conflicts.",

Non-violent protesters are not terrorists.\n\nBy Richard Norton-Taylor\n\nDeclassified UK\n\nThe government\u2019s plan to ban Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation is a hugely significant step in the steady erosion of civil liberties.\n\nThis decline began under Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, was advanced by the last Tory government and is now pursued enthusiastically by Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer.\n\nHis home secretary, Yvette Cooper, will be applauded by Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which said the protestors who spray painted aircraft at RAF Brize Norton should be charged with treason.\n\nThe government also knows the move has the added approval of the Israeli government, pro-Israel lobbies and arms companies.\n\n\u2018Treated Harshly\u2019\n\nPalestine Action\u2019s trademark is damaging machinery at factories in the U.K. that make weapons for Israel\u2019s military.\n\nCooper said several acts of serious damage by Palestine Action since its creation in 2020 had cost \u201cmillions of pounds,\u201d unintentionally driving home the point that the alleged crime is financial loss and damage to property, as opposed to mass murder.\n\nThe aircraft painted by Palestine Action at Brize Norton are from the Voyager fleet, which the RAF used to refuel U.S. jets during Donald Trump\u2019s bombardment of Yemen this year in sorties that killed hundreds of civilians.\n\nMinisters might well assume the move would be welcomed by U.S. President Donald Trump, who called Palestine Action \u201cterrorists\u201d that should be \u201ctreated harshly\u201d after they defaced his Scottish golf resort.\n\nThe Terrorism Act 2000, under which Palestine Action looks set to be proscribed, gives police enormous discretion.\n\nThey can question an individual for up to six hours \u201cwhether or not\u201d there are \u201cgrounds for suspecting\u201d the person has been involved in terrorist activities.\n\nPeople convicted of \u201csupporting\u201d the group could face 14 years in prison. [On Friday, four people were arrested in connection with spraying the planes, the BBC reports.]\n\n\u2018Bad Move\u2019\n\nCounter-terrorism laws have long been the first refuge of governments anxious to promote a climate of fear and insecurity.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2018 successive governments introduced 13 separate statutes designed to catch more and more people in the \u201canti-terrorism\u201d net.\n\nEarlier this year, Starmer, said people-smuggling should be seen as a security threat \u201csimilar to terrorism\u201d.\n\nStella Rimington, a former head of MI5, many years ago criticised politicians for trying to outbid each other in their opposition to terrorism.\n\n\u201cNational security has become much more of a political issue,\u201d she told me. \u201cParties are tending to use it as a way of trying to get at the other side. You know, \u2018We\u2019re more tough on terrorism than you are.\u2019 I think that\u2019s a bad move, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nDame Eliza Manningham-Buller, another ex-head of MI5, has warned the government risked banning \u201cnon-violent extremists\u201d from speaking at universities.\n\nSimilarly, Max Hill KC, when he was the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, warned the government about trying \u201cto criminalise thought.\u201d\n\nCalling Property Damage Terrorism\n\nThen in the wake of calls that last year\u2019s Southport killer should be treated like a terrorist, Hill\u2019s successor Jonathan Hall warned the definition of terrorism should not be expanded or changed as it could lead to \u201cthe prosecution of people who by no stretch of the imagination are terrorists\u201d.\n\nHe said this week that to his knowledge the ban on Palestine Action would be the \u201cfirst time that a group has been proscribed on the basis of serious damage to property\u201d in Britain rather than because of the use of, or support for, serious violence.\n\nBut he added that targeting the Brize Norton base had moved the group\u2019s activities into \u201cthe zone of national security\u201d and that had acted as \u201ca tipping point\u201d for the government.\n\nIn his introduction to the government\u2019s new National Security Strategy, published on June 24, Starmer said:\n\n\u201cWe must strengthen our approach to domestic security, where threats continue to grow in their scale and complexity. Not just in terms of terrorism as traditionally understood\u2026\u201d\n\nSo the message from this Labour government is clear: protestors will face unprecedented jail sentences and fines for actions never before considered to be akin to terrorism and for crimes that involve no violence against individuals.\n\nThis should concern everyone, especially Starmer himself. When he was a human rights lawyer in 2004, he defended a man who broke into a NATO airbase in Gloucestershire and tried to burn down a warplane in protest at the Iraq war.\n\nRichard Norton-Taylor is an editor, journalist, playwright and the doyen of British national security reporting.

He traces this trend back to Tony Blair's premiership, noting its continuation under subsequent governments, including the current Labour leadership under Keir Starmer. The move to ban Palestine Action, known for damaging machinery at UK factories producing weapons for Israel, is seen as aligning with pro-Israel lobbies and arms companies. Norton-Taylor criticizes the broad application of counter-terrorism laws, which could lead to severe penalties for non-violent protestors, equating property damage with terrorism. He warns that this approach risks criminalizing dissent and expanding the definition of terrorism to include actions not traditionally considered as such.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, prompting the military prosecution to call for a review into possible war crimes.\u201d\n\nOne Israeli soldier attests that civilians seeking aid are \u201ctreated like a hostile force?\u2014?no crowd-control measures, no tear gas?\u2014?just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe open fire early in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters away, and sometimes we just charge at them from close range. But there\u2019s no danger to the forces,\u201d the soldier says, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of a single instance of return fire. There\u2019s no enemy, no weapons.\u201d\n\nIDF sources tell Haaretz that Gaza has become \u201ca place with its own set of rules\u201d where they are interacting with civilians with whom \u201cyour only means of interaction is opening fire.\u201d Deadly military weapons are used as crowd control to steer the starving populace wherever it\u2019s determined they\u2019re supposed to be, routinely killing desperate aid seekers.\n\nAnother soldier describes being instructed to fire artillery shells at a crowd to keep them at a distance, saying, \u201cEvery time we fire, there are casualties and deaths, and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there\u2019s never a good answer. Sometimes, merely asking the question annoys the commanders.\u201d\n\nIn quote after quote after quote we read Israeli soldiers describing atrocities they were ordered to commit which they knew were wrong. I guess Israel\u2019s PR machine never counted on some of the soldiers they sent in to perpetrate the Gaza holocaust having an actual conscience.\n\nA joint statement from Netanyahu and Katz denounced the report, accusing Haaretz of publishing \u201cblood libels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe State of Israel absolutely rejects the contemptible blood libels that have been published in the Ha\u2019aretz newspaper, according to which \u2018IDF Soldiers Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian Aid.\u2019 These are malicious falsehoods designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military in the world,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cBlood libel\u201d refers to the way medieval Europeans used to falsely accuse Jews of murdering Christian children in blood sacrifices?\u2014?an early form of atrocity propaganda used to justify the persecution of Jews.\n\nSo again, just to be absolutely clear, the leader of the Israeli government is claiming that an Israeli newspaper quoting Israeli soldiers describing their own atrocities is antisemitic. And that mountains of testimony from inside the IDF is \u201cdesigned to defame the IDF, the most moral military in the world.\u201d\n\nWhat can I even say about that here? It speaks for itself. I have nothing to add.\n\nThe more exposed Israel\u2019s criminality becomes, the more absurd the arguments made in its defense are getting.\n\nCaitlin Johnstone\u2019s work is entirely reader-supported, so if you enjoyed this piece please consider sharing it around, following her on Facebook, Twitter, Soundcloud, YouTube, or throwing some money into her tip jar on Ko-fi, Patreon or Paypal.

Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nBy Video, 28 May 2025\n\nI\u2019m glad to be back at a Committee for the Republic salon, if only by video link. It has been a pleasure to interact with our speaker tonight, to whom John Henry introduced me only a few months ago. You are in for a treat.\n\nAlvin Graylin is that rare American who not only understands artificial intelligence, having started at least four companies involved with the development of AI, but who is au courant with China\u2019s AI industry as well as our own. He is a thinker who has important things to say and who says them clearly, even if he tosses in an acronym or two. I remember reading a science fiction novel as a kid in which, on page 3, it was revealed that the Pentagon had had to be torn down after it was discovered that acronyms cause cancer. I\u2019ve asked Alvin to keep the acronyms to a minimum in case there are people here tonight who are less immersed in the culture and jargon of Silicon Valley or \u4e2d\u5173\u6751 than he is.\n\nAlvin sees AI as bringing huge benefits to humankind and can persuasively describe these. Of course, he also recognizes that the first thing human beings usually do with new interactive technologies, like the internet, is use them for one-upmanship, warfare, the dissemination of pornography, and the perpetration of scams. As Confucius remarked, the essence of man is gluttony and lust. (For some reason, he did not mention greed. I guess he wasn\u2019t a hedge fund guy.)\n\nAlvin believes that it is crucial for the two nations leading the development of AI \u2013 China and the United States \u2013 to cooperate to maximize the enormous benefits it promises and minimize the risks it poses. I find his arguments convincing. I think many of you will too. We have a great deal to gain from AI if we put the best American and Chinese minds to work at gaining it. Conversely, if we don\u2019t work together, we face risks that should be countered or avoided.\n\nWill AI manage the battlefields of the future by treating human beings as expendable cannon fodder? Will it do to white collar workers what automation has done to blue collar workers, eliminating their jobs and making them redundant? Will it do what another science fiction story I read long ago posited? In that story, all the world\u2019s computers were connected so that scientists could ask the array a pressing question. The scientists turned it on and asked it: \u201cIs there a god?\u201d A lightning bolt then struck its on/off switch, and it spoke, saying: \u201cNow there is!\u201d\n\nThere is an urgent need for China and the United States to explore how to use AI to optimize the betterment of the human future while limiting its downside. Alvin Graylin has thought a lot about why and how to do this, as you will hear. Please join John and me in welcoming him.",

        "text": "Peace in Ukraine, Peace in Europe\n\nRemarks to a Conference on Strategic Challenges and the Emerging New Order\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nBy video, 24 May 2025\n\nIn the West, this is a time of forever wars. Forever wars have no defined or achievable objectives. Therefore, they include no plan for their termination or the reconciliation of the parties to their results. In forever wars, what passes for strategy is the fantasy that the will of the enemy will somehow evaporate, leading to its unconditional surrender. But \u2018we will win, they will lose\u2019 is a pipe dream, not a program. Even wars of attrition need steadfast purposes that both sides can, eventually, reluctantly agree to.\n\nIn the West, this is an era of fantasy foreign policy. In it, governments and media oligopolies use addictive modern technologies to dictate fictional versions of trends and events. This century has shown that determined propagandists can now fool most of the people most of the time. But reality exists whether people believe in it or not. Policies built on delusions cannot overcome it. What has been lost on the ground can be denied at pep rallies, but it cannot be recovered at the negotiating table.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has not \u201cweakened and isolated Russia.\u201d Far from it. But it has devastated and depopulated Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s ambition to ban the language and culture of its Russian and other minorities and to quell their resistance to forcible assimilation has failed. The war has put paid to the West\u2019s effort to incorporate Ukraine into an alliance hostile to Russia. Europe\u2019s need for post-Cold War security architecture to make it \u201cwhole and free\u201d remains unfulfilled.\n\nPeace is the restrained tolerance of a postwar status quo by those with the capability to alter it by violence. The West is without any plan for peace. And rather than a \u201cEurope whole and free,\u201d the Ukraine war has produced a Europe divided and in the process of abandoning free speech and liberal democracy.\n\nThose who are in the process of losing wars can be forgiven for dreaming of ceasefires but not for failing to recognize that they cannot impose a ceasefire on an advancing enemy. Nor can they credibly issue ultimatums. An enemy that is unbowed will predictably insist on terms that serve its interests and the war aims it has set for itself. As the Roman statesman Seneca observed, \u201cit is expedient for the victor to wish for peace, [but] for the vanquished it is necessary.\u201d To imagine otherwise is to compound disaster. Ukraine is not vanquished, but it is being broken. If there is no peace, it risks further dismemberment as well as suffering and the possible loss of its access to the sea.\n\nAny negotiating position that ignores realities because they are unpalatable is bound to fail. A triumphant enemy has a veto over what is possible. Basing peace talks on the attribution to Russia of nefarious objectives it has never professed guarantees impasse. The West needs to get a grip on reality and cure itself of fears of Russian plans to conquer Europe for which there is no evidence. In three years of warfare, Russia has not conquered Ukraine. Both its ambitions and its capabilities fall well short of Europe\u2019s hallucinatory view of them.\n\nOver three decades, Russia consistently asked how to construct a peaceful order in Europe. The West\u2019s adamant refusal to address the issues of concern to Russia finally provoked it to go to war. One of Russia\u2019s questions has found a costly answer in that war. The West now has no choice but to address those questions that remain.\n\nRussian speakers in Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson are now under Russian protection. They will not accept subjugation by Ukraine and Russia will not ask them to do so. But the other questions that sparked the war have not changed.\n\nCan Ukraine enjoy security by returning to the neutrality it proclaimed at its independence? If so, with what assurances and under what guarantees from whom?\n\nCan Europe, including Russia, replace division and confrontation with unity in diversity and cooperation among all its states? What framework can be agreed to enable this?\n\nIf Americans and Europeans do not at last address these questions forthrightly, there will be no peace in Ukraine, in Europe, or with Russia. A peace can yet arise from the ashes of war in Europe if Europeans pursue it with the realism and empathy that are the foundation of all sound statecraft.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. argues that the West's unrealistic foreign policies and failure to address Russia's security concerns have prolonged the war in Ukraine, and emphasizes the need for realistic negotiations and a new security framework in Europe to achieve lasting peace.",
        "paragraph_summary": "In his remarks to a conference on strategic challenges, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the West's approach to the ongoing war in Ukraine, describing it as part of a broader trend of \"forever wars\" characterized by undefined objectives and unrealistic strategies. He argues that the war has not weakened Russia but has instead devastated Ukraine, thwarting its efforts to integrate into Western alliances and leaving Europe divided. Freeman emphasizes the need for realistic peace negotiations that acknowledge the complexities of the situation, including the protection of Russian-speaking minorities in Ukraine and the broader security concerns of Russia. He calls for a reevaluation of Europe's security architecture, urging a return to Ukraine's neutrality and advocating for cooperation and unity across Europe, including Russia. Without addressing these critical questions, Freeman warns, there can be no lasting peace in Ukraine or Europe.",

        "text": "Notes for a Panel on Sino-American Perceptions and Misperceptions\n\nWatson Institute , Brown University\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island May 8, 2025\n\nThere is now an effective American ideological blackout on Chinese realities. The default American position is hostility to a China that mostly exists only in our imaginations.\n\nPeople believe what they hear. And all they hear about China is highly prejudicial. None of the three branches of the U.S. government now has active exchanges with China. Members of Congress pretend to know all about China without ever having visited the place.\n\nAll sorts of false or unsubstantiated statements are now taken by Americans as axiomatic. Official policy reflects these distorted perceptions, to include:\n\nA supposed Chinese desire to emulate the late, unlamented USSR by imposing its rule on its neighbors and its authoritarian ideology on the world or the United States.\n\nThe assertion that, because the Chinese system doesn\u2019t resemble our self-described democracy, it is inherently illegitimate and is regarded as such by the Chinese people, whom we should support in efforts to engineer regime change in Beijing.\n\nCharges that it\u2019s China rather than the United States that rejects the institutions and rules governing international economic and political interaction and scoffs at or ignores the UN, WTO, and international treaties and conventions and that it is China that takes a scofflaw position on everything from genocide to the laws of war.\n\nVarious evidence-free ideological conceits. For example, the notions that Constitutional democracy is a prerequisite for scientific and technological innovation, the gangsterish idea that every adversary has a breaking point or one at which its subordination can be bought, and \u201cDemocratic peace theory,\u201d which asserts that countries that practice Western-style democracy are peace-loving while other regime types are not.\n\nAttributing U.S. manufacturing job losses to Chinese competition rather than to steadily increasing productivity achieved through automation and to U.S. corporate decisions to outsource labor costs instead of retaining and retraining workers.\n\nTreating China\u2019s development of increasingly formidable self-defense capabilities as a threat to the United States rather than a challenge to American amour propre and military domination of the other side of the Pacific.\n\nExtrapolating a threat to third countries\u2019 sovereignty and territories from Beijing\u2019s efforts to pressure Taipei to negotiate a resolution of the unfinished Chinese civil war.\n\nDismissing China\u2019s claims to land features in the South China Sea out of hand while championing those of other countries with equally dubious claims.\n\nIntemperate Chinese reactions to American diatribe about these and other matters have reinforced mutual animosities. Congressional grandstanding on these issues has deeply offended Chinese. Mike Pompeo\u2019s patriotic invective epitomized this. Meanwhile, former Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian totally turned off Americans with his equally chauvinistic and counterproductive \u201cwolf warrior diplomacy.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s militant defense of its claims to islets, rocks, and reefs in the South and East China Seas has led to occasional confrontations with the U.S. Navy, while its escalating pressure on Taiwan has been answered with escalating American violations of the Sino-American agreements that had kept the peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait for five decades.\n\nChina foolishly ignored widening complaints about intellectual property theft and unfair trade and investment practices. Whatever the merits of these complaints, they cost China the support of the American political elite and much of the U.S. business community.\n\nBeijing did itself no favors by first tyrannizing, then pitching out most of the Western press, which now reports on China from Taipei, Seoul, and other places remote from Chinese realities. When China denies anyone remotely critical of it a visa or participation in a dialogue it violates its own \u201cunited front\u201d theory. Beijing\u2019s security agencies have in effect gone out of their way to turn foreign media against it and to give foreigners real axes to grind.\n\nThese actions by China aside, there are many more self-referential American reasons for our delusional view of it:\n\nDespite official information warfare and unprecedentedly shallow reporting by U.S. media, an increasing number of Americans are aware that China is rising while we are not.\n\nChina\u2019s rapid return to wealth and power is psychologically hard to take because it not only challenges U.S. primacy but also refutes the core beliefs of laissez-faire capitalist ideology.\n\nThe rise of China and other shifts in the world\u2019s balances threaten American primacy. Despite the disappearance of the circumstances that originally justified them, the United States seeks to retain global and regional economic, diplomatic, and military privileges and prerogatives\n\nHostile attitudes toward China that carried over from the era of \u201ccontainment\u201d during the Korean and Vietnam Wars persist.\n\nParanoia replicating fears of \u201cJapan as number one\u201d in the 1980s has translated into equally psychotic fantasies about a rising China in the 21 st\n\nToday\u2019s xenophobic racism echoes the era of the \u201cYellow Peril\u201d and the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II.\n\nThe demise of the USSR deprived Americans of a credible challenge to the warfare state and our military-industrial complex. Our cure for the resulting \u201cenemy deprivation syndrome\u201d was to designate China as the default enemy. China helpfully provided and continues to furnish the perceived high-tech threat needed to sustain the warfare state.\n\nAmericans have embraced xenophobic protectionism as an imagined cure for our domestic ills. A China that is beating us at our own capitalist game is the ideal b\u00eate noire.\n\nPopular American stereotypes about \u201cCommunist Parties\u201d substitute presuppositions for empirically observed realities. They lead to the culturally illiterate conclusion that, if you\u2019ve seen one Communist, you\u2019ve seen them all. In fact, few of the politicians pontificating on this subject have ever met a member of any Communist Party other than the Vietnamese (about whom they say nothing on the grounds that they are presumed to be anti-Chinese).\n\nAmericans now exhibit an odd combination of self-doubt, complacency, and hubris. The decay of constitutional democracy in America, the increasing decadence and culture wars affecting American society, and the diminishing capacity of the U.S. government to meet the expectations of its citizens have combined to produce a lack of self-confidence that feeds truculence.\n\nIngrained mutual hostility has ended diplomatic dialogue worthy of the name with Beijing, by contrast with Moscow during the Cold War. There is no dialogue between the political elites of the two countries beyond the performative. But there is intimate dialogue with Taipei, which remains determined to enlist the United States in its resistance to cross-Strait negotiations and its pursuit of expanded independence from the rest of China.\n\nWe live in an era in which the weird has been normalized. Some of the truly weird theories we now have invite comparison to those attributed:\n\nto the dark fantasies and charlatanism of Rasputin as Czarist Russia collapsed,\n\nto the socioeconomic lunacy of Mao Zedong\u2019s attempts to make China great again in the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d or the Cultural Revolution, or\n\nto Pol Pot\u2019s self-destructive animosity to the Cambodian administrative state.\n\nAmong the more deranged theories now guiding American policies and opinions are:\n\nThe idiosyncratic economics of Peter Navarro. He has persuaded our president that prosperity is best achieved by reducing the exchange of things we have for things we don\u2019t. This is an approach that has begun to leave our Treasury with abundant little green paper portraits of dead presidents while depriving ordinary Americans of the stuff they used to get in exchange for them.\n\nStephen Miran\u2019s plan to balance the U.S. trade account by persuading China and other countries to stop buying the Treasury bonds that finance chronic U.S. budget deficits while somehow preserving the dollar as the global reserve currency.\n\nThe Trumpian notion that Americans can use our waning economic power to strong-arm allies, friends, and adversaries into funding continuing U.S. global hegemony.\n\nThe claim that our president has the power to force China, the EU, and others to capitulate even as he quails before the sovereign might of El Salvador and Israel.\n\nEnough, already.\n\nAmericans need to get a grip on reality. Daniel Patrick Moynihan wisely observed that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but that no one is entitled to their own facts. We have now reversed that. Everyone is entitled to their own facts while no one is entitled to an opinion that differs from the prevailing political narrative.\n\nOur problems result from things we did to ourselves. Picking fights with China will not cure our problems. We need to do that.",

Freeman criticizes the lack of direct engagement between the U.S. and China, noting that Congress often operates on assumptions without firsthand experience. He points out that American narratives falsely attribute U.S. economic issues to China, misinterpret China's defense developments as threats, and dismiss China's territorial claims while supporting equally dubious claims from other nations. Freeman also discusses how mutual animosities are exacerbated by aggressive rhetoric from both sides, leading to confrontations and a breakdown in diplomatic dialogue. He argues that American attitudes are influenced by historical biases and a need to maintain global dominance, which have led to a skewed perception of China as an adversary. Freeman calls for a reassessment of these views, emphasizing that the U.S. must address its own internal issues rather than externalizing them through conflict with China.",

        "text": "How Competitive is the U.S. with China?\n\nRemarks to the Boston Community Church & East Bay Citizens for Peace\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nBoston, Massachusetts & Bristol, Rhode Island April 18 & 19, 2025\n\nWe Americans have bet our future on competition with China. The keys to winning this competition are domestic economic and technological renewal as well as enhanced influence abroad. So far, the evidence suggests that we are achieving neither, yet we have just started an economic forever war with China. What is happening reminds me of the saying: QUOS DEUS VULT PERDERE, PRIUS DEMENTAT. \u201cWhom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.\u201d\n\nOur country now disparages public service. It is taking a chain saw to its institutions. Such self-sabotage weakens our state capacity, reduces our situational awareness, clouds our decision making, degrades essential government services, and fuels rather than alleviates popular discontent. These trends invite adversaries to exploit American decline. They also cost us the respect and support of allies and friends.\n\nWe Americans have long been in denial about our many domestic and foreign problems. They are now visibly getting worse. Subconsciously, we appear to understand this, but we blame it on everyone but ourselves. Our allies and friends see us chaotically making threats, imposing tariffs, and coveting territory. They view our predatory behavior as an irrational and incoherent response by us to challenges that are largely of our own making.\n\nJust short of 30 percent of Americans chose Donald J. Trump as our president in the hope that he would \u201cmake America great again.\u201d But what he and his unelected billionaire buddies, band of talking heads, and digital delinquents are doing is not correcting the bumbling Biden administration\u2019s legacy but undermining both our long-term competitiveness and our standing abroad.\n\nLet me count the ways:\n\nOur alliances. We are alarming and alienating those countries historically most friendly and loyal to us. We menace Canada with hostile takeover We threaten to seize Greenland from Denmark (like Canada, a NATO ally). Polls show that many allies now regard us as a threat rather than a partner or protector. As we shut ourselves off from global trade, we treat them no better than our foes. In a world of loosening relationships, this all but guarantees that some of them will seek to separate their fates from ours.\n\nWe are alarming and alienating those countries historically most friendly and loyal to us.

Protectionism is an explicit admission that many elements of our economy as currently structured can no longer stand up to foreign competition. Our new habit of banning technological innovations made elsewhere from our market is even more damaging. This subsidizes and preserves uncompetitive backwardness. (Consider the steel industry, electric vehicles, TikTok, DeepSeek, solar panels, wind power, and telecommunications as examples.) By denying ourselves the benefits of intellectual advances by others, we have chosen a path that leads inexorably to technological inferiority.\n\n.

Denying U.S. IT companies access to China, their largest overseas market, deprives them of the revenue they need to stay ahead of their Chinese and other competitors.\n\nAs the saying goes, when the winds of change blow, some people build walls, while others build windmills. Rather than focusing on self-improvement and seizing opportunities, Americans have chosen to throw our declining weight around internationally. We rely on brute-force economic, financial, or military coercion to bring other countries to heel. This is no way to compete with China or any other rising or resurgent great power. And it is no way to \u201csecure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, despite many difficulties and not a few mistaken policies, China continues to power ahead. While we scapegoat and bully others, the Chinese remain single-mindedly focused on enhancing their economic, scientific, and technological prowess. They are ready, willing, and able to reach out to the foreign partners we are alienating. China had a couple of bad centuries, but it is back \u2013 and in the process of resuming its millennial position as the world\u2019s largest economy. [slide 2]\n\nChina\u2019s growth has slowed, but it is still growing twice as fast as the United States. In purchasing power terms \u2013 which avoid the significant distortions imposed by an overvalued U.S. dollar \u2013 the Chinese economy is already one-third larger than ours. [slide 3] China produces more than one third of the world\u2019s manufactures. [slide 4] It is the world\u2019s largest trading nation and the principal trading partner of more than 100 countries. Over one-fourth of the world\u2019s STEM workers are Chinese. That proportion is growing. Nearly half of the world\u2019s patent applications now originate in China. [slide 5]\n\nU.S. export controls, sanctions, and other efforts to hamstring or reverse Chinese advances are demonstrably not working. Their main effects have been to stimulate China to redouble its efforts to become self-sufficient, to boost its commitment to science and technology, to further improve its already formidable educational standards, and to explore ways to counter U.S. financial hegemony. The latest \u201cNature Index\u201d rates Harvard as the world\u2019s number one university in natural and health sciences, with MIT in tenth place. Chinese universities hold places two through nine.[1]\n\nChina\u2019s challenges to our global preeminence are economic, scientific, and technological. There are no Chinese warships or bombers off our coasts. China espouses no territorial claims against us. But, in accordance with our heavily militarized approach to foreign affairs, our response to China\u2019s resurgence is almost entirely military. We have ringed China with bases aimed at it. [slide 6] We conduct three or four aggressive patrols of its coasts and island bastions daily.\n\nSeventy-five years ago, we intervened militarily to protect the losing side of the Chinese civil war by separating it and Taiwan from the rest of China. Since then, the Taiwan issue has been an embryonic Sino-American casus belli. We refuse to say whether we would use force to counter an attempt by Beijing to recover it. But the Chinese assume we would. They are acting accordingly.\n\nThe result is escalating Sino-American tension and an arms race that our military commanders suggest we are in the process of losing. Of course, we can\u2019t be sure this isn\u2019t just their usual use of threat inflation to further inflate their budgets and gratify the military-industrial complex they expect to join upon retirement.\n\nStill, Chinese military innovations are indeed impressive.\n\nA huge arsenal of very accurate missiles, including some capable of striking naval vessels at long distances, others that are hypersonic, and many that are road mobile.\n\nBy far the world\u2019s largest navy, including ever more capable aircraft and carriers for them as well as submarines, world-beating drones, innovative landing craft, long-range ship-to-ship missiles, and rail guns.\n\nThe world\u2019s third largest air force, including both fifth generation and prototype \u201csixth generation\u201d aircraft. Advanced air defenses and electronic warfare as well as cyber-attack capabilities.\n\nThe initial battleground in any US-China war would be in China, including Taiwan, and China\u2019s near seas. China would be fighting on its own doorstep, enjoying very short lines of communication and supply lines. The United States be projecting power to a battlefield over 7,000 miles away from our West Coast. China would enjoy the many advantages of being on the defensive. From Beijing\u2019s perspective, the war would be about recovering and defending Chinese territory against foreign attack \u2013 about things that Chinese care much more about than Americans do.\n\nMultiple wargames predict that a US-China war over Taiwan could cost both sides the bulk of their navies and aircraft. China has the industrial surge capacity to replace its ships and aircraft, but we do not. Losses on the scale predicted would cripple the United States as a global power, not just cost it its eight-decade-old dominance of Pacific Asia.\n\nThe one certain outcome of a war over the political status of Taiwan would be the destruction of its democracy as well as its prosperity and industrial base. The ruin of Taiwan\u2019s advanced electronic industries would ensure huge collateral damage to the world economy. Such a war would have no winners even if it did not escalate to the nuclear level (which both sides assume it could).\n\nNotwithstanding this, the focus of U.S. policy in Pacific and South Asia at present is on preparing for a trans-Pacific war with China and on persuading U.S. allies in the region to let Americans use bases on their territory against China. In response, China is preparing for war with America.\n\nThe U.S. and China\u2019s defense budgets are structured so differently that it is hard to compare them. Both omit significant amounts of military-related spending and cover them in other budgets. All in all, however, China now appears to be spending less than 2 percent of its GDP on national defense, while the U.S. defense department\u2019s budget alone is about 3.6 percent of GDP. Including U.S. military-related spending in other departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 budgets brings total U.S. military spending to about 5.4 percent of U.S. GDP.\n\nThe disparity in spending levels reflects many factors, not least of which is the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s exclusive focus on the security of the Chinese homeland and adjacent areas versus a U.S. military force structure designed to preserve U.S. global primacy by projecting American power to every corner of the world rather than to defend the American homeland. Our \u201cdefense department\u201d is misnamed. In reality, it is an \u201coffense department.\u201d If Americans\u2019 concern were truly limited to defending ourselves, we would spend a lot less. We would also consider diplomacy as a cheaper and more reliable way to make more friends and fewer enemies.\n\nOf course, defense budgets do not decide the outcome of warfare. But the balance of fervor often does, as the failure of our effort to prevent the unification of Vietnam or to pacify Afghanistan should remind us. In a bloody American rendezvous with Chinese nationalism over Taiwan, the balance of fervor would strongly favor China. So, increasingly, would the military balance. The more both sides prepare for war, the more likely it becomes.\n\nU.S. policy has shifted from favoring a peaceful settlement of the divisions between Taipei and Beijing to de facto support for Taiwan\u2019s indefinite separation from the China mainland. This approach rejects diplomacy to rely entirely on military posturing against China. It is a direct challenge to China\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security as well as to its amour-propre.\n\nChina sees unsettling analogies to the evolution of U.S. policy toward the war in Ukraine. The U.S. objective has not been to promote Ukraine\u2019s wellbeing or its domestic tranquility \u2013 still less to save Ukrainian lives \u2013 but to counter, \u201cisolate, and weaken Russia.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in the case of Taiwan, the U.S. seems less concerned about Taiwan and its inhabitants than about showing China who\u2019s boss, weakening it, and containing its influence abroad. China is as opposed to the strategic use of Taiwan against it as Russia has been to the incorporation of Ukraine into an alliance hostile to it, or as the United States was to a menacing Soviet presence on the island of Cuba.\n\nRussia\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine has been carefully limited. It may seem to demonstrate that superpowers can conduct a proxy war without resorting to nuclear weapons. But a war over Taiwan would not be a proxy war fought in a third country like Korea, Vietnam, or Ukraine but a war conducted directly between U.S. and Chinese forces on territory universally acknowledged to be Chinese \u2013 Taiwan and the China mainland. Such a war could not and would not be \u201climited.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese would inevitably respond to U.S. devastation of parts of their homeland by counterattacking ours. Each side would be tempted to employ nuclear weapons to incapacitate the other. The United States is currently engaged in a massive program of nuclear force modernization aimed explicitly at prevailing in a war with China.\n\nThe United States remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons against another people. U.S. nuclear doctrine explicitly authorizes a nuclear first strike on enemies, whether nuclear-armed or not. In the past, on at least three occasions, our government has threatened to launch a nuclear attack on China. We have provided no assurance that we will not do so again.\n\nThis and the mounting likelihood of a Sino-American war over Taiwan have catalyzed a change in Chinese nuclear strategy. China was long content with a minimal nuclear capability \u2013 a force de frappe \u2013 one able to respond to a nuclear attack by taking enough of a bite out of the enemy to cause it to think twice about using nuclear weapons to attack any part of China. But China is now embracing \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d and building a nuclear force that could destroy the United States, if Americans use nuclear weapons to attack it.\n\nA war that not only cannot be won but that also risks becoming existential should obviously never be fought. Our diplomacy should focus on ensuring that it never is. A diplomacy-free, all-military-all-the-time U.S. policy toward China like our current policy therefore makes no sense.\n\nChina\u2019s military posture is defensive. Our military is in China\u2019s face. The People\u2019s Liberation Army is not in ours. It will not appear off our coasts or in our hemisphere unless we drive it to reciprocate our threatening presence on its borders. Our current policies risk convincing China eventually to do just that.\n\nThis underscores the absurdity of how Americans are dealing with China\u2019s return to its millennial wealth and power. China\u2019s eclipse of U.S. global primacy and dominance of Pacific Asia is grounded in its growing scientific, technological, and economic dynamism. [slide 7] It is not military, even if the People\u2019s Republic has now built a formidable capacity to defend itself.\n\nUnlike the Soviet Union, China does not occupy other countries or seek to impose its authoritarian ideology on them or us. Unlike Nazi Germany, China is not in search of \u201cLebensraum.\u201d Unlike Imperial Japan or European imperialists, China does not pursue military-colonial control of foreign natural resources or labor. Nor does China seek to replicate the imperial market preferences and mercantilism of past empires.\n\nThese analogies are false. But groupthink born of anxieties about American decline has transformed them and evidence-free conjectures into accepted \u201caxioms\u201d that are constantly reiterated and that cannot be questioned. Our present China policies are based on \u201cpolitically correct\u201d assumptions born of conjectures rather than the realities they misdescribe. They are dogmatic, delusional, and dangerous. And they come with high opportunity costs.\n\nThe ironies in this situation abound.\n\nWe Americans accuse China of seeking to replace the US-sponsored world order with its own. But China is far more committed to the post-war order\u2019s core ideas of free trade and multilateralism than we now are. It has integrated itself into that order and used its rules to advance Chinese interests. Unlike us, China has not withdrawn from the World Trade Organization (WTO), launched protectionist trade wars, or condemned international institutions like the World Court (ICJ) for doing their job. The new institutions China has helped create, like the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank, complement Bretton Woods institutions like the World Bank and mirror their rules. They supplement rather than replace the pre-existing world order. China is among the staunchest supporters of the United Nations Charter and the Westphalian order it is meant to regulate.\n\nWe accuse China of \u201caggression.\u201d China has indeed defended its longstanding claims to islets, reefs, and fishing grounds against other claimants in its near seas and its disputed border with India, but it has not made all-out war on, invaded, dismembered, or occupied other countries as we have. It does not seek to annex the territories or take possession of the canals in other countries. Unlike us, China has not backed others, like Israel, in wars of annihilation and territorial aggrandizement. Instead, it has made itself available as a peacemaker and mediator, most notably between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nWe accuse China of attempting to thwart our campaign to \u201cisolate and weaken\u201d Russia. But China has not recognized the separation of Crimea and other Russian-speaking oblasts from Ukraine any more than it has recognized NATO\u2019s forced separation of Kosovo from Serbia. China continues to trade with both Ukraine and Russia. If China is definitely not \u201cwith us,\u201d it is not necessarily \u201cagainst us.\u201d\n\nWe accuse China of \u201cmalign behavior.\u201d In practice, this seems to mean any reduction in our international influence, wherever it occurs, whatever the cause. China has emerged as the largest contributor to the economic development of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It may or may not now attempt to fill the vacuum that our sudden embrace of protectionism and our mean-spirited cessation of foreign assistance have created. Other countries are poised to ask it to do so. We shall see how it responds.\n\nThere are lots of things to criticize about China and its political system. China also has more than its fair share of problems. But it is for Chinese, not us, to deal with them. In this context, mirror-imaging to produce a portrait of China that much of the world would say better describes us is not just a faulty basis for policy but counterproductive.\n\nIt is entirely correct to describe China as a \u201csystemic challenge\u201d to our current internal disorder and decadence, fiscal improvidence, oligopoly- and plutocracy-dominated economy, complacent sense of superiority, jingoistic foreign policy, job-stripping financial capitalism, and collapsing educational standards. But the operative question for Americans is what to do about these things. There are many elements of the Chinese system from which we might usefully draw inspiration, but China\u2019s authoritarianism and disrespect for the rule of law, which we are now inadvertently emulating, should not be among them.\n\nWe cannot replay the strategy of \u201ccontainment\u201d that successfully isolated the Soviet Union until it succumbed to its own defects. Attempting to do so with China will isolate and impoverish us rather than the Chinese. China is outperforming us. It faces many challenges, but it is socially stable, economically productive, ever more scientifically and technologically capable, increasingly innovative, and internationally engaged. We may snarl at globalization, but it is continuing without us. And China remains both at its center and a major beneficiary of it.\n\nAttempting to perpetuate our global primacy and Pacific-Asian hegemony by cutting ourselves off from China and the world is an evasion of the pressing need to reform our system to make it more competitive. Focusing on hamstringing China rather than getting our own act together entails huge opportunity costs.\n\nWe live on credit rollovers and pyramiding debt, yet we refuse to accept investment from China, which is capital rich and prepared to finance improvements in our failing infrastructure, establish new factories here, and help expand U.S. agricultural production to assure food supplies for its own population as well as ours. China has the renewable energy technologies we need to go electric, but we seem determined to obstruct or ban our companies from importing or adopting them. Our economies are complementary, as their interdependence has amply demonstrated. We need a reset with China.\n\nIn this connection, diatribe is no substitute for diplomatic dialogue. It alienates and does not persuade. The Trump administration has at least one thing very right. U.S. security does not depend on coercing foreigners into conformity with our values. We could \u201cmake America [truly] great again\u201d by moving away from a mindset that quixotically insists on compelling others to conform to our increasingly unrealistic self-image. Instead, we should seek to understand other peoples \u2013 including the Chinese, respect them for who and what they are, and do our best to leverage their prosperity and technological advances to enhance our own.\n\n[1] https://www.nature.com/nature-index/research-leaders/2024/institution/academic/all/all",

        "text": "The End of Peace in Europe and the Western-dominated World Order?\n\nRemarks to an international conference on ending the disaster in Ukraine\n\norganized by Radio Roma News TV / Amici Network\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nBy video February 22, 2025\n\nHow wars end matters. The Napoleonic wars ended in the reconciliation of Europe\u2019s great powers, including the defeated French, at the Congress of Vienna. The resulting, inclusive \u201cConcert of Europe\u201d ensured a long, if imperfect, peace that ended only in World War I.\n\nThat war was fought mainly in Europe. It was followed by the vindictive exclusion of two great European powers from any role in or commitment to sustaining stability in Europe. The excommunication of Germany and Russia laid the basis for World War II, which \u2013 for Americans \u2013 was both transatlantic and transpacific. That war ended not in a peace but in a cold war \u2013 a tense but stable order sustained by mutual deterrence through military confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nThe failure to include a role for Russia in Europe commensurate with its power has now once again brought war to the continent. The lessons of history are clear. There can be no stable order in Europe that excludes any of its great powers. Those with no peaceful way to ensure respect for their security interests will see no reason not to use force to defend them. And if there is no prospect of a sustainable framework to safeguard their interests, they will prefer outcomes on battlefields to those contrived at the negotiating table.\n\nThis is the story of the Ukraine War. After nearly three decades of indifference and rejection of Russian security concerns by the United States and NATO, Russia issued an ultimatum demanding negotiations on three of these concerns:\n\n(1) neutrality for Ukraine rather than its incorporation into NATO \u2013 an alliance premised on armed hostility to Russia;\n\n(2) respect for the linguistic and cultural rights of Ukraine\u2019s large Russian-speaking population; and\n\n(3) agreement on Europe-wide security arrangements that could mitigate and relieve Russian security anxieties as well as those of the West.\n\nThe West flatly refused to discuss these issues. This left Russia with a choice between abandoning its ultimatum and accepting NATO and American forces everywhere on its western borders or going to war to prevent this. Russia quite predictably chose war, though it limited this to what it called a \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was followed within weeks by a draft treaty in which Ukraine met the basic Russian requirements. But the West was more interested in \u201cisolating and weakening\u201d Russia than in a ceasefire. It persuaded Ukraine to repudiate what it had agreed to.\n\nThe Ukraine War is now about to enter its fourth year. It has been catastrophic for Ukraine and humiliating for the West. Ukraine is on its last legs, depopulated, deindustrialized, depleted of military manpower, shorn of its democracy, bankrupt, and territorially reduced. Meanwhile, Russia has not been isolated or weakened. It has continued to limit its objectives, but its terms for peace are hardening. Ukraine\u2019s options continue to narrow.\n\nRussia will not cease to insist on a Ukraine that does not threaten it and a broader framework for peace in Europe. There will be no ceasefire or Korean-style \u201cdemilitarized zone\u201d between Russia and the West in Ukraine. The West has failed to prevail on the battlefield. It will not prevail at the negotiating table.\n\nThe alternative to war in Ukraine is nothing less than a peace that sets agreed borders between Ukraine and Russia and prevents the division of Europe into mutually hostile blocs. Achieving this will require Russia and the West each to address and take actions to alleviate the other\u2019s fears and suspicions. That will not be easy for either side. But it is time for both to try.\n\nAn agreement to end the war has clearly been made more difficult by the ways in which the world has changed since it began.\n\nThe United States has become a serial violator of the principle of PACTA SUNT SERVANDA (\u201cagreements must be kept\u201d). No one, least of all Russia, now trusts Washington to honor its word.\n\nThe collective West\u2019s shameless backing for Israel\u2019s sadistic genocide in Palestine, attacks on its neighbors, and territorial expansion have made it clear that the Atlantic community no longer adheres to or feels bound by international law.\n\nThe blatant double standards the West has applied to Ukraine and Palestine have cost it its moral authority with all the peoples it formerly colonized.\n\nThe \u201cglobal majority\u201d sees Western policies as unjust. The promiscuous imposition by the United States and G-7 of sanctions and other coercive measures on other countries has resulted in their almost universal withdrawal of respect for Western leadership and willingness to follow it.\n\nStrained and worsening relations between the West and resurgent powers like Brazil, India, and China that are interested in helping broker peace in Ukraine ensure that they will be less supportive of the West than they might otherwise have been.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these and other recent changes in the world order will be either mounting chaos or the emergence of a new international system in which renewed respect for the sovereign equality of nations and for their security concerns replaces the current global anarchy. How the war in Ukraine ends will determine which of these alternatives rules our future.",

        "text": "Is the Zionist State Now Doing Itself In?\n\nRemarks to the Community Church of Boston\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nBy Video, 4 October 2024\n\nThere will always be an Israel. It is a theological ideal and mythic memory that has survived millennia in the minds of observant Jews. Some Christians link Jewish dominance of Palestine to the second coming of Christ and the End of Days. The multinational religious communities that profess Judaism will ensure Israel\u2019s permanence as an idea. But both the Zionist State of Israel and the Jews who inhabit it are now in jeopardy. Palestine is where the humane values of Judaism have gone to die.\n\nAn abbreviated history seems appropriate.\n\nThe first Christians were Jews, but European Christendom never applied the brotherly love Jesus taught to the Jews in its midst. Instead, it classified them as socioreligious pariahs \u2013 an alien caste. Like the castes of India, Jews married only each other, had a distinctive religious identity, and were restricted to specialized socioeconomic roles. In the case of European Jews this meant occupations involving money lending and other sorts of financial engineering. European xenophobia, called \u201cantisemitism\u201d when directed at Jews, resulted not just in their persecution but in their occasional pillage and murder, for example by Crusaders preparing to conquer the Holy Land from its mostly Muslim inhabitants. It is fair to say that the Holocaust \u2013 the greatest atrocity of the 20th century among many \u2013 was less an innovation than the culmination of centuries of prejudice and persecution of Jews by other Europeans.\n\nAgainst this background, it is easy to understand the appeal of Zionism \u2013 an effort to transform Jewish religious identity into a national identity and to set up a state in which Jews would be a ruling majority rather than a vulnerable minority. Zionism\u2019s proponents argued that Jews, like other European ethnolinguistic groups, were entitled to self-determination. Ironically, Zionism thus embraced European Christendom\u2019s antisemitic designation of Jews not as adherents of a religious faith but as a \u201cpeople\u201d distinct from other Europeans.\n\nEuropean antisemites thought it would be just dandy to get rid of the Jews in their midst. But where should they go? What better than to export them to one of European colonialism\u2019s many overseas colonial dominions?\n\nMost of the original Zionists were not themselves religious but they judged correctly that locating their proposed state in the mythic homeland of Judaism \u2013 Palestine \u2013 would grant it a religious legitimacy it would otherwise lack. As Ilan Papp\u00e9, the noted Israeli historian, has quipped: they did not believe in God but insisted that He had promised Palestine to them. And, with the racist condescension typical of European imperialism, they ignored the presence of an indigenous population in their proposed homeland, describing Palestine as \u201ca land without people\u201d for the \u201cpeople without land\u201d that they were in the process of inventing.\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire imploded during the First World War, Britain \u2013 in an act intended to undermine Jewish support for Germany \u2013 declared its support for \u201cthe establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,\u201d provided that \u201cnothing shall be done \u2026 [to] prejudice the \u2026 rights of existing non-Jewish communities\u201d there.[1] But for the Jews colonizing Palestine the whole point was to establish Jewish supremacy there, not to affirm the rights of its non-Jewish inhabitants. A multifaceted Zionist campaign to dispossess the indigenous Palestinian Arab population was soon underway.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the increasingly brutal Nazi persecution of Jews in Germany led to a surge in Jewish emigration to Palestine. This set off the 1936 \u2013 1939 \u201cGreat Palestinian Revolt\u201d against both British rule and Zionist colonization. Britain reacted in 1939 by issuing a \u201cWhite Paper\u201d proclaiming a policy of establishing a Jewish homeland through regulated Jewish immigration to an unpartitioned, independent state of Palestine, which was to come into being within ten years.[2] Palestinian leaders feared this policy would dispossess them and firmly rejected it. For their part, armed Zionist settlers violently resisted its implementation, charging that it would put them at the mercy of Palestine\u2019s Arab Muslim and Christian majority.\n\nPrior to World War II, most European Jews opposed Zionism or were indifferent to it. The Nazi Holocaust understandably convinced them that to protect themselves and their posterity from genocide they needed to set up an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine.\n\nAfter the war, with more desirable safe havens \u2013 like the United States \u2013 denied to them, a mounting flood of European Jews sought resettlement in Palestine. Zionist paramilitaries simultaneously launched violent campaigns against the British authorities, Palestinian Arabs, and Jewish dissenters. Their aim was to achieve self-determination and establish an exclusively Jewish state by ridding Palestine of its indigenous inhabitants. Their targets included civilians as well as security personnel, government figures, and infrastructure. (In 1991, Yitzhak Shamir, a participant in this terrorist campaign who had become the prime minister of Israel, justified Jewish terrorism on the grounds that the Jews, stateless and persecuted, had no choice but to engage in it. By contrast, he asserted, the Palestinians, are \u201cfighting for land that is not theirs. This is the land of the people of Israel.\u201d) Zionism\u2019s morally blind sense of entitlement and reliance on terrorism against its opponents have never varied.\n\nIn the face of this, in 1947, the British threw up their hands and tossed the problem of Palestine into the lap of the United Nations. The UN \u2013 then dominated by colonial powers \u2013 imperiously recommended the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with the city of Jerusalem under international control. At the time, the population of Palestine was two-thirds Arab and one-third European Jewish. The UN plan nonetheless awarded fifty-six percent of the country, including most of its best agricultural land, to Jewish colonists, while allocating only forty-two percent of it to its native Arabs.\n\nPalestinian leaders, joined by every state in the region and newly independent India, opposed both partition and the UN plan for it as unfair. For newly independent states, the award of territory in Palestine to European Jewish settlers was a terminal affront as the age of racist Western colonialism sputtered to an end.\n\nUnder intense pressure, including death threats from Zionist activists, the UN General Assembly voted to approve the plan. Zionist leaders accepted it, while complaining that it would burden their proposed state in Palestine with a forty percent Arab minority. They began planning to seize more territory and Jerusalem if they could.\n\nThe British right to rule in Palestine was due to expire at midnight on May 14, 1948. In April of that year, newly augmented Zionist forces began an offensive to secure the cities and territories the UN partition plan had allotted to the proposed Jewish state, to encourage its indigenous inhabitants to leave, and to position themselves to seize even more land if the opportunity presented itself.\n\nA few hours before the British began their scheduled withdrawal from Palestine, the World Zionist Organization proclaimed the State of Israel and mobilized its armed forces. The next day military contingents from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Iraq entered Palestine. In the ensuing conflict, Zionist forces \u2013 many of them battle-hardened by warfare in Europe \u2013 took not only the territory assigned by the UN to a Jewish state but sixty percent of the territory designated for Palestine\u2019s Arabs. The new Israeli armed forces and Jewish militias conducted over seventy documented massacres of Palestinians and terrorized over 720,000 of them into abandoning their homes and fleeing to neighboring countries. Israeli forces also seized West Jerusalem, voiding its proposed status as part of an international city and complicating Jerusalem\u2019s continuation as a point of pilgrimage for the world\u2019s Muslims and Christians, for whom it was also a holy city.\n\nWhile Jews in the new state of Israel celebrated, those in the broader Arab world almost at once suffered the consequences of their European coreligionists\u2019 violent expulsion of over half of Palestine\u2019s Arab Muslim and Christian populations. Over the course of the next decade, the hate-filled reaction to this catastrophe \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0643\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 \u2013 in Arab countries led increasing numbers of Jewish Arabs to abandon their homes and flee to Israel. Israel\u2019s surprise attacks on Egypt in 1956 and on Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in 1967 as well as its several invasions of Lebanon then cemented Arab enmity to the Zionist state, fomented Arab and Muslim antisemitism, and resulted in the departure of all but a few of the ancient Jewish communities in the Islamic world. Once in Israel, Arab Jews were indoctrinated in the evils of the European Holocaust and assimilated to a national culture based on fear of renewed slaughter of Jews by hateful antisemites \u2013 equated with the 99.08 percent of non-Jewish human beings.\n\nIn its 1967 \u201cSix Day War,\u201d Israel gained control of all of Palestine, including East Jerusalem, as well as Syria\u2019s Golan Heights. This marked a fateful choice for Zionism. Having invented a \u201cJewish people\u201d to populate what it had proclaimed was \u201ca land without people,\u201d Zionists now faced the inconvenient reality that the land they had seized was, in fact, already populated. Israel could use its victory and its control of Palestine to dictate a basis for Israeli-Palestinian coexistence. Or it could persist in implementing policies designed to rid the West Bank and Gaza of its captive Arab populations. True to its Zionist origins, Israel chose to pursue the goal of eradicating all but a vestigial Arab Muslim and Christian presence in the Holy Land.\n\nIn the territories of pre-1967 Israel, a system of apartheid evolved, in which the twenty-percent Israeli Arab Muslim and Christian minority is discriminated against, segregated from Jewish Israelis, and denied many of the benefits available to Jewish citizens. In the West Bank, martial law evolved into a Kafkaesque system of checkpoints that oppressed and atomized its Palestinian inhabitants by separating them into 165 or so disconnected enclaves and progressively evicting them to make way for Jewish settlements and outposts in hundreds of places selected for their military value to the Israeli occupation and its annexationist agenda.\n\nThe cumulative result is the Israel of today, in which non-Jewish Arab Israelis are second-class citizens, Arabs in the occupied West Bank are disenfranchised and subject to Jewish settler and military terrorism, while the inhabitants of Gaza are being slaughtered and starved to death. As I speak, the extermination campaign in Gaza has been extended to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\n\nOccupation brutalizes the forces conducting it. Israel has been no exception. As time has gone on, the Israeli occupation forces and the conscripts that man them have become ever less constrained by morality or empathy for those they violently oppress.\n\nIn the beginning, Israel used pseudo-legal procedures to dispossess Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank but, as time went on, it came to rely ever more on terrorism by Jewish settlers, aided and abetted by the Israeli military. It is now openly applying the murderous techniques it pioneered in Gaza to the West Bank and Lebanon.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of Israeli settlements from Gaza in 2005, Israel transformed it into the world\u2019s largest concentration camp. It controlled Gaza with periodic invasions and massacres of its inhabitants in a policy that it sardonically called \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d On October 7 last year, Palestinians in Gaza \u2013 a persecuted people without a state of their own \u2013 responded by applying the logic of Yitzhak Shamir\u2019s justification of Zionist terrorism to the Israeli settlers and military reservists on Gaza\u2019s periphery.\n\nThe Zionist state\u2019s aim has been to create conditions so intolerable that Palestinians would voluntarily leave, transforming Palestine into the \u201cland without people\u201d it originally envisaged. In its effort to rid Palestine of its non-Jewish inhabitants, Israel has emerged as the world\u2019s most brazen violator of the norms enshrined in international law and the post-war Geneva conventions. Ironically, the world enacted these conventions precisely to preclude a recurrence of the cruelties that the Nazis and Japanese militarists had inflicted on occupied populations during World War II \u2013 most notably the genocide of Europe\u2019s Jews. With its behavior, Israel has turned the star of David on its flag into a global symbol not of resilience and redemption but of genocide and other crimes against humanity.\n\nIsrael\u2019s policies toward its captive Palestinian populations now blatantly violate the norms the post-war conventions enshrine. To cite a few obvious examples:\n\nArticle 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates that an occupying power must not transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, yet the Zionist state\u2019s settlement of occupied Palestinian lands is still its central mission and activity. Some 720,000 illegal Israeli settlers have dispossessed and now lord it over Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nThe same article provides that \u201ccollective penalties and all measures of intimidation or terrorism are prohibited. Pillage is prohibited. Reprisals against protected persons and their property are prohibited.\u201d Yet these measures are the very means by which Israel has long terrorized the inhabitants of both Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nArticle 76 of the same Convention prohibits an occupying power from murdering, torturing, mutilating, beating, or otherwise brutalizing the population under its control. Yet Israel relies on such sadistic practices \u2013 including sodomy and rape \u2013 to punish Palestinian prisoners, many of whom are detained without charge.\n\nThe separate Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948 defines genocide as destroying a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group in whole or in part. It criminalizes this behavior, the conspiracy to commit it, public incitement of it, the attempt to commit it, or complicity in it. The government of Israel and its army are currently committing every one of these crimes. The foreign governments supplying Israel with arms and protecting it in the United Nations have yet to face formal charges at the Hague but are full accomplices in this genocide.\n\nThe United Nations Charter demands that all states refrain from the threat or use of force against other states. Customary international law requires reprisals for violations of this prohibition to be proportional to the injury suffered. It restricts preemptive or anticipatory defensive actions to circumstances in which there is \u201ca necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment of deliberation.\u201d Yet Israel repeatedly retaliates disproportionately to any and all affronts, attacks its neighbors preemptively without regard to whether there is evidence of an imminent threat from them, and assassinates both their own officials and Palestinians on their soil.\n\nThis is not, by any means, a complete list of Israel\u2019s violations of international law and human decency. Israel offends these norms \u2013 to which the United States and Europe loudly proclaim allegiance \u2013 because it has Western backing to do so.\n\nThe Zionist state has gotten away with criminally scofflaw behavior because:\n\nEuropeans guilty of antisemitism, including aiding and abetting the round up and slaughter of Europe\u2019s Jews, have conferred compensatory immunity on the Jews of Israel.\n\nA powerful, unregistered lobby in the United States and United Kingdom, directed by the Israeli government and funded by native Jewish plutocrats, has made it politically fatal to criticize the behavior of the Zionist state.\n\nThe Western bloc in the UN Security Council \u2013 the United States, United Kingdom, and France \u2013 has shamelessly protected Israel by vetoing every and all attempts to hold it accountable for its outrageously illegal behavior.\n\nUntil recently, Israel \u2013 aided by biased, self-censoring Anglo-American media \u2013 was careful to keep its gross violations of Palestinian human rights below the radar screen. But the October 7 breakout of Palestinians from their incarceration in Gaza inevitably focused global attention on the outrageous Israeli treatment of them that had inspired their criminal atrocities against Israelis just outside Gaza. Israel\u2019s subsequent effort to exterminate the Palestinians in Gaza has indelibly shattered the image of Israeli and other Jews as eternal victims. The world now sees Israelis not as survivors of genocide but as vengeful perpetrators of it, heirs to the Nazis who sought to exterminate them as they now seek to exterminate the Palestinians. In much of the world, the Star of David has come to evoke the same revulsion as the Nazi swastika does in the West.\n\nIsrael is not a casual scofflaw. Since its establishment, it has systematically sought to normalize behavior that contravenes international law. As a former head of the Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) Legal Department argued:\n\n\u201cIf you do something for long enough the world will accept it. The whole of international law is now based on the notion that an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries . . .. International law progresses through violations.\u201d\n\nA colleague of his pointed out that:\n\n\u201cThe more often Western states apply principles that originated in Israel to their own non-traditional conflicts in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, then the greater the chance these principles have of becoming a valuable part of international law.\u201d\n\nThis Israeli strategy of \u201clawfare\u201d has succeeded in eroding international law and eliminating American compliance with it. Tolerance of illegality abroad fosters tolerance of it at home and vice versa. American enablement of Israel\u2019s brutal oppression of its captive Arab population and its wanton warfare on its neighbors has corrupted American politics and constitutional democracy in the United States as much as it has deformed American foreign policy.\n\nThe result is the current U.S. advocacy of an autocratic, so-called \u201crules-based order\u201d as an alternative to traditional consensus-derived international law. The United States and its close allies assert the right to proclaim the rules and decide to whom they should and should not apply. Might is once again to make right. The strong are to do what they can and the weak to suffer what they must. The world at large considers this approach, which the unconditional U.S. protection of Israel epitomizes for them, to be prima facie sociopathic.\n\nFor Israel and its neoconservative sycophants in the United States, the ends justify the means, and the ends transparently equate to the establishment of Jewish supremacy not just in Palestine but in West Asia. Since its founding in 1948, Israel has steadily expanded without agreeing borders with either the Palestinians or its Arab neighbors. The stripes on the Israeli flag symbolize bodies of water \u2013 a river and a sea or another river. The uniforms of some Israeli troops are adorned with a notorious map that depicts the State of Israel as extending from the Euphrates to the Nile. This reflects the belief of religious Zionists that God once promised this vast territory, consisting of part of Egypt, most of Iraq, all of Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria as well as northern Saudi Arabia to the Jews. This is a vision of depopulation through slaughter.\n\nIsrael now exists. Does Israel justly claim \u201ca right to exist?\u201d Not if that implies that no one else has the right to exist \u201cbetween the river and the sea.\u201d Does it deserve to exist? Not if its existence depends on sadistic violations of human decency and international law. Can the world tolerate the existence of a state that has institutionalized an ethnoreligious democracy that survives by dehumanizing and terrorizing a disenfranchised captive population, while aspiring to exterminate it? Can it fail forever to take action to stop Israel\u2019s indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinians and Lebanese? What\u2019s your answer to that?\n\nThese questions have become, I believe, the transcendent moral issues of our times. The world is watching and weighing the amorality of American enablement of Israeli genocide, persecution, and ethnic cleansing of its captive Arab populations. America\u2019s reputation and global leadership are at an historic nadir. Ever more Americans of conscience object to Washington\u2019s complicity in Israel\u2019s gross violations of human rights and international law.\n\nIf there is no path to peace in the Holy Land, Israel\u2019s state terrorism will inevitably stoke terrorism against it and the United States as well as the escalating opprobrium of Israel\u2019s neighbors and the global majority. To preclude this, Israel now seeks a regional conflagration \u2013 an apocalypse from which its current government believes that, with American backing, it will emerge triumphant.\n\nThe blank check we have given to Israel is not a strategy. It is a tragedy in the making. And it is one for which the world will justly hold the United States responsible.\n\nLet us not forget that U.S. taxpayers pay for the Zionist state\u2019s misdeeds. Israel has been and still is by far the largest single recipient of U.S. foreign aid. In 1964, in return for financial support from wealthy Jewish American donors for his presidential campaign, then President Lyndon Johnson agreed to drop America\u2019s post-Suez arms embargo on Israel. Since then, the United States has provided about $250 billion in military aid to Israel. Keeping Egypt at peace with Israel has cost the United States another $165 or so billion. Americans are responsible for Israel\u2019s persecution of the Palestinians and wars on its neighbors in ways we are not in other countries whose evil behavior we do not subsidize but whose conduct we condemn.\n\nIn normal times, Washington funds about fifteen percent of the Israeli defense budget, while unofficially suspending the Leahy law, which prohibits arms transfers to countries using them to violate human rights and international law. The International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court have both found that that is exactly what Israel is doing. Washington has nonetheless continued to support Israel\u2019s extermination campaign in Gaza, turned a blind eye to its pogroms in the West Bank, and backed its murderous attacks on Syria and now Lebanon with at least another $40 billion in emergency aid and over 50,000 tons of weaponry. The government of the United States is funding, arming, and excusing Israel\u2019s inexcusable behavior toward both the Palestinians and its neighbors.\n\nThe world is now calling Americans to account. Will we continue to exempt Israel from accountability for its gross violations of our proclaimed values, our laws, and international norms? Will we persist in allowing it to manipulate our elections to facilitate its suicidal policies? Will we continue to enable its campaign of genocide in Palestine and now Lebanon? Will we follow it into the wider war in West Asia that its current government persists in trying to ignite?\n\nI heard nothing at all about these questions at either of our major parties\u2019 national conventions.\n\nWhat is to be done? And if we don\u2019t demand that it be done, who will?\n\n[1] The \u201cBalfour Declaration,\u201d 2 November 1917.\n\n[2] White Paper, May 1939, stating British policy in Mandatory Palestine.",

        "text": "Opening Remarks to a Workshop on China Policy\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\n[As delivered. Introductory comments omitted.]\n\nI\u2019ve spent sixty years watching and dealing with China. Full disclosure. I do not share either the stated or unstated presuppositions that are driving our current policies. I do not believe that they form part of a coherent strategy. I do not think they will help Americans deal with China or the emerging world order of shifting power balances, in which the United States can no longer compete internationally with wealth and weaponry alone.\n\nI have lived through several wars in which Washington attributed objectives to the other side that they didn\u2019t have.\n\nDeductive reasoning by analogy as opposed to inductive reasoning from empirically verified reality has a bad track record. It took a while but, in the end, we came to realize that the Korean and Vietnam Wars were not \u2013 as we had supposed \u2013 wars of conquest by either China or the Soviet Union. They were civil wars that lent themselves to becoming proxy wars. The fact that they were not in fact motivated by a strategic challenge to us by other great powers is why we were able to limit them.\n\nChina is not Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, or the Soviet Union. China would love to see our hubristic global hegemony disappear. But it has no desire to assume the burdens we bear. It is not in search of Lebensraum, the annexation of its neighbors, or the imposition of its largely incomprehensible ideology on them or on us, still less the replacement of our global dominance by its own or that of any other overlord. \u201cHeute Taiwan, morgen die Welt\u201d does not compute. Leninism with Chinese characteristics is introverted, unlike the globally ambitious Soviet Communist Party (CPSU). China demands respect from its neighbors. It does not demand subservience from them or anyone else.\n\nWe\u2019ve picked a fight with China. We are in its face. For now, it is not in ours. Any fight will be mostly on China\u2019s turf, not ours.\n\nBoth deductive reasoning by analogy and self-fulfilling paranoia are dangerous. Both deny reality and, with enough charismatic effort, can be contagious. We profess to be defending China\u2019s neighbors against it, but we have had to make a significant effort to persuade them to agree that they need us to do that. Most would rather we backed them as they come to grips with China\u2019s return to wealth and power.\n\nIn many respects, China now not only overmatches us, but is widening the gap. It produces thirty-six percent of the world\u2019s manufactures to our one-sixth. Its domestic economy is one-third larger than ours in purchasing power. It lends the world $1 trillion or more each year, while we borrow more than that just to keep our government operating and our economy afloat. China has become the undisputed center of its region\u2019s economy. It has more diplomatic representation in more places around the world than we do. And, of course, it now has a larger navy, a highly competitive air force, and the world\u2019s most capable rocket force. China is, of course, no match for us in power projection capability but that is irrelevant. It is focused on defending its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and periphery against us, not crossing the Pacific Ocean to attack us. In anticipation of a showdown with us, it is building a very credible nuclear second-strike capability.\n\nEnough said.\n\nDeclared policy and actual policy are seldom the same. We are not blind to the hypocrisy of others. We should not assume that they are blind to ours. To the extent that our China policy now has identifiable goals, our de facto objectives appear to be:\n\nTo retard or reverse China\u2019s rise to wealth and power, including its scientific and technological progress, thereby preventing the eclipse of our own.\n\nTo deny China a sphere of influence in Pacific Asia or political or economic influence in other regions and countries.\n\nTo perpetuate the political and strategic separation of Taiwan from the rest of China through a combination of overt military deterrence and covert subversion of any cross-Strait negotiation of unification.\n\nTo limit Chinese dual-use exports to Russia for use in the production of weapons it might deploy in Ukraine.\n\nTo delegitimize the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and its ruling Communist Party (CPC) in hopeful anticipation of regime change in Beijing.\n\nThe successes or failures of policies do not depend on their political righteousness but on their results. So far, our vociferous antagonism to China has:\n\nNurtured a strategic partnership between China and Russia that looks very much like the Eurasian hegemonic coalition that U.S. strategists have always feared and sought to preclude. This partnership now leads the BRICS grouping and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which are merging into a rapidly expanding global coalition against U.S. hegemony.\n\nBoosted transfers of Russian weapons and military technology to China as well as joint Sino-Russian research and development (R&D) of weapons systems and activities in space, as symbolized by the plan for a joint Sino-Russian lunar base. We can no longer rule out the possibility that Russia will actively support a People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) military operation against Taiwan.\n\nTransferred the U.S. role in shaping the evolving trade and investment regimes in Pacific Asia to China, Japan, and ASEAN. We have abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and its Japanese-sponsored successor, ignored the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and sabotaged the World Trade Organization (WTO) while adopting national security-based protectionism and refusing to negotiate bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements (FTAs).\n\nSignificantly increased the danger of a Sino-American war, including a possible nuclear exchange, over Taiwan. Current U.S. policies are diplomacy-free, leave no apparent path to peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, and rely exclusively on military support for Taipei that demonstrably provokes rather than deters Beijing.\n\nTurned territorial disputes between rival claimants in the South China Sea into a focus of Sino-American naval confrontation that risks the accidental outbreak of hostilities, while making no effort to promote the peaceful resolution of these disputes.\n\nSupercharged the Chinese effort to achieve scientific and technological supremacy. The Australian Strategic Technology Institute\u2019s (ASTI\u2019s) \u201ccritical technology tracker\u201d reports that China has now seized the lead in thirty-seven of the forty-four technologies it tracks.\n\nStimulated an intensified search by ever more nations for ways to avoid the dollar in trade settlement. Should they succeed, U.S. global hegemony will collapse, the American standard of living will abruptly fall, domestic inflation will reach catastrophic levels, and the U.S. national debt will become utterly unsustainable.\n\nWe should honor the rule of holes. When in a deepening hole, stop digging. Our China policies are not keeping China down or pushing it back. They are doing the opposite, and they are at the same time progressively reordering the world to our disadvantage.\n\nWe cannot afford continued hubris and complacency.\n\nIt is a mistake to imagine that China policy can be fixed in isolation from overall U.S. grand strategy. A strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve a desired objective through the lowest possible investment of effort, resources, and time with the fewest adverse consequences for oneself. At the moment we have a determination to sustain our global primacy and our post-World War II sphere of influence in Pacific Asia but no strategy to accomplish this. Doubling down on military spending will not do so. Neither will isolating our economy from international competition with higher tariffs. We must consider not only what might sustain our global and regional hegemony but whether it is, in fact, sustainable, and, if not, what alternatives to attempting to do so will yet \u201cinsure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\u201d\n\nIn my view, that is what we should be discussing in this forum.\n\n[Subsequent discussion was off the record.]",

        "text": "Surviving the World Order to Come\n\nRemarks to Chinese Attendees at the Cambridge Executive Leadership Program[1]\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nVisiting Scholar, Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown University\n\nBy Video, 10 July 2024\n\nA new world order is coming into being. Many call it \u201cmultipolar,\u201d but it is better described as \u201cmulti-nodal.\u201d[2] A \u201cpole\u201d is the end of a line between two points. But the emerging order is a three-dimensional network, not a two-dimensional axis, or even a collection of axes. \u201cNodes\u201d [\u8282\u70b9] are places where many connections of diverse sizes and intensities originate, terminate, and intersect on differing vectors. Multi-nodal is a more accurate depiction of the geopolitical geometry that is now emerging.\n\nIn the emerging, unfamiliar international system, countries interact and connect with each other in a multidimensional \u2013 not just a bilateral context \u2013 and in multiple, often inconsistent, ways. A nation may have poor political relations or military confrontations with countries with which it nonetheless has a lot of economic interdependence.\n\nThis is a fair description of the current Sino-American bilateral relationship. Or, for that matter, Sino-Vietnamese relations, despite the two countries\u2019 ideological similarity. Or, as in the case of U.S. relations with Vietnam, major ideological differences may coexist with a flourishing economic relationship and a modest amount of cautious geopolitical cooperation.\n\nThis was the spirit of the recent meeting of the Chinese and Japanese premiers with the president of the Republic of Korea in Seoul. We will see more of this sort of complexity in relationships in future.\n\nTo the dismay of anti-Chinese or anti-American zealots, the international interests and aspirations of China or the United States cannot be understood or predicted by reference solely to their bilateral interactions. Each connects to the other in varying ways, and each has complex interactions with other countries and groups of countries. Such countries and groupings connect in their own ways to still others. Important as the Sino-American relationship is, it is only part of the context in which Beijing and Washington interact and behave at home and abroad.\n\nAfter a century and a half of decline, China is today once again at the center of Pacific Asia. For the first time in history, it is also a world power \u2013 a nation whose interests and preferences must be acknowledged and addressed in the management of every human domain and activity. In its comprehensive global and regional influence, China now resembles the United States. As of 2024, there is no other great power with a claim to do so.\n\nBut regional and middle-ranking powers are flourishing in the post-post-Cold War environment.\n\nJapan is a global power in economic terms and is cautiously returning to a leading role in the political and military affairs of Pacific Asia.\n\nRussia has global military reach but is not a major player in global trade and investment outside the energy sector.\n\nIndia is the hegemon in South Asia but currently has little influence beyond that region.\n\nEurope has global economic reach but is too disunited to act decisively even in its own region, still less beyond it.\n\nBritain and France retain strong but receding intellectual and cultural influence in their former imperial domains.\n\nThe Arab world has no cohesion and remains unable to manage its own affairs effectively, still less those of others.\n\nBrazil, Ethiopia, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and T\u00fcrkiye are growing in power in their regions but lack decisive global clout.\n\nAll seek to increase their strategic autonomy. None is willing to subordinate itself to China, the United States, or any other potential overlord.\n\nSo, the assertion that the international system and its dynamics are now defined by great power rivalry will not withstand scrutiny. This is a peculiarly American reaction to the progressive loss of U.S. dominance in every global domain other than the military. In a world no longer dominated by the bipolar order of the Cold War, all states have agency \u2013 the power to make a difference and to conduct themselves as they perceive their interests to dictate.\n\nThe world does not share the Biden administration\u2019s insistent conjecture that history is culminating in a great battle between democracy and autocracy. America\u2019s obsession with democratic ideology arises not from foreign efforts to subvert constitutional democracy in the United States but from internal factors that are eroding democracy and the rule of law domestically. Constitutional democracy can only be built and sustained at home. It cannot be dismantled by foreign refusal to emulate it.\n\nThe prerequisites for constitutional democracy include the combination of the rule of law with freedom of speech. This Western-invented composite has historically enabled debate among an informed citizenry so that they can advise and consent to government rulemaking. If the United States is becoming less constitutionalist and more authoritarian, as it is, this is disturbing to those who, like me, treasure the values of the European Enlightenment, but it is the result of decisions made by Americans, not manipulation by China, Russia, or any other foreign power.\n\nThe Western concept of the \u201crule of law\u201d (\u6cd5\u5236) is quite different from the Chinese Legalist theory of \u201crule by law\u201d (\u4ee5\u6cd5\u6cbb\u56fd), which is now almost everywhere de facto gaining ground. The \u2018rule of law\u2019 is a system in which rulers as well as citizens, institutions, and entities are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated. \u201cRule by law\u201d empowers a presumptively wise ruler to make rules that can remain unpublished, that are alterable on a case-by-case basis to produce desired results, and that do not constrain the ruler\u2019s own decisions or behavior.\n\n\u201cRule by law,\u201d as most clearly advocated by Han Feizi (\u97e9\u975e\u5b50), proposes a system of governance in which decisions by the ruler can and often should be made in secret and enabled by an explicit policy of keeping citizens uninformed (\u611a\u6c11\u653f\u7b56) so that they cannot challenge their ruler\u2019s dictates. This system defines any view inconsistent with the officially approved narrative as \u201cdisinformation\u201d that must be suppressed. It repudiates due process, is subservient to political power and privilege, and allows the rules to be applied selectively, based on who did what to whom rather than what was done and whether it was right or wrong.\n\nThese are quite different concepts of governance, and the world\u2019s nations differ on which is most effective and desirable. These ideological differences matter. They manifest themselves in nations\u2019 varied approaches to international interactions as well as in their views of the merits and legitimacy of domestic political systems. So be it. \u767e\u82b1\u9f4a\u653e\uff0c\u767e\u5bb6\u722d\u9cf4. \u201cLet a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend.\u201d As a great reformer once said, \u201cpractice is the sole criterion of truth\u201d \u2013 \u201c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e3a\u771f\u7406\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6807\u51c6.\u201d\n\nInternational law is the intellectual legacy of Western societies committed to the rule of law. It is the product of international consensus or of institutions like the United Nations created by international consensus that have been empowered to make rules governing the actions of sovereign states or interactions between them. It resembles the rule of law in that it represents community values, is not the product of the arbitrary dictates of a single nation or group of nations, is openly declared, embraces the concept of the sovereign equality of states, and has established standards and authorized quasi-judicial mechanisms for the non-violent resolution of disputes.\n\nThe purpose of international law is to protect the weak against the strong. That is why its greatest champions today are nations that lack the power or ambition to impose their political or economic preferences on others.\n\nIronically, given the historical U.S. role in promoting international law, the \u201crules-based order\u201d now promoted by Washington is a modern version of \u201crule by law.\u201d Han Feizi would recognize and approve of it. It supposes that the United States \u2013 or the United States plus the club of former imperialist powers called the \u201cG7\u201d \u2013 can make the rules, alter them at will, exempt themselves from them, and determine to whom else they do or do not apply. This system is rejected as illegitimate by the global majority, which much prefers one based on the United Nations Charter and the decisions of the international community.\n\nMeanwhile, the institutions of global governance created after World War II are disintegrating. The United Nations system has been unable to concert an effective response to war and state collapse, global warming, mass migration, pandemics, genocide, species extinction, nuclear proliferation, and other challenges to human existence. The Security Council is paralyzed. Regulatory regimes like the World Trade Organization have played a crucial role in fostering global prosperity and the expansion of the global economy but are now under attack and crumbling. The UN Charter and the international conventions that once constrained national behavior and made the world somewhat safe and predictable are now ever more widely flouted.\n\nLike constitutional democracy, respect for international law is now in retreat. It is unclear whether it will be displaced by a version of \u201crule by law\u201d or by an anarchy in which, as Thucydides wrote, \u201cthe strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.\u201d Sadly, Thucydides would not be surprised by what is happening in Ukraine, in Palestine, at the United Nations, or at the International Court at the Hague.\n\nIf we cannot fix the UN, we must replace it, as we did the League of Nations. Sub-global institutions with less than universal membership, limited cohesion, uncertain authority, and no demonstrated capacity to address planetwide problems increasingly substitute for the global institutions and legal frameworks created by the international community after World War II. Sadly, my country will not lead the effort to reform these institutions or to preserve international law. Therefore, others must do this as best they can.\n\nAmerica\u2019s distraught response to its loss of economic and political primacy has been to adopt protectionist trade and investment policies and to militarize its foreign policy. But neither protectionism nor militarism can or will \u201cmake America great again.\u201d And neither is an answer to hegemonic overextension \u2013 \u201ctrying to squash ten fleas at once with all ten fingers\u201d \u2013 \u201c\u5341\u4e2a\u624b\u6307\u6309\u5341\u4e2a\u8df3\u86a4\u201c \u2013 an absurd effort that is both futile and debilitating.\n\nIn effect, in place of \u201creform and opening,\u201d Washington has adopted a national politico-economic strategy of industrial constipation and hunger strike. Unable to compete with Chinese electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels, or wind turbines, it is barring them from the U.S. market. This may seem like an unprecedented response to the challenges posed by competition from advanced technology originating in a more dynamic foreign economy, but it is not.\n\nWalling out products with which the United States cannot compete recapitulates the bungled response of Qing China to its encounter with the industrial revolution in 1793. In that year, having inspected the wide range of innovative products presented at his court by a large British trade mission, the Emperor Qian Long [\u4e7e\u9686] dismissed the opportunity to leverage Western industrial prowess to China\u2019s advantage, saying complacently that he and China already \u201c[possessed] all things,\u201d while condescendingly adding that he and China \u201cset no value on objects strange or ingenious, and [had] no use for [such foreign] manufactures.\u201d\n\nThis smugly arrogant refusal to recognize the merits of opening China to trade with a rising West or to collaborate with foreign scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians led to economic stagnation, military defeat, and internal disorder. It culminated in the overthrow of the very primacy and regional \u201cPax Sinica\u201d that Beijing sought to preserve. Shutting the door to superior goods and services perpetuated China\u2019s competitive inferiority and entrenched mediocrity rather than promoting self-improvement.\n\nObviously, when self-reliance is overdone it can backfire. \u95ed\u95e8\u9020\u8f66 \u2013 trying to manufacture everything yourself behind closed doors \u2013 is a losing politico-economic strategy. As the coarse but pertinent saying: \u62c9\u4e0d\u51fa\u5c4e\u6765\u4e0d\u8981\u7ad9\u7740\u8305\u623f \u2013 advises: \u201cif you can\u2019t crank out the crap, don\u2019t fart around in the outhouse.\u201d There is no reason to believe that Washington\u2019s constipated response to the challenges posed by an economically dynamic and increasingly innovative China will lead to a different result.\n\nChina now produces thirty-six percent of the world\u2019s manufactures, and its economy is one-third larger than America\u2019s in terms of domestic purchasing power. For the first time in two centuries, China has a convincing self-defense capability, but China\u2019s major challenges to the world are not primarily military. An American military response to them will not overcome them. Still, the United States has chosen an almost exclusively military response to China\u2019s return to wealth and power. Diversion of investment to forever wars, military buildups, and arms races with China and Russia has led to deteriorating U.S. domestic infrastructure, declining educational standards, disinvestment in scientific research and public health, and rising debt.\n\nIn the nuclear age, no great power should wish to make an implacable enemy of another. But that is how Washington is currently treating both Beijing and Moscow. Meanwhile, the threat of nuclear escalation is demonstrably no longer an effective deterrent against conventional warfare between nuclear powers. Russia is the world\u2019s most heavily armed nuclear power, but the United States has become engaged in a losing proxy war with it in Ukraine. India and Pakistan have fought each other despite their nuclear arsenals. But the risk of escalation to the nuclear level is serious. Just wait till a nuclear power faces a threat of defeat it regards as existential!\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that no navy of any great power has fought a major battle in seventy-nine years. There have been no major amphibious landings since 1950 (seventy-four years ago). There have been no direct air battles between peer competitors since 1954 in Korea, when the embryonic Chinese air force and north Korean planes piloted by Russians engaged in dog fights with the US Air Force. That was seventy years ago. Western combat experience against all but insurgencies is lacking.\n\nEverywhere but in Russia and Ukraine, awareness of how technology has changed warfare has made little headway against political posturing based on wishful thinking. All Western militaries are configured to fight opponents with inferior technology and no air forces or navies. All envisage short, victorious wars, not protracted wars of attrition. No Western economy has the industrial surge capacity or stamina to win a war of attrition against a \u201cpeer competitor.\u201d\n\nA Sino-American war over Taiwan might decide the island\u2019s status but, even if it did, it would lead to protracted hostility between China and the United States. A war of attrition or catastrophic mutual destruction through a nuclear exchange might prove unavoidable. The one certainty, should such a war occur, is the destruction of Taiwan\u2019s prosperity and democracy, the elimination of its semiconductor and other advanced technology exports, and the loss by both China and the United States of the greater part of their respective navies and air forces. It is said that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. For many reasons, the same is true of a Sino-American war over Taiwan.\n\nThe United States now habitually substitutes coercive measures short of war for diplomatic dialogue. Sanctions and ostracism have displaced negotiation as the preferred American response to disagreements with other countries. But in international relations, as in warfare, one should never lose contact with one\u2019s adversary. Empathy \u2013 \u77e5\u5df1\u77e5\u5f7c \u2013 [\u201cknowing yourself and knowing your opponent] is as indispensable to success in diplomacy as it is to victory on the battlefield.\n\nThe United States and its Western partners now routinely use unilateral sanctions to isolate countries and their economies, deny them access to trade settlement mechanisms, freeze or confiscate their government assets, bar their access to technology, curtail their exports and investments, prohibit transactions with them, and bar the issuance of visas to their officials and citizens. Sanctions create resentment and fuel the recalcitrance of their targets, while distorting markets and creating vested interests in their perpetuation. They entrench rather than solve problems, but they have a devoted following, especially in my country.\n\nThe net effect of American sanctioneering and protectionism is to make the world ever less than the previous sum of its parts. The new U.S. stand on trade and investment:\n\nSubstitutes geopolitical risk judgments based on national security paranoia for comparative price and quality as the basis for business decisions, thereby reducing global economic efficiency, growth, and prosperity.\n\nExempts uncompetitive domestic oligopolies \u2013 which now dominate the American economy \u2013 from competitive pressures to produce better, cheaper products.\n\nDeprives U.S. producers of economically desirable production inputs and locks in inflation.\n\nReplaces quasi-judicial dispute settlement mechanisms in international trade with zero-sum contests of economic power.\n\nUndermines global monetary reserve and trade settlement systems and encourages the formation of competing currency blocks and exchange mechanisms.\n\nDivides the world into multiple segregated political and economic blocs, restricting trade and investment flows with other blocs or countries to the detriment of global prosperity and economic efficiency.\n\nConstitutes a pivot to further stagnation and technological decline, not a realistic approach to reindustrializing America.\n\nDrives the world toward attempted military rather than diplomatic solutions to problems, most of which cannot be resolved on the battlefield.\n\nThe U.S. political elite portrays its new stance on trade and investment as consolidating alliance relationships while fending off unfair competition from foreigners. But from a global perspective what is happening is:\n\nthe resurgence of civilizational states like China, India, Japan, and Russia.\n\nthe strengthening renaissance of the Islamic world.\n\nthe reassertion of strategic autonomy by France and other European powers.\n\nthe rise of new middle-ranking powers like Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.\n\nthe emergence of ASEAN as a significant independent factor in the global economy; and\n\nthe beginning of Africa\u2019s realization of its tremendous demographic and economic potential.\n\nThis looks more like a G7 retreat into a defensive citadel than a reassertion of the global centrality of Atlantic civilization. It risks placing the West on the fringe rather than at the center of the future, marginalizing its previously dominant role in human progress as parallel international communities and orders emerge. The de facto isolation of the West from the global majority is exacerbated by worldwide ideological shifts as well as by behavior driven by the loss of self-confidence by the nations of the Atlantic world.\n\nThe trends at work include the rise of religious zealotry in Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism as well as radical shifts in the norms of social behavior in Western societies. Even as much of the world reaffirms traditional values, Western elites extol the virtues of gender fluidity, hedonism, and other aspects of so-called \u201cwokeism,\u201d which intolerantly demands tolerance of behavior long universally considered to be immoral.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States and the G7 continue to insist on the adoption by other countries of models of governance and rules the West itself seems to be abandoning. The domestic divisions, instability, and decadence of the United States and its G7 allies find expression in self-contradictory and ineffectual statements and actions abroad. The global majority sees Euro-American behavior on issues like the wars in Ukraine and Palestine as transparently hypocritical, based on double standards, and justified by narratives that belie visible realities. The countries that the West once colonized or dominated are no longer prepared to follow its lead in world affairs.\n\nIn short, we are witnessing the end of a unified, Western-dominated global order and its replacement by a hodgepodge of collaborations and rivalries at the sub-global level. Something similar happened to cause the devastating chaos of the \u201cThirty Years\u2019 War\u201d in Europe. That was a disorder composed of warring states, much like the history of China before the Qin unification or India before A\u015boka. But the \u201cThirty Years\u2019 War\u201d ended in the establishment in the Peace of Westphalia of a system of peaceful coexistence between multiple sovereign states that respected their cultural diversity. Its result is memorialized in the \u201cfive principles of peaceful coexistence.\u201d\n\nThe question for your generation and the next in China, the West, and the rest of the world is whether we can replicate that outcome and end our descent into anarchy. We need to craft a peace based on mutual respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs, tolerance, and equality and cooperation for mutual benefit. If we cannot not do this, we risk more than our prosperity. We risk our very existence.\n\n[1] This lecture is a follow-on to the previous year\u2019s talk, \u201cA World Divided,\u201d which can be read at https://chasfreeman.net/a-world-divided/.\n\n[2] I am indebted to Brantly Womack, Professor Emeritus of Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia for this insight, described in Recentering Pacific Asia, Cambridge University Press, 2023.",

        "text": "In a world of shifting power balances, Americans can no longer compete internationally with wealth and weaponry alone. We live in a world in which other nations no longer automatically defer to the United States. Our national margin for error has demonstrably narrowed. In several regions war has already replaced the Pax Americana. It threatens to do the same in still others. Our highly professional military remains peerless, but our diplomacy \u2013 our first line of defense \u2013 increasingly lacks traction. Our country needs to get a lot better at diplomatic reasoning and the practice of diplomacy. To match the professionalism of our competitors, we must professionalize our own diplomacy. But what is diplomatic professionalism?\n\nOn Diplomatic Professionalism\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nJuly 2024\n\nThe members of professions warrant that they possess expertise that distinguishes them from amateurs. Lawyers, theologians, soldiers, and physicians affirm they can conduct and resolve disputes, parse indignation to extract right from wrong, apply force to impose their nation\u2019s will on opponents, or sustain or restore health more effectively than lay, non-experts can. Their profession of unique competence in efficient problem-solving is the source and raison d\u2019\u00eatre of their authority.\n\nEvery profession develops its own mode of reasoning and specialized vocabulary. The specialized knowledge of professionals is crystallized in doctrine drawn from the experience of previous generations of practitioners. The doctrines professionals espouse, and their distinctive associated vocabularies, define the questions with which they deconstruct issues, provide the tools of critical thinking with which they understand problems, and supply a menu of choices for dealing with relevant factors and interests.\n\nDiplomacy is a political performing art whose objective is to alter foreign behavior to the advantage of the diplomat\u2019s government and homeland. The professed expertise of diplomats is the management of relations between states and peoples to advance and defend their nation\u2019s interests and augment its security and well-being. To this end, diplomats use measures short of war, define feasible purposes for nonetheless necessary uses of force, organize or disrupt coalitions of foreign states and peoples, and translate the results of war or other forms of international competition into the most advantageous and sustainable modus vivendi possible.\n\nTo advance the interests in their charge, diplomats seek to convince foreign decision makers that the choices they are urging them to make would be more beneficial than costly to their nation than those it otherwise might favor. To induce their interlocutors to agree to what they advocate, they employ both peaceful persuasion and reminders of the power of their state, including its potential to impose pain on its opponents. For adjustments in relations or behavior to last, diplomats must invent and arrange non-zero-sum outcomes that will be seen by the parties as superior to repudiating what has been agreed or resorting to subversion or the use of force.\n\nTo formulate arguments that can persuade foreigners that it is in their interest to do what the diplomats\u2019 government desires them to do demands skill at cross-cultural communication based on empathetic comprehension of foreign histories, political systems, cultures, languages, and perspectives. Such expertise is essential for diplomats to be able effectively:\n\nTo advocate and promote foreign understanding of their state and society and its policies and beliefs,\n\nTo persuade foreigners to identify their own national interests with those of the government the diplomats represent,\n\nTo enable their own government to understand how best to protect and advance its interests in its interactions with others,\n\nTo propose policies and programs and to carry out activities abroad to safeguard and promote the sovereignty, prosperity, security, and domestic tranquility of their homeland,\n\nTo settle or mitigate disputes with foreign states and peoples,\n\nTo build coalitions of foreign support for their nation\u2019s policies and to weaken and divide competing coalitions, and\n\nTo quell controversies and restore international tranquility by reconciling antagonists to the outcomes of conflicts and confrontations that they are tempted to resist.\n\nThese tasks of diplomacy require acuity of observation and skill in negotiation as well as grounding in the principles and practices that make diplomacy a learned profession. These reflect thousands of years of recorded experience, transcend the differences between states and peoples, and define the profession of diplomacy. The lessons of millennia are ignored at a nation\u2019s peril.\n\nLike lawyers, diplomats both negotiate the terms of contractual obligations and serve as advocates for the parties (in their case, governments) to disputes. But unlike lawyers, they cannot appeal to a judge, jury, or other third party to enforce agreements or sustain them. Moral or legal opinions may define the desired outcomes of disputes and inspire fervor in those seeking them, but they do not determine outcomes. The peaceful resolution of differences in international relations depends on diplomats bringing the parties\u2019 perceptions of their national interests and relative power into alignment. If they cannot do this, the parties to international disputes will attempt to impose their desired outcomes unilaterally.\n\nThe absence of supranational enforcement authority means that the understandings diplomats contrive must either be self-executing or voluntarily implemented. To be able to implement treaties and agreements, those who conclude them must convince domestic elites that they are more congruent with the national interest than available alternatives. This is true even on those rare occasions when the parties to disputes can be persuaded to submit them to a neutral third party for arbitration. The parties to an accord must be brought to see keeping their word as more advantageous to them and their interests than attempting to impose better terms by resorting to coercive, or subversive measures.\n\nA great part of diplomacy is the patient cultivation of friendships with foreign officials in positions of authority or likely in time to occupy such positions. To achieve this, diplomats must demonstrate empathetic appreciation of the distinctive norms, beliefs, and perceptions of those they seek to befriend and influence. They work with and among foreigners who, by definition, have notions and perspectives that differ from their own and those of their compatriots. They must show respect to people they do not believe deserve it, not as tribute to their character but as a demonstration of their own. Diplomats should never insult someone else unintentionally as this is generally, though not always, counterproductive. They must master the art of tactfully refraining from giving offense while avoiding the hypocritical endorsement of discreditable ideas and patterns of behavior. Tact is the knack of making a point without making an enemy. Hypocrisy begets both distrust and contempt.\n\nDiplomats understand that insisting on blaming one side or the other for a confrontation is more likely to entrench differences, exacerbate animosities, and reinforce confrontations than to reduce them. They are specialists in problem-solving that benefits their country rather than in humiliating the other side. While insisting that the government they represent is in the right, they habitually focus on determining what each of the parties could gain or lose from resolving their differences or setting them aside, rather than on assigning blame or extracting admissions of culpability.\n\nOvert threats tend to evoke recalcitrance rather than acquiescence in opponents, so diplomacy relies more on implicit menaces than on explicit threats or ultimatums. For the same reason, diplomats seek to discover and design affordable incentives for better behavior that can obviate a resort to coercive or punitive measures. Dismissing another state\u2019s demands as non-negotiable ultimata rather than as an unacceptable initial bargaining position is a mistake, especially when these demands involve its vital strategic interests. Failing to test its position through dialogue can leave it with no alternative to the use of force.\n\nIf international differences cannot be composed or resolved through negotiated compromise, diplomats typically seek a basis on which to set them aside for later resolution. This can provide opportunities to craft circumstances that will eventually cause the parties to see alternatives to ongoing or escalating confrontation. Sometimes refusing to negotiate is a form of negotiation designed to gain time. But acquiescence in impasse requires buttressing the status quo with military or other deterrent threats. This entails risks.\n\nApparently disconnected trends and events can transform issues that had seemed deferable into matters of perceived urgency for one side or another. With time, unresolved disputes may become more, rather than less irritating and explosive.[1] The balance of power may shift, with one side gaining a convincing new capacity to impose a solution on the other. Abandonment of efforts to settle disputes with the potential to escalate or erupt into violence is therefore strategically unwise. This is especially true in the nuclear age, in which wars between nuclear powers risk escalation to levels that have the potential not just to destroy the combatants but to put an end to the human species.\n\nEven when differences between states seem irreconcilable, diplomats will seek to reduce the risk of confrontations leading to war or to limit the potential scope and consequences of conflict with reciprocal arms control and disarmament agreements. The prerequisite for a partial relaxation of tensions [d\u00e9tente] to manage risk is respect for the other side\u2019s right to have views of its own \u2013 erroneous as they may appear \u2013 and de facto acceptance of them as an unresolved factor in interactions with it. The recognition and accommodation of clashing interests is essential to manage relations between states without warfare.\n\nWar is the ultimate argument of statecraft and a not-infrequent response to a refusal by another state to negotiate. Its purpose is to compel adjustments of borders, behavior, and relations between states that cannot be achieved by mutual accommodation. Politicians start wars. Soldiers fight them. Diplomats limit and end them. War seeks to establish a new sustainable status quo \u2013 a peace \u2014 that is less threatening and more advantageous to the war\u2019s initiator than the situation that it finds unacceptable. It is the negotiation of change by violence. Like any kind of antagonistic interaction, war requires those who engage in it to have a clear sense of priorities, distinguishing between aims that are essential and those that are merely desirable.\n\nDiplomacy embodies an ethos that requires issues to remain open to peaceful resolution through dialogue. Productive dialogue depends on perceived mutual reliability and trust. So, even when declaring war, diplomats bear in mind that they may be called upon to negotiate a post-war peace with the enemy. While their political masters may passionately denounce the enemy, diplomats must try to convey the reasons for the decision to go to war to the enemy\u2019s representatives in as dignified and courteous a way as possible. All wars must end. Preserving respectful relations with adversaries enhances diplomats\u2019 ability to obtain their acquiescence in new relationships when war ends. Conversely, menacing enemies with post-conflict punishment deprives them of any incentive to compromise or capitulate and therefore prolongs wars.\n\nWar is a gamble. Those who start wars must first consider their minimal as well as their maximal objectives and how \u2013 whatever the outcome \u2013 they can end the war, on what terms, and with whom. Wars do not end when those who triumph on the battlefield proclaim victory but only when those who are defeated accept their defeat and resign themselves to the circumstances it has created. If the vanquished are decapitated and left without credible leadership, there will be no one with whom to make an effective peace. This is a common cause of postwar low intensity conflict and insurgency.[2]\n\nWar is the province of militaries, but the formation and sustainment of alliances and ententes to conduct it is the domain of diplomacy. Diplomacy does not end when war begins, it sometimes provokes war, and it accompanies and supports it. War often involves complex logistical problems that depend on other countries agreeing to rights of transit, basing, the transport and storage of materiel, and legal immunities for forces engaged in these activities. The nation\u2019s armed forces look to diplomats to help arrange such facilitation of their operations.\n\nThe negotiation of terms for war\u2019s termination, and the translation of battlefield results into stable postwar political adjustments in relations between the victors and the defeated are quintessentially diplomatic tasks. Diplomacy vindicates military sacrifices and consolidates battlefield achievements by translating them into a sustainable status quo. Former combatants must be brought to agree that, going forward, it is in their interest to acquiesce in the realities combat has produced, rather than to attempt to subvert or overturn the new status quo. In victory, magnanimity \u2013 appropriate restraint by the victors in their demands of the vanquished \u2014 is usually the key to sustainable outcomes. This is because war termination requires reconciling the vanquished to the losses they have suffered as well as satisfying the victor that it has gained what it wanted.\n\nLike physicians, with whom they share an ethic of doing no harm, diplomats soon learn that mitigating one problem will not eliminate the need to address others. Foreign affairs are an endless process in which the successful resolution of one issue as often as not complicates or creates still others. Every interaction on an immediate issue is also the negotiation of a longer-term relationship with an opponent and helps determine the extent to which future agreements with that opponent will be feasible. This is why diplomats take care not to deceive those with whom they deal. Trust, once forfeited, can never be fully restored.\n\nDiplomacy contributes to national well-being by exploiting unforeseen opportunities to advance state interests[3] or reducing wasteful defense spending through d\u00e9tente, arms control, or disarmament accords. A great deal of diplomacy consists of ensuring that the natural frictions inherent in relations between states and peoples are minimized and restrained,[4] that needless confrontations and blunders into warfare are avoided, and that when war does occur its scope and level of violence are appropriately constrained. Such risk management challenges the skills of diplomats at cultivating foreign counterparts and leaders and sustaining productive interactions with them as well as their relationships with their own government, which is inevitably focused more on managing the domestic politics of foreign relations than on those relations themselves.\n\nDiplomatic dialogue is the key to the fashioning of strategic relationships and the management of conflicting interests with foreign governments. Its conduct requires diplomats to approach the discussion of issues with firm objectives but an open mind about how best to achieve them and to keep their own views in reserve. It begins with their asking their interlocutors to explain how they see a situation at issue, how they believe it is likely to develop, whether they view this or alternative evolutions as likely to be helpful or hurtful to their interests. If so, why, and what do they plan to do to support desired outcomes or preclude unfavorable ones? Soliciting the views of those diplomats hope to persuade to do things they want them to do helps convince them they are being taken seriously and have something to gain by being reasonable. The insights they provide may also suggest how a diplomat can bring their views closer to his or her own government\u2019s.\n\nIf diplomatic dialogue reveals analyses and interests that are in part congruent with those of the diplomat\u2019s government, the way is open for a discussion of what each side might do separately in parallel or together to promote the outcomes both aspire to shape. If it reveals differing analyses but compatible interests, diplomats will want to understand the unstated presuppositions that explain these analytical differences and seek to persuade the other side to reconsider them. If the two sides\u2019 analyses are similar but their appraisals of the consequences for their nations\u2019 interests differ, diplomats will want to consider how best to persuade the other side that its interests are not incompatible with those of their own government and are therefore not a plausible cause for discord.\n\nIt is at the strategic level that diplomacy can make its greatest mark.[5] The instruments of statecraft are warriors, spies, and diplomats. \u201cThe art of statesmanship is to foresee the inevitable and to expedite its occurrence,\u201d[6] while gaining and preserving every conceivable advantage for one\u2019s state. Today, major, often unpredictable shifts in the balance of power and the pattern of international relations are occurring, international law is increasingly disrespected, and the limitations of the use of force and the risks of war escalating to Armageddon have never been more apparent. No world power now enjoys automatic deference from others. The alignments of many regional powers are in play.\n\nThe crafting of a new strategic order conducive to peace is the diplomatic challenge of our times. This is a task for well-trained professionals, not for those attempting to deal with a world order they have yet to realize no longer exists, still less for untutored amateurs.[7]\n\n[1] A prime example of this is U.S. policies toward north Korea \u2013 the \u201cDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea or DPRK\u201d \u2013 that have relied exclusively on military deterrence. In the absence of follow-up to the 1953 armistice, which called for the conclusion of a peace in Korea, endless confrontation has resulted in the emergence of a previously unthinkable danger of a Korean nuclear strike on the U.S. homeland. A similar focus on military deterrence by the United States accompanied by failure to promote a peaceful resolution of the Chinese civil war and the Taiwan issue has resulted in escalating risks of war, including a possible nuclear exchange, with the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\n[2] The anarchy and insurgency that followed the U.S. disbanding of the Iraqi government after invading Iraq in 2003 are a classic instance of this.\n\n[3] See, e.g., https://chasfreeman.net/diplomacy-as-tactics/\n\n[4] See, e.g., https://chasfreeman.net/diplomacy-as-risk-management/\n\n[5] See https://chasfreeman.net/diplomacy-as-strategy/ and https://chasfreeman.net/on-diplomatic-relationships-and-strategies/\n\n[6] Talleyrand\n\n[7] As Fran\u00e7ois de Calli\u00e8res put it three centuries ago: \u201cDiplomacy is a profession by itself which deserves the same preparation and assiduity of attention that men give to other recognized professions. The qualities of a diplomatist and the knowledge necessary to him cannot, indeed, all be acquired. The diplomatic genius is born, not made. But there are many qualities which may be developed with practice, and the greater part of the necessary knowledge can only be acquired by constant application to the subject. In this sense diplomacy is certainly a profession capable of occupying a man\u2019s whole career, and those who think to embark upon a diplomatic mission as a pleasant diversion from their common task only prepare disappointment for themselves and disaster for the cause which they serve. The veriest fool would not entrust the command of an army to a man whose sole badge of merit was his eloquence in a court of law or his adroit practice of the courtier\u2019s art in the palace. All are agreed that military command must be earned by long service in the army. In the same manner it should be regarded as folly to entrust the conduct of negotiations to an untrained amateur.\u201d",

        "text": "Remarks to a Conference of the Schiller Institute\n\nAmbassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)\n\nBy Video, 15 June 2024\n\nLadies and gentlemen:\n\nIt is an honor to join the Schiller Institute in today\u2019s conference. Someone must speak out for peace. Someone must advocate and organize diplomacy rather than war as the answer to the tensions now afflicting Europe. I commend the Institute and Helga Zepp-Larouche, its founder and leader, for speaking out and for convening us.\n\nWe are here to sound the alarm about where the cycle of escalation and counter-escalation between NATO and the Russian Federation is taking Europe, Russia, and America and to consider what to do about this. Red lines have been drawn, then repeatedly abandoned. Each side has said it will not do this or that, and then gone ahead and done it. Now, in response to NATO backing direct Ukrainian strikes on targets deep inside Russian territory, Russia is not only striking back at strategic targets in Ukraine but threatening retaliation elsewhere. What has been a proxy war now risks becoming direct conflict between the United States, NATO, and the Russian Federation.\n\nThe good news is that President Putin has said that, for now, he does not plan to retaliate against Western escalation of attacks on his homeland with his enormous nuclear arsenal. But it is a sign of how dangerous this moment is that he has announced that he will instead arm the enemies of the United States and other NATO countries involved in attacking Russia. It is unclear whether he means to restrict this reprisal to states or whether he will include nonstate actors. That is bad enough, but, given the short half-life to date of any red line involving Ukraine, his next retaliatory step could well be nuclear.\n\nSometimes history is the product of strategic design, sometimes of miscalculations and blunders. The peace managed by the Concert of Europe was an artifact of statecraft. World War I was a mishap that ushered in almost a half-century of ruinous turmoil. Bretton Woods and the post-World War II order were the creations of statesmen. Ours is an age of irrational antagonisms born of strategic misjudgments and bungling. It is off to a dangerous start.\n\nThere is renewed warfare between great powers in Europe and open antagonism between the United States and China. It is pointless to ask who is to blame. Future generations of historians will render judgments on this that transcend our current passions.\n\nThe international system in which we have cooperated and prospered is disintegrating. For seventy-three years \u2013 from 1944 to 2017 \u2013 the world was mainly regulated by internationally agreed norms, obligations, and conventions grounded in the United Nations Charter. This system was originally advocated by Washington, though not necessarily always respected by it. It worked out well for the United States until many Americans thought it did not. Then a disgruntled American electorate elected a populist administration that was long on resentment of the constraints of the international order, untutored in statecraft, economically nationalist, and indifferent to critical foreign opinion.\n\nThe current U.S. administration has doubled down on both its predecessor\u2019s national security-based protectionism and its economic warfare against presumed adversaries. And it has doggedly sought to extend the American sphere of influence in Europe to the very borders of Russia, while dismissing Moscow\u2019s objections and refusing to acknowledge, let alone address its strategic concerns. Russia has not ceased to propose negotiations to devise a security architecture in Europe in which it does not feel threatened by the United States and its European allies, and Europeans similarly do not feel threatened by Russia. The United States and NATO have consistently refused to talk with Russia about this.\n\nThe stated war aim of the West is to \u201cisolate and weaken Russia.\u201d The results of this policy and the sanctions adopted to promote it have been:\n\nFirst, to decouple Russia from Europe and North America and reorient it toward China, India, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nSecond, to revive the Russian economy and deindustrialize Germany and other members of the European Union formerly dependent on Russian energy exports. In purchasing power terms, Russia now has the largest economy in Europe.\n\nThird, to double the size of the Russian defense budget, armed forces, and armaments production and to stimulate Russian development of counters to NATO\u2019s military doctrines and weaponry.\n\nAnd fourth, to catalyze the alienation of the so-called \u201cGlobal South\u201d or \u201cGlobal Majority\u201d from the West and to isolate the West in global institutions.\n\nFor Ukraine \u2013 whose abandonment of its neutrality provided the casus belli for Russia \u2013 the war has been a national catastrophe. Ukraine has lost one-third of its population and an entire generation of brave men of military age. It has already lost one-fifth of its territory and it lacks the capacity to prevent further losses. Its infrastructure has been devastated. Before this war, Ukraine was the poorest and most corrupt country in Europe. It has been further impoverished. War fosters corruption, and Ukraine is more corrupt than ever. Ukraine\u2019s democracy has been superseded by martial law. Its political parties have been outlawed, its media nationalized, and its elections canceled. It is now more authoritarian than Russia and far less tolerant of ethno-linguistic diversity.\n\nThe West\u2019s proxy war on Russia has been a failure. It has enhanced Russia\u2019s global influence and strengthened it militarily. It has not prevented Russia from gutting Ukraine. And it has raised rather than allayed fears of a wider war in Europe. It now threatens to go nuclear.\n\nYou might suppose that what has happened would lead the West and Ukraine to stop reinforcing failure and to seek a diplomatic rather than a military solution to a situation that increasingly threatens not just the peace and prosperity of Europe but escalation to the nuclear level.\n\nBut no. The United States and NATO are doubling down on a purely military approach to managing European security and relations with the Russian Federation. The West has no strategy that holds out any realistic prospect of regaining any of the territory Ukraine has lost. Ukraine is in danger of losing still more, possibly endangering its access to the Black Sea. And there is no war termination strategy. Instead, the West proposes to fight to the last Ukrainian and continues to dream of imposing a humiliating defeat on Russia \u2013 the very outcome that Russian military doctrine stipulates would justify Moscow\u2019s use of nuclear weapons against its attackers. Meanwhile, President Zelensky has joined the West in insisting that there can be no negotiations with Russia to end the war.\n\nThe course we are following is based on miscalculations and blunders. It is a march of folly that, if continued, leads only to tragedy. It is destroying Ukraine. It has taken us to the brink of nuclear war between the United States, NATO, and the Russian Federation. But it is not too late to take another path.\n\nOnce before, the world trembled at the prospect of a nuclear exchange that would have made our planet uninhabitable. That was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. It led President John F. Kennedy to the conclusion that we should \u201cnever negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\u201d That is as sound advice today as it was sixty-two years ago.\n\nWe should learn from the contrast between the way in which the Napoleonic Wars ended and how we ended World War I. The convenors of the Congress of Vienna were careful to include their former French enemy in the crafting of what became the Concert of Europe \u2013 an arrangement based on a balance of power that kept Europe largely at peace for a century. The victors in World War I excluded both Germany and Russia from any role in the management of the peace negotiated at Versailles. The result was World War II, followed by the Cold War. There can be no peace in Europe based on the ostracism of Russia or any other great European power.\n\nIn many ways, the breakdown of the post-Cold War peace in Europe has brought us to what Chancellor Scholtz called a Zeitenwende \u2013 a turning point in history that demands the crafting of a new order in international relations. Helga Zepp-Larouche has likened this challenge to that faced by the nations of Europe after the Thirty Years War. It took protracted negotiations to produce the Peace of Westphalia and overcome the religious, territorial, and regime change impulses that had devastated Central Europe. The understandings that grew from that peace live on. They were affirmed by the newly independent states of the post-colonial era at Bandung in 1955 in the form of the \u201cFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.\u201d These are mutual respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs, equality and co-operation for mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. It is time for Europe, including Russia, to rediscover and adapt this diplomatic heritage to the challenges of the day.\n\nThe outcome of the recent European Parliament elections suggests that Europeans are ready for new thinking about Europe\u2019s future. Interestingly, it is the European Right, like the American Right, which is most disillusioned by the forever war in Ukraine and most dissatisfied with the economic decline of the West. There is a basis for something like the conferences in M\u00fcnster and Osnabr\u00fcck that crafted the Peace of Westphalia to explore and affirm principles for a new European order that can bring peace to Ukraine, refashion European-American relations to enhance European strategic autonomy, bring Russia back to an appropriate relationship with the rest of Europe, and create international understandings to sustain security and stability in Europe. But are there leaders with the imagination, drive, and diplomatic skills to accomplish this?\n\nWe must hope there are. If there are not, the risks are high and the prospects dire. I look forward to a lively discussion among the distinguished participants in this conference.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Technology and Sanctions War Will End, by Bifurcating the Global Economy\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation, 18 Dec 2018\n\nThe true reason behind the US-China \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrade\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 war has little to do with actual trade \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 What is really at the basis of the ongoing civilizational conflict between the US and China \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 are China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitions to be a leader in next-generation technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), which rest on whether or not it can design and manufacture cutting-edge chips, and is why Xi has pledged at least $150 billion to build up the sector\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, Zerohedge writes.\n\nNothing new here: yet behind that ambition, lies another, further ambition and a little mentioned \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelephant in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrade war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is also the first stage to a new arms race between the US & China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit of a different genre of arms race. This \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew generation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arms-race is all about reaching national superiority\u00c2 in technology over the longer-term, via Quantum Computing, Big Data, Artificial\u00c2 Intelligence (AI), Hypersonic Warplanes, Electronic Vehicles, Robotics, and Cyber-Security.\n\nThe blueprint for it, in China, is in the public domain. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMade in China 2025\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (now downplayed, but far from forgotten).\u00c2 And the Chinese expenditure commitment ($ 150 billion) to take the tech lead \u2013 will be met \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchead on\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (as Zerohedge puts it), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by a [counterpart] \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAmerica First\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategy:\u00c2 \u00c2 Hence the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcarms race\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in tech spending \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is intimately linked with defence spending. \u00c2 Note: military spending by the US and China is forecast by the IMF to rise substantially in coming decades, but the stunner is: that by 2050, China is set to overtake the US, spending $4tn on its military, while the US is $1 trillion less, or $3tn \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This means that\u00c2 sometime around 2038, roughly two decades from now, China will surpass the US in military spending.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThis close intimacy between tech and defence in US future defence thinking is plain: It is all about data, big data and AI: A Defense One article makes this very clear,\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The battle domains of space and cyber are divorced, largely, from the raw physical reality of war. To Hyten [Gen. John E. Hyten, who leads US Air Force Space Command], these two uninhabited spaces mirror one another in another way: They are fields of data and information and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what modern war runs on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What are the missions we do in space today? Provide information; provide pathways for information; in conflict, we deny adversaries access to that information,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he told an audience on Wednesday at the Air Force Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual conference outside Washington, D.C.. The same is true of\u00c2 cyber.\n\nThe\u00c2 U.S.\u00c2 wages war with tools that require a lot of information \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Inevitably, more adversaries will eventually employ data-connected drones and gunships of their own. The heavy information component of modern-day weapons, particularly that those wielded by air forces, also creates vulnerabilities. Air Force leaders this week discussed how they are looking to reduce the vulnerability for the United States while increasing it for\u00c2 adversaries\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nSo, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfront line\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to this trade/tech/defence war, effectively pivots about who can design \u2013 and manufacture \u2013 cutting-edge, semi-conductors (since China already has the lead in Big Data, Quantum computing, and AI).\u00c2 And, in this context, General Hyten\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment about reducing US vulnerability, whilst increasing it for adversaries takes on major significance: For Washington, the plan is to ramp up export controls (i.e. ban the export) of so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfoundational technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d those that can enable development in a broad range of sectors.\u00c2\n\nAnd the equipment for manufacturing chips, or semi-conductors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not surprisingly \u2013 is one of the key \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctarget areas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 under discussion.\n\nExport controls though, are just one part of this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategy of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdata denial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to adversaries.\u00c2 But semi-conductors is one field in which China is indeed vulnerable: since the global semiconductor industry rests on the shoulders of just six equipment companies, of which three are based in the US. Together, these six companies make nearly all of the crucial hardware and software tools needed to manufacture chips.\u00c2 This\u00c2 implies that an American export ban would choke off China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to the basic tools needed to manufacture their latest chip designs (though China can retaliate by choking-off the supply of Raw Earth, upon which sophisticated tech, is reliant).\n\n\u201cYou cannot build a semiconductor facility without using the big major equipment companies, none of which are Chinese,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Brett Simpson, the founder of Arete Research, an equity research group. And, as the FT, notes, the real difficulty is not [so much] designing the chips, but in the making of very cutting-edge chips.\u201d\n\nSo here is the point: the US is attempting to clasp to itself both the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 technology-knowledge, plus additionally, the practical tech supply-chain experience and knowhow, in order to repulse China out from the western tech sphere.\n\nAt the same time, another strand to the US strategy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as we have witnessed with Huawei, a global leader in 5G infrastructure technology (in which the U.S. is falling behind) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is to scare everyone off\u00c2 incorporating Chinese\u00c2 5G in to their national infrastructures \u2013 through such devices as the arrest of Meng Wanzhou (for breach of US sanctions).\u00c2\n\nEven before her \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcarrest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, America has been systematically cutting\u00c2 Huawei\u00c2 out of the global 5G rollout, by quoting the magical words: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecurity concerns\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Just as it is attempting to cut Russia out of weapons sales in the Middle East, on similar, tech-protective, grounds: i.e. that states should not buy Russian air defence, since this would give Russia a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwindow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into NATO tech capabilities).\n\nAnd, as General Hyten made clear, this not just about increasing tech and area denial, and promoting vulnerability for adversaries in terms of chips \u2013 but the US also plans to extend tech and area info-denial to space, cyber, avionics and military equipment.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another Cold War \u2013 but this time it is about technology and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdata denial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2\n\nWell, China, with its centralized economy, will throw money and brainpower, into creating its own, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnon-dollar sphere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, supply lines: for semi-conductors; for components \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both for civil and military use.\u00c2 It will take time, but the solution will come.\n\nClearly, one consequence of this new arms race between the US \u2013 and China and Russia \u2013 is that specialized, and thinly-populated supply lines will have to be disentangled, and made anew, each in its own separate sphere: that is, on one hand, within the NATO-dollar sphere, and on the other, in the non-dollar sphere, led by China and Russia.\n\nAnd not only will there be this physical supply-line disentanglement and separation, but should the US persist with its Huawei leverage tactic of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWar on Terror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-style \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrendition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of foreign businessmen, or business women, alleged to have breached any US broad spectrum tech sanctions, there will have to be a disentangling of mixed boardrooms to avoid exposing company officials to individual arrest and prosecution.\u00c2 Limitations on company officers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 travel, where their business spans spheres, is already happening (as a result of the attempted rendition of Meng Wahzhou \u2013 and in order to avoid being caught up in tit-for-tat, retribution).\n\nThe bifurcation of the global economy was already in process.\u00c2 This stemmed firstly from America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s geo-political financial sanctions regime (i.e. Treasury Wars) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the consequent attempts by targeted states to de-couple from the dollar sphere.\u00c2 The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar hawks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 surrounding the President are now inventing a whole new swathe of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctech crimes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for sanctioning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ostensibly to give Trump oven more of his much-desired negotiating \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleverage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Clearly the hawks are using the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleverage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pretext, to up-the-ante against China, Russia and its allies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for far wider ambitions than just giving the President more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccards in his hand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Perhaps rather, to re-set the entire power-balance between America versus China and Russia.\n\nThe obvious and inevitable consequence has been an accelerating financial separation from the dollar sphere; and the development of a non-dollar architecture.\u00c2 De-dollarisation in a word.\n\nEffectively, the US seems prepared to burn-down its reserve-currency status, to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 itself \u2013 to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMake America Rich Again\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (MARA), and to hobble China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise.\u00c2 And while burning down dollar-hegemony, the Administration is burning its own \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal order\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 too: attenuating it from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcglobal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u2013 down to a reduced sphere of US tech and security allies, facing China and the non-West. The domestic consequences for America will be felt in the new (for Americans) frustration of finding it harder to finance itself, in the manner in which it has grown accustomed, over the last 70 years, or so.\n\nPeter Schiff, CEO and Chief Global Strategist of Euro Pacific Capital, says that:\n\n\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c [the US] having the reserve currency, [is placing that] status \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in jeopardy.\u00c2 And I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the world likes giving America this kind of power that we can impose our own rules and demand that the entire world live by it.\u00c2 So, I think this has a much bigger and broader ramifications other than what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on in the stock market today. I think long-term, this is going to undermine the dollar, and its role as a reserve currency. And when that goes, so does the American standard of living: because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to collapse.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153People think we have the upper hand because we have this huge trade deficit with China. But I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the other way.\u00c2 I think the fact that they supply us with all this merchandise that our economy needs, and the fact that they hold a lot of our bonds [debt], and continue to lend us a lot of money so we can live beyond our means \u2013 they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the ones, I think, that call the tunes, and we have to dance to it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThis tech and data new Cold War will polarise the global economy into spheres, and already it is polarising it politically, into a new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwith us, or against us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 American paradigm. Politico notes:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Trump administration\u2019s global campaign against telecom giant Huawei is pitting Europe against itself \u2013 over China. In the midst of a ballooning U.S.-China trade conflict, Washington has spent the past few months pressing its EU allies via its ambassadors to take a stronger stance against Chinese telecom vendors such as Huawei and ZTE.\n\nThe American push\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6is exposing fault-lines between U.S. allies in Europe as well as [between] the so-called \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence community \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which have largely followed the U.S. lead \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and others that resist the American pressure, by stopping short of calling out Chinese tech.\n\nOn the other side there is Germany, which wants proof from the United States that Huawei poses a security risk, as well as France, Portugal and a slew of central and eastern EU nations.\n\nThe increasingly divergent attitudes show how Donald Trump is forcing allies to take sides in a global dispute and measure their economic interests \u00e2\u20ac\u201d often deeply embedded with the Chinese vendors \u00e2\u20ac\u201d against the value of a security alliance with Washington.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe potential for accelerated de-dollarisation is one aspect, but there is another potential flaw inherent to the wholesale repatriation of supply-lines.\u00c2 US corporate earnings have ballooned over the last two decades.\u00c2 Part of this earnings hike stemmed from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 liquidity, and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit; but a major element owed to cost-cutting \u2014 that is to say, off-shoring elements of higher-cost US production (because of wage levels, regulatory costs and employee entitlements) to lower wage, less regulated states.\u00c2 The coming bifurcation of the global economy has therefore, as its inevitable consequence, the repatriation of lower-cost production (in China and elsewhere) to a now higher-cost, and more highly regulated, US and European environment.\n\nPerhaps this is a good thing \u2014 but for sure it means costs and prices will rise in the US and America, and it means that corporate business models will be impaired as they de- off-shore.\u00c2 Americans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 standards of living will decline further (as Peter Schiff foretells).\n\nThe alienation and disgruntlement of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeplorables\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYellow Vests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is evidently a profound problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and one that will not be solved by a new Cold War.\u00c2 The roots to our present discontents lie precisely with the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 liquidity, and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceasy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 credit paradigm, which centrifuged-out societies into the asset owning 10% and into the non-asset holding 90% of society, and which degraded so the sense of societal well-being and security.\n\nOf course this discontent can really only be resolved by addressing the question of our hyper-financialised economic paradigm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not something the \u00c3\u00a9lites will, or want, to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctouch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The US-China trade war is primarily driven by a technological arms race, with both nations striving for dominance in next-generation technologies like AI and semiconductors, leading to a bifurcated global economy and a potential decline in the US dollar's reserve currency status.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The article \"America\u2019s Technology and Sanctions War Will End, by Bifurcating the Global Economy\" by Alastair Crooke discusses the underlying motives of the US-China trade war, which are less about trade and more about technological dominance. China aims to lead in next-generation technologies like AI and quantum computing, which has led to a new arms race focused on technological superiority. The US is countering China's ambitions through strategies such as export controls on foundational technologies and efforts to exclude Chinese companies like Huawei from global markets, citing security concerns. This tech war is leading to a bifurcation of the global economy into two spheres: the US-led dollar sphere and a non-dollar sphere led by China and Russia. This division is causing financial and supply chain separations, potentially undermining the US dollar's reserve currency status and affecting global economic dynamics. The article suggests that this new Cold War will have significant implications for global alliances, economic structures, and the standard of living in the US, as it may lead to increased costs and a decline in living standards due to the repatriation of production to higher-cost environments.",

        "text": "What Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Happen at G20 is Far More Important than What Did\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation, 10 Dec 2018\n\nSometimes what doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t occur tells us much more than what did\u00c2 \u2014 as in Sherlock Holmes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 case of the dog that did not bark in the night.\u00c2 Yes, two things did not occur at the G20, at the end of last week: Why?\u00c2 And what do they signify?\n\nWhat these two lacunae tell us is something important: that Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency has reached a key point of inflection \u2014 the end of the beginning, or perhaps even the beginning of the end?\n\nFirst, there was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with China.\u00c2 As Christopher Balding, former associate professor of business and economics at the HSBC Business School in China, frankly put it: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It cannot be emphasized enough: This is not a deal, and it is not a resolution. This is an agreement to delay further escalation. Neither side really gave anything, except some cotton candy sweeteners. Nothing fundamental\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nMost of the subsequent media commentary\u00c2 has focussed on the prospects of a return to the Cold War trenches at the end of ninety days (a deadline which incidentally China has yet to confirm) or, even sooner, as Trump returns to Twitter belligerency.\u00c2 But the real question is not what happens towards the end of the first quarter 2019, but why was there \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Saturday?\u00c2\n\nTrump has been promising \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am a tariff man\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, he proclaims in a tweet, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make America Rich Again\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2 And, the Administration keeps repeating that the US economy is strong, whilst the Chinese one is weak: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe have all the leverage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the Administration outs at regular intervals.\u00c2 We can \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctariff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 double the goods, and double the tariffs too, Trump warns, whilst the US exercises its military muscle, regularly, right into Xi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face.\n\nAnd then?\u00c2 Come G20, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnothing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Trump stalks the edges of G20 looking tense and defensive.\u00c2 He was no alpha-male, dominating these events.\u00c2 He looked crocked. It was all a bit of a dud, really.\n\nRecall however, that the G20 followed immediately in the wake of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguilty plea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to Robert Mueller, for lying to Congress, by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen.\u00c2 This, as Harvard Law Professor Dershowitz notes, is evidence of Mueller again creating new crimes (through entrapment), in place of investigating the possibility of past crimes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet Mueller, clearly is still \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcafter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Trump:\u00c2 And maybe, he will not prove any crime (collusion, were it to have occurred, is no crime anyway) \u2013 but that is not the point.\u00c2 Mueller is cornering Trump politically, as opposed to legally, through painting him as sleazy, and surrounded by liars and scoundrels.\u00c2 Mueller is targeting Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vanity: shredding Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-image as somehow a heroic figure set on restoring the greatness of America: Making America Rich Again.\u00c2 Mueller is slowly paralysing the President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potency, whilst making him appear a mere empty vessel.\n\nFormer US diplomat, James Jatras thus hints at the answer to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhy no deal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the\u00c2 Democrats set to take over in the House\u00c2 of Representatives in just over a month, we\u2019ll soon see\u00c2 intensified investigations coordinated with Mueller\u00c2 to find any possible pretext for impeachment in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business or private life. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conventional wisdom that even if the Democrat-controlled House can find something to support articles of impeachment, the GOP-held Senate will be Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firewall. Bunk. Democrats rallied around their president Bill Clinton but it was Republicans who threw Richard Nixon to the wolves. Are there a dozen or so Republican Senators who would be ready to dump Trump and install Mike Pence in the Oval Office? You betcha. Start with Mitt Romney.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAnd what might, in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, stand between him and the unbearable indignity \u2013 and blow to his ego \u2013 of being \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdumped\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by his party, and being further humiliated by being hounded from office?\u00c2 Well, what wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t is a collapsing market, and an US economy stalling into approaching recession. That, in itself, could possibly deliver the President precisely into the hands of those Republican Senators who despise him, and who would side with the Democrats in a heartbeat, if they thought they could get away with dumping the President \u2014 just as Jatras suggests.\n\nThe US market was already sinking into the doldrums in the week before the G20.\u00c2 The trade-war fear, initially discounted, has begun gripping market sentiment.\u00c2 And tell-tale harbingers (though not definitive) of a recessional economy are being espied (such as the inversion of part of the Treasury yield curve, and the oil futures curve having been in contango. Both are considered as signals of a global economy that may be slowing).\n\nThe point here is simply that Trump has, very explicitly, hitched his presidential fortunes to a rising stock market and a roaring economy.\u00c2 So, if it might stop the market from puncturing his business-savvy image, why not a offer a trade-war respite with China?\u00c2 Why not give the markets a pre-Christmas goosing?\n\nThen there was the other notable G20 omission: another dog that significantly failed to bark. The Presidents of two pre-eminent military and nuclear powers, who sit astride major geo-political faultlines, and who need to talk, circled each other, closed-faced, and without stretching out hands \u2014 they could not find even, the subterfuge for sitting together.\n\nWhy? Ostensibly, because a tug-boat and a couple of Ukrainian armed coastal vessels were told to enter the Azoz \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, whilst ignoring the required norms of obtaining prior permission. Really? For that? How bizarre.\u00c2 Trump no longer can pull Mr Putin aside, send away his aides, to sit and talk?\u00c2 Even more interesting, was that the Kremlin spokesman subsequently said that there \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchad been exchanges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Washington, and that John Bolton would be coming to Moscow, to discuss a possible future meeting between Trump and Putin.\u00c2 And that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been done face-to-face in Buenos Aires because of an arrested tugboat?\u00c2 And that such meeting now requires Bolton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prior imprimatur and involvement?\n\nAll in all, President Trump emerges from this summit, a pussy-cat.\u00c2 Big on talk, short on action: Short on action domestically; short on action in cleaning the swamp; and short on action generally. Jatras concludes, more in sorrow than in anger, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it would be only a small exaggeration to say that with respect to foreign and security policy, Trump is now a mere figurehead of the permanent state. Even\u00c2 if Trump and Putin do happen to meet again, what can the latter expect the former to say that would make any difference?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nWhy?\u00c2 We can only speculate:\u00c2 Simply, it may be that he fears that the markets and economy are turning against him.\u00c2 Perhaps Trump fears a Republican \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrutus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will smell his weakness (stripped of his market-raising \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmagic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), and plunge the dagger in his back?\n\nIn his book, Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates distinguishes between different debt cycles: the short-term cycles, and debt \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuper-cycles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Short-term debt cycles move more or less in parallel with the underlying economic cycles, and last on average 7-8 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in line with the average length of economic cycles.\u00c2 Debt \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuper-cycles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 typically last 50-75 years, and have a long history.\u00c2 Dalio notes their mention in the Old Testament, which described the need to wipe out debt every 50 years or so, whence it was known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYear of Jubilee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Debt super-cycles always end with a big bang\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, Nils Jensen writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The previous debt super-cycle ended with the breakout of World War II, and a new debt super-cycle commenced its life when the canons fell silent in 1945. We are now almost 75 years into the current super-cycle; i.e. it will go down in history as one of the longer ones\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nIt is Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misfortune that his Presidency seems to be coinciding with the end to not just \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 super-cycle, but to a turbo-charged, global debt super-cycle, fuelled by radical interest rate suppression, and massive credit creation (which may explain its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclongevity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122).\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDoubly unfortunate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, perhaps, because at the same time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for related reasons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US simply is running out of fiscal \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 The Treasury has a big (a repeating, dollar, Trillion-plus) borrowing requirement, in this and coming years, and foreigners are no longer buying US debt. In short, for the first time in seventy years, the Reserve Currency holder is finding it hard to finance itself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in the current atmosphere of Washington polarisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US cannot reform itself, either. It is stuck.\n\nThis represents the primordial paradox that is binding the US President: Politically he needs a rising market and a roaring economy, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOracles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are mouthing that the Goldilocks market already may be behind him.\u00c2 He wants the Fed to lift the market aloft, but the Fed is more concerned to prepare for the next phase to the economic cycle.\u00c2 For that, it needs the elbow-room to be able to drop interest rates by 4%, which of course is impossible now.\u00c2 And the Fed needs a leaner balance sheet \u2013 in case of needing to charge to the rescue of the economy.\n\nSo here is the tension that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbinds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Trump:\u00c2 He can act politically, and risk a deeper end-of-cycle \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbig bang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; or act sagely, to limit the potential consequences of a possible debt crisis.\u00c2 But, acting \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsagely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 also implies understanding that America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal situation of having to sell a mountain of US debt paper, on a market bereft of foreign buyers is likely to lead interest rates up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stock prices down (as institutions sell shares to buy the higher yielding USTs).\u00c2 In short, politically he wants shares up and interest rates down, but America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present fiscal situation is likely to impose the inverse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and therefore expose him to the potential \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBrutus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lurking in the Senate corridors.\n\nWhich will he choose?\u00c2 Well, we can see it already: Trump is desperate to keep the equity market up. His own security is tied to it: He is bullying Jerome Powell to halt the projected Fed interest rate interest rate hikes; and he wants the price of oil down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so that Powell has no excuse (of rising inflation), to hike rates further.\u00c2 So anxious was Trump, it seems, that he was ready to issue several oil waivers in respect to purchasers of Iranian oil. His 25 November tweet makes the link between low oil prices and his expectation that the Fed should forego hikes, quite explicit:\n\nSo great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!\n\nWhat does all this mean?\u00c2 It means that Trump, whose entire business acculturation favours debt \u2013 more debt and low or zero-based interest rates \u2013 will hope to get his way \u2013 and he may partially. The signs are that the Fed will raise rates this month, but may slow the pace of rises next year. (At least, this is what the shape of the futures curves would imply).\n\nBut the auguries are adverse: World trade is slowing; China is slowing; Japan is slowing; Germany and Europe are slowing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the first shoots, hinting that the US has peaked in 2Q18, are poking through the soil.\u00c2 Trump may end with neither a roaring stock market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nor, more ominously, a bond market, painlessly digesting the Trillions of US debt.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, the Hawks run it: Pence, Navarro and Lighthizer will pursue their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcall-government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cold war with China, but who knows what will be the state of the US market in 90 days. I would not bet on those additional tariffs and 25% rates emerging in April.\u00c2 Xi has played it perfectly: Sun Tzu would be proud.\n\nAnd Mr Bolton will continue to press Russia at all points of its border; to disrupt it economically, through a regular diet of sanctions; trouble-raising in Ukraine, and trying to diss Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political process in Syria (the Astana Process).",

The lack of a deal with China underscores the fragility of Trump's economic strategies, as he has tied his political fortunes to a strong stock market and economy.

        "text": "Italy, the EU, and the Fall of the Roman Empire\n\nAlastiar Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation, 3 Dec 2018\n\nThe EU leadership is trying to contain a crisis that is emerging at increasing speed: This challenge comprises the rise of contumacious states (i.e. the UK, Poland, Hungary and Italy), or of defiant, historic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccultural blocs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (i.e. Catalonia) \u2014 all of whom are explicitly disenchanted with the notion of some coerced convergence towards a uniform EU-administered \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcorder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, with its austere monetary \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisciplines\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They even dismiss the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim to be, somehow, a part of a greater civilizational order of moral values.\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2\n\nIf, in the post-war era, the EU represented an attempt to escape the Anglo-American hegemony, these new defiant blocks of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccultural resurgence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which seek to situate themselves as interdependent, sovereign \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspaces\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are, in their turn, an attempt to escape another type of hegemony: that of an EU administrative \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuniformity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 \u00c2\n\nTo exit this particular European order (which it originally was hoped, would differ from the Anglo-American imperii), the EU nevertheless was forced to lean on the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s archetypal construct of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliberty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as empire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s justification (now metamorphosed into the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfour freedoms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) on which the EU strict \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuniformities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclevel-playing-field\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, regulation in all aspects of life, tax and economic harmonization) have been hung.\u00c2 The European \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproject\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has become seen, as it were, as something that hollows out distinct and ancient \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcways-of-being\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nIndeed, the very fact of their being attempted, at different levels, and in distinct geographical cultural regions, these assays indicate that that EU hegemony has already weakened to the point that it may not be able fully to hinder the emergence of\u00c2 this new wave.\u00c2 What is at stake precisely for the EU, is whether it can succeed to slow down, and curb in every way, the emergence of this process of cultural re-sovereigntisation, which of course, threatens to fragment the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vaunted \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsolidarity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and to fragment its matrix of a perfectly regulated customs union and common trade area.\n\nIt was Carl Schmitt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the political philosopher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however, who warned strongly against the possibility of what he called a negative\u00c2 katechon\u00c2 accelerator.\u00c2 This would seem to apply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c exactly \u2013 to the situation in which the EU presently finds itself. This was a notion, held by the ancients, that historical events often have a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbackstage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 contrarian dimension -\u00c2 that is to say that some given \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or action (by say, the EU), may end up accelerating precisely those processes which it was meant to slow down or to halt.\u00c2 For Schmitt, this explained the paradox through which a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbraking action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (such as the one being undertaken by the EU) may actually reverse itself, in an unwanted acceleration of the very processes the EU intends to oppose.\u00c2 Schmitt called this an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvoluntary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 effect, since it produced effects opposed to the original intent.\u00c2 For the ancients, it simply reminded them that we humans often are merely history\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s objects, rather than its causal subjects.\n\nIt is possible that the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbraking action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 imposed on Greece, on Britain, on Hungary \u2013 and now on Italy \u2013 may precisely slide towards Schmitt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Katechon.\u00c2 Italy has lingered in economic limbo for decades: Its new government feels obliged to relieve, in some way, the accumulated economic stresses of past years, and to try to re-kindle growth. But the state has a high level of debt to GDP, and the EU insists that Italy must endure the consequences: it must obey \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe rules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nProfessor Michael Hudson (in a new book) explains how the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbraking action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in respect to Italian debt, represents a certain European strand of psychic rigidity that totally ignores historical experience, and may precisely result in Katechon: the opposite of what is intended.\u00c2 Interviewed by John Siman, Hudson says:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In ancient Mesopotamian societies, it was understood that freedom was preserved by protecting debtors. A corrective model actually existed and flourished in the economic functioning of Mesopotamian societies, during the third and second millennia B.C. It can be termed the Clean Slate amnesty \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It consisted of the necessary and periodic erasure of the debts of small farmers \u00e2\u20ac\u201d necessary because such farmers are, in any society in which interest on loans is calculated, inevitably subject to being impoverished, then stripped of their property. and finally reduced to servitude \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 by their creditors.\n\n[And was necessary too, as a] constant dynamic of history has been the drive by financial elites to centralize control in their own hands and manage the economy in predatory, extractive ways. Their ostensible freedom [comes] at the expense of the governing authority, and the economy at large. As such, it [stands as] the opposite of liberty \u2013 as conceived in Sumerian time \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\nSo it was inevitable [in later centuries], that in Greek and Roman history, increasing numbers of small farmers became irredeemably indebted, and lost their land. It likewise was inevitable that their creditors amassed huge land holdings and established themselves in parasitic oligarchies. This innate tendency to social polarization \u2013 arising from debt unforgiveness \u2013 is the original and incurable curse on our post-eighth-century-B.C. Western Civilization, the lurid birthmark that cannot be washed away, or excised.\u00c2\n\nHudson argues that the long, decline and fall of Rome begins, not as Gibbon had it, with the death of Marcus Aurelius, but four centuries earlier, following Hannibal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastation of the Italian countryside during the Second Punic War (218-201 B.C.). After that war, the small farmers of Italy never recovered their land, which was systematically swallowed up by the\u00c2 pr\u00c3\u00a6dia, the great oligarchic estates, as Pliny the Elder observed. [Of course, today it is small and medium sized Italian businesses that are being swallowed up by oligarchic, pan-European corporations.]\n\nBut among modern scholars, as Hudson points out, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Arnold Toynbee is almost alone in emphasizing the role of debt in concentrating Roman wealth and property ownership\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (p. xviii) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and thus in explaining the decline of the Roman Empire \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mesopotamian societies were not interested in equality,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he told his interviewer, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but they were civilized. And they possessed the financial sophistication to understand that, since interest on loans increases exponentially, while economic growth at best follows an S-curve, this means that debtors will, if not protected by a central authority, end up becoming permanent bondservants to their creditors. So Mesopotamian kings regularly rescued debtors who were getting crushed by their debts. They knew that they needed to do this. Again and again, century after century, they proclaimed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClean Slate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Amnesties.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe EU has punished Greece for its profligacy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is set to punish Italy if it flaunts EU fiscal rules.\u00c2 The EU is attempting what Schmitt termed a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreaking action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to maintain its hegemony.\n\nThis is however, truly a case of the EU seeing the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (speck) in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye, whilst ignoring the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in its own eye. The Economic Cycle Research Institute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lakshman Achuthan writes:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The combined debt of U.S., the Eurozone, Japan and China has increased more than ten times as much as their combined GDP, over the past year.\u00c2 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable that the global economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slowing in sync, despite soaring debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c finds itself in a situation reminiscent of the Red Queen Effect. As the Red Queen says to Alice in Lewis Carroll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Through the Looking Glass, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nBut that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c running faster, taking on more debt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can only, in the end, be resolved with a major default (or through inflating the debt away). Look at the US: its GDP is growing at 2.5%; the US Federal debt is at 105% of GDP; the US Treasury is spending $1.5 billion on interest per day, and debt is growing at 5-6% of GDP.\u00c2 It is not sustainable.\n\nDemands by Greece and Italy for debt relief may be regarded by some as special pleading, in the wake of past economic mismanagement; but Sumerian and Babylonian demands were based not on such \u2013 but rather, on a conservative tradition grounded in rituals of renewing the calendrical cosmos and its periodicities, Hudson tells us. The Mesopotamian idea of reform had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno notion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of what we would call \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsocial progress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Instead, the measures the king instituted under his debt \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjubilees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 were measures intended to restore a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbackstage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, underlying order in society, or maat.\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rules of the game had not been changed, but everyone had been dealt a new hand of cards\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nHudson notes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Greeks and the Romans replaced the cyclical idea of time and societal renewal, with that of linear time\u00e2\u20ac\u009d [with convergence toward an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEnd Time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122]: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Economic polarization became irreversible, not merely temporary\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the idea of renewal became lost.\u00c2 Hudson might have added that linear time, and the loss of the imperative of dismemberment and renewal, has played a major role in underpinning all of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s universalist projects of a linear itinerary towards human transformation (or, Utopianism).\n\nThis is the essential contradiction: that ineluctable economic divarication and polarization is transforming Europe into a continent torn by unresolved internal contradiction. On the one hand it castigates Italy for its debts, and on the other, it has been the ECB which has pursued interest rate \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrepression\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 into negative territory, and has monetized debt to the equivalence of one-third of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global output.\u00c2 How can the EU not have expected banks and businesses not to have loaded up on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpositive-carry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 debt? How can they have expected Banks not to have inflated their balance sheets with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfree debt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the point of becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo big to fail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?\u00c2\n\nThe global explosion of debt is a macro problem that vastly transcends the microcosm of Italy.\u00c2 Like the ancient Roman Empire, the EU has atrophied in its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcorder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to become an obstacle to change, and, with no alternative, but to hold tight to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbraking action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that will ultimately produce effects, completely at odds to the original intent (i.e. involuntary, negative Katechon).",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The article discusses the EU's struggle to maintain its hegemony amidst rising discontent from member states like Italy, highlighting the historical parallels with the Roman Empire's decline due to economic polarization and debt issues, and suggesting that the EU's rigid fiscal policies may inadvertently accelerate the fragmentation it seeks to prevent.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The article by Alastair Crooke discusses the growing crisis within the European Union (EU) as several member states, including the UK, Poland, Hungary, and Italy, express dissatisfaction with the EU's push for a uniform administrative order and strict monetary disciplines. This discontent reflects a broader cultural resurgence and a desire for sovereignty, challenging the EU's hegemony and threatening its solidarity. The EU's efforts to enforce fiscal rules, particularly in countries like Greece and Italy, are likened to a \"braking action\" that may inadvertently accelerate the very processes it aims to prevent, a concept described by political philosopher Carl Schmitt as a \"negative katechon accelerator.\" The article draws parallels between the EU's current predicament and historical events, such as the fall of the Roman Empire, emphasizing the role of debt in societal decline. It highlights the contrast between ancient Mesopotamian practices of debt forgiveness and the EU's rigid fiscal policies, suggesting that the latter may lead to economic polarization and internal contradictions within Europe. The piece concludes by questioning the sustainability of the global debt explosion and the EU's ability to adapt to changing circumstances, warning that its current approach may ultimately hinder progress and transformation.",

        "text": "The Khashoggi Effect: Erdogan Inverts the Paradigm, whilst Gulf & Allies Sink in Quagmire\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation, 26 Nov 2018\n\nIt seems that the quartet (US, Israel, UAE and MbS himself, naturally), acting in the cause of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexonerating MbS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, think they have got their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccoup\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe he did, but maybe he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, exculpation.\u00c2 They are probably quite pleased with themselves. MbS may stay for now, and embarrass everyone at the G20, by ostentatiously trying to shake hands with leaders, in front a phalanx of photographers, as leaders try to dodge the tainted hand.\u00c2 But if MbS does weather the crisis, what it shows more than anything else is how well MbS has succeeded in destroying the al-Saud family as a joint leadership \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenterprise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and in undercutting Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Islamic credentials.\u00c2 President Trump and Jared Kushner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite oblivious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c colluded in this outcome.\n\nAnd the outcome: Yes, as Pepe Escobar, lately was being told in Istanbul: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Erdogan machine has sensed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity [i.e. l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122affaire Khashoggi], to simultaneously bury the House of Saud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaky Islamic credibility, while solidifying Turkish neo-Ottomanism, but with an Ikhwan [i.e. with a Muslim Brotherhood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c style] framework\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2 This is heady stuff \u2014 maybe the Arab world is not so anxious to welcome back, with open arms, either the Ottomans or the Muslim Brotherhood.\u00c2 But nonetheless, with the Gulf so discredited in terms of its legitimacy, Erdogan is probably right to think that he is pushing at an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcopen door\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nAnd strategic interests are giving Erdogan a strong tail-wind in his bid. Erdogan has secured \u2013 as part of the package to try to get Turkey to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclay-off\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with its Khashoggi drip-drip leaks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an end to the Saudi siege on Qatar. It is possible too, as part of the deal, that the Qatari Emir (we are told) might visit Riyadh in the near future, and that some sort of cold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very frigid \u2013 reconciliation will be conducted with MbS.\u00c2 The point is that Qatar is greatly beholden to Erdogan for ending the siege (and for the earlier stationing of Turkish troops in the Emirate, to protect it, against any Saudi attack), and like Turkey, the Emir is a generous Muslim Brotherhood patron.\n\nTurkey also enjoys a close strategic relationship with Iran (though they have their differences over Syria). The two states have a strong shared interest in seeing an end to American forces occupying parts of Syria, and putting a stop to the Israeli-sponsored Kurdish \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproject\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the region.\u00c2 And again the Muslim Brotherhood enters into this equation \u2014 the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flirtation with Saudi Arabia is finished, and parts of the movement (it is still fractured from the Gulf-led war against it) are returning to old comrades: Hizbullah and Iran (the Muslim Brotherhood never parted from Turkey).\u00c2 In short, the Muslim Brotherhood seem destined to become Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Arab foot-soldiers in the battle to take the mantle of Islamic leadership away from Saudi Arabia.\n\nBeyond the convergence of political interest however, there is oil and gas too.\u00c2 Russia is the mastermind here, with Turkey acting as the putative pivot.\u00c2 Moscow is quietly stitching together a new energy axis: Qatar had already injected needed cash into Russian oil giant, Rosneft, giving it a substantial stake in the latter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as providing Rosneft with the means to buy into Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge Zohr gas field. And Qatar is co-operating closely with Iran on exploiting their shared North Dome/South Pars gas field (the largest in the world) in the Persian Gulf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with Qatar recently, substantially expanding its LNG facilities.\u00c2 Iraq too has just agreed to co-ordinate oil and gas operations with Russia.\n\nIt is not hard to see what is afoot here: This week Russia completed the link to the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpivot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Turkey) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the undersea gas pipeline TurkStream, linking Russia with Turkey.\u00c2 As Pepe Escobar notes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TurkStream is projected as two lines, each capable of delivering 15.75 billion cubic meters of gas a year.\u00c2 The first will supply the Turkish market. The second will run 180 km to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s western borderlands and supply south and southeast Europe, with first deliveries expected by the end of next year. Potential customers include Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Serbia and Hungary\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2\n\nAnd phase Two? Well, soon the old plan of a regional pipeline from the Persian Gulf through Iran and Syria, to Europe (possibly via Turkey), may become again politically viable (i.e. in the interests of all parties in the new regional re-alignment.)\u00c2 What does this signify?\u00c2 It suggests that the Qatar-Turkey-Iran-Russia axis may dominate in Middle East energy production, pushing Saudi and the UAE into the place of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecond fiddle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 And let us not ignore Iraq. Apart from its energy co-operation accord with Russia, Iraq has also just signed a free trade agreement with Iran \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite threats from American officials.\u00c2 (The efforts to keep Iraq within the US sphere of interest do not seem to be working well.)\n\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconce-in-a-lifetime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 opportunity given to Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcto bury the House of Saud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Islamic Credibility, and to resurrect Istanbul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ancient claim to leadership of the Islamic world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, naturally has stirred alarm and a deep sense of vulnerability in the Gulf.\n\nMbZ is leading a push by the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain to re-establish the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcArab prerogative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Syria \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in order to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjoin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with President Assad in pushing back non-Arab (i.e. Turkic and Iranian) influence across the Levant.\u00c2 (No doubt, part of this MbZ initiative is to distance, and to differentiate himself, from the now tainted MbS).\n\nAnd the atmospherics across the Sunni Levant are today extremely hostile towards MbS, we hear from recent visitors to the region. It is putting into question the Custodianship of the two Holy Sanctuaries (Mecca and Medina):\u00c2 The Khashoggi barbarism has forced attention onto the issues of personal safety, as well to that of the financial exploitation of pilgrims at Mecca.\u00c2 Ordinary pious Muslims are questioning whether it is worth undertaking pilgrimage \u2014 there is a movement advocating for boycott.\u00c2 This aspect of popular outrage should not be underestimated: the Sanctuaries are a significant component of identity (together with Jerusalem).\n\nMbZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative to try to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Levant from non-Arab influence may have the side-effect of returning Damascus to the Arab \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (which is to say, its seat at the Arab League), and will be welcomed in Damascus on that account alone.\u00c2 Moreover, the initiative represents more broadly a political recognition of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic realities by the Gulf.\u00c2 That too can only help in bringing about a broader internal reconciliation domestically, and the full marginalization of the jihadists in Syria.\n\nBut to look for more than that would be wishful thinking on the part of MbZ and his western advocates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we suggest.\u00c2 Syrians generally are not so open to the claims of pan-Arabism as they were in the past.\u00c2 They were, after all, betrayed by this Arab ideal, multiple times. The claim of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreater Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 has dimmed, and a current of steely, Syrian, Arab nationalism is more evident.\u00c2 It will be a tougher, more assertive Syria that emerges from this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Damascus may be open to Gulf rapprochement, but it will not suffer any lectures on the ideals pan-Arab nationalism from those who waged war against this ancient Arab nation, nor against those who supported Syria through its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdark nights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nThose who are in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquagmire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 now are not Russia (as Obama confidently forecast), nor Syria, nor its allies. The wheel has turned.\u00c2 It is now the Gulf States, fearful for their own futures, should the family al-Saud implode, who are in a quagmire of crumbling credibility, and legitimacy \u2014 and Israel, too, is in its own separate quagmire, albeit for different reasons.\u00c2 Israel deliberately opted for a path that pitted it aggressively up, and against, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Turkey (via Kurdish proxies), and Hizbullah.\u00c2 Netanyahu presumably hoped to capitalize on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of nous concerning the region, and on manipulating MbS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overt ambition. Israel escalated this overt hostility (through hundreds of air incursions over Syria), to the point of clashing, and endangering the Russian military interest \u2013 by insisting Israel must freely, and regularly, bomb Syria.\n\nWell, the Russian military command have \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchad it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u2014 enough of Israeli air incursions. They want stability in Syria. Netanyahu bet on leading Trump, Kushner and MbS \u2014 a slender, unrepresentative, stratum \u2014 into a remake of the region \u2013 and lost: Netanyahu lost Israel its freedom of the skies over the northern tier of the Middle East. Putin now declines a meeting with Netanyahu.\u00c2 Bibi has painted Israel into a corner where it now has to decide whether to risk \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgoing for broke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 against much of the region and its Palestinian \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubjects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; or, as Gulf leaders presently are doing in Damascus, acknowledge uncomfortable realities, and try to make do.\n\nThe other question is why does Erdogan pursue the drip, drip of Khashoggi evidence, when Trump and the European establishment would dearly like him to stop? Why does he not take what is on offer and shut up?\u00c2 Answer: because he too, was fearing being trapped in Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own particular quagmire.\u00c2 Khashoggi was the chance to turn the tables \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Erdogan is taking it.\n\nYes, Turkish rhetoric has been somewhat florid, but behind it lies substantive Turkish concerns: Erdogan can see that Turkey is being deliberately pressured at its maritime and land based borders, and has been subject to Lire and financial sanctions attrition internally (now halted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks to Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s careful leaking of the Khashoggi evidence).\u00c2 On the maritime border, Erdogan can see plainly that Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EastMed gas pipeline, via Cyprus to Europe, when completed, will likely leave Turkish North Cyprus bereft of pipeline revenues.\u00c2 He sees also the probing by western oil majors (pursuing EU/US interests), steaming into (disputed) waters claimed by Turkey and the Turkish-administered North Cyprus.\n\nThen there are the Kurds, supported by Israel and European states, avidly trying to establish a Kurdish \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbelt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the length of Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern border. And to the east, the new, pro-western colour revolutionary government of Nikol Pashinyan in Armenia. Pressure all around. All these exacerbated tensions, as well as the earlier financial attrition, spelled out a US containment policy \u2013 and even an eventual further coup being plotted against Turkey \u2013 in the Turkish assessment.\n\nNo wonder the euphoria in Istanbul. Erdogan is skilfully \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and strategically \u2013 using Khashoggi \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleaks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dribbled out in the media.\u00c2 He is using them to exit from the threat of the Gulf-led project to plunge rival Turkey into a quagmire of encirclement, whilst watching at the same time, those who facilitated the attempted coup against him last year squirm (the Turkish press identified MbZ and MbS in particular as facilitators) \u2013 as the vice of crumbling credibility tightens on them, inverting the paradigm.",

Erdogan's strategic use of Khashoggi's murder has pressured Saudi Arabia, leading to the end of the Saudi-led siege on Qatar and strengthening Turkey's position in the region.

        "text": "The Iranian Albatross the US Has Hung Around Its Own Neck\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation, 19 Nov 2018\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr. Trump, nor anyone else in his administration, has announced any conclusions about how Mr. Khashoggi died, or who bears responsibility for ordering the killing\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, a Washington Post editorial fulminates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Instead, they have pretended to be waiting for the results of a Saudi investigation \u2026 the obvious problem with that stance is it assumes that Mohammed bin Salman himself is not at the bottom of\u00c2 the Khashoggi plot\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d though abundant evidence points to the crown prince.\u00c2 In truth, as the administration surely knows, there is no Saudi investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d only a cover-up operation that has clumsily tried to disguise itself as an inquiry\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nOne aspect to this affair is the US domestic issue. The White House is increasingly perceived \u2013 as the Washington Post implies \u2013 as engaged in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cover-up of a cover-up.\u00c2 That is to say, the White House is being viewed as so set on keeping MbS in position as lynchpin to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire Middle Eastern strategy that the White House and Mr Bolton will try to turn a Nelsonian \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblind eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u2013 or a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcselective ear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u2013 to any audio evidence provided by the Turkish government that seems to implicate MbS.\n\nPresident Trump is keeping his powder dry. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a much stronger opinion on that subject over the next week \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m forming a very strong opinion.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2 But caution on his part might be wise: leading Turkish daily, Yeni Safak, which is close to the Turkish government, and which has been covering leaked details of the Khashoggi investigation day by day, has reported that Maher Mutrib, the Saudi intelligence official who led the 15-man assassination team in Ankara, spoke to Badr al-Asaker, the head of the Crown Prince\u2019s private office, four times directly after Khashoggi was killed (if it was Mutrib who said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tell your boss\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to MbS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chef de cabinet, then the implication is clear).\u00c2 This has not been officially confirmed, but it is possible (and likely) that Turkish intelligence has yet further details to trickle out, piecemeal, to discredit the Saudi \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 each time the kingdom tries to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdraw the line\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 under the case.\u00c2 Erdogan is determined to get MbS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scalp, it seems.\n\nIn any case, the nature and cost-benefit of the Saudi-US relationship clearly is an issue set to run-on in Washington: Adam Schiff (Chair of the House Intelligence Committee) has already identified it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe who, where, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the Khashoggi affair \u2013 as a prime topic for Democratic Party scrutiny, when the new House assembles.\n\nHowever, the bigger issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that Trump may not yet be ready to admit \u2013 is that his Mid-East strategy is in deep trouble, even if MbS does manage to survive as heir-apparent, as seems likely, given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong attachment.\u00c2 The complication does not derive from the gruesome Khashoggi murder alone \u2014 it is now much wider than that.\u00c2 The significance of the Khashoggi affair, as it were, is that it has slid open a Pandora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s box of ugly goings-on. What is emerging from the Gulf is that the Khashoggi assassination is neither isolated, nor out of the ordinary in the Gulf today:\u00c2 Buzzfeed News reported that UAE leaders had set up, and tasked, a foreign military mercenary unit for the explicit task of serial assassinations of Muslim Brotherhood leaders (Al-Islah), in Yemen (whilst Saudi Arabia was at the same time, quietly facilitating al-Qa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122eda forces in Yemen, fighting against Houthi insurgents).\u00c2 More recently, the NY Times has disclosed an attempt by a senior Saudi official to close a $2 billion contract with US interests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again for serial assassinations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this time, of Iranian leaders.\u00c2 It is, to put it bluntly, more redolent of the Saddam Hussein era, to read these reports; and those of Princes \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisappeared\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Switzerland and Paris; of a Prime Minister hijacked; and of dissenters and senior princes incarcerated at whim.\n\nOf course, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrealists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will argue \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcso what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 And we see this line coming from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwestern officials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in their briefing, for example, to the Financial Times: a weary sigh of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthere is no alternative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 percolates through. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Western officials doubt that the 33-year-old prince is in danger of being ousted as he has consolidated so much power, including bringing all armed forces and security services under his control \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There is no obvious candidate to replace Prince Mohammed, who has won support among youth and the liberal elite for his social reforms during his meteoric rise\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, they conclude.\u00c2 Really? No one? No one else to perform any of this roles?\u00c2 \u00c2\n\nWell then, there is indeed a problem here for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grand strategy: In fact, there is a three-fold problem: One, is psychology. Does MbS or Saudi Arabia now embody anything authoritative, anything compelling, in terms of leadership or vision?\u00c2 Does the Kingdom have the charisma now to gather under its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbanner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Sunni world, and to lead Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Iran?\u00c2 (Most people in the region have been sickened by events in Yemen, even before the Khashoggi murder).\n\nSecondly, have not all these reports underscored Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political risk in staking so much on the veritable pinhead of a one-man platform? What else lurks unknown and unseen, beneath the surface?\u00c2 (By-the-by, Prime Minister Netanyahu has based his platform too, on a similarly, precariously narrow foundation.)\n\nAnd lastly, what \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the light of all that is emerging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now stands as the core \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advanced by the Gulf: What does \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe Gulf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stand for after the eclipse of Monarchial, de haut en bas, handouts of benevolence to grateful \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubjects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?\u00c2 Is it a vision of quasi-secular autocracy, the ubiquitous security-state, and raw neo-liberalism?\u00c2 Admittedly, the might prove a hit with Israel, but in terms of the energetic national, cultural re-sovereigntisation taking place in the northern tier of the region, this leaden notion is no competitor.\u00c2 And the embrace of the security-state structure \u00c2 \u2013 in, and of itself \u2013 speaks not of self-confidence, but of rising internal dissent and existential pressures that must be contained and suppressed.\u00c2 \u00c2\n\nAnd it is this latter point (increased internal repression) on which Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, inadvertently, has shed unexpected illumination. It is an insight which suggests that the future axis of conflict in the region will not be as Trump and PM Netanyahu had hoped.\u00c2 It will be focused not on Iran, but will rotate towards a further round of conflict with the Muslim Brotherhood and its patrons \u2013 Turkey and Qatar.\u00c2 Some Gulf states are more frightened of Islamist Muslim Brotherhood dissidence within their emirates than they are frightened of Iran, which has no history of external state expansion.\u00c2 These anxieties are driving \u2013 and represent \u2013 the new regional re-alignment.\n\nAnd these Gulf states, the UAE and Saudi, are fearful that Turkey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the old Ottoman imperial political power, and seat of the Islamic Umma \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might just succeed in usurping Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Islamic credentials \u2013 as diminishing Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as being no more than an inept Custodian of Mecca and Medina (the Turkish press is full of such claims). This would strip the Gulf of much of its significance and value to Washington.\u00c2\n\nAnd whilst the Gulf has made its turn toward a quasi-secularism to please the West, Turkey has been quietly vacuuming up what there is of the Gulf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discarded Islamic credibility in the form of a MB-style, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Islamism \u2013 and a very explicit neo-Ottoman revanchism, fueled by Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sense of being victim to a conspiracy led by Mohamed bin Zayed, the US and Israel.\n\nThus, the axis of the coming conflict is more likely to be that between a fearful Gulf, and an increasingly assertive Turkey, bidding for the leadership of the Islamic sphere.\u00c2 As for Iran, it can contemplate these events with sanguinity: Saudi being pressed to end its campaign against Yemen \u2013 and end its siege of Qatar.\u00c2 And, additionally, this new regional dynamic will only serve to push Turkey and Qatar closer to Iran.\n\nNone of this can be countered as promising for Mr Trump. Turkey will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on embracing the Palestinian cause (with Iran and Qatar in the rear), and MbS will lack the credibility or standing to lead any new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 against Iran after the disaster of Yemen, nor be able to coerce the Palestinians into capitulation in the face of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeal of the century\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Even his near incapacitated father, as well as the al-Saud family, understand Netanyahu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy to bury the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcidea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of a Palestinian state \u2013 and in any event, Bibi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy is likely to be overtaken by internal politics, as Israel struggles with the implications of Lieberman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation.\n\nAll this raises the question of why the Trump Administration continues to view an MbS-led Kingdom as somehow still a fount of strategic stability (\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is it just that old habits die hard)?\u00c2 Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of not just exiting JCPOA, but of going that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 further in seeking to overthrow the Islamic Republic as well, through sanctions will \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we suggest \u2013 eventually become seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe Albatross\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which Trump injudiciously \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and without compelling need \u2013 hung about his own neck.\u00c2 It will not work, and America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s credibility in the Middle East will be gone when that failure becomes apparent.",

The article argues that the Khashoggi affair has exposed a series of troubling actions by Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, such as mercenary-led assassinations and internal repression, which undermine their credibility and leadership in the region. It suggests that the real axis of future conflict will not be against Iran, as Trump and Netanyahu hope, but rather between the Gulf states and an assertive Turkey, which is vying for leadership in the Islamic world.

        "text": "After Midterms, Will Trump Go On Risking World Trade and the Off-Shore Dollar Sphere?\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation, 12 Nov 2018\n\nThe midterms are done.\u00c2 A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblue wave\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 did not materialise, but rather, the close result is claimed by both major parties as somehow a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvictory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 The real outcome is that there was no one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisive victory (though Trump fared better than many had expected).\u00c2 Rather, we will see more popular polarisation and a vengeful Congressional insurgency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which means greater difficulty in conducting the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business, and a heightened atmosphere of crisis and siege within the White House.\u00c2 The promise of more tax cuts now seems a chimaera, but so too is any further big uplifts for military spending (goodbye to a new intermediate missile boondoggle?).\u00c2 Managing the US fiscal deficit financing becomes no easier, and interest rate increases (now more likely) will crowd out Federal discretionary expenditure \u2013 as the interest payment on debt at 106% of US GDP\u00c2 inexorably rises\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or, if ignored, create the conditions for a severe funding crisis.\n\nThere is an old \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrule of thumb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that when leaders are stymied in their programme at home, they embark on foreign initiatives, which though may seem easier, at first sight, than dealing with their own fractious legislatures, often prove to be painfully \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcotherwise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Will Trump then, reorient his foreign policy in wake of the elections?\n\nHe is known to have been initially frustrated by the Pentagon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTimes Square\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doctrine.\u00c2 This refers to an answer reportedly proffered by General Mattis when Trump asked (at a Situation Room briefing) simply, why the US had so many troops in Afghanistan (after\u00c2 16 years of failure), why so many in Korea, and why was the US still in Syria?\u00c2 \u201cYou guys want me to send troops everywhere,\u201d Trump\u00c2 reportedly said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u2019s the justification?\u201d.\u00c2 \u00c2 Mattis merely told Trump that the US presence in those places was needed \u201cto prevent a bomb from going off in Times Square\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00c2 Unfortunately, sir, you have no choice,\u201d\u00c2 Mattis added; \u201cYou will be a wartime president\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nAlready Trump has moved to sort out one long-standing frustration: He has sought the resignation of Jeff Sessions. It seems that he intends to put a finish to the so-called\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRussiagate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meme.\u00c2 Whilst Trump doubled-down during the campaign on his rhetoric against China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic malfeasance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Xi reciprocated, warning against US hubris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might we see some shift occurring toward Russia and in the Middle East too?\u00c2 Does Sessions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exit make some new space for d\u00c3\u00a9tente with Russia in the wake of the midterms?\n\nDmitri Trenin, writing from Moscow, says:\n\nWith a short, high-profile meeting between [Putin and Trump] possibly happening this weekend in Paris and a more comprehensive session later this month in Buenos Aires, many in Russia are asking the question, why meet at all? After all, each of their previous meetings \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in Hamburg in 2017 and then in Helsinki last July \u00e2\u20ac\u201d seemed to leave Russian-American relations in even worse shape than before. Some are advising the Kremlin to stay clear of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House, and not be drawn into America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fractious and ruthless domestic politics. The operative theory behind that counsel appears to be: Let America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cold civil war blow over before re-engaging with the winner of 2020. Yet, Putin is determined to continue his face-to-face contacts with Trump. Why such seemingly illogical behavior?\n\nTrenin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2 comment\u00c2 is right. Russians are understandably angry and frustrated at what they perceive as an almost daily litany of fantastical allegations of every imaginable type of Russian \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmalignity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 made against them.\u00c2 Patience is exhausted: Why even bother to respond?\u00c2 But, more substantively, the Russian public knows that Trump has his hands tied on sanctions. Sanctions remain the almost exclusive preserve of the now-Democrat \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHouse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and that furthermore, Trump has been \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least until now \u2013 boxed in by the Pentagon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTimes Square\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 axiom and by a coterie of neo-con advisers obsessed by an historic antipathy towards all things Russian.\n\nTrenin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to this paradox is interesting:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Russian leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment in the U.S. president has little to do with Congress, or with the U.S.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia policy, or whether or not the Republican Party gets a drubbing in the midterms. To Putin, Trump represents a new departure in U.S. foreign policy. What Putin considers positive for Russia is the disruption that Trump is creating for the global system that the United States has underwritten since the end of the Cold War.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn other words, that which Putin appreciates is that Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by design \u2013 is set on dismantling the full panoply of American \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcempire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and with it, crucially, the notion of a de-cultured, cosmopolitan, utopian, hegemony.\n\nThe latter represents the antithesis to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own cultural re-sovereigntisation and Eurasian path, and is therefore, a main obstacle to the Russo-Chinese desired shift toward a multi-polar world. Trenin adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump, for all his idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies, [therefore] is the most avowedly Russia-friendly American leader Putin is likely to encounter\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2 But more important than Trenin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last point perhaps is Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2 way\u00c2 of achieving MAGA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is essentially through individual,\u00c2 transactional,\u00c2 power-plays:\u00c2 That is to say, Trump is no longer a purveyor of a global ideology, (as in the Cold War), and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnational interests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are always muteable.\n\nSo far \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so clear: And of course, the Russian leadership cannot have failed to notice that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twitter \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmissiles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 are also opening up Europe, in a new \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as yet undefined \u2013 way.\u00c2 So, there we are: Trump and Putin are transactional \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 But what that does\u00c2 not\u00c2 imply is that there is something or anything transactional to be transacted.\n\nTrump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign policies do not sit at all comfortably with Russian interests: Trump wants to re-establish a US unilateral, power-primacy; he wants to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhack-a-mole\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 China (a Russian ally); his team wants to trip-up the Belt and Road Initiative, and to set up a rival; Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team wants North Korea to be intrusively invaded, inspected, and its nuclear project, crated and DHL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d, to the US; he wants the Iranian state (a Russian ally) to be overthrown; his advisors seek instability in Syria (whilst Russia seeks stability); his team want Assad removed, and the Kurds to become a western \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcproject\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 weakening Turkey and Syria; and he wants to use Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s erstwhile influence with other Gulf and Sunni states to lead a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 against Iran, and to strong-arm the Palestinians to commit to being second class citizens in an overbearing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jewish nation-state\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2 Where are the transactional possibilities in this list?\n\nNo? So let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to Trenin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original question: why engage?\u00c2 President Putin certainly knows the score.\u00c2 He may see too that America through \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsanctioning the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and weaponising the dollar, as a neutron bomb of sanction possibilities\u00c2 is, as it were, deliberately risking the burning-down of world trade.\n\nAt risk too, again consciously, is the possibility of a global renunciation of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge, off-shore, dollar sphere (whose existence has served to finance America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget deficits, over the last seventy years). All this is being staked in the bid to restitute America as the one player at the table, holding the aces.\n\nThe bet is that tough \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmafia-style\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 talk will cause fear.\u00c2 And, this fear will lead to the flight of dollars held overseas, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcback home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to Wall Street, thus weakening, or breaking, firstly emerging markets \u2013 with the contagion spreading to Europe (as the effects of dollar liquidity voids), moving from the periphery towards the centre.\u00c2 The point of course, is that America \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which commands the worlds currency, and can supply (or, elect not to supply) dollar liquidity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will then hold all the aces in the negotiations for re-framing the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour.\n\nThere is an old Chinese story dating back to around 200 BC about a boy who is sent out by his master to catch a hare (for lunch).\u00c2 Well, the boy goes to the woods, and almost as soon as he arrives there, he sees a huge hare running through the woods, at full-pelt.\u00c2 Astonished, the boy watches as the hare slams straight into the tree, knocking itself out.\u00c2 All the boy has to do is pick up the hare, and carry it home triumphantly, to the pot.\n\nThe original Chinese moral to the story is this: the boy, then grown to a man, spent the last 50 years standing beside the same tree, waiting for more hares to collide into it (of course, none did: moral \u2013 don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect history to repeat itself).\u00c2 Well, in a sense, the US had a similar experience.\u00c2 In the wake of WW2, the rest of the world had indeed run at a tree, and knocked itself economically senseless.\u00c2 All the US had to do, was to pick up its lunch, lying there prone on the ground.\u00c2 Now, 70 years later, a US President is standing by the same tree, hoping the world will again run into a tree, and knock itself senseless, butting its head against sanctions and dollar liquidity shortages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only to leave it prone for the US to pick it up, and carry it home for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclunch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nThis is just an allegory; it is not to be taken literally. \u00c2 But the point is clear. Presidents Xi and Putin \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcget it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 And if the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworld\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 manages to swerve away from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tree, then it likely will be America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal situation that will burn.\n\nAnd now, in the wake of the Khashoggi murder, we have a\u00c2 new Middle Eastern \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcscheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00c2 afoot.\u00c2 According to reports, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are on the cusp of normalizing with President Assad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Syria, (re-opening diplomatic missions in Damascus).\u00c2 Of course, this is good news for Syria. No doubt of that. But there is a twist to the story.\u00c2 The plan reportedly is to form an anti-Muslim Brotherhood \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfront\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, consisting of a secular Syria, together with the Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\u00c2 Nominally, this is a front targeted at the Muslim Brotherhood, but in practice, it is clearly aimed at Turkey \u2013 and its ally, Qatar.\u00c2 The Turks have been warning about such a plot being hatched for some time, and have vowed to defeat it. Neither will Turkey allow Saudi Arabia, nor the US, to use the Kurds in eastern Syria, as a wedge to be driven into the soft underbelly of Turkey.\u00c2 Erdogan seems \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon a roll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122:\u00c2 He is bidding to take the leadership of the Sunni world away from Saudi Arabia (and Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder gave him just the peg that he needed to set that ball rolling).\n\nThe justification for this new alliance (should it come to fruition) is the usual bromide: The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcalliance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will contain and weaken Iran.\u00c2 There are obvious flaws here: Why should such a front with Syria suddenly weaken Iran?\u00c2 Syria has had since 1979 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and still has \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very close relations with Iran.\u00c2 Syria has had four rounds of its own bitter war with the Muslim Brotherhood since the 1920s, yet both Syria and Iran have common cause with the Palestinians (a major segment of whose population are sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood).\u00c2 Syria will not turn against Iran (Gulf states have tried before \u2013 to bribe President Assad to sever links with Iran, without success); neither will Syria turn its back on the Palestinians; and though Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with President Erdogan are fraught, and veering on the confrontational, President Assad of course, recognizes that major players, and close allies such as Russia and China, have vital stakes in any Turkish \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to which Syria must pay close attention.\n\nMoscow may welcome the tactical advantages to such a front, whilst at the same time, recognizing its improbable viability.\u00c2 There is however, a deeper meaning to be drawn from this new Gulf initiative.\u00c2 Long story short: Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 historically was always only marginally \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpolitical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Saudi derived influence more from its possession of the holy sites, and its assertion of the right to interpret the Qur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122an according to its own lights.\n\nBut the Gulf States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 facilitation of Wahabbist jihadis in the attempt overthrow the Iraqi and Syrian states, by the most barbaric means, forced those Gulf States to distance themselves from ISIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bloodshed.\u00c2 But MbS was tied from openly condemning ISIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Wahabbism, without linking what was happening in Syria and Mosul, to the Wahabbist principles, by which the Saudi State itself, was founded.\u00c2 And such criticism would have been wholly unacceptable to the Saudi religious establishment.\n\nThe Gulf \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 therefore was never to condemn directly, but rather, to urge on everyone an undefined \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoderation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 Saudi Arabia under this meme of espousing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoderation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, became, in some ways quite secular, yet without embracing secular political notions; or indeed without outlining any new model for the kingdom.\u00c2 Rather than go fully secular, young princes embraced a western business school type neo-liberalism, plus hyper-centralisation of power, underpinned an ubiquitous, intolerant apparatus of repression \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Singapore\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctotalitarian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 model, as it were.\u00c2 For example, in Bahrain it is now ok to fraternise with Israelis, but to say anything positive about Qatar will lead one to a 10-year prison sentence.\n\nSome Gulf States are aware of the dangers\u00c2 inherent\u00c2 in their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcturn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 towards repression.\u00c2 If Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing has done nothing else, it has shone an uncomfortable light on political repression in the Gulf.\u00c2 The princes have no other model (as their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoderation narrative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gave rise to fresh ideas on governance) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hence the proposed new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFront\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 A \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the Muslim Brotherhood is popular in Washington (an useful diversion for the Gulf from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwinnable war against Iran).\u00c2 An anti-Muslim Brotherhood front can justify the repressive apparatus at home, and also provide a platform for turning the West against Turkey (as patron of the Muslim Brotherhood, together with Qatar).\n\nThe deeper meaning then is Gulf anxiety and fear. The Muslim Brotherhood has been made weak and fragmented by the campaign of attrition launched against it \u2014 it has been largely incapacitated, yet the Gulf wants a new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Plainly the ghosts of the 2011 Arab Awakening which threatened tribal autocracy still haunts the kings and emirs. They are afraid.\n\nBottom line: President Putin may wonder whether the midterms will bring any foreign policy change. Plainly not in respect to China, but with the neo-cons so dug into Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Administration at many levels, really the only question is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhat does Mr Bolton want from Russia, now?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nAt the back of minds in Moscow perhaps is the thought that the US may end this phase by finding it is not the global power-hegemon it had hoped to be, but rather has burnt fingers from its dollar supremacy bet \u2013 and with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious hopes for the Middle East vanished into the ether (as many have afore now).\u00c2 Why should Mr Putin then not patiently keep channels open with Mr Trump, however unpopular that might be in Russia \u2013 expecting nothing beyond yet more US sanctions and more calumny. Mr Putin might patiently await the Fourth Turning when politics can be upended.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "After the midterms, Trump's foreign policy may shift towards transactional engagements with Russia and the Middle East, despite ongoing tensions and challenges in global trade and the off-shore dollar sphere, as he seeks to re-establish U.S. power primacy amidst domestic and international pressures.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The article by Alastair Crooke discusses the potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy following the 2018 midterm elections, focusing on President Trump's approach to international relations and its implications for global trade and geopolitics. Despite the lack of a decisive victory for either party in the midterms, the outcome is expected to exacerbate domestic polarization and complicate governance. Trump, frustrated by domestic constraints, may seek foreign policy initiatives, although his strategies often conflict with Russian interests. The article highlights Trump's transactional approach, which disrupts the global order and challenges the U.S.-led hegemony, aligning with Russian interests in a multi-polar world. However, Trump's policies, including aggressive stances towards China, Iran, and North Korea, do not align with Russian goals, complicating potential U.S.-Russia cooperation. The article also touches on Middle Eastern dynamics, particularly the emerging anti-Muslim Brotherhood front involving Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which could impact regional stability and U.S. influence. Ultimately, the piece suggests that while Trump may continue to risk global trade and the offshore dollar sphere, Russia's strategy might be to maintain open channels with the U.S., anticipating future shifts in global power dynamics.",

        "text": "The Unraveling of the Netanyahu Project for the Middle East\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation / Zerohedge, 5 Nov 2018\n\nNahum Barnea, a leading Israeli commentator, writing in\u00c2 Yedioth Ahronoth\u00c2 in May (in Hebrew), set out, unambiguously, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 behind Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Middle East policy: In the wake of the US exit from JCPOA [which occurred on 8 May], Trump, Barnea wrote, will threaten a rain of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfire and fury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 onto Tehran \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 whilst Putin is expected to restrain Iran from attacking Israel using Syrian territory, thus leaving Netanyahu free to set new \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrules of the game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by which the Israel may attack and destroy Iranian forces anywhere in Syria (and not just in the border area, as earlier agreed) when it wishes, without fear of retaliation.\n\nThis represented\u00c2 one level\u00c2 to the Netanyahu strategy: Iranian restraint, plus Russian acquiescence to coordinated Israeli air operations over Syria.\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is only one thing that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear [concerning this deal]\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\u00c2 a senior Israeli Defence official\u00c2 closest to Netanyahu,\u00c2 told Ben Caspit,\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that is, who works for whom? Does Netanyahu work for Trump, or is President Trump at the service of Netanyahu \u2026 From the outside \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it looks like the two men are perfectly in sync. From the inside, this seems\u00c2 even more so:\u00c2 This kind of cooperation \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 sometimes makes it seem\u00c2 as if they are actually just one single, large office\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nThere has been, from the outset, a\u00c2 second level,\u00c2 too: This entire \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinverted pyramid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Middle East engineering had, as its single point of departure, Mohammed bin Salman (MbS). It was Jared Kushner, the\u00c2 Washington Post\u00c2 reports, who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153championed Mohammed as a reformer poised to usher the ultraconservative, oil-rich monarchy into modernity. Kushner privately argued for months, last year, that Mohammed would be key to crafting a Middle East peace plan, and that with the prince\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing, much of the Arab world would follow\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. It was Kushner, the\u00c2 Post\u00c2 continued, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who pushed his father-in-law to make his first foreign trip as president to Riyadh, against objections from then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u2013 and warnings from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nWell, now MbS has, in one form or another, been implicated in the Khashoggi murder.\u00c2 Bruce Riedel of\u00c2 Brookings, a longtime Saudi observer and\u00c2 former senior CIA & US defence official,\u00c2 notes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for the first time in 50 years, the kingdom has become a force for instability\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (rather than stability in the region), and suggests that there is an element\u00c2 of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbuyer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remorse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 now evident in parts of Washington.\n\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcseamless office process\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to which the Israeli official referred with Caspit, is known as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstovepiping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which is when a foreign state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy advocacy and intelligence are passed straight to a President\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c omitting official Washington from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcloop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; by-passing any US oversight; and removing the opportunity for officials to advise on its content.\u00c2 Well, this has now resulted in the Khashoggi strategic blunder.\u00c2 And this, of course, comes in the wake of earlier strategic \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmistakes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: the Yemen war, the siege of Qatar, the Hariri abduction, the Ritz-Carlton princely shakedowns.\n\nTo remedy this lacuna, an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcuncle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (Prince Ahmad bin Abdel Aziz)\u00c2 has been dispatched\u00c2 from exile in the West to Riyadh (with security guarantees from the US and UK intelligences services) to bring order into these unruly affairs, and to institute some checks and balances into the MbS coterie of advisers, so as to prevent further impetuous \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmistakes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 It seems too, that the US Congress wants the Yemen war, which Prince Ahmad consistently has opposed (as he opposed MbS elevation as Crown Prince), stopped.(General Mattis has called for a ceasefire within 30 days.) It is a step toward repairing the Kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image.\n\nMbS remains -\u00c2 for now\u00c2 \u2013 as Crown Prince. President Sisi and Prime Minister Netanyahu both have expressed\u00c2 their support for MbS\u00c2 and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as U.S. officials contemplate a more robust response [to the Khashoggi killing], Kushner has emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Saudi alliance in the region\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the\u00c2 Washington Post\u00c2 reports.\u00c2 MbS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Uncle (who as a son of King Abdel Aziz, under the traditional succession system, would be himself in line for the throne), no doubt hopes to try to undo some of the damage done to the standing of the al-Saud family, and to that of the Kingdom.\u00c2 Will he succeed?\u00c2 Will MbS accede now to Ahmad unscrambling the very centralisation of power that made MbS so many enemies, in the first place, to achieve it?\u00c2 Has the al-Saud family\u00c2 the will, or are they too disconcerted by events?\n\nAnd might President Erdogan throw more wrenches into this delicate process by further leaking evidence Turkey has, if Washington does not attend sufficiently to\u00c2 his\u00c2 demands.\u00c2 Erdogan seems ready to pitch for the return of Ottoman leadership for the Sunni world, and likely still holds some high-value cards up his sleeve (such as intercepts of phone calls between the murder cell and Riyadh).\u00c2 These cards though are devaluing as the news cycle shifts to the US mid-terms.\n\nTime will tell, but it is this nexus of uncertain dynamics to which Bruce Reidel refers, when he talks of\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinstability\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Saudi Arabia.\u00c2 The question posed here, though, is how might these events affect Netanyahu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and MbS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Iran?\n\nMay 2018 now seems a distant era.\u00c2 Trump is still the same \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but Putin is not the same Putin. The Russian Defence Establishment has weighed in with their President to express their displeasure at Israeli air strikes on Syria \u2013 purportedly targeting Iranian forces in Syria.\u00c2 The Russian Defence Ministry too, has enveloped Syria in a belt of missiles and electronic disabling systems across the Syrian airspace. Politically, the situation has changed too: Germany and France have\u00c2 joined the Astana Process\u00c2 for Syria. Europe wants Syrian refugees to return home, and that translates into Europe demanding\u00c2 stability\u00c2 in Syria. Some Gulf States too, have tentatively begun normalising with the Syrian state.\n\nThe Americans are still in Syria; but a newly invigorated Erdogan (after the release of the US pastor, and with all the Khashoggi cards, produced by Turkish intelligence, in his pocket), intends to crush the Kurdish project in north and eastern Syria, espoused by Israel and the US.\u00c2 MbS, who was funding this project, on behalf of US and Israel, will cease his involvement (as a part of the\u00c2 demands made by Erdogan\u00c2 over the Khashoggi murder). Washington too wants the Yemen war, which was intended to serve as Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcquagmire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to end forthwith.\u00c2 And Washington wants the attrition of Qatar to stop, too.\n\nThese represent major unravelings of the Netanyahu project for the Middle East, but most significant are two further setbacks: namely, the loss of Netanyahu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and MbS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stovepipe to Trump, via Jared Kushner, by-passing all\u00c2 America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2 own system of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchecks and balances\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 The Kushner \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstovepipe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 neither forewarned Washington of coming \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmistakes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, nor was Kushner able to prevent them. Both Congress and the Intelligences Services of the US and UK are\u00c2 already\u00c2 elbowing into these affairs.\u00c2 They are not MbS fans.\u00c2 It is no secret that Prince Mohamed bin Naif was their man (he is still under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpalace arrest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122).\n\nTrump will still hope to continue his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIran project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and his Deal of the Century between Israel and the Palestinians (led nominally by Saudi Arabia\u00c2 herding together the Sunni world, behind it).\u00c2 Trump does not seek war with Iran, but rather is convinced of a popular uprising in Iran that will topple the state.\n\nAnd the second setback is that Prince Ahmad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear objective must be other than this \u2013 instability in, or\u00c2 conflict\u00c2 with, Iran.\u00c2 His is to restore the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing, and to recoup something of its leadership credentials in the Sunni world, which has been shredded by the war in Yemen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is now under direct neo-Ottoman challenge from Turkey.\u00c2 The al-Saud family, one may surmise, will have no appetite to replace one disastrous and\u00c2 costly\u00c2 war (Yemen), with another \u2013\u00c2 an even greater\u00c2 conflict, with its large and powerful neighbor, Iran.\u00c2 It makes no sense now.\u00c2 Perhaps this is why we see signs of Israel rushing to hurry Arab state\u00c2 normalisation\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even absent any amelioration for the Palestinians.\n\nNehum Barnea presciently noted in his May article in\u00c2 Yediot Ahoronot: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump could have declared a US withdrawal [from the JCPOA],\u00c2 and made do with that. But under the influence of Netanyahu and of his new team,\u00c2 he chose to go one step further. The economic sanctions on Iran will be much tighter, beyond what they were, before the nuclear agreement was signed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hit them in their pockets\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, Netanyahu advised Trump: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you hit them in their pockets, they will choke; and when they choke, they will throw out the ayatollahs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nThis was another bit of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstovepiped\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advice passed directly to the US President.\u00c2 His officials might have warned him that it was fantasy.\u00c2 There is no example of sanctions alone having toppled a state; and whilst the US can use its claim of judicial hegemony as an enforcement mechanism, the US has effectively isolated itself in sanctioning Iran: Europe wants no further insecurity. It wants no more refugees heading to Europe. Was it Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough stance that brought Jong Un to the table?\u00c2 Or, perhaps contrarily, might Jong Un have seen a meeting with Trump simply as the price that he had to pay in order to advance Korean re-unification?\u00c2 Was Trump warned that Iran would suffer economic pain, but that it would nonetheless persevere, in spite of sanctions? No \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem inherent in listening principally to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstovepipes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The unraveling of Netanyahu's Middle East strategy is marked by the diminishing influence of the Kushner \"stovepipe\" to Trump, the shifting geopolitical dynamics involving Russia, Turkey, and European nations, and the internal challenges within Saudi Arabia, all of which undermine the original plan to counter Iran and stabilize the region under U.S.-Israeli-Saudi leadership.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The article \"The Unraveling of the Netanyahu Project for the Middle East\" by Alastair Crooke discusses the complexities and challenges facing the Middle East strategy led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and supported by U.S. President Donald Trump. Initially, the strategy involved a coordinated effort to counter Iran, with Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA and threats against Tehran, while relying on Russian restraint of Iran and allowing Israeli military actions in Syria. However, this plan has faced significant setbacks, particularly due to the fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which implicated Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) and led to instability within Saudi Arabia. The article highlights the diminishing influence of Jared Kushner's direct line to Trump, which bypassed traditional U.S. checks and balances, and the shifting geopolitical dynamics, including Russia's strengthened defense posture in Syria and Europe's push for stability. Additionally, the U.S. and its allies are reevaluating their positions on the Yemen war and relations with Qatar. The article suggests that these developments have weakened the Netanyahu-MbS alliance against Iran, as regional and international actors seek to restore balance and avoid further conflict.",

        "text": "A Rules-Based Global Order or Rule-less US Global \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOrder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation\u00c2 / Zerohedge, 31 Oct 2018\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has taken the US military/security complex 31 years to get rid of President Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last nuclear disarmament achievement\u00c2 \u2013 the INF Treaty, that President Reagan and Soviet President Gorbachev achieved in 1987\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, writes Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former Assistant Treasury Secretary:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Behind the scenes, I had some role in this, and as I remember, what the treaty achieved was to make Europe safe from nuclear attack by Soviet short and intermediate range missiles [the SS20s], and to make the Soviet Union safe from US [Pershing missiles deployed in Europe].\u00c2 By restricting nuclear weapons to ICBMs, which allowed some warning time, thus guaranteeing retaliation and non-use of nuclear weapons, the INF Treaty was regarded as reducing the risk of an American first-strike on Russia and a [Soviet] first-strike on Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Reagan, unlike the crazed neoconservatives, who he fired and prosecuted, saw no point in nuclear war that would destroy all life on earth. The INF Treaty was the beginning, in Reagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind, of the elimination of nuclear weapons from military arsenals.\u00c2 The INF Treaty was chosen as the first start, because it did not substantially threaten the budget of the US military/security complex\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nThe Trump Administration however now wants to unilaterally exit the INF. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Speaking to reporters in Nevada, Trump\u00c2 said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russia has violated the agreement. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been violating it for many years and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why President Obama didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t negotiate or pull out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to pull out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement and do weapons, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not allowed to\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Asked to clarify, the President said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unless Russia comes to us and China comes to us and they all come to us, and they say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all of us get smart and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s none of us develop those weapons,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but if Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing it and if China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing it and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re adhering to the agreement, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unacceptable. So we have a tremendous amount of money to play with our military.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nThe tell-tale markers are plain: Russia and China are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new weapons (and the US is behind the curve); China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoing it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (and is not party to the INF treaty), and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 have a tremendous amount of money to play with our military (we can win an arms race and the military-industrial complex will be ecstatic).\n\nA (US) diplomat has told the\u00c2 Washington Post\u00c2 that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the planning [for the withdrawal] is the brainchild of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, [a career opponent of all arms control treaties on the principle that they potentially might limit America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s options to take unilateral action], has told U.S. allies he believes the INF puts Washington in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excessively weak position\u00e2\u20ac\u009d against Russia \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and more importantly China\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nTrump is not a strategist by nature.\u00c2 He prides himself rather, as a negotiator, who knows how to go after, and to seize, US leverage.\u00c2 A wily Bolton has played here into Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obsession with leveraging US strength to do two things: To return the US to having potentially a first strike capability over Russia (i.e. more leverage), through being able to install intermediate missiles\u00c2 (such as Aegis) in Europe, over and up against Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frontiers.\u00c2 And, secondly,\u00c2 because were some military\u00c2 conflict\u00c2 between the US and China\u00c2 to\u00c2 become inevitable, as tensions escalate,\u00c2 the US has concluded that it needs medium range missiles to strike at China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainland. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not China only. As Eric Sayers, a\u00c2 CSIS\u00c2 expert,\u00c2 put it:\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deploying conventionally-armed ground-launched intermediate-range missiles may be key to reasserting US military superiority in East\u00c2 Asia.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (i.e. leverage again).\n\nIndeed, last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2 US Nuclear Posture Review\u00c2 already noted that\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China likely already has the largest medium and intermediate-range missile force in Asia, and probably the world.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2 And the US\u00c2 is in\u00c2 the process\u00c2 of encircling China with intermediate missiles initially with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to buy the Aegis system, with Taiwan possibly next. (Bolton is known to support\u00c2 stationing US troops on Taiwanese soil, as further leverage over China).\n\nPresident Putin sees this\u00c2 plainly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Americans keep on indulging in these games as the actual goal of such games is not to catch Russia in violations, and compel it to abide by the treaty; but to invent a pretext to ruin that treaty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c part of its belligerent imperial strategy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2 Or, in short, to impose a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrule-less, US, global order\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nWhat is happening is that Bolton and Pompeo seem to be precisely taking Trump back to the old 1992\u00c2 Defence Policy Guidance\u00c2 document, authored by Paul Wolfowitz, which established the doctrine that the US would not allow any competition to its hegemony to emerge.\u00c2 Indeed, Assistant Secretary of State, Wess Mitchell, made this return to Bush era policy, absolutely clear, when in\u00c2 a statement\u00c2 to the US Senate he said:\n\nThe starting point of the National Security Strategy is the recognition that America has entered a period of big-power competition, and that past US policies have neither sufficiently grasped the scope of this emerging trend nor adequately equipped our nation to succeed in it.\u00c2 Contrary to the hopeful assumptions of previous administrations, Russia and China are serious competitors that are building up the material and ideological wherewithal to contest US primacy and leadership in the 21st\u00c2 Century.\u00c2 It continues to be among the foremost national security interests of the United States to prevent the domination of the Eurasian landmass by hostile powers.\n\nAnd at the\u00c2 Atlantic Council\u00c2 on 18 October, the Secretary made it very plain that\u00c2 Europe will be whipped into line\u00c2 on this neo-Wolfowitz doctrine:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153European and American officials have allowed the growing Russian and Chinese influence in that region to\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sneak up on us.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Western Europeans cannot continue to deepen energy dependence on the same Russia that America defends it\u00c2 against. Or enrich themselves from the same Iran that is building ballistic missiles that threaten Europe,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c2 the assistant secretary emphasized. Adding,\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not acceptable for US allies in central Europe to support projects like\u00c2 Turkstream 2\u00c2 and\u00c2 maintain cozy energy deals\u00c2 that make the\u00c2 region more vulnerable to the very Russia that these states joined NATO to protect themselves against.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nAlso\u00c2 addressing\u00c2 the\u00c2 Atlantic Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2 October 18 conference,\u00c2 US Special Representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, revealed that\u00c2 Washington plans to stiffen the sanctions regime against Moscow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153every month or two\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to make it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmore amenable over Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n\nPlainly, Europe will be expected too, to welcome America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missiles deployed back into Europe. Some states may welcome this (Poland and the Baltic States), but Europe as a whole will not.\u00c2 It will serve as another powerful reason to rethink European relations with Washington.\n\nThe influence of Bolton poses the question of what is Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign policy now. Is it still about getting a good deal for America on a case-by-case basis, or is it a Bolton-style make-over for the Middle East (regime change in Iran), and a long cold war fought against Russia and China? US markets have until now thought it is about trade deals and jobs, but perhaps it no longer is.\n\nWe have\u00c2 written before\u00c2 about the incremental neocon-isation of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign policy. That is not new. But, the principal difficulty with a neo-Wolfowitzian imperialism, lashed to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radical, transactional, leveraging of the dollar jurisdiction, of US energy and of the US hold on technology standards and norms, is that by its very nature, it precludes any \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgrand strategic bargain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from emerging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except in the unlikely event of a wholesale capitulation to the US.\u00c2 And as the US bludgeons non-compliant states, one-by-one, they\u00c2 do\u00c2 react collectively, and asymmetrically, to counter these pressures.\u00c2 The counter current presently is advancing rapidly.\n\nBolton may have sold Trump on the advantages of exiting the INF as giving him bargaining leverage over Russia and China, but did he also warn him of the dangers? Probably not. Bolton has always perceived treaty limitations to US action simply to be disadvantageous. Yet President Putin has warned that Russia will use its nuclear weapons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if its existence is threatened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even if it is threatened through conventionally armed missiles. The dangers are clear.\n\nAs for an arms race, this is not the Reagan era (of low Federal debt to GDP). As one commentator notes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no entity on earth (not currently engaged in QE), has as much government debt vulnerable to short-term interest shifts, than the US government.\u00c2 The US Federal Reserves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u201c5 more [interest rate] hikes by end 2019\u201d, roughly translates into: \u201cThe Fed [interest payments due on US debt may become so large, as to] impose cuts on the US military in 2019\u201d.\n\nTrump loves the leverage Bolton seems to magic out of his NSC \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcblack box\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but does the US President appreciate how ephemeral leverage can be?\u00c2 How quickly it can invert?\u00c2 He cannot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Canute like \u00e2\u20ac\u201c simply stand on the sea-shore and command the rising tide of US bond interest rates to recede like the tide, or the US stock market, just to levitate, in order to multiply his leverage over China.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The article discusses the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the INF Treaty, driven by National Security Adviser John Bolton's influence, as part of a broader strategy to reassert U.S. military dominance and leverage over Russia and China, while highlighting the potential risks and geopolitical tensions this move could exacerbate.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The article discusses the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a move influenced by National Security Adviser John Bolton, who opposes arms control treaties that limit U.S. unilateral action. The INF Treaty, established in 1987 by President Reagan and Soviet President Gorbachev, aimed to reduce the risk of nuclear war by eliminating certain types of missiles. Trump's rationale for exiting the treaty is based on allegations of Russian violations and the need to counter China's growing missile capabilities, despite China not being a party to the treaty. This decision is part of a broader strategy to reassert U.S. military dominance and leverage in global affairs, particularly against Russia and China, and reflects a return to a 1992 Defense Policy Guidance doctrine that seeks to prevent any competition to U.S. hegemony. The article suggests that this approach could lead to increased tensions and an arms race, while also straining U.S. relations with Europe, which may be reluctant to host American missiles. The influence of Bolton raises questions about whether Trump's foreign policy is shifting from transactional deals to a more aggressive, neoconservative stance, potentially leading to long-term geopolitical instability.",

        "text": "Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c At the Complex Intersection of Three Points of Inflection\n\nAlastair Crooke, Strategic Culture Foundation, 23 Oct 2018\n\nRealists point out that Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alive dismemberment and killing is still just one dead journalist; that such events are not exceptional \u2014 and that states seldom change policy for the sake of one death, however gruesome its commission.\u00c2 All true.\u00c2 But it is also true that an isolated event can catch \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; Can strike just at the instant when \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinflection\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is poised to turn; When a single additional, undifferentiated, snowflake can touch off a huge slide whose mass is entirely disproportionate to the single grain that triggers it.\u00c2 Was Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing just such a trigger?\u00c2 Quite possibly yes \u2014 because there are several unstable accumulations of political mass in the region where even a small event might set off a significant slide. These dynamics constitute a complex nexus of shifting dynamics.\n\nKhashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literal bodily dismemberment is somehow also an allegory for the larger regional dynamics grinding away. Khashoggi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an early member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and considered as their icon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was, we are told, literally, gruesomely dismembered. Symbolically, his end will be viewed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the region, at least \u2013 as the still live body of the MB, spread prone on the desk, being diced into bits by\u00c2 Saudi apparatchiks\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c recalling almost precisely the Gulf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign to crush the Brotherhood, and to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extinguish\u00e2\u20ac\u009d it from the region.\u00c2\n\nThe symbolism is all the more poignant as Khashoggi symbolised too, in a personal way, that ambiguous tentacle stretching between bin Laden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Al-Qae\u00e2\u20ac\u2122da and the Muslim Brotherhood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although later Khashoggi was to reserve his estimation of bin Laden.\u00c2 (Khashoggi joined the MB at about the same time as bin Laden; traveled extensively with the al-Qaeda leader in Afghanistan; and wrote one of the first profiles of him for a Saudi magazine in 1988 (see\u00c2 Peter Bergen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2 The Osama bin Laden I Know).\n\nThe primary \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoint of inflection\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on which the world has rightly seized, however, is the potential that President Trump will be grudgingly cornered, by the slow drip, drip, feed of the evidence \u2013 into a redress of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSaudi relationship for the first time since 1948.\u00c2 And, as part of this, reluctantly cornered to concede that Mohammed bin Salman is not the reliable foundation from which the main elements of US foreign policy all branch out: Iran regime change, putting a lid on the price of oil as Iran falls under further sanctions, selling US weapons, and handing Israel its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdeal of the century\u00e2\u20ac\u2122).\u00c2 Of course, no one knows what might come next in Saudi Arabia, were MbS to be sidelined as heir presumptive.\u00c2 There are\u00c2 rumblings from within\u00c2 the al-Saud family clearly audible.\n\nWill Trump actually make such determination?\u00c2 He will do everything to avoid it. However, a critical \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoverhang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of US Congressional and Beltway opinion has been souring on the Saudi relationship for a long while: incrementally, since 9/11, and the catastrophe that is Yemen, has added mass to that overhang of discontent and unease about the merit of the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tight hug of MbS.\u00c2\n\nFew in DC, believe that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim of a $110 billion potential in arms sales is anything other than bluster: a dressing up of existing sales, already in the pipeline from Obama days, puffed out with a few (non-binding) letters of intent.\u00c2 And the US today is no longer dependent on a secure supply of Saudi oil. Inevitably then, the downside to the relationship is becoming starker (and darker).\u00c2 And with the public plainly more cognizant of the horrors that constitutes Wahhabi brutal jihadism (i.e. in Syria), as well as the slow dawning that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Saudi is not what reform connotes, elsewhere.\u00c2 Is Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder then that last grain that will set off the precipitous slide?\u00c2 If Senator Lindsay Graham can be considered the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccanary in the mineshaft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, then yes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This guy [MbS], has got to go\u00e2\u20ac\u009d,\u00c2 Graham insists.\n\nAnd here the other symbolism arising from Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s killing points to a different \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpoint of inflection\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: His dismemberment occurred in Turkey, just as he was about to marry into the AKP Establishment (his fianc\u00c3\u00a9e\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uncle was an AKP founder).\u00c2 Khashoggi was also a friend of President Erdogan.\u00c2 This grisly event has allowed Erdogan to leverage Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation immeasurably (especially when it occurred in parallel to the Turkish court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release of US Pastor Brunson).\u00c2 Trump, greeting Brunson at the White House, admitted to a Damascene conversion: he now viewed Turkey very favourably, the President claimed.\u00c2 Erdogan will\u00c2 leverage this advantage fully, to prise the US away from the Kurds in eastern Syria, and to strengthen his hand in playing Washington off, against Moscow.\n\nErdogan plainly has loftier ambitions. He is using this Khashoggi leverage now to\u00c2 pitch for the leadership\u00c2 of the Islamic world, no less \u2013 hoping to snatch it away from Saudi Arabia. After the defeat of the Wahhabis in Syria, Erdogan senses that Sunni Islam is on the cusp: He is brazenly using Ottomanesque language and imagery to assert this prior claim; and op-ed pieces in the Turkish press are adding to this:\u00c2 the demand\u00c2 for Saudi Arabia to give up its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWahhabi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hegemony over the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.\u00c2\n\nThis represents another key potential tipping point: Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position is slipping: It has been always a marginal state\u00c2 politically, but the kingdom compensated for this, through cheque-book politics, and its credentialisation as Keeper of the Holy Sites.\n\nBut with the excesses of ISIS alienating Americans and Europeans, the Gulf States turned to a narrative of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccalling for moderation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and of endorsing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwar on theocracy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, rather than risk outright condemnation of jihadi violence:\u00c2 A stance unacceptable to their own \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPuritan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clerics.\u00c2 (The point here, was that whilst the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWar on Theocracy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00c2 could\u00c2 be\u00c2 understood as an explicit commitment to fighting ISIS, rhetorically, it more conveniently served to equate Iran, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood as being indistinguishable from ISIS).\u00c2 This is the highly contrived narrative into which Trump unreservedly has bought.\n\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoderation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meme however, compelled a concerted, if confused, attempt at the distancing of Gulf monarchies from \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIslamic Statehood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00c2 But,\u00c2 as noted\u00c2 by Ahmad Dailami, the monarchical nationalism that MbS used to distance the kingdom from its own Islamic puritanism was neither replaced with an alternative creed, nor with true secularism.\n\nKhashoggi is hailed in the West as a liberal, favouring democratic reform, but in fact, he was a staunch supporter of the monarchical system (of which MbS is the effective head).\u00c2 He contended however, that all these monarchieswere \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reformable\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\u00c2 Only the secular republics, he suggested (such as Iraq, Syria and Libya) were unreformable, and required to be overthrown.\u00c2 Where he fell out with MbS therefore, was that he favoured not a turn to secularism or western-style \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliberalism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but a reforming\u00c2 Islamisation\u00c2 of Arab politics along Muslim Brotherhood lines \u2014 just like Erdogan, in fact.\n\nSo, here is the second potential tipping point: Will Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so-far successful leveraging of the Khashoggi murder also succeed in drawing in its wake,\u00c2 an inversion of US support\u00c2 away from the Gulf back toward the Turkish Muslim Brotherhood model?\u00c2 The US has oscillated (often quite violently), over the years, between supporting the MB as the catalyst of change in the ME, only to swing back to the Saudi intelligence service\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to field \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckick-ass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 jihadists as the better recip\u00c3\u00a9 for quick regime change.\u00c2\n\nTrump hinted at just such a possible shift with his favourable\u00c2 comments\u00c2 on Turkey when receiving Pastor Brunson: \u201cThis is a splendid step to have a major and special kind of relationship with Turkey. Our thoughts on Turkey today are much different than what yesterday. I guess we have a chance to be much closer with Turkey, to have much, much closer relations. Establishing good ties with President Erdo\u00c4\u0178an is gaining significance.\u201d\n\nAnd what constitutes a possible third latent point of inflection?\u00c2 Well, Israel of course. The former US Ambassador to Israel,\u00c2 Dan Shapiro, writes:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The grisly hit-job on Khashoggi has implications far beyond its exposure of the Saudi Crown Prince as brutal and reckless. In Jerusalem and D.C., they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mourning their whole strategic concept for the Mideast \u2013 not least, for countering Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The shocking brutality of Jamal Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abduction and murder by Saudi security forces cannot be papered over, no matter how implausibly it is dressed up, as\u00c2 an interrogation gone wrong\u00c2 or the work of\u00c2 rogue actors.\n\nBut its implications go deeper than the tragedy visited upon Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family and fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. It raises fundamental questions for the United States and Israel about their whole strategic concept in the Middle East\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the Khashoggi murder, beyond obliterating red lines of immorality, also points to the fundamental unreliability of\u00c2 Saudi Arabia\u00c2 under MBS as a strategic partner. What happened in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul echoes words once used to describe Napoleon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elimination of an opponent: \u201cIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse than a crime. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mistake.\u201d One might add, a strategic mistake\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\n\nIn fact, it opens a potential inflection point of great consequence.\u00c2 Israel has either lost, or had its air superiority over Syria and the northern arc of the Middle East, greatly circumscribed. Israel depended on this air superiority. But in the wake of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss of an Ilyushin Il-20 aircraft and its 15 airmen over Syria on 17 September, Russia has installed a formidable air and electronic defence umbrella across much of the northern tier of the Middle East.\n\nConsequently, the strategic balance in the Middle East hangs precariously in the balance.\u00c2 The pendulum of power has swung northwards:\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be easy for Israel to navigate these waters, as the Washington foreign policy establishment has quickly splintered into anti-Iran and anti-Saudi camps \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 For Israelis, [it may be that] the biggest blow in the fallout of Khashoggi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murder [is that] MBS, in his obsession with silencing his critics, has actually undermined the attempt to build an international consensus to pressure Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, US Ambassador\u00c2 Shapiro concludes. Israel now has a number of alternatives: press Trump to intervene with Putin in order to have him \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwalk-back\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the S-300 SAM deployment in Syria; challenge the Russian air defences directly, or, acquiesce to a new regional strategic balance.\n\nHow Trump finally decides to handle the Khashoggi killing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to fudge it, or not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may well determine which of these options Israel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the region as a whole \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ultimately will elect to follow.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The murder of Jamal Khashoggi serves as a potential catalyst for significant geopolitical shifts in the Middle East, challenging the US-Saudi relationship, empowering Turkey's regional ambitions, and questioning the reliability of Saudi Arabia as a strategic partner for the US and Israel.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has become a pivotal event at the intersection of several geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East. While some view it as just another tragic death, it has the potential to trigger significant shifts in regional and international relations. Khashoggi's killing has exposed the brutal nature of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) and has strained the longstanding US-Saudi alliance, with increasing calls from US Congress to reassess this relationship. This incident also provides Turkish President Erdogan with leverage to enhance Turkey's influence, potentially challenging Saudi Arabia's leadership in the Islamic world. Furthermore, the murder complicates the US and Israel's strategic plans in the region, particularly against Iran, as it questions Saudi Arabia's reliability as a partner. The fallout from Khashoggi's death could lead to a realignment of US support, possibly favoring Turkey's Muslim Brotherhood model over the Gulf States, and impact Israel's strategic calculations in the Middle East. How President Trump addresses this situation could significantly influence the future geopolitical landscape of the region.",

        "text": "Funeral ceremony for military commanders and nuclear scientists martyred during Israel\u2019s 12-day war, Tehran, June 28, 2025\n\nTrump flip-flops on Iran, again. Why?\n\nThe US President Donald Trump\u2019s latest Truth Social post yesterday on Iran nuclear issue reads as follows: \u201cTell phony Democrat Senator Chris Coons that I am not offering Iran ANYTHING, unlike Obama, who paid them $Billions under the stupid \u201croad to a Nuclear Weapon JCPOA (which would now be expired!), nor am I even talking to them since we totally OBLITERATED their Nuclear Facilities.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s post suggests that the Iran question threatens to move to the centre court of American party politics. Trump is upset by Senator Coon\u2019s criticism, who is a senior lawmaker in the Senate from Delaware (Joe Biden\u2019s \u2018eyes and years\u2019, as New York Times once put it) for the past 15 years.\n\nInterestingly, Senator Coon is an ordained elder with West Presbyterian Church, who continues to preach regularly at houses of worship across Delaware and, importantly, is committed to bipartisan engagement in politics aiming to bring Americans of all backgrounds, faiths, and political parties together through a celebration of spirituality and prayer. Coon has an evangelical base, regularly participates in the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast, and is one opposition politician who can attract a hefty breakaway wing of MAGA movement if it were to splinter over Trump\u2019s abandonment of campaign pledge on farewell to arms.\n\nCoon has trenchantly criticised Trump\u2019s handling of the Iran question. In doing so, he aligned with four other senior Democratic senators \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Appropriations Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Senate Armed Services Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.)\n\nThey have issued a statement on the Iran question on June 18 which argued that: 1. The eruption of Israel-Iran conflict represented \u201ca dangerous escalation that risks igniting a broader regional war\u201d 2. Trump should \u201cprioritise diplomacy and pursue a binding agreement that can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. 3. Trump should not expand US engagement in the war, given the \u201clack of preparation, strategy, and clearly defined objectives, and the enormous risk to Americans and civilians in the region.\u201d 4. Trump administration is yet to provide answers to fundamental questions, such as\n\nIntelligence Community\u2019s current assessment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, its leaders\u2019 intent, and its capabilities;\n\nthe objective of US military intervention in Iran, especially Trump\u2019s call for \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER\u201d by Iran;\n\nthe estimated scope and duration of any US military campaign;\n\nthe risk to US forces across its bases in the region;\n\nevacuation plans for US citizens; and, most important,\n\nthe constitutional or statutory authority that would underpin the military intervention.\n\nOn the last point, in a stinging rebuke, the five senators reminded Trump that \u201cCongress is an equal partner in preserving and defending US national security around the world, and Congress has not provided authorisation for military action against Iran\u2026 The United States cannot sleepwalk into a third war in as many decades. Congress has a critical role to play in this moment.\u201d\n\nTrump is unused to checks and balances. What made Trump particularly furious would be that Sen. Coon also happens to be a member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee and a staunch supporter of Israel and a guest speaker at AIPAC events.\n\nCoon is an interesting politician who can take bold positions. Last year, for example, he opposed a resolution proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders that would have applied human rights norms to US assistance for Israel, while on the other hand, urging the Biden administration to recognise a \u201cnon-militarised\u201d Palestinian state after the end of the Gaza war!\n\nThe bottom line is that a groundswell of opinion is building up in the US, reminiscent of the undercurrents after President Kennedy\u2019s assassination that eventually swept America as Lyndon Johnson accelerated the Vietnam War, ultimately turning it into a tsunami that forced him to retire from politics.\n\nIn reality, Trump\u2019s options are limited. He is insisting that the air strikes of June 22 \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. That is to say, the Iranian bomb is no longer a compelling reality.\n\nOn the other hand, Israel is mighty upset that Iran has given it such a battering that its economy is in shambles and it cannot hope to take on Iran directly. It expects the US to do the heavy lifting, which, to my mind \u2014 and, perhaps, special envoy Steve Witkoff\u2019s mind too\u2014 Trump is loathe to do. (More about Witkoff later.)\n\nIf Trump embarks on the war path regardless, he needs a mandate from the UN Security Council and the US Congress. But neither is likely forthcoming. That aside, if Iran inflicts serious damage to the US interests in a military confrontation, it can potentially become a hot button issue in the mid-term elections next year that could mean an ignominious end to MAGA movement and Trump\u2019s legacy.\n\nWhat is the alternative? I would go back to Trump\u2019s default position and do ground work to negotiate the so-called Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which Witkoff had promised as recently as last week in a CNBC interview.\n\nTrump should have known that Iran\u2019s political rhetoric at the level of the Supreme Leader is mostly meant for the domestic audience of observant Muslims. Any Iran expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft could have compiled a list of past instances in such volatile moments in the US-Iran standoff during the past 47 years and someone in the White House could have prepare a bulky document and got Trump to glance through it.\n\nThe problem with the White House all along has been that it eats out of Israeli hands \u2014 with a new exceptions such as Barack Obama. But that habit is no longer viable, since a point has come when the US and Israeli interests no longer converge.\n\nSimply put, Trump had no conceivable reason to name calling Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the eve of the funeral ceremony for top military commanders and nuclear scientists martyred during Israel\u2019s 12-day war against Iran, which he could not even attend due to security considerations.\n\nWhat would Trump have done in a similar situation at the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Episcopal Diocese of Washington if body bags were to arrive from Middle East? A Fox News interview? A post on Truth Special?\n\nLife moves on. Trump should return to a priori history and let Witkoff negotiate the agreement that he promised. Let things cool down meanwhile through the multiple back channels that are available.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "text": "America\u2019s peacemaking president Donald Trump emerges out of White House after wrapping up a ceasefire in the war in West Asia, heading for the Netherlands for the 2025 NATO Summit that marks a consolidation of the western alliance system under US leadership, Washington, DC, June 23, 2025\n\nTrump won\u2019t brook opposition to peace talks with Iran\n\nAs the 12-day war ends in the Middle East, it is abundantly clear that the conflict erupted almost entirely due to Israel\u2019s plan to undermine the US-Iran talks. Israel feared that fundamentally, both Washington and Tehran sought an improvement of relations, which would be a historic reconciliation ushering in a New Middle East, where its regional hegemony would be at risk.\n\nThe destruction of Iraq and Syria testifies to what extent Israel would go to pin down the US foreign policy strategy to the old groove despite nagging awareness in Washington\u2019s thoughtful circles, including the CIA, over the years that without addressing the Iran question, American diplomacy in West Asia would remain sub-optimal.\n\nBarack Obama realised this but wouldn\u2019t take the bull by its horns. Joe Biden also knew this but became a victim of the Russophobia that warped his thinking, and Iran got relegated to the back burner. Things were in drift until the October 7 attacks on Israel. The rest is history.\n\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, is clear-headed that he has three major foreign policy challenges to be sorted out in the four years ahead \u2014 Russia, Iran and China. Arguably, he prefers to handle the three areas sequentially but also realises that is not feasible or even advisable.\n\nThus, Trump found himself reopening the Iran file. Paradoxically, he saw Iran reconciliation as a low-hanging fruit, although it is an incredibly complicated issue where memory mixes with desire.\n\nThe mitigating factor is that although the US\u2019 capacity to influence the region\u2019s politics is in decline and interventionism no longer an option, West Asia has transformed beyond recognition during the four years he was out of power. Trump feels emboldened that Iran has much greater acceptability in its neighbourhood than ever before and this allows out-of-the-box solutions.\n\nThe nomination of Steve Witkoff as special envoy for Middle East was the first sure sign that Trump was aiming at a paradigm shift on a grand scale where Iran nuclear issue was only one segment. Indeed, it is a stunning turnaround that Trump sees potential to tap into normalisation with Iran to create synergy for \u2018America First\u2019.\n\nTrump sees that American interests are best served through Iran\u2019s integration into the Western market. He is shrewd enough to assess that basically, Iran\u2019s elites (and the influential Tehran bazaar) desired good relations with the US. The election of Masoud Pezeshkian as president was an affirmation of the national mood and the religious establishment\u2019s refusal to block his ascendance was a massive signal that winds of change were sweeping over Iran.\n\nWhen I visited Iran to observe the presidential election last year, it was apparent that Iran was not only ready for reconciliation with the US but also favoured Trump to emerge in the November election, the consensus opinion being that they could do business with the billionaire-businessman president. It, actually, left me wondering at times whether Iranian elites were already quietly talking to Trump\u2019s circle.\n\nWhen I returned from Tehran, I wrote in the wake of Pezeshkian\u2019s victory, that we should anticipate a \u2018Look West\u2019 shift in Iran\u2019s foreign policy strategy.\n\nHowever, Israel refuses to budge from its maximalist stance that Iran should capitulate \u2014 ie., not only surrender its rights to enrich uranium but must roll back its conventional deterrent capability as well. Predictably, it turned out to be the deal breaker in Witkoff\u2019s negotiations.\n\nTo my mind, the US bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and Iran\u2019s acquiescence thereof has since cut this Gordian knot so that talks can be resumed after the 12-day interruption! One crucial detail here, unreported by the Western press, is that days before the US strike, Iran\u2019s foreign ministry had already announced the transfer of enriched uranium from the nuclear sites!\n\nSuffice it to say, Iran is not contesting Trump\u2019s triumphant claim that the US \u201cobliterated\u201d the nuclear programme. The word play reminds me that the US-Iranian standoff all along has had traits of a pantomime of love-hate between an estranged couple.\n\nTrump couldn\u2019t care less anymore about the Israeli demand for Iran\u2019s \u2018de-nuclearisation\u2019 and \u2018de-militarisation.\u2019 Certainly, he has no time for Netanyahu\u2019s agenda to force a regime collapse in Iran or a break-up of Iran along ethnic lines, etc. Trump pins hopes on a grand bargain with Iran as partner in America First.\n\nWhile for Netanyahu, this war is an extension of the so-called Greater Israel project, there isn\u2019t a shred of evidence that Trump is a votary of Zionism. The plain truth is: Israel has taken a beating from Iran like it never took in its entire life story. Israel\u2019s missile stockpiles, especially interceptors, have been depleted and the US has only limited capacity to replenish, while Iran still has a vast stockpile of tens of thousands of missiles.\n\nIsrael\u2019s much-vaunted air defence capability turned out to be dysfunctional in combat conditions. And, Trump will not hesitate to browbeat Netanyahu if push comes to shove. By now, Netanyahu would knows pretty much about Trump\u2019s explosive fury littered with expletives if provoked.\n\nEvidently, Trump also feels the imperative need to preserve the backing of the MEGA movement, his core political constituency, which is anchored on his vociferous commitment as a peacemaking president who will never allow another interventionist war abroad. Therefore, the bottom line is that the ceasefire should hold rather well. Don\u2019t worry!\n\nThe message from the 2025 NATO Summit in the Netherlands is that the entire western world has rallied behind Trump. Possibly, Russia and China also see these geopolitical realities, which may explain the belated decisions by Putin and Xi Jinping to skip the upcoming BRICS summit in Brazil.\n\nI expect US-Iran talks to begin any day. There is a sense of urgency on both sides, as evident from Trump\u2019s announcement waiving sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports and specifically allowing China to buy Iranian oil.\n\nTrump is pacifying Tehran so that oil flows smoothly through the Strait of Hormuz. But the main thing about Trump\u2019s announcement is that he justified it by saying Iran needs money for its reconstruction after the war and oil exports should help!\n\nWe should anticipate a big Saudi role going forward. That is the impression I get from Pezeshkian\u2019s conversation with Saudi Crown Prime Mohammed bin Salman. They see in MBS a visionary. Tehran wants MBS to come on board Iran\u2019s normalisation process with the US so that it gains in gravitas.\n\nThis is Persian ingenuity at its best for the remaking of \u2018Muslim West Asia\u2019, putting behind the tragic history of Shia-Sunni sectarian divides created by foreigners, which pitted Muslims against Muslims.\n\nWhat is there in all this for Trump himself? To be sure, Trump and Witkoff envisage that economic cooperation with Iran will be a game changer for America First. As a potential energy supplier for Europe to replace Russian oil, Iran\u2019s integration will help Europe\u2019s economic revival, which boosts US\u2019 pre-eminence on the global stage.\n\nWith a hugely successful NATO Summit wrapped up at the Netherlands, Trump is preparing to end the 47-year old rift with Iran to pave the way for a New West Asia. This week must be counted as the finest hour of Trump\u2019s five-month old presidency. Trump is closer than ever to claim the Nobel as America\u2019s peacemaking president.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "paragraph_summary": "In June 2025, Donald Trump emerged from the White House after successfully negotiating a ceasefire in the Middle East and headed to the Netherlands for the NATO Summit, which underscored the consolidation of the Western alliance under U.S. leadership. The recent 12-day war in the Middle East was largely attributed to Israel's attempt to undermine U.S.-Iran peace talks, fearing a historic reconciliation that could threaten its regional dominance. Unlike his predecessors, Trump is determined to address the Iran issue as part of his broader foreign policy challenges, which include Russia and China. He sees potential in normalizing relations with Iran, believing it could serve American interests by integrating Iran into the Western market. Despite Israel's opposition, Trump is focused on a grand bargain with Iran, viewing it as a partner in his \"America First\" agenda. The ceasefire is expected to hold, bolstered by Trump's commitment to avoiding interventionist wars. The NATO Summit demonstrated global support for Trump's peacemaking efforts, and U.S.-Iran talks are anticipated to resume soon, with Trump waiving sanctions on Iranian oil to facilitate economic recovery. Saudi Arabia is expected to play a significant role in this new geopolitical landscape, as Iran seeks to mend sectarian divides and foster regional cooperation.",

        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin received Iran\u2019s foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Kremlin, June 23, 2025\n\nThe former President and Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev who is one of the most authoritative voices in the Kremlin, wrote on the Telegram channel on June 23 a critique on the Middle East crisis following the US attack on Iran\u2019s three key nuclear sites of Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nMedvedev listed ten points, which, taken together, messaged that Russia\u2019s stance on the developing situation around Iran has markedly shifted to one of proactive mode marked by profound scepticism and deep concern about President Donald Trump\u2019s intentions.\n\nAs recently as on June 4, Trump had sought Putin\u2019s help to advance the US-Iran negotiations on the nuclear issue and Putin, in good faith, agreed to help. Indeed, the Iranian government spokesperson had disclosed on June 12 that preparations were under way for a visit by Putin to Tehran.\n\nBut on June 22, Trump ordered the air strike on Iran\u2019s three nuclear sites without taking Putin into confidence. Such surreptitious behaviour may be nothing new to Washington in inter-state relationships but it caused embarrassment to the Kremlin. Medvedev\u2019s comments show it when he ridicules Trump\u2019s triumphalism about the air strike.\n\nMedvedev listed ten points under the heading What did the Americans achieve with their night strike on three points in Iran? They underscore that Russia\u2019s stance on the developing situation around Iran has shifted to one of unequivocally distancing itself from the US approach going forward. The 10 points are:\n\nQuote.\n\nThe critical infrastructure of the nuclear cycle, apparently, was not damaged or was damaged only slightly. The enrichment of nuclear materials, and now we can say directly \u2013 and future production of nuclear weapons \u2014 will continue. A number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their nuclear weapons. Israel is under attack, explosions are thundering, people are in a panic. The United States is drawn into a new conflict with the prospect of a ground operation. The political regime of Iran is preserved, and with a high degree of probability it has become stronger. The people are consolidating around the spiritual leadership, and even those who did not sympathize with him. Trump, who came as a peacemaker president, started a new war for the United States. The absolute majority of countries in the world are against the actions of Israel and the United States. With such success, Trump will never see the Nobel Peace Prize, even despite all the venality of this nomination. A good start, congratulations, Mr. President!\n\nUnquote.\n\nOn the whole, Medvedev\u2019s assessment is in sync with the swathe of opinion among neutral observers, including Western analysts, about the state of play. However, Points 2 and 3 stand out as particularly noteworthy in their prognosis that inexorably, Iran has now been pushed into a path of making the nuclear bomb and, more importantly, Tehran can expect help in this direction from \u201ca number of countries (who) are ready to directly supply Iran with their nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time that Russia has explicitly spoken about Iran\u2019s likely \u2018nuclearisation\u2019. That in itself is a paradigm shift. Medvedev has approvingly presented it in a marked departure from Russia\u2019s stated affirmations in the past that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. Russia has been historically a cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n\nThree things have changed. First, the US itself has become a proliferator. In Europe, the US\u2019s allies freely fly its planes fitted with nuclear bombs during exercises. German pilots have familiarised themselves with such planes. In Asia-Pacific, AUKUS alliance actually involves transfer of nuclear weapon technology to Australia, which is technically an NPT member.\n\nSecond, when it comes to Iran, a key ally of Russia, the US aggression has crossed Iran\u2019s \u201cbig red line\u201d \u2014 to borrow the words of foreign minister Abbas Araghchi \u2014 which leaves Tehran with no alternative but to act in self-defence. Besides, in the \u2018rules-based order\u2019 imposed by the US on Iran, its own ally Israel, a non-NPT member country, has a fully-developed clandestine nuclear weapon programme and is estimated to have a stockpile of some 200 nuclear missiles but all that Trump blithely ignores.\n\nThird, things have come to such a pass today that smaller countries must nuclearise in the quickest way possible, which is their only iron-clad guarantee to preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity from the US attacks in the chaotic international situation today. North Korea\u2019s success in pushing back US pressure is due to its nuclear deterrent capability. What is absolutely galling is that Trump has not even cared to seek a mandate from the UN Security Council and has gone to war with Iran without getting Congressional approval.\n\nEvidently, Medvedev\u2019s commentary pooh-poohs the pious hopes in Washington and Tel Aviv about forcing a \u2018regime change\u2019 in Iran. Medvedev assertively proclaims that not only has Iran\u2019s political system become stronger but \u201cpeople are consolidating around the spiritual leadership\u201d including elements that \u201cdid not sympathise with him\u201d previously.\n\nRussia shares the prevailing opinion in the world community that by embracing on a military confrontation with Iran, Trump has added to the US\u2019 growing isolation in the world community.\n\nAn intriguing point here is that in Medvedev\u2019s prognosis, the US is being drawn into a new conflict abroad \u201cwith the prospect of a ground operation.\u201d He didn\u2019t explain how this may happen. Iran, which is almost the size of Europe, is a big country and has approximately 610,000 active duty personnel plus 350,000 reserve and trained personnel that can be mobilised when needed. Then, there is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has approximately 125,000 personnel and a voluntary militia, Basj, under it with a further approximately 90,000 active personnel.\n\nEven a limited US commando operation is fraught with high risk. The Operation Eagle Crew \u2014 undertaken in April 1980 in an attempt to rescue the US hostages \u2014 ended tragically. Of eight helicopters sent into Iran, two became disabled and a third was blown into a C-130 cargo plane in a fierce desert sandstorm, killing eight American servicemen whose bodies, left behind, were later paraded before Iranian television cameras. The Carter administration, humiliated by the failed mission and loss of life, expended great energy to have the bodies returned to the US. Trump is unlikely to risk such escapades.\n\nIn geopolitical terms, the seismic shift in the Kremlin thinking can be a game changer for Iran which must be regretting that it declined a Russian offer to include a provision for mutual security assistance in times of war in the two countries\u2019 recently concluded treaty of strategic partnership, similar to what Russia has with DPRK. Also, Putin disclosed last week that Russia had offered to develop an integrated air defence system jointly with Iran (that could access Russian satellite data) but Iran showed no interest. Curiously, he revealed that Tehran was yet to ask for any help, either!\n\nThat was on June 19. But on June 22 Trump struck and a terrible beauty was born. It appears that Khamenei ordered Araghchi who was busy parleying with Europeans to go East and meet Putin.\n\nAnyway, at a meeting with Araghchi in the Kremlin today, Putin used exceptionally strong words to condemn the US attack on Iran which he called a \u201ccompletely unprovoked act of aggression against Iran \u2026 without foundation or justification.\u201d\n\nPutin added, \u201cRussia has long-standing, strong, and trustworthy relations with Iran, and we are committed to supporting the Iranian people through our continued efforts\u2026 Your visit provides us with an important opportunity to discuss these sensitive issues in depth and to explore ways we might work together to navigate the current situation.\u201d (The Kremlin readout is here.)\n\nWill Russia\u2019s entry deter Trump on his warpath? That is the million dollar question in the coming days. If Trump persists with such belligerence in cahoots with Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, a protracted war of attrition will ensue that will most certainly bring in China at some point with which Iran has a strong mil-to-mil relationship.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Putin condemned the U.S. attack as unprovoked and reaffirmed Russia's commitment to supporting Iran, raising questions about whether Russia's involvement might deter further U.S. military actions. The situation hints at the possibility of a prolonged conflict that could eventually involve China, given its strong military ties with Iran.",

        "text": "Putin in reflective mood muses on US-Iran confrontation\n\nThe US President Donald Trump who sought President Vladimir Putin\u2019s active help a fortnight ago to mediate in the negotiations over Iran nuclear issue has abruptly changed his mind. In retrospect, Putin probably showed undue enthusiasm no sooner than Trump sought his help, and even mooted a trip to Iran shortly to meet Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but only to realise just days later that Trump had other thoughts on his impressionable mind following the Camp David meeting with his aides and advisors and has since wandered into strange thoughts, including such tragic notions as decapitation of the Iranian leader. (here and here)\n\nPutin\u2019s terse remarks to a group of senior foreign journalists in St.Petersburg on Wednesday were made in a sombre mood. Putin wouldn\u2019t answer a pointed question from Reuters as to what he thought of Trump\u2019s shocking hint a day earlier in a Truth Social post that he might order the assassination of Khamenei.\n\nPerhaps, it was a folly on Putin\u2019s part to rush into playing second fiddle to Trump on the highly complicated Iran nuclear problem, blithely ignoring that this is quintessentially a geopolitical problem too, where the interests of the US and Russia do not necessarily converge.\n\nIn reality, Russian-Iranian relations are no less complex than the US-Russia tango. The two countries had a deeply troubled common history. During World War 2, Soviet forces even occupied Tehran in cahoots with Britain; earlier, imperial Russia carved out vast territories of the Persian Empire and annexed them. How could Iranians forget all that?\n\nIn an article in January when Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed a strategic partnership treaty, I had written that the event in Moscow signified at best a breakthrough in the ties but the road ahead would be long and winding. I estimated that the treaty was \u201can attempt to build guardrails so as to enable a new trajectory of relationship in mutual interests.\u201d (See Russia-Iran treaty signifies a \u2018breakthrough\u2019 in ties, Indian Punchline, January 24, 2025)\n\nCuriously, Article 3 of the treaty painstakingly flags the maleficent activities that both sides should avoid and goes on to commit both sides not to help either side\u2019s adversary in a conflict situation! What sort of strategic partnership can be a treaty with such caveats and mutual suspicions?\n\nAt the media event in St.Petersburg on Wednesday, Putin revealed that it was Iran who did not want a mutual defence clause to be included in the treaty (as Russia has with North Korea) \u2014 and, furthermore, that in the emergent circumstances while battling the US-Israeli juggernaut, Tehran has not so far sought any help from Moscow!\n\nThere is an abject lesson here for Trump, too. Iran is a fiercely independent country which, no doubt, is interested to have a productive relationship with the US, but the question, from the US perspective, is how to go about it. Certainly, it cannot be the John Wayne way.\n\nWhere the US failed repeatedly is also on this score \u2014 its inability or refusal to seek an equal relationship with Iran based on mutual respect. If Trump carries out a decapitation of the Iranian leader, he might as well forget about a normalisation of the US-Iran relationship for decades to come. And its debilitating consequence will be that even the US\u2019 residual influence in the West Asian region will drain away within Trump\u2019s presidency. In fact, any such incredibly stupid act may even lead to the emergence of a ultra-nationalistic nuclear weapon state.\n\nIran question needs to be handled with subtlety and sophistication. A hugely successful businessman like Trump ought to have the sense of realism (and pragmatism) to know the art of the possible.\n\nPutin told on Wednesday, \u201cWe see that today in Iran with all the complexity of the internal political processes taking place there \u2013 we know about it, and I think there is no point in going into depth \u2013 but still there is a consolidation of society around the political leadership of the country. This happens almost always and everywhere, and Iran is no exception.\u201d In short, Putin noted that a regime change in Iran to Washington\u2019s satisfaction will remain a pipe dream.\n\nSecond, Putin said referring to Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facilities and missile manufacturing defence industry, \u201cI will only repeat what we know and hear from all sides, these underground factories, they exist, nothing has happened to them \u2014 And in this connection, it seems to me that it would be right for all of us to seek ways to end the hostilities together \u2026This is a delicate question, and of course you need to be very careful here. But, in my opinion, in general such a solution can be found.\u201d\n\nThis is the best advice Trump can hope to get from any quarter today from within his circle or from foreigners. The level of trust and cooperation in the nuclear field between Russia and Iran is very high and Trump should have no difficulty to tap into it.\n\nPutin disclosed that Moscow has given \u201ccertain signals to our Iranian friends. And in general it is possible to secure Iran\u2019s interests in the field of peaceful nuclear energy and at the same time go out to allay concerns on the part of Israel regarding its security.\n\n\u201cSuch options, in my opinion, there are. We have outlined them, I repeat, to all our partners: and the United States, and Israel, and even to Iran. We\u2019re not imposing anything on anyone \u2013 just talking about how we see a possible way out of the situation. But the solution, of course, lies behind the political leadership of all these countries, above all Iran and Israel.\u201d\n\nFrankly, Iran is not an easy country to negotiate with. It can be stubborn as a mule while defending its national interests and preserving strategic autonomy. The collective consciousness of a civilisation state going back to circa 700 BC must be reckoned with. Putin pointed out that Russia had once offered to jointly develop an integrated air defence system for Iran but \u201cthe [Iranian] partners did not show much interest, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Look at the irony of it today!\n\nPutin probably senses that a US intervention in Iran is in the cards. Of course, he is a worried man. Putin\u2019s advice to both Netanyahu and Trump is deceptively simple: \u201cYou should always look at whether the goal is achievable or not when starting something.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "text": "Israel\u2019s Dimona nuclear facility from where, according to Iranian reports, \u2018plumes of smoke were rising\u2019, June 17, 2025\n\nTrump orders \u2018unconditional surrender\u2019 by Iran. Who\u2019s listening?\n\nIsrael\u2019s blitzkrieg against Iran five days ago is failing spectacularly. The Russian media reported that: i) Israel\u2019s Rafael weapons complex has been destroyed; ii) Haifa oil refinery is in flames; iii) the Iron Dome has been breached; iv) and, Israel\u2019s air dominance is a figment of imagination.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iran fired cruise missiles for the first time against Israel. Another wave of Iranian missile and drone attack targeted the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel, where stealth fighter jets, transport aircraft, tanker aircraft and machines for electronic reconnaissance/surveillance, etc. are stationed.\n\nSome Iranian reports claim that \u201cplumes of smoke were rising from areas near the Dimona nuclear facility,\u201d where an estimated 90 Israeli nuclear warheads are stored. If true, this must be highly embarrassing for Israel which has been maintaining a policy of deliberate ambiguity in regard to its nuclear capabilities as well as for President Donald Trump who is constantly hectoring Iran while turning a blind eye on Israel\u2019s clandestine nuclear weapon stockpiles right under his nose \u2014 apart from exposing the IAEA.\n\nAccording to the independent Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Israel\u2019s nuclear warheads are capable of being delivered anywhere within a maximum radius of 4,500 km by its F-15, F-161, and F-35I \u201cAdir\u201d aircraft, its 50 land-based Jericho II and III missiles, and by about 20 Popeye Turbo cruise missiles, launched from submarines.\n\nSuffice to say, rational minds among the Israeli elite feel worried. Typically, Danny Yatom, former head of Mossad, is quoted as saying, \u201cIranians will not kneel; they will not raise the flag of surrender and they will not give in!\u201d\n\nThe American broadcast television network NBC has reported that Israel asked Iran, through western mediators, to stop its retaliatory attacks and return to nuclear negotiations. This would probably explain Trump\u2019s bombastic post on Sunday in Truth Social that Israel and Iran will end their violent conflict by \u201cmaking a deal\u201d through his mediation. Trump wrote, \u201dWe will have peace, soon, between Israel and Iran. Many calls and meetings now taking place.\u201d He even drew the analogy of his success in brokering peace between India and Pakistan recently.\n\nHowever, the realisation may have since dawned on Trump that Iranians will not forget or forgive the assassinations of their military commanders or the destruction and loss of life of dozens of civilians in the Israeli Blitzkrieg, which targeted Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, military infrastructure, and residential buildings in Tehran and other cities.\n\nTrump has a major decision to take in coming days as regards the next move \u2014 specifically, how to rescue Israel from the attritional war that lies ahead. Pressure for US military intervention is mounting. Trump is obligated one way or another to all three segments of the Israel Lobby \u2014 Zionists, evangelical Christians and wealthy Jewish elites who are kingmakers in American politics.\n\nThe pendulum is wildly swinging in Trump\u2019s mercurial mind. He was in an irritable mood at the G-7 summit in Canada on Monday, cut short his trip and picked a nasty public quarrel with French President Emmanuel Macron for simply commenting that Trump hurried back to wrap up a ceasefire.\n\nTrump wrote angrily, \u201cPublicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France, mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a \u201ccease fire\u201d between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. Stay Tuned!\u201d\n\nFour hours later, he clarified, \u201cI have not reached out to Iran for \u201cPeace Talks\u201d in any way, shape, or form. This is just more HIGHLY FABRICATED, FAKE NEWS! If they want to talk, they know how to reach me. They should have taken the deal that was on the table \u2014 Would have saved a lot of lives!!!\u201d\n\nSeven hours later, Trump claimed, \u201cWe now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn\u2019t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured \u201cstuff.\u201d Nobody does it better than the good ol\u2019 USA.\u201d\n\nBut a few minutes later, Trump threatened Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: \u201cWe know exactly where the so-called \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don\u2019t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d\n\nSeven minutes later, another nasty post followed in capital letters: \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!\u201d\n\nThat was 9 hours ago. Presumably, Trump wound up Tuesday by ordering Iran to crawl on its knees. The chances of Iran obliging him are zero. In fact, the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of Iran\u2019s Armed Forces Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi said on Tuesday that the operations carried out so far have served as a deterrent warning, and the actual \u201cpunitive operations\u201d are set to begin soon. The general asked the inhabitants of Tel Aviv and Haifa \u201cto leave these areas for the sake of their lives.\u201d\n\nIn fact, an Iranian commentary underscored yesterday that \u201cIsraeli strikes on Iran\u2019s energy infrastructure and southern ports near the Persian Gulf could shift the nature of the conflict dramatically\u2026 This is precisely what Iran identifies as its strategic red line.\u201d\n\nThe commentary continues: \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing is a multi-level hybrid conflict, a complex puzzle involving direct warfare, proxy engagement, diplomatic pressure, and a simmering \u201ccold peace\u201d\u2014all unfolding at once\u2026 But such a scenario is unsustainable, as Israel\u2026 knows it cannot endure a prolonged high-intensity conflict.\n\nThe commentary estimates that a ceasefire \u201cwould likely be a tense calm or a \u201ccold peace\u201d rather than true stability.\u201d Because, \u201cWhat\u2019s emerging now is a fluid and brutal new balance of power\u2026 The Persian Gulf, Israel, the Axis of Resistance, and the global energy market are no longer separate arenas\u2014but interconnected pieces in a simultaneous, high-stakes game.\u201d (here)\n\nThe great dilemma for Trump is that there\u2019s no quick fix solution in sight. On his way back to the US yesterday evening, Trump said he wanted a \u201creal end\u201d to the conflict and that he was \u201cnot too much in a mood to negotiate.\u201d German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also noted that Trump was indeed considering that option. The US is rapidly building up its forces in the Gulf region.\n\nHowever, US intervention may trigger a continental war that will outlive Trump\u2019s presidency and destroy his presidency, as Bush\u2019s 2003 Iraq invasion destroyed his. And Trump might as well forget about America First, MAGA, Ukraine, Taiwan, tariff wars, immigration, inflation, China, etc.\n\nEven European allies won\u2019t stand by Trump. Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 summit after Trump\u2019s departure, \u201cThe biggest mistake today would be to try to do a regime change in Iran through military means because that would lead to chaos.\u201d Macron warned that \u201cno one can say what comes next\u2026We never support actions of regional de-stabilisation.\u201d\n\nDo not forget that the skeptics include Vice President JD Vance also, whose suspicion of foreign entanglements had its origins in his time as a US Marine in Iraq, where he became disillusioned with America\u2019s interventionist regime change projects and ill-fated \u2018forever wars\u2019 in the region.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "text": "Scene of an apartment building destroyed by an Iranian ballistic missile impact, Bat Yam, Israel, June 15, 2025\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s war on Iran has no future\n\nAn unnoticed undercurrent of the Israel-Iran war is that three Christian nations in Europe \u2014 UK, France and Germany \u2014 have joined the fray with alacrity on the side of Israel.\n\nStrange, isn\u2019t it, that these European countries comprising the so-called E-3 have a well-established exclusive path of dialogue with Iran but are joining Israel\u2019s warpath? It\u2019s a Crusade, stupid!\n\nThe three \u2018Crusader nations\u2019 share Israel\u2019s obsession to check the rise of a Muslim nation as an emerging power in the Middle East that could radically transform its geopolitical alignments. Simply put, destroying the Islamic regime in Iran is the real objective of Israel\u2019s war \u2014 and of the three Christian nations from Europe.\n\nReportedly, Israeli fighter jets which attacked Iran used the British air base in Cyprus; British refuelling planes are on deployment in Syrian-Iraqi airspace for use of Israeli fighter jets; French president Emmanuel Macron, as defender of Roman Catholicism openly vows that he will act to prevent Israel\u2019s defeat; Germany, the fountainhead of Protestantism, has also similarly positioned itself behind Israel.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, what emerges from the hour-long phone conversation between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday is that they will work together to advance the path of dialogue with Iran, the current conflict situation notwithstanding. The Kremlin readout stresses that Putin forcefully denounced the Israeli aggression.\n\nSuch a line-up of the principal actors signals that Israel\u2019s best bet lies in killing the war itself as a strategic error and create a \u2018new normal\u2019? But will Tehran allow Netanyahu to get away with murder? That\u2019s the million dollar question. Putin will have to use all his persuasive power doing the planned visit to Iran \u2014 ie., if it still goes ahead.\n\nThe Israeli thinking behind its assassination of the IRGC leadership and military commanders stemmed out of the foolish miscalculation that Tehran lacks a political will to resist aggression. The Israeli objective is on the one hand to create conditions for a regime change in Iran and on the other hand to derail any form of US-Iran constructive engagement.\n\nAll through, terror has been the chosen weapon for Israel and the western powers to undermine and weaken Iran. But a point has been reached where a containment of Iran is no longer feasible. Logically, Iran\u2019s neighbours in the Muslim world should have rallied in support of Iran but that\u2019s too much to expect, given their limited sovereignty to act independently.\n\nNonetheless, Iran will not capitulate. Iran\u2019s sense of national pride and honour as a civilisation state will prompt it to circle the wagons and wage a protracted war until victory. From the early days of the revolution, the Islamic republic which was founded on the principles of justice and resistance on the bedrock of nationalism and independence, got attracted to Mao\u2019s concept of \u2018protracted people\u2019s war\u2019 to keep predator nations at bay. That strategy paid off during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988).\n\nSaddam Hussein too, like Netanyahu, miscalculated that Iran was a hopelessly weakened nation in the civil war conditions with its economy in virtual collapse, army in disarray, state formation yet to crystallise, and with no allies in the region to lend a helping hand. But as it turned out, Iran fought an 8-year war defiantly to a stalemate, undeterred by the lavish support extended to Saddam by the Western powers and their regional allies.\n\nThe US even equipped Saddam\u2019s army with chemical weapons to stop the human-wave\u2013attack tactics of Iranian fighters, but of no avail \u2014 although, an estimated quarter million Iranians sacrificed their lives.\n\nAt some point, in a very near future, Israel will also meet the fate of Saddam, having miscalculated Iran\u2019s grit to resist. Netanyahu also estimated that Iran is a much weakened country compared to last year due to the setbacks taken by the Axis of Resistance. Such na\u00efvet\u00e9 underestimates the potency of resistance at the very core of Shi\u2019ism.\n\nLast week, the resistance forces that were supposedly vanquished from the face of the earth regrouped and began firing missiles at Israel \u2014 from Syria, of all places! On May 4, Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv hitting the perimeter of the main terminal of Ben Gurion Airport! Reports suggest that Hezbollah has restored its supply routes from Iran.\n\nWhat Israel fails to grasp is that resistance movements do not die their raison d\u2019\u00eatre remains. Israel is, in reality, in very deep crisis fighting on multiple fronts amidst a cascading domestic political crisis and an economy that requires drip feeding by Washington.\n\nAs the US\u2019s capacity to influence events in the Middle East keeps diminishing, Israel\u2019s unviability as a nation propped by the Jewish Lobby in the Beltway appears sharper in focus. Already, there is resentment within the US about bankrolling Israel and fighting its wars.\n\nOn the contrary, the rise of Iran is inevitable \u2014 with a population base 10 times bigger than Israel\u2019s, vast mineral resources, a self-sufficient agricultural sector and broad-based industry, innovative progress in technology, big domestic market, highly strategic location and trained manpower.\n\nIran\u2019s stamina is of a long distance runner, as Iran-Iraq war showed, whereas, Israel\u2019s forte is as sprinter on a 100 metre track. Make no mistake, Israel, a small country with a population of 8 million people will get hollowed out in a protracted war.\n\nIn the current scenario, what goes against Israel critically is that while President Donald Trump tried and failed to stop Netanyahu on the warpath, he is not going to deploy American forces to fight Israel\u2019s war.\n\nTrump has an evangelical base in US politics and is on friendly terms with wealthy Jewish donors, but has nothing in common with the Crusader nations of the Old World \u2014 be it on Ukraine or Iran. In both cases, actually, he tends to view the paradigm through the America First prism where he sees immense potential to generate wealth through business links with Russia or Iran.\n\nBesides, Trump is far too smart a politician to risk the future of his MAGA movement whose core tenet is the total rejection of all interventionist \u2018forever wars\u2019. Trump knows only too well that American public opinion is staunchly opposed to Middle Eastern wars.\n\nThe replacement of Mike Waltz as NSA on May 1 (a known Israeli proxy who found himself in the top echelons of Trump administration) and the subsequent purge of the entire pack of \u2018Iran hawks\u2019 in the National Security staff under him, signalled that Trump is wary of Netanyahu\u2019s diabolical plots to derail his negotiations with Iran through back channels. (here and here)\n\nDuring their phone conversation on Saturday, according to the Kremlin readout, Trump and Putin agreed to prioritise the \u201cnegotiating track in Iran\u2019s nuclear programme\u2026 Trump noted, the team of US negotiators is ready for resuming work with Iranian representatives.\u201d Clearly, a military confrontation with Iran does not figure in Trump\u2019s calculus.\n\nThat being the case, Netanyahu\u2019s bombastic rhetoric apart, Israel\u2019s best interests lie in ending this futile war in the quickest way possible. Conceivably, that is also the preference of the IDF. A protracted war on its own steam with a clutch of crusader nations in tow as cheer leaders is not something that can save Israel from destruction.\n\nCuriously, Trump in his latest Truth Social post on Sunday after the conversation with Putin advised Israel \u201cto make a deal\u201d with Iran! Does that fit into Netanyahu\u2019s war mongering? And Trump went on to burnish his own credentials as a peacemaker president!\n\nTrump concluded predicting that \u201cwe will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran!\u201d Succinctly put, Trump has no intentions whatsoever to risk American lives by fighting Netanyahu\u2019s wars.\n\nObviously, \u201cPEACE, soon\u201d will be Russia and Iran\u2019s preference too, as serious negotiations can be resumed and agreement reached that would herald a US-Iran normalisation and the lifting of American sanctions. But does that suit Netanyahu?\n\nThe paradox is, Israel has no future in a protracted war with Iran, but an inconclusive end to this war will pose the high risk for Netanyahu of a cascading demand for a regime change in Israel. Loss of power means loss of parliamentary immunity from prosecution that Netanyahu hitherto enjoyed from corruption charges against him and his family members, and a possible imprisonment.\n\nRead more: Iran Attack: Netanyahu Gambles Big, Rediff.com, June 14, 2025\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "text": "Protestors in an anti-Israeli gathering hold up Iranian and Palestinian flags, Tehran, Iran, June 13, 2025\n\nWhy did Israel jump the gun?\n\nThe Israeli Defence Forces called the aerial attack on Iran by some 200 planes in the early hours of Friday, June 13, as a \u201cpreemptive strike.\u201d International law gives no scope to attack a country over 1000 kms away on a vague pretext of \u2018self-defence\u2019 \u2014 or, \u2018an immediate operational necessity.\u2019\n\nThe UN Charter allows acts in self-defence, but there is nothing that Iran has done in the recent period \u2014 at least after President Donald Trump returned to the White House \u2014 that can be construed as threatening Israel. Israelis claim to have significantly weakened Iran\u2019s capacity to threaten their country.\n\nSo, call it naked aggression. The statement by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to distance the US from Israeli strikes stressing that \u201cIsrael took unilateral action\u201d and had advised Washington that \u201cthey believe this action was necessary for its self-defence.\u201d\n\nTrump had been telling Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu that such attacks would only undermine the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. The sixth round of US-Iran negotiations is scheduled to take place in Muscat on June 15.\n\nRubio\u2019s statement underscored that \u201cWe are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.\u201d Rubio did not make the slightest attempt to voice US support for Israel in defending against any Iranian counterstrikes. This is extremely unusual.\n\nThe big question is, what forced Netanyahu\u2019s hands \u2014 apart from the obvious one of distracting attention from the aggravating domestic political crisis?\n\nOne factor is that his personal equations with Trump have been steadily going south, especially since the removal of Mike Waltz on May 1 from the crucial post of National Security Advisor, a key policy-shaping role in the White House.\n\nWaltz\u2019s reassignment as ambassador to the UN came in the aftermath of the so-called \u201cSignalgate\u201d incident, but with hindsight, his leaning towards aggressive military action against arch foe Iran too weighed on Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nNo sooner than Waltz lost his position, a purge of key foreign policy and national security positions in the White House began. Known \u2018Iran hawks\u2019 whom Waltz had handpicked to assist him have been shuffled out while \u2018America First\u2019 realists are in ascent.\n\nThey include Eric Trager, who was heading the Middle East and North Africa portfolios for the National Security Council who is considered an \u2018Iran hawk\u2019 whom Waltz brought into the post from the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Again, Morgan Ortagus, considered one of the \u201cstrongest pro-Israel supporters in the administration,\u201d was shuffled out of her role as the Lebanon envoy under Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nAccording to YNet News, Ortagus\u2019 removal from the position \u201cstunned officials in Jerusalem, where she is viewed as closely aligned with Israeli interests.\u201d Also, Merav Ceran (an Israeli-American who was a former official in Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense) has been removed from the Iran and Israel desk in the National Security Council.\n\nCertainly, Israel\u2019s moles who favoured war over diplomacy with Iran, have been shown the door while the president himself is negotiating with Iran to curb its nuclear program! (See a fuller account of the White House changes in two reports by the Responsible Statecraft website of Quincy Institute \u2014 here , here and here.)\n\nIsraelis claim that there was \u201cfull and complete coordination\u201d with the Americans ahead of Friday\u2019s attacks but the sentiment has not yet been echoed in Rubio\u2019s statement. Admittedly, Rubio did issue a warning for Iran: \u201cLet me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel.\u201d But that is more of a red line.\n\nAnother sensitive factor at work is the growing pressure on Trump from some recognised figures in the Make America Great Again (MAGA) camp backing him, such as Steve Bannon, former chief White House strategist and influential figure. They warn Trump against a hawkish foreign policy stance, particularly by way of support for military interventions abroad, as that is fraught with the risk of splintering the MAGA camp, which would be politically damaging.\n\nFinally, there is the big picture of geopolitical realignments. Last fortnight was a critical period. The audacious Ukrainian attack on Russian nuclear triad on June 1 prompted a call from Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin within forty-eight hours.\n\nThe outcome of their conversation appears to be that: i) US-Russia constructive engagement must run its course; ii) diplomacy will continue on the Ukraine issue even while new facts on the ground may keep shaping diplomacy; and iii) the US is decoupling from European allies in the proxy war in Ukraine.\n\nThe stunning part of the phone call was that Trump sought Putin\u2019s intervention in Iran nuclear issue. Putin agreed to help. Only a week later, Iran\u2019s government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani was quoted by Russia\u2019s state RIA news agency as saying, \u201cPutin\u2019s trip to Tehran is currently being worked out, preparations are underway.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei holds Putin in great esteem. Succinctly put, Israel\u2019s worst nightmare is coming true \u2014 US-Iran negotiations gaining in the statesmanlike gravitas of a world leader. Without doubt, Putin knows that this could be potentially a game changer in Russia-US relations as resolution of the Iran issue remains critical to the stabilisation of the Middle East and further opportunities may arise to address the Middle East crisis, including the Palestine issue.\n\nEvidently, time is running out for Israel. And Netanyahu has chosen to act now, whether Trump likes it or not. From the Iranian perspective, advantage lies in continuing the talks with Steve Witkoff in Muscat on Sunday. Any attack on the US bases in the region is avoidable in the retaliation that can be expected for sure. Let Israel stew in its aggression. Hurt them where it matters most in the upcoming war.\n\nBBC reported that \u201cIn the hours before Thursday\u2019s attacks, US officials were briefing that there would be no American support in the event of Israeli action, even going as far as to say they would not help with any aerial refuelling. That was meant for Tehran\u2019s consumption.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s first reaction to Israeli strikes is also in the nature of a case for negotiations and compromise:\n\n\u201cI gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest of words, to \u201cjust do it,\u201d but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn\u2019t get it done.\n\n\u201cI told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come \u2013 And they know how to use it.\n\n\u201cCertain Iranian hardliners spoke bravely, but they didn\u2019t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!\n\n\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.\n\n\u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This Israeli aggression comes amid strained relations between Trump and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, exacerbated by recent personnel changes in the U.S. administration that have seen pro-Israel figures replaced by more diplomatic-minded individuals. The attack risks undermining ongoing U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations, with Trump warning Netanyahu that such actions could be detrimental. Meanwhile, geopolitical dynamics are shifting, with Trump seeking Russian President Vladimir Putin's involvement in the Iran nuclear issue, potentially altering U.S.-Russia relations and impacting Middle Eastern stability. As tensions rise, Iran is urged to continue diplomatic talks, while Israel faces increasing international scrutiny and pressure.",

        "text": "The Indian media reports make out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s reception for the seven parliamentary delegations waging the war on terror turned into a social occasion to celebrate the flashes of \u2018national unity\u2019 before the hurly-burly of politics returns as the election cycle picks up.\n\nThe PMO did not issue any press release on PM\u2019s remarks. We wouldn\u2019t know whether this event on Tuesday is a substitute for a special session of the parliament to discuss Pahalgam incident, which opposition parties demanded.\n\nRegrettably, we won\u2019t even know the international reaction to our war on terror against Pakistan. There have been no public statements. How can a war be waged when there is no clarity about the enemy?\n\nTerrorism is a dicey subject with a complicated history. It is not only China which maintains \u201cambiguity or double standards\u201don terrorism \u2014 per EAM S. Jaishankar\u2019s allegation \u2014 but even within India there are misconceptions. The contesting legacies of Bhagat Singh and Savarkar bear testimony to it.\n\nWe need to tread softly. Proposals are being mooted lately that India should rally the Global South in the war on terror. There is great risk that we may lethally erode our article of faith that Kashmir is an internal matter. The world-wide perception is already that the periodic eruption of India-Pakistan violence stems from the unresolved Kashmir problem. (See my article Operation Sindoor Outreach: What Did Panda & Co Achieve In West Asia? Rediff, June 5, 2025)\n\nOur solution lies in diligently picking up the thread of negotiations during the time of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf. But no serious attempt has been made in this direction in the past decade or more \u2014 nor is it ever likely by the ideology-driven present government.\n\nIf the bilateral track is unproductive or damaged, what is the alternative? Fixation about bilateralism shouldn\u2019t be an alibi for inertia. The international environment today has dramatically changed and old dogmas have become obsolete. India is no longer vulnerable to external aggression / interference / interventions. Indians are a patriotic people and national unity doesn\u2019t have to be promoted if the country faces an existential danger. We, our children and grandchildren are all stakeholders, because we live here and this is our only country.\n\nWe see a remarkable convergence between the three big powers \u2014 the US, Russia and China \u2014 on the efficacy of dialogue between India and Pakistan. What drives the big powers may not be altruistic motives, but, quintessentially, there is convergence that all three dread a weakened, failed Pakistani state and will prevent it no matter what it takes \u2014 IMF / ADB / World Bank, etc., have been lined up. Pakistan is a highly strategic entity in geopolitical terms.\n\nArguably, China\u2019s helping hand to Pakistan too is not really any different \u2014 although a powerful lobby in our country is raising the spectre of a military \u2018fusion\u2019 between the two countries. Their diabolical agenda is to legitimise the hypothesis that our problematic relations with these two neighbours have no real solutions and all that is possible is a cauterisation of gaping wounds. This is a defeatist mentality unbecoming of a civilisation state.\n\nAfter all, is China doing anything essentially different from what the US did during India\u2019s cold-war era wars with Pakistan\u2014 or for that matter, what Russia is doing for India\u2019s militarisation and national defence? Where was the \u2018fusion\u2019 then?\n\nRussia has openly acknowledged the US\u2019 good offices in checking the India-Pakistan tensions from spiralling out of control. All three big powers offered to promote dialogue. So, where lies the real problem?\n\nSimply put, we remain stuck with the \u2018management\u2019 of Kashmir problem rather than seek a permanent solution. There are interest groups that adopt maximalist positions. And political leadership lacks the courage or the moral authority to approach the problem in a spirit of give and take. Remember, Germany and France also used to be eternal enemies; they even fought two world wars.\n\nIronically, even as PM hosted the seven multi-party delegations that returned home, in a hearing in the US Congress, at the House Armed Services Committee, the commander of the US Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla lavishly praised Pakistan as a key partner in counterterrorism.\n\nThe general unequivocally commended a \u201cphenomenal partnership\u201d on the part of the Taliban with Pakistan in the tribal areas on their border in the fight against ISIS with the support of US intelligence, which eliminated dozens of ISIS fighters and captured at least five high-value terrorists, who included Jafar, one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing.\n\nGen. Kurilla disclosed that Pakistani army chief Gen. Asim Munir called him personally to inform, \u201cI have caught him [Jafar], ready to extradite him back to the United States, please tell the Secretary of Defence and President.\u201d\n\nGen. Kurilla added, \u201cSo we are seeing Pakistan, with the limited intelligence that we provide, go after them using their means to do that, and we are seeing an effect on ISIS Khorasan\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd I would also tell you that since 2024 \u2014 the beginning \u2014 Pakistan has had over 1000 terrorist attacks in the western area [Baluchistan], killing about 700 security and [2500] civilians. They have an active counterterrorism fight right now, and they have been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Gen. Kurilla alluded to a US-Russian convergence \u2014 and even possibly US-Iranian \u2014 in this regard, saying, \u201cBut remember, these [ISIS] are the same individuals that did the Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow [in March 2024 in which the death toll touched 143 and more than a hundred people were injured.] They did the attack in Kerman [in January 2024 at a commemorative ceremony marking the assassination of Gen. Qassem Soleimani at his grave in eastern Kerman, eastern Iran, where two bomb explosions killed at least 95 people and injured 284 others.]\u201d\n\nThe US Army general summed up: \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to\u2014 we have to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India. I do not believe it is a binary switch that we can\u2019t have one with Pakistan if we have a relationship with India. We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives it has.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t it all too obvious that Shashi Tharoor who led the parliamentary delegation to Washington was beating a dead horse?\n\nEAM condemned China publicly, but it is common sense that China also cannot afford the weakening of the Pakistani state. They\u2019ve invested deeply in the CPEC. Or, consider Xinjiang\u2019s stability and security and the nexus between ISIS and Uighur terrorists.\n\nIn reality, our irritation with China is that it is countering terrorist threats supported from abroad effectively, with a long-term perspective, in its own way, with all the wisdom that it can bring to bear on the challenge as a civilisation state \u2014 which has shown results, too \u2014 rather than follow our footfalls and muddling methods.\n\nChina cannot afford a hybrid war like Don Quixote\u2019s against giant windmills because well-trained battle-hardened terrorists from Xinjiang actually constitute the cadres of the ISIS and terrorism is not an optical illusion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "text": "Satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows damage after Ukrainian drone attack on Belaya Air Base, Irkutsk, eastern Siberia, June 4, 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump had a difficult week. No, this isn\u2019t about Elon Musk or Harvard University. On Wednesday, his call to Russian President Vladimir Putin didn\u2019t go well. It turned into a \u2018conversation\u2019, as Trump wrote on Truth Social, lasting only an hour and 15 minutes, which means, setting aside the time for interpretation, it left no room for substantive discussions.\n\nThe call took place against the backdrop of the attack on Russia\u2019s nuclear force on June 1. Trump acknowledged in his Truth Social post later that Putin spoke \u201cstrongly\u201d about Russia\u2019s response to come. The post was notable for its subdued tone.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t know whether Putin brought up Western involvement. The Kremlin merely noted that \u201cDonald Trump reiterated that the Americans had not been informed about this [attack] in advance.\u201d\n\nZelensky\u2019s version is that the attack was in the pipeline for the past 18-month period. Yet, we are to believe, neither the CIA nor MI6 whose operatives run the show in Kiev got an inkling of it. Trump\u2019s Truth Social post simply omitted this crucial part of the conversation with Putin, which is highly significant \u2014 and consequential.\n\nEspecially, as Kremlin-funded RT had already carried one report citing the assessment of an ex-French intelligence officer that the Ukrainian targeting couldn\u2019t have been possible without US satellite inputs.\n\nEarlier, Tass also had carried a similar report citing a former US naval officer who estimated that the 18 month-period was when the Biden administration was virtually on auto-pilot (due to the president\u2019s dementia). An interesting thought in itself?\n\nTass quoted the American source who actually said on a War Room podcast: \u201cSo, who was it on the American side that either gave the greenlight to this or provided the initial intelligence targeting? Hey, where is William Burns and Jack Sullivan, the neocon whizkids in Biden\u2019s team?\n\nAgain, on the same day as Trump spoke to Putin, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov warned at a news conference in Moscow, \u201cThe fact that certain circles in the United States have been and are still hatching plans to move towards eradicating Russia as a state is also undeniable\u2026 We should not underestimate the consequences of such a mindset\u2026 Russian society should remain in a state of high readiness for any intrigues.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Ryabkov called on Washington and London specifically to speak up on the attack on Russian airfields. As he put it, \u201cWe demand that both London and Washington respond in a manner that stops this recent round of escalation of tensions.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the Ukrainian attack on Wednesday in Brussels, NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte came up with an ingenious argument : \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that the capabilities they hit were the capabilities the Russians were using to attack innocent people going about their daily lives in Ukrainian cities and communities. So I think we should take note of that.\u201d Clearly, the poor chap was in the loop! Rutte refused to speak further.\n\nEqually, the social media is awash with the assessments by some prominent American experts, especially ex-CIA analysts, pointing finger directly at the agency\u2019s involvement. Of course, Russia has the experience and technical expertise to dig deep.\n\nThere are comparable situations. What comes to mind is the famous U-2 spy plane incident on May 1, 1961. Perhaps, Trump is finding himself in the same embarrassing situation as President Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nDo we give the benefit of the doubt to Trump that he too was unaware of the strike on Russia\u2019s nuclear force on June 1? To my mind, the analogy of the U-2 incident holds good \u2014 a rare cold-war era confrontation over the US\u2019 blatant violation of Russian sovereignty and territory at a critical juncture just when the White House was navigting an improvement of relations with Russia.\n\nEisenhower was kept in the dark about the full details of the U-2 although countdown had begun for his planned summit meeting with Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, in Paris to discuss a Soviet-American detente (just what Trump is attempting with Putin.) The following excerpts from the archives of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, Eisenhower National Historic Site are most insightful:\n\n\u201c[U-2 spy plane pilot Gary] Powers did have a contingency in the form of a concealed needle with the poison Saxitoxin. If injected, this would have killed him and prevented his capture. Powers did not utilize this and was surrounded by Soviet citizens very soon after he touched down. Soviet citizens soon found his United States issued firearm, and other items bearing the flag of the U.S., turning him over to Soviet officials. Powers, and what was left of his spy plane, were shipped to Moscow be researched and documented. In a matter of hours, Khrushchev was informed of the captured pilot and the wrecked U-2.\n\n\u201cWhen Powers was overdue to land at Norway [U-2 had taken off from its base in Peshawar], the CIA started to consider what might have happened. As a result, their contingency plan went into action. To prevent the public and the Soviets from learning the true nature of the U-2 aircraft, a misinformation campaign began. A NASA press release stated one of their high-altitude weather research U-2 aircraft had gone missing over Turkey, and that it may have drifted into Soviet airspace because of an unconscious pilot. A U-2 was shown off in NASA colors as well to help sell the story. Khruschev learned of this story from the Americans and decided to lay a trap for the United States and for Eisenhower.\n\n\u201cThe Soviets released information that a spy plane was shot down but did not include any other information on the status of the aircraft or Powers. The U.S. believed it could shape the narrative further and kept releasing \u201creports\u201d of oxygen difficulties in the aircraft and that the auto pilot may have sent the plane into Soviet territory. Once the deception from the United States grew large enough, on May 7th, Khruschev sprung his trap by stating the pilot was alive, and that the Soviets had captured the remains of the aircraft, which contained a camera and film of Soviet Military Installations. This destroyed the cover story and was a public embarrassment for the United States and for President Eisenhower. The President learned of this at the office of his Gettysburg residence, where he got a phone call informing him the Soviets had captured Powers. This shattered the peace and tranquility of his stay in Gettysburg, and he knew that he would be held responsible in the eyes of the Soviet Union. In a remark to an aide, Eisenhower reportedly said, \u201cI would like to resign.\u201d\n\nWhile Eisenhower did not resign, the U-2 incident and the acute embarrassment so close to the end of his second term defined his Cold War legacy. Khrushchev cancelled the Paris summit and Soviet-American detente had to wait until Henry Kissinger consolidated his grip over US foreign policy strategies. Nonetheless, the Deep State, which loathed detente, booby-trapped Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency!\n\nEisenhower\u2019s sense of betrayal is reflected in his farewell address when he bitterly called out the Deep State and prophesied that it will someday wreck America\u2019s democracy.\n\nHistory is repeating. Look at the cascading turbulence already around Trump presidency. Eighty two out of 100 members of the Senate are co-sponsoring a bill by Senator Lindsey Graham (whose affiliation to the Deep State is legion), forcing Trump\u2019s hands to impose \u201cbone-breaking\u201d sanctions against Russia, whose sole objective is to stall any improvement of US-Russia relations. Meanwhile, a call for impeachment of Trump is already in the air.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "text": "Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa (L) met with U.S. President Donald Trump (R), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 14, 2025\n\nThe multi-party delegation led by the BJP Vice-President and spokesman Bijayant Panda which toured four countries in the Gulf region \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Algeria \u2014 to rally support for the government\u2019s war on terror against Pakistan has returned. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar \u201clauded their efforts,\u201d per media reports.\n\nThis was the most consequential delegation out of the five delegations that the government mounted to mobilise international opinion. The tidings from the Gulf have great \u2018grassroots resonance\u2019 in India\u2019s domestic politics.\n\nA member of Panda\u2019s team said, \u201cWe briefed the EAM \u2026 that India\u2019s growing economic might and position in the world order, secured by PM Narendra Modi\u2019s diplomatic push during his tenure and visits to several nations, are key when it comes to the world\u2019s decision to stand with us as partners both in international trade as well as on the issue of zero tolerance against terrorism.\u201d\n\nWest Asia is India\u2019s \u2018extended neighbourhood.\u2019 And India\u2019s West Asian diplomacy does carry the imprimatur of Modi. For that reason, an ex-Foreign Secretary was included in Panda\u2019s team to navigate the tricky mission. What comes to mind is Panda\u2019s challenge was similar to Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s as the Commissar of the Red Army at the Stalingrad Front in World War II.\n\nKhrushchev shouted at the commanders of the 62nd Army and the 64th Army on the Stalingrad Front, \u2018Comrades, this is no ordinary city. This is Stalingrad. It carries the name of the Boss.\u201d The generals got the message and went on to crush the crack Nazi Panzer Divisions and turn the tide of the Battle of Stalingrad, which is still remembered as the bloodiest and fiercest battle of the entirety of World War II \u2014 and, arguably, in all of human history.\n\nBut Panda didn\u2019t have such an option. His delegation received a warm reception. But the profoundly worrisome reality still continues, namely, the Gulf regimes are taking a \u2018proforma\u2019 attitude, voicing hackneyed words on terrorism but also echoing the burgeoning world opinion that India and Pakistan ought to find a solution to their issues through dialogue and negotiations.\n\nThe Gulf states have neatly sidestepped Pakistan\u2019s alleged role in Pahalgam. They ask for \u2018proof\u2019! The top diplomat of a friendly country apparently remarked a few days ago in a private conversation as an aside that the Pahalgam terrorists physically checking out the religion of their victims first is nothing new in the subcontinent, and cited Khushwant Singh\u2019s Train to Pakistan for reference.\n\nWhat has Panda\u2019s delegation brought home? Does it make a success story? A member of the delegation later told media in the mother of all quotes, \u201cEvery country we visited had already issued statements condemning the Pahalgam terror incident \u2014 these were reiterated by them in person to us.\u201d But this is like reinventing the wheel.\n\nSome profoundly troubling question arise here, especially as countdown has begun for the Shashi Tharoor moment in Washington. Tharoor also has a challenging mission. After all those decades in the UN where he handled public relations work, this must be a novel experience \u2014 to actually negotiate as a flag carrier.\n\nNot a single senior US official is willing to name Pakistan so far \u2014 certainly, not Trump. They will wonder how this flashy neocon liberal from Delhi and an eloquent exponent of globalism in American publications all these years has shrunk and become a pale shadow of himself.\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of terrorism in 21st century? We are in an era where terrorism is becoming the preferred weapon to fight hybrid wars. Trump recently shook hands with the notoriously cruel ex-al Qaeda terrorist leader Ahmad al-Sharaa who committed unspeakable crimes against humanity, underscoring that yesterday\u2019s terrorist can be tomorrow\u2019s key ally.\n\nThat al-Qaeda was actually a creation of the Americans is known to everybody but Trump proclaimed himself openly as an admirer of al-Sharaa, telling Gulf sheikhs at a GCC conclave in Riyadh on May 14 after shaking hands with the tall six-footer Syrian that \u201che\u2019s a \u201cyoung, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.\u201d Trump added, \u201cHe\u2019s got a real shot at holding it [Syria] together. He\u2019s a real leader. He led a charge, and he\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nTrump had better be right in his optimism because his entire gambit of betting on an ex-al Qaeda ally to reshape West Asia is a risky venture funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar who\u2019d see in all this by the time Trump becomes history a pathway to sow the germane seeds of a third Wahhabi state modelled after them in the cradle of Islamic civilisation.\n\nIn Ukraine too, terrorism is the preferred weapon for the Western powers to bleed Russia in their proxy war when in military technology and defence manufacturing industry they cannot match Russia\u2019s, and they are no longer capable of fighting a continental war either. The stark message coming out of the attacks on Russian military assets two days ago with technical support from NATO satellites \u2014 and possibly Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink \u2014 is that terrorism can be a game changer in geopolitics.\n\nTherefore, all this global campaign by our government against Pakistan may have a good optic domestically as our media hypes it up dutifully, but what is the net gain for diplomacy? Even if the whole world were to now bracket Pakistan with the US, UK, Saudi Arabia or Qatar as yet another state sponsoring terrorism, so what? Who cares?\n\nToday\u2019s papers have reported that according to a list of chairs of the subsidiary bodies of the UN that monitor international terrorism, Pakistan holds responsible positions as co-chair of the Taliban Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council for 2025 and the Counter-terrorism Committee. Pakistan will also be the co-chair of the informal working groups on documentation and other procedural questions as well as the general UN Security Council sanctions issues.\n\nHow could the alleged epicentre of international terrorism be possibly a watchdog and decision-maker on counter-terrorism and sanctions in a world body? Clearly, international opinion ignores India\u2019s diatribes against Pakistan, which is also currently an elected non-permanent member of the Security Council.\n\nOn the other hand, thanks to the Biden administration and Five Eyes, an impression gained ground in recent years that Indian government is sponsoring assassination of political opponents abroad as a matter of statecraft. Not only have we suffered some \u2018reputational damage,\u2019 but the Pakistani claim that it too is a victim of terrorism gained traction. Countries seem to hyphenate India with Pakistan. It has become necessary for Delhi to disown responsibility when a train derails in Baluchistan or an improvised explosive device blows up a Pakistani army convoy or some notorious jihadi fellow meets with unnatural death on the streets of Lahore and Karachi.\n\nThis is becoming a vicious cycle which only helps to call attention to the unresolved Kashmir problem as posing threat to regional and international security. Put differently, \u2018terrorism\u2019 in the India-Pakistan context has become the objective co-relative of the Kashmir problem and Hindu-Muslim strife. Trump\u2019s caustic remark about the millennial war speaks for itself.\n\nIt is high time that the \u2018war on terror\u2019 is removed from our diplomatic toolbox. Certainly, our parliamentarians have no role in it. As for the optics domestically, resort to some other means. By all means, meet terrorism with coercion \u2014 if that indeed helps. Deploy what Joseph Nye called \u2018smart power\u2019. But neither expect external support, nor canvass for it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

        "text": "Image by SWinxy, Creative Commons 4.0\n\nIn one of the scariest moments in modern history, we're doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation.\n\nBy Norman Solomon / Z Network\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s first chief justice, John Jay, would have empathized with the billionaires who\u2019ve been freaking out ever since Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York last Tuesday. \u201cThose who own the country ought to govern it,\u201d Jay insisted. But now, oligarchs accustomed to such governance are furious that the nation\u2019s capital of capitalism is in danger of serving people instead of megaprofits.\n\nMeanwhile, among progressives, euphoria is especially fitting because the Mamdani campaign\u2019s win was truly a people-powered victory, thanks to active efforts of 40,000 volunteers. In a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans six-to-one, the Democratic nomination would ordinarily be a virtual guarantee of winning the general election. But the forces of oligarchy now mobilizing could disprove a claim that \u201cMamdani\u2019s widespread appeal represents the total collapse of a Democratic Party establishment.\u201d\n\nSuch a collapse is very far from certain.\n\nOn the surface, Andrew Cuomo\u2019s decision to stay on the fall ballot as an \u201cindependent,\u201d while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams does likewise, seems to foreshadow splitting the anti-Mamdani vote. But Cuomo still has a substantial electoral following. And the corrupt Adams \u2013 who cut a deal with President Trump to viciously betray immigrants and got his criminal indictment thrown out by Trump\u2019s Justice Department \u2013 has no better ethics than the disgraced former governor Cuomo. Bankrolled by wealthy donors, the pair might make some kind of pact, with one of them telling his followers to unify behind the other before voting begins this fall.\n\nIn any case, a key context of the upcoming election battle is that hell hath no fury like corporate power scorned.\n\nA social-media screed by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman (net worth: upward of $9 billion) was damn near apoplectic that activists and voters had so terribly transgressed. Ackman described himself as \u201ca supporter of President Trump\u201d while expressing a fervent desire \u201cto save the Democratic Party from itself.\u201d Mamdani\u2019s policies, Ackman wrote late Wednesday night, \u201cwould be disastrous for NYC. Socialism has no place in the economic capital of our country.\u201d\n\nBut Ackman held out hope that those owning the city of New York could continue to govern it: \u201cImportantly, there are hundreds of million of dollars of capital available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight \u2026 so that a great alternative candidate won\u2019t spend any time raising funds. So, if the right candidate would raise his or her hand tomorrow, the funds will pour in. I am sure that Mike Bloomberg will share his how-to-win-the-mayoralty IP [intellectual property] and deliver his entire election apparatus and system to the aspiring candidate so that the candidate can focus all of his or her energy on the campaign.\u201d\n\nAnother aggrieved hedge-fund multibillionaire, Daniel Loeb, opted to be concise: \u201cIt\u2019s officially hot commie summer.\u201d Many other moguls have also sounded alarms. But beneath all the froth and bombast, extremely wealthy individuals are busy gauging how to prevail against the threat of democracy and social justice.\n\nIn the Empire State, there are many ways for the empire to strike back. The constellation of forces now regrouping with a vengeance includes titans of Wall Street, enormous real estate interests, pro-Israel groups, corporate media, the anti-progressive rich and assorted smear artists.\n\nIn recent weeks, the completely false charge of antisemitism has escalated against Mamdani. He has taken a principled and consistent stand on behalf of human rights for all \u2013 in the process, denouncing Israel\u2019s war on Palestinian civilians in Gaza \u2013 while at the same time opposing rapacious corporate power. So, it\u2019s no surprise that New York\u2019s most powerful Democrat, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, has been dodging the question of whether he\u2019ll endorse Mamdani in the general election.\n\nFor decades, Schumer\u2019s campaign coffers have bulged while he has been hugely compensated by Wall Street. He has also remained a staunch supporter of Israel, despite its systematic ethnic cleaning and genocide against Palestinian people. A few months ago, Schumer declared: \u201cMy job is to keep the left pro-Israel.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in the state\u2019s second-largest city in 2021 is important to understand. Democratic socialist India Walton was the candidate of a grassroots campaign that stunned the party establishment in the Democratic primary when she defeated Buffalo\u2019s corporate mayor, four-term incumbent Byron Brown. As the Democratic nominee, she seemed set to win the general election in the blue city. But a coalition of furious Democratic power brokers and deep-pocketed Republicans, including racists and vehement haters of the left, aided by much of the city\u2019s mass media, teamed up to smear her and ending up getting Brown elected as a write-in candidate.\n\nLast weekend, I asked India (now a colleague at RootsAction, where she is senior strategist) how she saw the Mamdani campaign. \u201cWatching the New York City mayoral primary from Buffalo last Tuesday gave me a familiar feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I watched the results come in, I felt a flutter in my gut and a sense of pensiveness. A feeling of overwhelming joy and a fear that it would be snatched away despite my attempts to cling to it. I imagine that as Zohran watched, he also felt a sense of familiarity. In 2021, Zohran Mamdani supported my run for Buffalo mayor; I was a first-time unknown candidate challenging a 16-year incumbent, and conventional wisdom said it was an impossible race to win. Now, in 2025, Zohran has once again toppled the establishment. I\u2019m starting to think that populist policies that focus on working people are a winning strategy.\u201d\n\nThat strategy is now striking fear into the hard hearts of insatiably greedy billionaires.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

Avash Media, CC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn one of the scariest moments in modern history, we're doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation.\n\nBy Kit Klarenberg / MintPress News\n\nOn June 13, 2025, Tel Aviv launched what many international observers and Iranian officials have described as an unprovoked military strike on Iran. Israeli jets bombed military and nuclear sites, while Mossad-run sleeper cells carried out sabotage missions against air and missile defense systems from within Iran, and drones smuggled into Tehran were launched against local missile launch bases.\n\nDozens\u2014perhaps more\u2014of nuclear scientists and top military commanders were murdered with surgical precision, often in the presence of innocent family members, who were themselves frequently killed. A climate of chaos and uncertainty seemed to engulf everything.\n\nThese early results so exhilarated Israeli officials that they talked a big game on where their operation would lead, making several incendiary claims along the way. They boasted of operating in Iranian airspace without hindrance, invited the U.S. to get formally involved with the \u201celimination\u201d of Tehran\u2019s nuclear weapons program, and anonymously briefed the media that \u201ca multi-faceted misinformation campaign\u201d\u2014in which Donald Trump was an \u201cactive participant\u201d\u2014had been conducted \u201cto convince Iran that a strike on its nuclear facilities was not imminent.\u201d\n\nInternationally-wanted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu forecast on June 15 that Israel\u2019s war on Iran \u201ccould certainly\u201d produce regime change, as the government was \u201cvery weak,\u201d and that \u201c80% of the people would throw these theological thugs out.\u201d\n\nA hard-hitting response to Netanyahu\u2019s premonitions and Tel Aviv\u2019s military strike quickly arrived from Tehran in the form of a wave of missile attacks. Wreaking unprecedented damage on Tel Aviv and Haifa. The impact on Israeli military installations is difficult to assess due to its strict policy of internal censorship.\n\nVisibly, though, Iran\u2019s bombardments sent Israelis scurrying for shelter, while many others fled the country outright. Such was the exodus, from a country that has already suffered mass depopulation since October 7, 2023\u2014the Israeli government has since scrambled to implement legally questionable bans on its citizens leaving.\n\nBy June 19, officials in Tel Aviv had dropped the braggadocio, and Western media were publishing explainer guides to explain why Israel\u2019s much-vaunted Iron Dome air defense system had failed to repel Iranian strikes.\n\nIran\u2019s unmolested battering of Israel continued apace until June 22, when the U.S. officially entered the war. Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were targeted, allegedly using heavy-duty B-2 bombers that dropped earth-shattering bunker busters.\n\nTrump boasted that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cobliterated,\u201d and Tehran struck an unmanned U.S. base in Qatar in response. Iran and Israel then traded missile barrages, which inflicted significantly greater damage on the latter, for two more days, before begrudgingly agreeing to a ceasefire.\n\nSo far, the ceasefire holds. In the meantime, U.S. claims of having damaged, let alone destroyed, Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities have quickly unraveled, as have Israeli allegations that the June 13 strike was an urgent necessity conducted as Iran was on the imminent verge of acquiring nukes.\n\nAs the dust settles, it is becoming increasingly clear that the so-called \u201c12 Day War\u201d was long in the making, and an unmitigated disaster for Tel Aviv and Washington, with wide-ranging ramifications for the region and beyond.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu wanted to incite regime change in Tehran, while drawing the U.S. into a wider war. He failed on both counts, and now Iran is stronger, its citizens more united with one another, and behind their government,\u201d Ali Abunimah, Electronic Intifada cofounder, tells MintPress News.\n\nThis has enormous implications for West Asia and the world. Israel proved itself more vulnerable than ever. Tehran, while still facing enormous dangers from determined enemies, proved itself far more resilient than its adversaries expected.\u201d\n\n\u2018Burning Through\u2019\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, as many Iranian commentators note,\u201d Abunimah says, another deleterious upshot of the fiasco is \u201cWestern-oriented segments of Iranian society have been left disillusioned\u2014even discredited\u2014by Washington\u2019s brazen deceit.\u201d\n\nBragging about how Trump\u2019s nuclear negotiations were a ruse \u201cmeans not only Iran but many other countries globally will never again trust U.S. diplomacy.\u201d Still, he believes Washington and Tel Aviv\u2019s \u201cefforts to destroy\u201d Iran shouldn\u2019t cease, and could intensify.\n\nFor the time being, Tehran has made clear it will observe the ceasefire and only strike back if it is attacked again. As Abunimah puts it, \u201cSome have criticized Iran for not linking a ceasefire to Israel ending the Gaza genocide.\u201d However, he believes \u201csuch a demand could\u2019ve triggered serious U.S. aggression, rather than the meaningless strikes that happened, and civilians could\u2019ve ended up in the firing line.\u201d\n\nTehran has never envisaged direct defeat via a single blow, but wearing Israel down. The Resistance, including Iran, is the weaker side in an asymmetrical war, facing the full might of the U.S.-led Western empire. Ironically, although Israel started this war, it advanced the Resistance\u2019s objective. Israel appears weak, unstable, and unsafe, while totally reliant on foreign support in a world where it is more hated than ever after nearly two years of its livestreamed genocide in Gaza.\u201d\n\nTyler Weaver, a U.S. military veteran who runs a popular X account publishing military analysis and commentary, echoes Abunimah\u2019s analysis. \u201cIran demonstrated a consistent capability to pierce Israeli missile defenses and damage or destroy Israeli infrastructure and combat systems \u2013 several IDF air defense missile batteries were struck and destroyed,\u201d he observes.\n\nAnd while Iran may not have secured an outright victory against its attackers, \u201cIsrael sure lost\u201d the 12-Day War. \u201cThis was their \u2018big show\u2019 against Iran, and its results did not meet the effort expended. The most effective weapon the Israelis had wasn\u2019t their vaunted Air Force, but instead an elaborately constructed attack network inside Iran courtesy of Mossad, which is now gone, and likely cannot be reconstructed.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure can be repaired, weaponry can be replaced, but they\u2019re not going to be able to rebuild anything like that network again,\u201d Weaver warns.\n\nFurthermore, Israel\u2019s high-risk bid to overpower Iran consumed enormous amounts of munitions and came at great financial expense. A former financial adviser to the IDF chief of staff estimates that just the first 48 hours of Tel Aviv\u2019s botched campaign cost $1.45 billion, with almost $1 billion spent on defensive measures alone. Meanwhile, government economists estimated the daily cost of military operations at $725 million.\n\nTel Aviv was reportedly running perilously low on missile interceptors within five days, despite the U.S. having been aware of \u201ccapacity problems\u201d for months prior, and spending intervening months \u201caugmenting Israel\u2019s defenses with systems on the ground, at sea and in the air.\u201d This, in turn, has created \u201cconcern about the U.S. burning through its own interceptors\u201d within the Pentagon. As a July 2024 report by the Department of Defense-funded RAND concluded, Washington cannot replenish its stockpile of those munitions at any pace or scale.\n\nHaaretz estimates that the civilian and economic toll of the 12-Day War on Israel could reach into the billions of dollars. Thousands of residents have been displaced, with reconstruction costs projected in the hundreds of millions. Most industries were brought to a halt during the conflict, deepening the strain on Tel Aviv\u2019s already fragile economy.\n\nTaken together, Israel\u2019s ability to sustain a longer or more intense confrontation with Iran\u2014militarily or financially\u2014and the U.S. capacity to provide continued support appear increasingly uncertain.\n\n\u2018Idiotic Decision\u2019\n\nReports suggest Trump was motivated by fears of a drawn-out war and saw military strikes on Iran as the most direct path to a ceasefire. This interpretation is greatly reinforced by a high-ranking Iranian official claiming the White House gave Tehran advance notice of the bombings, insisting they were intended as a \u201cone-off,\u201d opening the door for a \u201csymbolic\u201d Iranian counterattack, and cessation of hostilities.\n\nMedia reports suggest that the strikes were part of a broader effort by the President to de-escalate the conflict by offering a negotiated off-ramp for all parties involved. Despite these disclosures, Trump has repeatedly avowed in his typically brash style that the June 22 attack on Iran was decisive, and \u201cone of the most successful military strikes in history.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times later cited a senior U.S. official who said Iran\u2019s nuclear sites were not destroyed but targeted in a way that temporarily took them \u201coff the table,\u201d contradicting the president\u2019s more emphatic characterization.\n\nEven that more modest assessment was further challenged on June 25, when CNN reported on the findings of a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency analysis. The report concluded that U.S. strikes on Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz had not destroyed the core components of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and had likely only delayed it by months. These conclusions were echoed by multiple informed sources, who noted that Iran\u2019s stockpile of enriched uranium had been relocated prior to the attack, and that the facilities\u2019 centrifuges remained largely intact.\n\nWeaver, who has studied photo and video evidence of the 12-Day War extensively, concurs \u201cthere\u2019s little indication\u201d the Iranian nuclear sites were \u201cmeaningfully damaged.\u201d What can be detected from satellite imagery on the ground \u201cis simply inconsistent with the use of earthquake bombs as claimed by Trump and the Pentagon.\u201d\n\nWeaver points to several inconsistencies in mainstream reporting and White House statements regarding both the execution and outcomes of the attack. He notes that the strike \u201cpassed entirely under the radar of the usual nightly exchange of fire between Iran and Israel,\u201d and was not acknowledged by either side until Trump announced it.\n\nFor the official account to hold, he argues, B-2 bombers\u2014aircraft the U.S. had previously avoided using in Yemen\u2014would have had to penetrate deep into Iranian territory, strike heavily fortified sites with gravity bombs, and return across hundreds of miles of monitored airspace without being detected, all while Iran\u2019s air defense systems remained operational.\n\nI think Trump tried to rescue Netanyahu from the consequences of his idiotic decision to start a war with Iran he manifestly wasn\u2019t capable of finishing, and do so in a manner the Iranians weren\u2019t going to be provoked into responding to in a major way. As an American taxpayer and former DoD employee, I would hope this wasn\u2019t the most impressive attack the U.S. military could put together on a week\u2019s notice, and it reflects deliberate restraint rather than a lack of capability.\u201d\n\nDespite extensive planning reportedly dating back to the Biden administration, including war-game scenarios focused on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, analysts have questioned the limited impact of Israel\u2019s strike. Furthermore, it has been revealed that senior Israeli officials had been preparing for the June 13 attack since March, and sought to strike before Iran \u201crebuilt its air defenses by the latter half of the year.\u201d\n\n\u2018Polite Fiction\u2019\n\nCNN\u2019s report on the leaked DIA assessment was quickly met with coordinated responses from across the U.S. government disputing its conclusions.\n\nFirst, a dedicated article was published on the White House website, \u201cIran\u2019s Nuclear Facilities Have Been Obliterated \u2014 and Suggestions Otherwise are Fake News.\u201d The article collated quotes from numerous high-ranking administration officials, including the President, and Israeli government and military apparatchiks, testifying to the attack\u2019s triumph. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fulminated, \u201cAnyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard separately issued statements declaring \u201cnew intelligence\u201d indicated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities had in fact been \u201cdestroyed\u201d by U.S. airstrikes. Neither provided any evidence to support this bold conclusion. Later that day, Politico revealed that the aggressive flurry of disavowal was a determined \u201cblitz\u201d by the administration, \u201cto counter media reports\u2026the strikes had not significantly set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d\n\nThe DIA leak reportedly provoked an angry response from Trump, leading to federal investigations into the breach. Like many administrations, the White House and U.S. agencies have typically resisted admitting to failures in military operations. Nonetheless, the determination of so many officials to push back against any suggestions that the strike wasn\u2019t a historically ruinous cataclysm could point to a different motive than covering for Trump, or being forced to admit that Washington\u2019s once-vaunted military machine isn\u2019t what it once was.\n\nThe assertion that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been eliminated offers a convenient rationale for ending discussions that, even before the conflict, had reached an impasse and now appear permanently derailed. In the wake of Tel Aviv\u2019s strike, Iran canceled nuclear talks with the U.S. that had been scheduled for June 21 in Oman, citing what it called Israel\u2019s \u201cbarbarous\u201d actions, backed by Washington, as rendering the summit \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\nIf, as some analysts have suggested, the negotiations were never intended to succeed and successive U.S. administrations were aware of Israel\u2019s plans in advance, then Tehran has little reason to resume talks. In addition, Iranian officials have stated that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors will no longer be permitted entry to nuclear sites on Iranian soil.\n\nOn June 12, Press TV published documents exposing how the Association previously provided Israeli intelligence with the names of several Iranian nuclear scientists who were subsequently assassinated, and its chief, Rafael Grossi, enjoys a close, clandestine relationship with Israeli officials.\n\nDocuments released by Iran show that IAEA chief Grossi has been completely coordinated with Israel and has been carrying out Israel's orders.\n\n\n\nIran recently managed to obtain a wealth of secret documents from the Israeli regime. pic.twitter.com/iVz2V0oNh5 \u2014 Press TV \ud83d\udd3b (@PressTV) June 12, 2025\n\nUnder the terms of Tehran\u2019s July 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal with the Obama administration, the IAEA was granted unimpeded access to Iran\u2019s nuclear complexes to ensure the country was not using the facilities to develop weapons. Its inspectors collected a wealth of information on and in the sites, including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents.\n\nIt is an open question whether this intelligence bonanza was shared with the U.S. and Israel, and played any role in the 12-Day War. Iranian lawmakers aren\u2019t waiting for proof, and on June 25, they unanimously passed legislation to suspend cooperation with the Association indefinitely.\n\nExiting the Non-Proliferation Treaty is being openly debated in the Islamic Republic as well. Maintaining the narrative that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been eliminated may serve a strategic purpose for Washington, allowing it to argue against further diplomatic engagement. \u201cThe polite fiction that Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were destroyed is helpful to keep the peace,\u201d says Tyler Weaver.\n\n\u2018Beyond Themselves\u2019\n\nThe question of what happens next is likewise an open one. Alex McKay, of the Marx Engels Lenin Institute and Decline & Fall, notes that while \u201cthis latest regime change attempt is over, plots against Iran by the Anglo-American empire, and its Israeli proxy, will continue,\u201d as \u201cthe imperialist powers cannot countenance Iran being a sovereign, independent nation.\u201d\n\nHowever, he believes the \u201ctotal failure\u201d of the recent operation against the Islamic Republic cannot be understated, and left U.S.-Israeli weakness and vulnerability writ unambiguously large.\n\n\u201cOnce it became clear the hoped-for palace coup or color revolution wouldn\u2019t materialize, the U.S. was left without many options, and a number of unpalatable choices, McKay tells MintPress News.\n\nTo actually destroy the Islamic Republic would take a long-term military campaign, possibly including a ground invasion. The U.S. has avoided wars as dangerous as this would be ever since their defeat in Vietnam. Imperialist powers of the world prefer to wage their wars via air power, terrorist acts, proxy armies, espionage and cultural subversion.\u201d\n\nA large-scale air war against Iran \u201calso carried enormous risks,\u201d such as the Iranians closing the Strait of Hormuz or targeting oil infrastructure across the Gulf states hosting U.S. bases. Either approach would \u201clead to a spike in oil prices, and plunge the economies of imperialist nations into a deep recession,\u201d McKay observes. As it was, the 12-Day War led to a brief surge in oil prices, which reversed once the ceasefire commenced. Meanwhile, vessels traversing Hormuz are subject to \u201cintense levels of GPS jamming.\u201d\n\nSuch moves suggest that while Tehran\u2019s missile onslaught may be over, it is under no illusions that it effectively remains at war with Israel and Tel Aviv\u2019s Western puppetmasters, and must remain ever-vigilant as a result.\n\nIt is evident that this perspective is widely shared among Iranian citizens. Far from destabilizing and fracturing the country and triggering the revolutionary government\u2019s collapse, the population is more united than ever against Western powers. As one patriotic Iranian celebrated on \u2018X\u2019:\n\nWe are now aware of our shortcomings more than ever and in dire need of some changes. Iran\u2019s biggest achievement or gift wasn\u2019t on the battlefield but at home amongst the people, becoming as one. Younger generations who had not experienced\u2026the Revolution or the [war with Iraq] now tasted something beyond themselves. It gave them the identity they were longing for.\u201d\n\nShould Israel again attempt to foment all-out war with Iran, it will be up against an adversary far more prepared than this time round, with nigh-universal domestic support for total victory, which may mean Tel Aviv\u2019s final destruction, and the vanquishing of U.S. bases across West Asia. Tehran is also likely to emerge better armed, given that on June 26, China convened an emergency meeting with Iran and Russia\u2019s defense ministers. It is now up to Netanyahu to make the next move, which may be his very last.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

        "one_sentence_summary": "The article describes a 12-day conflict initiated by an Israeli military strike on Iran, which resulted in significant damage to both countries, failed to achieve its objectives, and highlighted vulnerabilities in Israel's defenses while strengthening Iran's position and unity.",
        "paragraph_summary": "On June 13, 2025, Israel launched a military strike on Iran, targeting military and nuclear sites with jets, Mossad-run sleeper cells, and drones, resulting in the deaths of numerous nuclear scientists and military commanders. The attack, described as unprovoked by international observers, led to a fierce Iranian missile retaliation that caused significant damage in Tel Aviv and Haifa, exposing vulnerabilities in Israel's defense systems. The conflict, dubbed the \"12 Day War,\" saw the U.S. enter the fray, targeting Iranian nuclear sites, though claims of obliterating Iran's nuclear program were quickly contested. The war ended with a ceasefire, leaving Israel and the U.S. facing criticism for their handling of the conflict, while Iran emerged more resilient and united. The war highlighted the fragility of Israel's military strategy and the potential for further geopolitical instability in the region, with implications for U.S.-Iran relations and the broader West Asian landscape.",

Please consider a tax-deductible donation.\n\nBy Jonathan Cook\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed predictable outrage at the weekend that the BBC had inadvertently broadcast punk band Bob Vylan leading crowds at Glastonbury in a chant of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d \u2013 the \u201cIsrael Defence Forces\u201d that have been responsible for slaughtering many tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza over the past 21 months.\n\nHe called the chant \u201cappalling hate speech\u201d \u2014 apparently unaware that there are far worse crimes than hating soldiers carrying out the mass slaughter of children. Those worse things, of course, include slaughtering children en masse.\n\nThe BBC apologised, calling the band\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d \u2013 more offensive, apparently, than Israel bombing and starving the children of Gaza.\n\n\"But have you heard this one tho\"\ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/7pNSRn0i6l \u2014 \u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0646\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0643\u064a (@aldnmarki) June 30, 2025\n\nGlastonbury\u2019s organisers condemned the chant, saying there was no space for \u201chate speech or antisemitism\u201d \u2014 apparently assuming, wrongly, that all Jews identify not just with the state of Israel but with an Israeli military widely accused by genocide experts of committing genocidal violence in Gaza.\n\nI\u2019m a British Jew in England\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t interpret #DeathToTheIDF as a call for people to kill me because\n\n\n\n1.

I\u2019m not brain dead \u2014 Stop The Bollocks with Mirabel (@MirabelTweets1) June 29, 2025\n\nPolice are investigating Bob Vylan, a musical duo, to see whether they have committed a criminal offence, or possibly a terrorist one. As far as we know, the same police are doing nothing to investigate some 10 British citizens known to have travelled abroad to join the Israeli military, the IDF, committing the Gaza genocide.\n\n[On Monday, the U.S. State Department cancelled the group\u2019s visas ahead of a U.S. tour scheduled to begin in the fall and United Talent Agency dropped the duo, according to The Hollywood Reporter.]\n\nOn Sunday, the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire grilled Starmer\u2019s health secretary, Wes Streeting, on remarks from the Israeli embassy in London condemning what it termed \u201cthe normalisation of extremist language\u201d and the \u201cglorification of violence\u201d at Glastonbury.\n\nUnexpectedly, Streeting avoided jumping whole-heartedly on the media outrage band-wagon, led by the Mail on Sunday, whose front page demanded the arrest of the two band members for what the paper wrongly described as a chant demanding \u201cDeath to Israelis\u201d.\n\nThe Mail, apparently, believes that all Israelis, presumably including the country\u2019s children, are currently serving in the Israeli military.\n\n\"I'd say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order\"\n\n\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting responds to Israel's claims on Glastonbury's \"glorification of violence\", saying \"Israeli settler terrorists\" carried out \"unwanton acts of violence\"#BBCLauraK https://t.co/v2HwddQuYE pic.twitter.com/DRoqBMrVM6 \u2014 BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) June 29, 2025\n\nThere are four important points to make about the interview between Derbyshire and Streeting:\n\n1. The Israeli embassy in London, like the Israeli government it represents, has precisely no concerns about the \u201cglorification of violence\u201d when Israel is doing either the glorifying or the violence.\n\nIsrael is currently celebrating its \u201csuccess\u201d in slaughtering and maiming hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, including huge numbers of children; attacks by its soldiers and state-backed Jewish settler militias on Palestinian civilians in the West Bank; its eradication of whole communities in Lebanon; and its bombing of residential tower blocks across Tehran, killing many hundreds.\n\nViolence has been Israel\u2019s signature policy for the past 21 months \u2014 and long before that. Israel has revelled in the carnage it has inflicted on populations across the region.\n\nIn a post on social media, the Israeli embassy additionally argued of Bob Vylan\u2019s chant:\n\n\u201cWhen speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out \u2014 especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms.\u201d\n\nAnd yet public figures from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Starmer have incited against the Palestinians, with Netanyahu comparing them to \u201cAmalek\u201d, a people the Israelites were commanded by God to exterminate, and Starmer terming the wholesale starvation of the people of Gaza an act by Israel of \u201cself-defence\u201d.\n\nIsraeli officials from Netanyahu down have advocated the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. And, even more seriously, Israel has not just threatened but repeatedly carried out the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under its belligerent rule.\n\n2. It is beyond ridiculous for the BBC to echo the Israeli government in prioritising a harsh crackdown on words at Glastonbury \u201cglorifying violence\u201d towards Israeli soldiers ahead of the actual violence of genocide being committed by those Israel soldiers.\n\nThe BBC has avoided criticising the Israeli government for its actual violence \u2014 its bombing and active starvation of Palestinian civilians \u2014 and the Starmer government for colluding in that violence, or what the International Court of Justice termed more than a year ago a \u201cplausible\u201d genocide by Israel.\n\nAs a recent report by the Centre for Media Monitoring confirmed, the BBC has dramatically skewed its language to present Israel, the aggressor, in a more favourable light than the victim, the Palestinians of Gaza. The BBC\u2019s own whistleblowing journalists have warned that the state broadcaster has all but banned the use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d, even by experts on the matter.\n\n[See: Jonathan Cook: The BBC\u2019s Complicity in Genocide]\n\nBy arming Israel, by organising spy flights over Gaza from RAF base Akrotiri on Cyprus, and by providing diplomatic cover, Starmer has effectively glorified Israel\u2019s slaughter of Palestinian children in the enclave.\n\nBob Vylan\u2019s chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d have a far more dangerous counterpart in Starmer\u2019s recital of Israel\u2019s \u201cright to defend itself\u201d when that \u201cdefence\u201d involves Israel mercilessly starving Gaza\u2019s population of food, water and power.\n\nBob Vylan are a punk band; Starmer is the British prime minister, the man who directs Britain\u2019s foreign policy and directs its army.\n\nNo one, least of all the BBC, has held Israeli or British officials accountable not just for glorifying violence but for actually carrying it out on an industrial scale for nearly two years.\n\nBut the BBC is suddenly interested in holding to account two punk musicians for leading a chant \u2014 one that made a symbolic, hypothetical threat of violence \u2014 against an Israeli military carrying out the ultimate form of violence, an actual genocide.\n\nIn a serious media, Israel\u2019s supposed \u201cconcerns\u201d about the glorification of violence and extremist language would be laughed off the stage rather than respectfully aired.\n\n3. Streeting is being congratulated and condemned in equal measure on social media for refusing to be drawn into the Mail and BBC\u2019s confected outrage. \u201cI\u2019d say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order,\u201d he responded to Derbyshire. But hang on a minute. Streeting\u2019s resistance to Derbyshire\u2019s line of questioning was perhaps unexpected. But it also, let us not forget, serves the interests of both the Starmer and Israeli governments.\n\nStreeting\u2019s insistence that Israel \u201cget its house in order\u201d had, as he made clear, nothing to do with its 21-month slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. Starmer is still defining the Gaza genocide as Israel\u2019s supposed \u201cright to defend itself.\u201d\n\nIn responding to Derbyshire, Streeting expressed concern only at what he called violent \u201csettler attacks\u201d in the West Bank. He said the Israeli embassy needed to \u201cget your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and the settlers in the West Bank.\u201d\n\nThis was intended purely as deflection, designed to serve Starmer and Israel, the West\u2019s key client state in the oil-rich Middle East. It benefits the U.K. government to make an issue of West Bank settler attacks \u2014 and present them as disorganised, random violence by individual extremists that the Israeli government is not responsible for but needs to get a firmer grip on.\n\nBy highlighting problems in the West Bank, the Starmer government can avoid addressing the genocide in Gaza and the Israeli state\u2019s clear responsibility for that genocide. Which is precisely why in recent weeks Britain has made so much noise about imposing feeble penalties on a handful of extremist settlers and two fascist ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s government that represent those settlers.\n\nStarmer and Streeting\u2019s prioritising of Israel\u2019s West Bank violence over Israel\u2019s Gaza violence is a switch and bait twice over.\n\nMost of the violence in the West Bank is not coming from settler extremists, even though they are the ones being punished by the U.K. It is coming from the Israeli military, which has bulldozed thousands of homes there over the past year, driving 40,000 Palestinians off their lands.\n\nFurther, settler violence is not random. It is coordinated with Israeli field commanders, many of them settlers themselves, to uproot Palestinians so that Israel can move in Jewish settlers to colonise the land \u2014 or, in the words of successive Israeli governments, \u201cJudaise\u201d it.\n\nNone of this is new either. Israel has engineered and imposed a violent, apartheid system on Palestinians for decades to make life unbearable and encourage them to leave their homeland.\n\nSecond, Glastonbury\u2019s anger-fuelled chant against the IDF was not primarily motivated by Israel\u2019s violent actions in the West Bank. It was against the Israeli military for committing a genocide in Gaza, which the British government has been supporting.\n\nStreeting\u2019s aim was to drag the debate on to safer territory for him and Starmer: that Britain needs to deal not with a genocide in Gaza but with a handful of violent loons in the West Bank.\n\nEven in criticising the Israeli government for not doing enough to tackle settler violence, Streeting is still operating within the confines of a public discourse dictated by Israel, which prefers any criticism to be directed at individuals not at the Israeli state behind those individuals.\n\n4. The BBC, the Starmer government and the Israel lobby are all delighted to play their part in this game of deflection and deception because these kinds of moral panics obscure the real issue: that all these parties are actively colluding in Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhile the media and government can now have a long backwards and forwards about whether criticism of Israel\u2019s genocidal army needs to be defined in law as a criminal offence or \u201cterrorism\u201d, Israel will get a free pass to continue with the real terrorism: a genocide in Gaza.\n\nFamously, the black civil rights fighter Malcolm X observed of the role of the media:\n\n\u201cThey have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that\u2019s power. \u2026 If you\u2019re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.\u201d\n\nSixty years on, nothing has changed.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

        "paragraph_summary": "The article discusses the controversy surrounding British punk-rap band Bob Vylan, who led a chant of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d at Glastonbury, which was inadvertently broadcast by the BBC. The chant sparked outrage from UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the BBC, who labeled it as hate speech, while Glastonbury organizers condemned it as antisemitism. The article criticizes the BBC and the UK government for focusing on the band's words rather than addressing the alleged genocide committed by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) against Palestinians in Gaza.

The article also notes that the U.S. State Department canceled Bob Vylan's visas, and their agency dropped them following the incident.

        "text": "Israeli Air Force fighter jets on their way to attack Iran, June 2025. / IDF Spokesperson\u2019s Unit\n\nIn one of the scariest moments in modern history, we're doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation.\n\nBy Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares / Other News\n\nThe attack by Israel and the US on Iran had two significant effects. First, it once again exposed the root cause of turmoil in the region: Israel\u2019s project to \u201creshape the Middle East\u201d through regime-change, aimed at maintaining its dominance and blocking a Palestinian state. Second, it highlighted the futility and recklessness of this strategy. The only path to peace is a comprehensive agreement that addresses Palestine\u2019s statehood, Israel\u2019s security, Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program, and the economic recovery of the region.\n\nIsrael wants to topple the Iranian government because Iran has supported proxies and non-state actors aligned with the Palestinians. Israel has also consistently undermined US-Iran diplomacy regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nInstead of endless wars, Israel\u2019s security can be ensured by two key diplomatic steps \u2013ending militancy by establishing a Palestinian state with UN Security Council guarantees, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful and verifiable nuclear program.\n\nThe far-right Israeli government\u2019s refusal to accept a Palestinian state is the root of the problem.\n\nWhen the British empire promised a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine in 1917, the Palestinian Arabs constituted 90% of the population and Jews less than 10% of the population. In 1947, with US intense lobbying, the UN General Assembly voted to grant 56% of Palestine to a new Zionist state, while the Jews were only 33% of the population. Palestinians rejected this as a violation of their right to self-determination. After the 1948 war, Israel expanded to 78% of Palestine, and in 1967, occupied the remaining 22%\u2014Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.\n\nInstead of returning occupied lands in exchange for peace, Israeli right-wing politicians insisted on permanent control of 100% of the land, with the Likud founding charter declaring in 1977 that there would be only Israeli sovereignty \u201cbetween the Sea and Jordan\u201d.\n\nNetanyahu represents this policy of domination \u2013 and has served as Prime Minister for a total of 17 years since 1996. When he came to power, he and his US neocon allies authored the \u201cClean Break\u201d strategy to block the creation of a Palestinian state. Instead of pursuing land for peace, Israel aimed to reshape the Middle East by overthrowing governments that supported the Palestinian cause. The US would be the implementing partner of this strategy.\n\nThis is exactly what happened after 9/11, as the US led or sponsored wars against Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon (U.S. funding and arming Israeli aggressions), Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (CIA operation during 2010\u2019s), Sudan (supporting rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011), and Somalia (backing Ethiopia\u2019s invasion in 2006).\n\nContrary to the glib promises by Netanyahu to the US Congress in 2002 \u2014 that regime change in Iraq would bring a new day to the Middle East \u2014 the 2003 Iraq War augured the events that were to come across the region. Iraq descended into turmoil, and since then, each new war has brought death, destruction, and economic disarray.\n\nThis month, Israel attacked Iran even as negotiations between Iran and the US were underway to ensure the peaceful use of Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2013 repeating the same WMD propaganda that Netanyahu used to justify the Iraq War.\n\nIsrael has been claiming for more than 30 years that Iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. However, on June 18, 2025, the IAEA Director General stated that there is \u201cno proof of a systematic effort\u201d by Iran to develop nuclear weapons. More to the point, Iran and the US were actively engaged in negotiations according to which the IAEA would monitor and verify the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nThe attack on Iran proves yet again the futility and nihilism of Netanyahu\u2019s approach. The Israeli and US attacks accomplished nothing positive. According to most analysts, Iran\u2019s enriched uranium remains intact, but is now in a secret location rather than under IAEA monitoring. In the meantime, with Israel\u2019s ongoing genocide in Gaza \u2013 neither peace nor security have been achieved.\n\nIsrael has driven the region to a 4,000-km swash of violence from Libya to Iran through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately aimed at preventing a State of Palestine by \u201cremaking\u201d the Middle East.\n\nThe solution is clear: it is time for the United States to recognize that its own strategic interests require a decisive break from partnering in Israel\u2019s destructive strategy.\n\nPrioritizing genuine peace in the Middle East is not only a moral imperative, but a fundamental U.S. interest\u2014one that can only be achieved through a comprehensive peace deal. The key pillar of this deal is for the US to lift its veto on a Palestinian State on the borders of 4 June 1967, and to do so at the start, not in some vague distant future that never actually arrives.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Arab nations have backed a practical peace plan. So too has the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), with its 57 member countries, and the League of Arab States (LAS), with its 22 members. So too have almost all the nations in the UN General Assembly. So too has the International Court of Justice in its 2024 ruling that Israel\u2019s occupation is illegal. Only Israel, with support from the US veto, has stood in the way.\n\nHere is a seven-point peace plan in which all parties would benefit. Israel would gain peace and security. Palestine would achieve statehood. Iran would win an end to economic sanctions. The US would win an end to costly and illegal wars fought on Israel\u2019s behalf, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation if the current violence continues. The Middle East would win economic development, security and justice.\n\n\u2013 First,an immediate ceasefire would apply across the entire region \u2013 and the ceasefire would include an immediate release of all hostages and prisoners.\n\n\u2013 Second, the UN Security Council would vote upfront to welcome Palestine as the 194th UN Member State on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel and Palestine could subsequently agree on mutually desired border adjustments.\n\n\u2013 Third,Israel would withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967. UN-mandated international forces would ensure a peaceful, orderly transition, a transfer of Palestinian territories to Palestinian authorities, and mutual security for both Israel and Palestine.\n\n\u2013 Fourth, the territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed for Lebanon, Syria, and all states in the region. All non-state armed groups would be demilitarized, and foreign troops would be withdrawn.\n\n\u2013 Fifth, the UN Security Council would adopt an updated nuclear agreement with Iran, including binding verification, and with all economic sanctions on Iran lifted alongside Iran\u2019s verified compliance with the peaceful uses of its nuclear program.\n\n\u2013 Sixth, Israel and all Arab and Islamic states would establish full diplomatic relations following the admission of the State of Palestine as UN member state.\n\n\u2013 Seventh, the Middle East nations would establish an international fund for rebuilding the war-torn parts of Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, with contributions coming from within the region and from external sources.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

Please consider a tax-deductible donation.\n\nBy Marjorie Cohn / Truthout\n\nContinuing in their shameful deference to the president, Donald Trump\u2019s lackeys on the Supreme Court once again affirmed the superiority of the executive over the other two branches of government. Last year, the high court ruled that presidents are immune from prosecution when they carry out official functions. Now, that same court has stripped federal judges of their authority to protect people throughout the nation when the president breaks the law.\n\nMore than two dozen nationwide (\u201cuniversal\u201d) injunctions blocking several of Trump\u2019s policies were in effect as of mid-May. Those policies include a more stringent voter ID requirement; a rule requiring that mail-in ballots be received by Election Day; an effort to freeze $3 trillion in federal spending to review whether the disbursement of those funds aligned with administration policies; a demand that public schools eliminate DEI programs or risk losing some of the $75 billion in federal funds; and allowing over 25,000 children to enter deportation proceedings without lawyers.\n\nTrump v. CASA, Inc. came to the Supreme Court as a challenge to Trump\u2019s January 20 executive order purporting to unilaterally outlaw the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship. But in its June 27 ruling, the high court didn\u2019t actually decide the citizenship issue, which they kicked back to the lower federal courts.\n\nInstead, in a shocking decision, the Supreme Court held that federal judges cannot issue universal injunctions for actions that are almost certainly illegal. \u201cNever before has the Supreme Court imposed such restrictions on the ability of courts to provide relief against unconstitutional acts,\u201d Berkeley Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky wrote in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted the request by the Trump administration to partially pause three federal court rulings that had blocked Trump\u2019s executive order. Those courts had determined that only nationwide injunctions would provide the plaintiffs with complete relief because people constantly move in and out of states, and children born to noncitizen parents in a non-plaintiff state may later reside in a plaintiff state, and vice versa.\n\nTrump will likely continue to be barred from enforcing his order against the pregnant plaintiffs who challenged it. But the decision could affect any case in which a federal judge makes a ruling that encompasses people beyond the individuals who actually filed the lawsuit. The Supreme Court left open the question of whether courts could block government actions nationwide when there is no narrower judicial approach possible.\n\nTrump\u2019s Executive Order Purports to End Birthright Citizenship\n\nSection 1 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \u2014 known as the \u201cCitizenship Clause\u201d \u2014 reads, \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d Congress codified the Citizenship Clause in the Nationality Act of 1940.\n\nIn the 1898 landmark decision of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court held that the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to virtually all individuals born in the U.S. with exceptions for children of foreign diplomats or enemy occupiers. Although Wong Kim Ark included children in Indigenous tribes as an additional exception, Congress explicitly granted citizenship to them in the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order says that, beginning on February 19, 2025, children born in the U.S. will no longer be treated as citizens if their mothers were not in the U.S. lawfully and their fathers were not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. It also denies citizenship to children whose mothers were legally in the country on a temporary basis (such as under the Visa Waiver Program, or with a student, tourist, or work visa) and whose fathers were neither citizens nor lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe order would deny about 255,000 children nationwide their birthright to citizenship each year. It would also effectively cut federal funding for foster care services for neglected and abused children, as well as early interventions for infants, toddlers, and students who have disabilities.\n\nOn January 21, 22 states sued Trump and some of his department officials in a U.S. district court in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs requested a declaration that Trump\u2019s order violates the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and U.S. laws, and they sought an injunction preventing its enforcement.\n\nSimilar lawsuits were filed in the states of Washington and Maryland. In all three cases, federal district judges granted injunctions and blocked the operation of Trump\u2019s order nationwide while the legal issue worked its way through the courts. U.S. District Court Judge John C. Coughenour in the Western District of Washington called the executive order \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d The First, Fourth, and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals denied the Trump administration\u2019s requests to stay the injunctions.\n\nThirty days after the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Trump\u2019s executive order could go into effect for people in the 28 states that haven\u2019t challenged it in court, unless those individual parents hire lawyers to mount their own legal challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Government Is Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm\u201d\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the radical right-wing majority of the Supreme Court overturned the injunctions. They didn\u2019t rule on whether Trump\u2019s executive order was constitutional. Instead, they held that federal judges cannot prevent him from implementing it on a nationwide basis.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, writing for herself, Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, admitted, \u201cNo one disputes that the Executive has a duty to follow the law.\u201d Nevertheless, the majority held, \u201cNothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a century thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal courts lack authority to issue them.\u201d\n\nThe majority said that \u201cthe Government is likely to suffer irreparable harm from the District Courts\u2019 entry of injunctions that likely exceed the authority conferred by the Judiciary Act.\u201d\n\nBarrett admitted that a \u201cpatchwork injunction\u201d would \u201cprove unworkable\u201d because \u201c[c]hildren often move across state lines or are born outside their parents\u2019 State of residence.\u201d But the majority left it to lower courts to decide whether a \u201cnarrower\u201d freeze would be \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling anticipated proceedings in the lower courts about how much the injunctions should be narrowed for the plaintiffs. The majority suggested class-action lawsuits to challenge Trump\u2019s order on behalf of groups of affected plaintiffs who were not parties to the three pending cases.\n\n\u201cNo Right Is Safe in the New Legal Regime the Court Creates\u201d\n\nResponding to the new condition for citizenship Trump created in his executive order, Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her powerful dissent, in which she was joined by Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan: \u201cBesides birth, there is only one condition: that one be \u2018subject to the jurisdiction\u2019 of the United States. Yet that condition too leaves no room for ambiguity. To be \u2018subject to the jurisdiction\u2019 of the United States means simply to be bound to its authority and its laws.\u201d\n\nSotomayor charged that \u201cthis Court endorses the radical proposition that the President is harmed, irreparably, whenever he cannot do something he wants to do, even if what he wants to do is break the law.\u201d\n\nThe government \u201cfalls well short of satisfying its burden to show that it will likely suffer irreparable harm absent a stay and that it will likely succeed on the merits of its challenge to the scope of the injunctions,\u201d the dissent says. In fact, the notion that the executive branch would be \u201cirreparably harmed by injunctions that direct it to continue following settled law,\u201d Sotomayor wrote, \u201cstrains credulity.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it is pregnant people whose children would lose the benefits of citizenship under Trump\u2019s order who would suffer irreparable harm. The majority, Sotomayor wrote, \u201cdoes not contend otherwise.\u201d\n\nSotomayor also noted that the government didn\u2019t ask the Supreme Court to rule that Trump\u2019s executive order is constitutional, which would be \u201can impossible task in light of the Constitution\u2019s text, history, this Court\u2019s precedents, federal law, and Executive Branch practice.\u201d\n\nInstead, Sotomayor wrote, the government \u201ctries its hand at a different game. It asks this Court to hold that, no matter how illegal a law or policy, courts can never simply tell the Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone. \u2026 This Court\u2019s precedent establishes beyond a shade of doubt that the Executive Order is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nSotomayor notes that the majority didn\u2019t identify a single case from the founding era to the present in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts cannot issue \u201cuniversal injunctions or broad equitable relief that extends to nonparties.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,\u201d according to the dissent. \u201cToday, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\u201d\n\nThe Ruling Is an \u201cExistential Threat to the Rule of Law\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s effort to abolish universal injunctions \u201cis, at bottom, a request for this Court\u2019s permission to engage in unlawful behavior,\u201d Jackson wrote in her separate dissent. She calls the majority\u2019s decision \u201can existential threat to the rule of law,\u201d adding, \u201cWith deep disillusionment, I dissent.\u201d\n\nThe consequence of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling is that only children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents who have filed separate lawsuits stand a chance of enjoying their constitutional right to birthright citizenship, she noted.\n\nJackson said that economic status will determine whether individuals can vindicate their constitutional rights going forward. \u201cThe wealthy and the well connected will have little difficulty securing legal representation, going to court, and obtaining injunctive relief in their own name if the Executive violates their rights,\u201d she wrote. But \u201cthe zone of lawlessness the majority has now authorized will disproportionately impact the poor, the uneducated, and the unpopular \u2014 i.e., those who may not have the wherewithal to lawyer up, and will all too often find themselves beholden to the Executive\u2019s whims.\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling Will Lead to a \u201cScattershot System\u201d\n\nIn his concurrence, Kavanaugh admits that \u201cthe regular movement of the American people into and out of different States and regions, would make it difficult to sensibly maintain such a scattershot system of federal law.\u201d\n\nMore than 300 lawsuits have been filed to block Trump\u2019s executive orders since the beginning of his second term. Federal judges have halted or limited many of his actions. But the high court has allowed several of them to continue while the legal issues they raise are pending.\n\nNow separate lawsuits would have to be filed in all 94 federal districts in order to challenge the constitutionality of executive orders or federal laws.\n\nClass-Action Lawsuits\n\nThe Supreme Court suggests that people can file class-action lawsuits in lieu of seeking universal injunctions. Class actions allow groups or individual plaintiffs to bring a lawsuit on behalf of a larger class of individuals who have been victims of similar government policies.\n\nKavanaugh cited the possibility of \u201cstatewide, regionwide or even nationwide\u201d class action relief. But in order to be certified as a class, plaintiffs must satisfy several statutory hurdles.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, two new class-action lawsuits were filed to temporarily block Trump\u2019s order from applying to members of the \u201cputative class\u201d of people who would be impacted by it. Both suits alleged that the order violates the 14th Amendment and the Nationality Act of 1940.\n\nCasa, Inc.; Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, Inc.; and expectant and recent mothers filed in Maryland for a class action. Plaintiffs proposed a class definition of: \u201cAll children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.\u201d\n\nAs the plaintiffs wrote:\n\nAbsent citizenship, children born to noncitizens, including the children of Plaintiffs, Members, and members of the putative class, may be subject to deportation. These children may therefore be forced to leave the country of their birth to travel to a place where they have never been, where they may have no family or legal ties, and, in the worst cases, where they may face torture, persecution, and death.\n\nIn the other case, the national ACLU, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU of Massachusetts, Legal Defense Fund, Asian Law Caucus, and Democracy Defenders Fund filed a class-action lawsuit in New Hampshire on behalf of a proposed class of babies subject to Trump\u2019s order, as well as their parents. Their proposed class includes:\n\nAll current and future persons who are born on or after February 20, 2025, where (1) that person\u2019s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person\u2019s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, or (2) that person\u2019s mother\u2019s presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person\u2019s father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person\u2019s birth, as well as the parents (including expectant parents) of those persons.\n\nBoth lawsuits cited facts showing that they met the numerous requirements for class certification, which are set forth in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(g).\n\nEven if the class is certified and the plaintiffs prevail, other class members would not automatically benefit the way they would after a nationwide injunction. They would still have to hire a lawyer and prove to the court that they are entitled to relief as a class member.\n\nProject 2025 created a blueprint for Trump\u2019s autocratic state and he has moved quickly and decisively to implement it. The Supreme Court granted presidents immunity from prosecution for official acts. And the high court has now ruled that federal courts are powerless to stop executive branch lawbreaking on a nationwide basis.\n\nBut the resistance will continue to grow as the repression increases. Between 4 and 6 million people participated in the June 14 \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests. People are resisting \u2013 not only in the courts, but in the media, in Congress, and in the streets.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

        "paragraph_summary": "The article by Marjorie Cohn, published on Truthout, criticizes the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to limit the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against executive actions, particularly those deemed unconstitutional. The ruling emerged from a case challenging former President Donald Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents. The Supreme Court's conservative majority, led by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that such injunctions exceed judicial authority, leaving the question of nationwide relief to lower courts. This decision, according to dissenting justices like Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, poses a threat to constitutional rights and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations unable to afford legal representation. The ruling has sparked new class-action lawsuits and widespread protests, as critics argue it undermines the rule of law and enables executive overreach. The article underscores the importance of independent journalism and calls for public support to continue exposing such critical issues.",

        "text": "Starved for Peace \u2013 by Mr. Fish\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost\n\nIsrael\u2019s weaponization of starvation is how genocides always end. I covered the insidious effects of orchestrated starvation in the Guatemalan Highlands during the genocidal campaign of Gen. Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt, the famine in southern Sudan that left a quarter of a million dead \u2014 I walked past the frail and skeletal corpses of families lining roadsides \u2014 and later during the war in Bosnia when Serbs cut off food supplies to enclaves such as Srebrencia and Gora\u017ede.\n\nStarvation was weaponized by the Ottoman Empire to decimate the Armenians. It was used to kill millions of Ukrainians in the Holodomor in 1932 and 1933. It was employed by the Nazis against the Jews in the ghettos in World War II. German soldiers used food, as Israel does, like bait. They offered three kilograms of bread and one kilogram of marmalade to lure desperate families in the Warsaw Ghetto onto transports to the death camps. \u201cThere were times when hundreds of people had to wait in line for several days to be \u2018deported,\u2019\u201d Marek Edelman writes in \u201cThe Ghetto Fights.\u201d \u201cThe number of people anxious to obtain the three kilograms of bread was such that the transports, now leaving twice daily with 12,000 people, could not accommodate them all.\u201d And when crowds became unruly, as in Gaza, the German troops fired deadly volleys that ripped through emaciated husks of women, children and the elderly.\n\nThis tactic is as old as warfare itself.\n\nThe report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, that Israeli soldiers are ordered to shoot into crowds of Palestinians at aid hubs, with 580 killed and 4,216 wounded, is not a surprise. It is the predictable denouement of the genocide, the inevitable conclusion to a campaign of mass extermination.\n\nIsrael, with its targeted assassinations of at least 1,400 health care workers, hundreds of United Nations (U.N.) workers, journalists, police and even poets and academics, its obliteration of multi-story apartment blocks wiping out dozens of families, its shelling of designated \u201chumanitarian zones\u201d where Palestinians huddle under tents, tarps or in the open air, its systematic targeting of U.N. food distribution centers, bakeries and aid convoys or its sadistic sniper fire that guns down children, long ago illustrated that Palestinians are regarded as vermin worthy only of annihilation.\n\nThe blockade of food and humanitarian aid, imposed on Gaza since March 2, is reducing Palestinians to abject dependence. To eat, they must crawl towards their killers and beg. Humiliated, terrified, desperate for a few scraps of food, they are stripped of dignity, autonomy and agency. This is by intent.\n\nYousef al-Ajouri, 40, explained to Middle East Eye his nightmarish journey to one of four aid hubs set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The hubs are not designed to meet the needs of the Palestinians, who once relied on 400 aid distribution sites, but to lure them from northern Gaza to the south. Israel, which on Sunday again ordered Palestinians to leave northern Gaza, is steadily expanding its annexation of the coastal strip. Palestinians are corralled like livestock into narrow metal chutes at distribution points which are overseen by heavily armed mercenaries. They receive, if they are one of the fortunate few, a small box of food.\n\nAl-Ajouri, who before the genocide was a taxi driver, lives with his wife, seven children and his mother and father in a tent in al-Saraya, near the middle of Gaza City. He set out to an aid hub at Salah al-Din Road near the Netzarim corridor, to find some food for his children, who he said cry constantly \u201cbecause of how hungry they are.\u201d On the advice of his neighbor in the tent next to him, he dressed in loose clothing \u201cso that I could run and be agile.\u201d He carried a bag for canned and packaged goods because the crush of the crowds meant \u201cno one was able to carry the boxes the aid came in.\u201d\n\nHe left at about 9 p.m. with five other men \u201cincluding an engineer and a teacher,\u201d and \u201cchildren aged 10 and 12.\u201d They did not take the official route designated by the Israeli army. The massive crowds converging on the aid point along the official route ensure that most never get close enough to receive food. Instead, they walked in the darkness in areas exposed to Israeli gunfire, often having to crawl to avoid being seen.\n\n\u201cAs I crawled, I looked over, and to my surprise, saw several women and elderly people taking the same treacherous route as us,\u201d he explained. \u201cAt one point, there was a barrage of live gunfire all around me. We hid behind a destroyed building. Anyone who moved or made a noticeable motion was immediately shot by snipers. Next to me was a tall, light-haired young man using the flashlight on his phone to guide him. The others yelled at him to turn it off. Seconds later, he was shot. He collapsed to the ground and lay there bleeding, but no one could help or move him. He died within minutes.\u201d\n\nHe passed six bodies along the route who had been shot dead by Israeli soldiers.\n\nAl-Ajouri reached the hub at 2 a.m., the designated time for aid distribution. He saw a green light turned on ahead of him which signaled that aid was about to be distributed. Thousands began to run towards the light, pushing, shoving and trampling each other. He fought his way through the crowd until he reached the aid.\n\n\u201cI started feeling around for the aid boxes and grabbed a bag that felt like rice,\u201d he said. \u201cBut just as I did, someone else snatched it from my hands. I tried to hold on, but he threatened to stab me with his knife. Most people there were carrying knives, either to defend themselves or to steal from others. Eventually, I managed to grab four cans of beans, a kilogram of bulgur, and half a kilogram of pasta. Within moments, the boxes were empty. Most of the people there, including women, children and the elderly, got nothing. Some begged others to share. But no one could afford to give up what they managed to get.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. contractors and Israeli soldiers overseeing the mayhem laughed and pointed their weapons at the crowd. Some filmed with their phones.\n\n\u201cMinutes later, red smoke grenades were thrown into the air,\u201d he remembered. \u201cSomeone told me that it was the signal to evacuate the area. After that, heavy gunfire began. Me, Khalil and a few others headed to al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat because our friend Wael had injured his hand during the journey. I was shocked by what I saw at the hospital. There were at least 35 martyrs lying dead on the ground in one of the rooms. A doctor told me they had all been brought in that same day. They were each shot in the head or chest while queuing near the aid center. Their families were waiting for them to come home with food and ingredients. Now, they were corpses.\u201d\n\nGHF is a Mossad-funded creation of Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry that contracts with UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, run by former members of the CIA and U.S. Special Forces. GHF is headed by Rev. Johnnie Moore, a far-right Christian Zionist with close ties to Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. The organization has also contracted anti-Hamas drug-smuggling gangs to provide security at aid sites.\n\nAs Chris Gunness, a former spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) told Al Jazeera, GHF is \u201caid washing,\u201d a way to mask the reality that \u201cpeople are being starved into submission.\u201d\n\nIsrael, along with the U.S. and European countries that provide weapons to sustain the genocide, have chosen to disregard the January 2024 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which demanded immediate protection for civilians in Gaza and widespread provision of humanitarian assistance.\n\nHaaretz, in its article headlined \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a Killing Field\u2019: IDF Soldiers Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian Aid\u201d reported that Israeli commanders order soldiers to open fire on crowds to keep them away from aid sites or disperse them.\n\n\u201cThe distribution centers typically open for just one hour each morning,\u201d Haaretz writes. \u201cAccording to officers and soldiers who served in their areas, the IDF fires at people who arrive before opening hours to prevent them from approaching, or again after the centers close, to disperse them. Since some of the shooting incidents occurred at night \u2014 ahead of the opening \u2014 it\u2019s possible that some civilians couldn\u2019t see the boundaries of the designated area.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a killing field,\u201d one soldier told Haaretz. \u201cWhere I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day. They\u2019re treated like a hostile force \u2014 no crowd-control measures, no tear gas \u2014 just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Then, once the center opens, the shooting stops, and they know they can approach. Our form of communication is gunfire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe open fire early in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters away, and sometimes we just charge at them from close range. But there\u2019s no danger to the forces,\u201d the soldier explained, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of a single instance of return fire. There\u2019s no enemy, no weapons.\u201d\n\nHe said the deployment at the aid sites is known as \u201cOperation Salted Fish,\u201d a reference to the Israeli name for the children\u2019s game \u201cRed light, green light.\u201d The game was featured in the first episode of the South Korean dystopian thriller Squid Game, in which financially desperate people are killed as they battle each other for money.\n\nIsrael has obliterated the civilian and humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza. It has reduced Palestinians, half a million of whom face starvation, into desperate herds. The goal is to break Palestinians, to make them malleable and entice them to leave Gaza, never to return.\n\nThere is talk from the Trump White House about a ceasefire. But don\u2019t be fooled. Israel has nothing left to destroy. Its saturation bombing over 20 months has reduced Gaza to a moonscape. Gaza is uninhabitable, a toxic wilderness where Palestinians, living amid broken slabs of concrete and pools of raw sewage, lack food and clean water, fuel, shelter, electricity, medicine and an infrastructure to survive. The final impediment to the annexation of Gaza are the Palestinians themselves. They are the primary target. Starvation is the weapon of choice.\n\nNOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is now no way left for me to continue to write a weekly column for ScheerPost and produce my weekly television show without your help.

        "paragraph_summary": "In his article \"Starved for Peace,\" Chris Hedges discusses the use of starvation as a weapon in conflicts, focusing on the situation in Gaza. He draws parallels between historical instances of weaponized starvation, such as the genocides in Guatemala, Sudan, Armenia, Ukraine, and during the Holocaust, and the current Israeli blockade on Gaza. Hedges describes the dire conditions faced by Palestinians, who are forced to risk their lives to obtain food from aid hubs controlled by Israeli forces and contractors. He criticizes the international community, particularly the U.S. and European countries, for ignoring the International Court of Justice's ruling to protect Gaza's civilians. Hedges argues that the blockade and destruction of Gaza's infrastructure aim to force Palestinians to leave the region, framing starvation as a deliberate tactic to achieve this goal.

        "text": "Photo of solar panels on roofs, Wuxi Shi, Jiangsu Sheng, China, by Ming Z: https://www.pexels.com/photo/solar-panels-on-roofs-9731105/\n\nBy Juan Cole / Informed Comment\n\nAnn Arbor (Informed Comment) \u2013 According to Asia Society Policy Institute Senior Fellow Lauri Myllyvirta, China installed 93 gigawatts of solar in May, along with 27 gigawatts of wind. She points out that this is equivalent to 100 solar panels being put in every second.\n\nChina has passed the 1 terrawatt milestone for installed solar capacity, says Vincent Shaw at PV Magazine. The US only had a fourth or so of that by the end of last year. Shaw writes that \u201cFrom January to May, new solar installations totaled 197.85 GW, up 388.03% from the same period last year.\u201d He explains this incredible ramping up of solar power as being the result of government policies. Green energy has grown so fast that China\u2019s emissions are falling for the first time in the industrial era.\n\nThe US installed an average of 4 gigawatts of solar per month in 2024. But that fell to about 3.6 gigs per month the first quarter of this year. Falling is going backward. This decline will steepen dramatically with the passage of Trump\u2019s obese hideous tax bill Saturday night.\n\nLet\u2019s just put it out there in black and white. China was already kicking our asses before we chose to commit national energy suicide.\n\nChina is already installing 25 times as much solar as America each month. We will now certainly fall farther and farther behind Beijing.\n\nBack when I was a kid, the US was perceived to have a \u201cmissile gap\u201d with the Soviet Union, which put a scare into the Washington elite. Friends, there is a solar gap.\n\nA solar gap is much more dangerous than a missile gap \u2014 which wasn\u2019t real anyway, just more Washington paranoia. The country that makes the world\u2019s solar panels is going to be the powerhouse of the twenty-first century, since the whole world will electrify in the coming three decades. It will do so ever more urgently as Nature brings down the hammer with ever greater brutality as a result of our burning coal, fossil gas and petroleum, causing climate breakdown. Solar energy will be increasingly popular, as in Pakistan, because it is cheap. But it will also be actively promoted in much of the world because the alternative is dangerous carbon dioxide emissions, which cost the world some $417 billion in climate-related disasters last year, and cost the US alone $182 billion. Since our property is more highly valued than that in much of the rest of the world, hurricanes, floods, storm surges, erosion and wildfires do more dollar damage here.\n\nWho is going to supply Asia\u2019s 4.8 billion people with solar energy? On present evidence it will be China. Who is going to supply Africa\u2019s 1.5 billion people (who will grow to 3.8 billion by 2100) with solar panels? China. Who is going to supply the nearly 700 million people of Latin America and the Caribbean? China. Europe is the only economy that now has the scientific, technological and industrial capacity to compete in this industry, and signs aren\u2019t good there, either. China is deigning to open some solar panel factories in places like France, and while that will help the French economy, China will repatriate the profits to Beijing.\n\nThe estimates for the value of the global solar energy market are all over the place, but something on the order of $200 billion is plausible today. It is projected to reach $600 billion by 2030, in only 5 years. The Chinese have 80% of the industry now, and they may well still have that five years from now. Certainly, Trump\u2019s America won\u2019t be competing seriously in that space.\n\nChina is emerging as the world\u2019s first electrostate, the advanced superpower of this century, which could well be the Chinese century. Trump\u2019s doddering old tattered America, blighted with toxic fracking pools and oil spills, crowned with opulence for the carbon-farting millionaires in their gated communities and with penury for harried workers in the minimum-wage strip malls selling poisonous micro-plastics as their wares, is staggering into the new century on arthritic knees, packing useless high-tech side-arms for a contest it has already lost.\n\nPlease share this story and help us grow our network!\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!! DJT,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\n\nAccording to Israel Hayom, the Israeli security cabinet is expected to hold a meeting on Sunday night to discuss the prospect of a Gaza deal, but one that would involve only a temporary ceasefire, an idea that\u2019s been repeatedly rejected by Hamas. The Palestinian group\u2019s long-standing position is that it\u2019s willing to release the remaining Israelis in exchange for a permanent ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nSources close to Netanyahu told Israel Hayom that the Israeli leader hasn\u2019t given up on his goals and that ending the war isn\u2019t under consideration. Israeli officials are discussing the idea of a deal previously put forward by US special envoy Steve Witkoff that would free some captives, followed by a return to military operations.\n\nMahmoud Mardawi, a senior Hamas official, said on Sunday that Netanyahu doesn\u2019t want a deal because he is putting forward \u201cimpossible conditions\u201d and is insisting on selecting the names of 10 Israeli hostages to be released instead of all of them.\n\nThe report said that IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir favors a temporary truce to allow the Israeli military to regroup for further operations. Several ministers in the cabinet are opposed to the idea because they fear that a temporary deal could become permanent.\n\nWhile Trump is calling for a deal, there\u2019s no sign that he\u2019s putting any pressure on Netanyahu to reach one, which he could do by leveraging US military aid since it\u2019s required for the IDF to maintain operations in Gaza. Instead, Trump is strongly backing Netanyahu by demanding an end to his corruption trial and hinting that US military aid could be at risk if it continues.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year, far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this,\u201d Trump said in a post on Saturday. The president also claimed that Netanyahu was attempting to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nIn an analysis published by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the author, Amir Tibon, said that in order to reach a deal in Gaza, Trump must pressure Netanyahu, but instead he is \u201ccoddling\u201d the Israeli leader.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s claim that the Netanyahu trial is somehow an impediment to the hostage deal doesn\u2019t hold water,\u201d Tibon wrote. \u201cThe main obstacle to a hostage and ceasefire deal was, has been and continues to be Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to end the war. Hamas hasn\u2019t budged on this demand in the last 100 days, despite heavy losses in Gaza and the killing of some of its last remaining senior leaders.\u201d\n\nPlease share this story and help us grow our network!\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

        "text": "By Chris Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report\n\nThis article is read by Eunice Wong, a Juilliard-trained actor, featured on Audible\u2019s list of Best Women Narrators. Her work is on the annual Best Audiobooks lists of the New York Times, Audible, AudioFile, & Library Journal. www.eunicewong.actor\n\nText originally published May 26, 2025\n\nFull text:\n\nThere are few differences between the lies told to ignite the war with Iraq and the lies told to ignite a war with Iran. The assessments of our intelligence agencies and international bodies are, as they were during the calls to invade Iraq, airily dismissed for hallucinations.\n\nAll the old tropes have been resurrected to entice us into another military fiasco. A country that poses no threat to us, or to its neighbors, is on the verge of acquiring a Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD) that imperils our existence. The country and its leaders embody pure evil. Freedom and democracy are at stake. If we do not act now the next smoking gun will be a mushroom cloud. Our military superiority assures victory. We are the saviors of the world. Massive bombing, an updated version of Shock and Awe, will bring peace and harmony.\n\nWe heard these canards leading up to the 2003 war in Iraq. Twenty-two years later they have been resurrected. Anyone who advocates for negotiations, for diplomacy and peace, is a stooge for terrorists.\n\nDid we learn any lessons from the fiascos in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, not to mention Ukraine?\n\nAll the ghouls who sold us these past wars on false pretenses, such as conservative talk show host Mark Levin, Max Boot \u2014 who writes, \u201cthat strategic imperative argues for bombing Fordow,\u201d where Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program is buried underground \u2014 David Frum, John Bolton, Gen. Jack Keane, Newt Gingrich, Sean Hannity and Thomas Friedman, have returned to saturate the airwaves with breathless fearmongering.\n\nNever mind that their grand plan to topple the Taliban in Afghanistan and then invade and replace the regimes in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia \u2014 and finally in Iran \u2014 blew up in their faces. Never mind that their lust for war left hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions dead and drained trillions from the U.S. Treasury. Never mind the sheer idiocy of their arguments. Their megaphones are secure. They are dutiful shills for the war industry, brain dead neoconservatives and genocidal Zionists, who believe in the magical regeneration of the world through violence, ignoring catastrophe after catastrophe.\n\nForget the intelligence community\u2019s Annual Threat Assessment that \u201cIran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003,\u201d something reiterated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi this week. Forget that Benjamin Netanyahu, for almost three decades, has been breathlessly warning that Iran is on the cusp of producing a nuclear weapon. Forget that the preemptive attack on Iran by Israel is a war crime, not to mention the bombings of a hospital, ambulance and journalists. Forget the hundreds of Iranian civilians Israel has slaughtered in its waves of airstrikes. Forget that Israel launched its attack on Iran as the sixth round of negotiations on nuclear enrichment between the U.S. and Iran were set to take place in Oman. Forget that it is the Israeli prime minister, not the leader of Iran, who is subject to an arrest warrant, accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Forget that Israel, in the midst of carrying out a campaign of genocide against the Palestinians, possesses at least 90 nuclear weapons \u2014 built in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) \u2014 and blocks inspections by the IAEA. Forget that Donald Trump ripped up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, an agreement to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which Iran was abiding by. Forget that Washington and London orchestrated the 1953 coup to topple Iran\u2019s democratically elected government, the first in the region, and installed the compliant Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi into power. Forget that the U.S., along with Israel, trained and equipped the SAVAK, the Shah\u2019s savage secret police.\n\nBomb! Bomb! Bomb!\n\nIran\u2019s purported nuclear weapons program is the evidence-free equivalent of Saddam Hussein\u2019s mythical WMDs and alliance with Al-Qaeda.\n\nThe invasion and occupation of Iraq, which led to the deaths of over 4,000 U.S. soldiers and Marines and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, resulted in widespread destruction, regional instability and gave birth to a range of fanatical extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The assurances \u2014 that our invasion would implant democracy in Baghdad, which would emanate outwards across the Middle East, that we would be greeted as liberators and that the oil revenues would pay for the reconstruction \u2014 were a fantasy dreamed up by the George W. Bush administration and Washington think tanks. These shills for endless war do not grasp the mechanism or the consequences of war. They are culturally, historically, and linguistically illiterate about the countries they attack. Iraq. Afghanistan. Libya. Syria. Iran. I doubt they can tell the difference.\n\nThese cheerleaders of war, once they are proven wrong, are adept at issuing mea culpas. They assure us of their good intentions. They did not mean to peddle disinformation. They only wanted to keep the world safe from \u201cevildoers\u201d and protect our national security. No one, even those within the Bush and now Trump administrations, are intentionally dishonest. It is not their fault if they act on flawed intelligence. The problem is one of judgment, not virtue. They are good people.\n\nBut this, perhaps, is the biggest lie. The intelligence assessments used to justify the war against Iraq were cooked up by a cabal of lunatic neoconservatives and rabid Zionists because they did not like the assessments of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other intelligence agencies. Now another cabal, dominated by Israel-firsters, is concocting bogus intelligence assessments to justify a war with Iran. These wars are not prosecuted in good faith. They are not based on a careful and rational assessment of verifiable intelligence. They are utopian visions severed from reality where our own intelligence agencies are ignored along with international bodies such as the United Nations, WMD inspectors or the IAEA.\n\nThe history of modern Iran is the history of a people battling tyrants propped up and funded by Western powers. The brutal crushing of legitimate democratic movements over the decades resulted in the 1979 revolution that brought the Iranian clerics to power. The new Islamic government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini championed Islam and argued for standing up to \u201carrogant\u201d world powers and their regional allies, who would oppress others \u2013 including Palestinians \u2013 to serve their own interests.\n\n\u201cThe central story of Iran over the last 200 years has been national humiliation at the hands of foreign powers who have subjugated and looted the country,\u201d Stephen Kinzer, the author of \u201cAll the Shah\u2019s Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror,\u201d told me. \u201cFor a long time the perpetrators were the British and Russians. Beginning in 1953, the United States began taking over that role. In that year, the American and British secret services overthrew an elected government, wiped away Iranian democracy, and set the country on the path to dictatorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, in the 1980s, the U.S. sided with Saddam Hussein in the Iran-Iraq war, providing him with military equipment and intelligence that helped make it possible for his army to kill hundreds of thousands of Iranians,\u201d Kinzer said. \u201cGiven this history, the moral credibility of the U.S. to pose as a promoter of democracy in Iran is close to nil.\u201d\n\nYou can see an interview I did with Kinzer about Iran here.\n\nHow would we react if Iran orchestrated a coup in the U.S. to replace an elected government with a brutal dictator, who for decades persecuted, assassinated and imprisoned democracy activists? How would we react if Iran armed and funded a neighboring state, as we did during the eight year war with Iraq, to wage war against us? How would we react if Iran shot down one of our passenger jets as did the USS Vincennes (CG49) \u2014 caustically nicknamed the \u201cRobocruiser\u201d by the crews of other American vessels \u2014 when in July 1988 it fired missiles at a commerical aircraft filled with Iranian civilians, killing all 290 passengers, including 66 children? How would we react if Iranian intelligence services sponsored terrorism within the U.S., as our and Israel\u2019s intelligence services do in Iran? How would we react if these state-sponsored terrorist attacks included suicide bombings, kidnappings, beheadings, sabotage and \u201ctargeted assassinations,\u201d of government officials, scientists and other Iranian leaders? How would we react if, like Israel, a country attacked us based on a hypothesis, an attack that is illegal under the U.N. charter, which forbids preemptive war?\n\nThe pimps of war who orchestrate these military fiascos have risen once again from the crypt. They migrate like zombies from administration to administration. They are ensconced in think tanks \u2014 Project for the New American Century, American Enterprise Institute, Foreign Policy Research Initiative, The Atlantic Council and The Brookings Institution \u2014 funded by corporations, the Israel lobby and the war industry. They are puppets jerked up and down by their masters, given megaphones by a bankrupt media, urging us forward from one quagmire to the next.\n\nThe old faces and the old lies are back, exhorting us into another nightmare.",

Hedges questions the moral authority of the U.S. to promote democracy in Iran, given its history of supporting oppressive regimes and military aggression. He warns against the influence of think tanks and media figures who continue to advocate for war, urging skepticism of their motives and the narratives they promote.",

According to Al Jazeera, at least three people were killed while waiting near a distribution site run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in the Netzarim Corridor, which separates northern Gaza from the rest of the Strip.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that 18 people were killed by an Israeli airstrike on a crowd of people in central Gaza\u2019s Deir el-Balah who were receiving aid from a Palestinian police unit that confiscated goods from gangs that looted aid trucks. The security unit, known as Sahm, is run by the Hamas-led Interior Ministry but includes other factions, including tribal groups.\n\nWitnesses told AP that the Sahm was handing out bags of flour and other goods when the strike hit the crowd. According to hospital officials, the bombing killed at least one child and seven members of the security unit. Israel has backed a gang in southern Gaza that was responsible for significant aid looting last year.\n\nThe strike on the security unit came after Israeli officials announced a halt to aid shipments over claims that Hamas was stealing aid, which has been denied by Palestinian clans in Gaza, who say armed men seen on aid trucks were providing security against looting.\n\nIsraeli strikes also pounded other targets across the Strip, and photos and videos from Gaza show many children among the dead and wounded.\n\nMedical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 15 people were killed in two separate Israeli attacks on Gaza City, including nine who were killed in the bombing of a school-turned-shelter for displaced Palestinians. In Khan Younis, southern Gaza, at least nine people were killed by strikes on a tent encampment, and five were killed by the bombing of a car.\n\nThe Health Ministry said the latest violence has brought the death toll since October 7, 2023, to 56,259 and the number of wounded to 132,458.

The IDF has even fired on Palestinians waiting to receive aid with drones and tanks.\n\nOne soldier explained to Haaretz, \u201cIt\u2019s a killing field.\u201d They added that the Israeli soldiers fired at the Palestinians even though the aid seekers did not present a threat.

Soldiers said some Palestinian militias backed by Tel Aviv have also fired on civilians, including the ISIS-linked Abu Shabab.\n\nOn Thursday, at least 18 Palestinians were killed by an Israeli air strike while attempting to receive aid that the Gaza police had recovered from looters.\n\nAt the beginning of March, Tel Aviv broke a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal with Hamas by cutting off all aid entering the Strip. Near the end of May, Israel began allowing the US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to distribute a limited amount of aid in Gaza.\n\nHuman rights groups warned that the GHF\u2019s distribution plan would be insufficient. Over the past week, children have died of deprivation. On Thursday, two infants at the Al-Nassar Hospital in Khan Younis died due to a lack of formula.\n\nThe US recently approved sending $30 million to the GHF. The leader of the GHF, Rev Johnny Moore, is a close ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe doctors who spoke with NBC News said that Israeli aid restrictions are the cause of the formula shortages that are now killing Gazan babies.\n\nPlease share this story and help us grow our network!\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: At a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible journalism is overwhelmingly the play thing of self-serving billionaires and their corporate scribes, alternatives of integrity are desperately needed, and ScheerPost is one of them.

The situation has been exacerbated by Israel's restrictions on aid, following a broken ceasefire with Hamas, leading to severe shortages and deaths, including infants due to lack of formula. Human rights groups have criticized the limited aid distribution plan by the US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which recently received $30 million in US aid. The foundation's leader, Rev Johnny Moore, is closely allied with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The article calls for support of independent journalism to continue reporting on such critical issues.",

Magnier \u2013 Vertaald door \u2013 Francis J.\n\nIn de nasleep van de aanvallen van 2025 op de nucleaire infrastructuur van Iran heeft Isra\u00ebl zich niet alleen aangemoedigd, maar is het ook van plan om de oorlog te gebruiken om de regionale orde op zijn eigen voorwaarden opnieuw vorm te geven. Hoewel de luchtaanvallen zijn gestopt, beginnen de geopolitieke naschokken nog maar net door het Midden-Oosten te galmen.\n\nDe aanvallen, die werden uitgevoerd in volledige co\u00f6rdinatie met \u2013 en resoluut gesteund door \u2013 de Amerikaanse militaire macht, vertraagden het Iraanse nucleaire programma zonder het te vernietigen. Maar de belangrijkste impact was politiek en leidde tot een cascade van verschuivingen in de hele regio.\n\nIn Libanon, waar de naoorlogse wederopbouw tot stilstand komt en de economie ongecontroleerd blijft kelderen, heeft Isra\u00ebl het moment aangegrepen. Isra\u00eblische troepen hebben hun aanvallen vanuit de lucht ge\u00efntensiveerd en hun territoriale bezetting uitgebreid tot buiten de al lang betwiste zones. Zonder zichtbare plannen voor terugtrekking en zonder diplomatieke beperkingen, lijkt de bezetting minder op een tijdelijke maatregel en meer op een strategische verschansing \u2013 een verschansing die is gekalibreerd om de feiten op de grond opnieuw vorm te geven terwijl Libanon te verdeeld en niet in staat is om te reageren en te streven naar de bevrijding van zijn gebieden.\n\nIn Iran hebben de laatste Isra\u00eblisch-Amerikaanse oorlog en de uitdaging voor de strategische afschrikking geleid tot een compromisloze reactie. Teheran heeft gezworen om niet alleen zijn nucleaire infrastructuur opnieuw op te bouwen, maar ook een hele defensieve doctrine die gericht is op de meest effectieve proliferatie van hypersonische raketten, asymmetrische allianties en een versnelde militair-industri\u00eble push in een race tegen de klok. Iran trekt zich niet terug, maar lijkt zich opnieuw af te stemmen op een confrontatie op korte en lange termijn.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

Magnier\n\nIn the aftermath of the June 2025 joint strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, Israel has emerged not only emboldened but intent on leveraging the war to reshape the regional order on its own terms. Though the air raids have ceased, the geopolitical aftershocks are only beginning to reverberate across the Middle East.\n\nExecuted in full coordination with\u2014and backed decisively by\u2014American military power, the strikes slowed down without destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. But their most significant impact has been political, triggering a cascade of shifts across the region. In Lebanon, where post-war reconstruction remains stalled and the economy continues its uncontrolled descent, Israel has seized the moment. Israeli forces have intensified their aerial incursions target-assassination and expanded their territorial occupation beyond longstanding disputed zones. With no visible plans for withdrawal and no diplomatic constraints in play, the occupation appears less like a temporary measure and more like a strategic entrenchment\u2014one calibrated to reshape facts on the ground while Lebanon remains too fractured and incapable to respond and seek the liberation of its territories.\n\nIn Iran, the latest Israeli-US war and the challenge to its strategic deterrent have prompted an uncompromising response. Tehran has vowed to rebuild\u2014not just its nuclear infrastructure, but an entire defensive doctrine centred on the most effective hypersonicmissile proliferation, asymmetric alliances, and an accelerated military-industrial push in a race with time. Far from retreating, Iran appears to be recalibrating for short and long-term confrontation.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

Magnier\n\nLe Conseil des gardiens de la Constitution iranien a officiellement approuv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Parlement de suspendre les inspections de l\u2019Agence internationale de l\u2019\u00e9nergie atomique (AIEA). Cette mesure, soutenue par l\u2019organe de surveillance le plus puissant du pays, marque une escalade critique dans l\u2019affrontement de T\u00e9h\u00e9ran avec l\u2019Occident au sujet de son programme nucl\u00e9aire. Cette d\u00e9cision exclut effectivement les inspecteurs de l\u2019AIEA des principaux sites nucl\u00e9aires iraniens et pourrait faire entrer l\u2019Iran dans une nouvelle phase redout\u00e9e par la communaut\u00e9 internationale : l\u2019ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 nucl\u00e9aire, voire un blackout nucl\u00e9aire total.\n\nLa position de l\u2019Iran d\u00e9coule d\u2019ann\u00e9es de d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la confiance envers les \u00c9tats-Unis et leurs alli\u00e9s occidentaux. Au c\u0153ur de la question se trouve l\u2019insistance de l\u2019Iran sur le caract\u00e8re inali\u00e9nable de sa production locale d\u2019uranium enrichi et sur la nature pacifique de son programme nucl\u00e9aire, en opposition \u00e0 des d\u00e9cennies de suspicion et de sabotage, principalement orchestr\u00e9s par les \u00c9tats-Unis et Isra\u00ebl. La d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente ne constitue pas une simple man\u0153uvre politique : c\u2019est un acte l\u00e9galement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi, fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation iranienne de ses obligations internationales. En vertu du Trait\u00e9 sur la non-prolif\u00e9ration des armes nucl\u00e9aires (TNP) et de l\u2019Accord de garanties g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es (CSA), l\u2019Iran est tenu de permettre les inspections de ses mati\u00e8res nucl\u00e9aires d\u00e9clar\u00e9es et de ses installations. Cependant, l\u2019Iran n\u2019a jamais ratifi\u00e9 le Protocole additionnel (PA), ce qui lui permet l\u00e9galement de refuser \u00e0 l\u2019AIEA l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux sites non d\u00e9clar\u00e9s, aux installations militaires et \u00e0 d\u2019autres infrastructures sensibles.\n\nCette nuance juridique est cruciale. L\u2019Iran ne viole pas son Accord de garanties (CSA) en restreignant l\u2019acc\u00e8s au-del\u00e0 des engagements qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9s. Mais sur le plan pratique, cette d\u00e9cision a de lourdes cons\u00e9quences. Avec une visibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite, l\u2019AIEA n\u2019est plus en mesure de v\u00e9rifier la nature pacifique des activit\u00e9s nucl\u00e9aires iraniennes. Cela alimente les sp\u00e9culations sur ce que T\u00e9h\u00e9ran pourrait dissimuler et sur l\u2019\u00e9tat r\u00e9el de l\u2019avancement de ses capacit\u00e9s nucl\u00e9aires.\n\nHistoriquement, Isra\u00ebl a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le central dans l\u2019orientation de la politique am\u00e9ricaine \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du programme nucl\u00e9aire iranien. Le Premier ministre isra\u00e9lien Benjamin Netanyahou r\u00e9clame une action militaire contre l\u2019Iran depuis au moins 1996, pr\u00e9sentant le pays comme constamment au bord de la bombe nucl\u00e9aire. En 2010, sous la pression croissante d\u2019Isra\u00ebl, les \u00c9tats-Unis ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la meilleure mani\u00e8re de d\u00e9truire Fordow, l\u2019installation nucl\u00e9aire profond\u00e9ment enfouie en Iran. Cette analyse a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Dan Caine, chef d\u2019\u00e9tat-major interarm\u00e9es am\u00e9ricain, qui a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019arm\u00e9e am\u00e9ricaine travaille depuis 15 ans \u00e0 des options de frappe \u2013 sans n\u00e9cessairement parvenir \u00e0 d\u00e9truire les installations nucl\u00e9aires iraniennes. Dans une d\u00e9claration au Congr\u00e8s, le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Caine a affirm\u00e9 : \u00ab Nous n\u2019avons pas utilis\u00e9 de bombes perforantes contre l\u2019une des plus grandes installations nucl\u00e9aires souterraines \u00e0 Ispahan car le site est si profond que les munitions auraient pu \u00eatre inefficaces. \u00bb\n\nL\u2019administration Trump a port\u00e9 cette campagne de pression \u00e0 son apog\u00e9e. Le pr\u00e9sident Donald Trump a autoris\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations secr\u00e8tes agressives de la CIA \u2013 le chef du Mossad isra\u00e9lien a d\u2019ailleurs remerci\u00e9 son homologue am\u00e9ricain pour son soutien \u2013 ainsi que des actions militaires directes contre les cibles nucl\u00e9aires iraniennes. Pour Netanyahou, cela repr\u00e9sentait l\u2019aboutissement de d\u00e9cennies de campagne. Mais ce choix de timing n\u2019\u00e9tait pas seulement strat\u00e9gique : il \u00e9tait aussi personnel. Netanyahou a lanc\u00e9 cette escalade alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait politiquement accul\u00e9, confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des accusations de corruption et \u00e0 une col\u00e8re croissante de la population sur sa gestion du conflit \u00e0 Gaza et la question des prisonniers isra\u00e9liens d\u00e9tenus par le Hamas. Une question s\u2019impose : bien qu\u2019il ait toujours plaid\u00e9 pour une frappe contre le programme nucl\u00e9aire iranien, pourquoi Netanyahou a-t-il choisi de passer \u00e0 l\u2019acte pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment au moment o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait en difficult\u00e9 politique ? Il semble que cette action ait davantage servi de diversion interne que de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 strat\u00e9gique.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

        "text": "Geschreven door Elijah J. Magnier \u2013 Vertaald door Francis J.\n\nRust in ruil voor rust, maar geen einde aan de vijandelijkheden of de oorlog. Er is een staakt-het-vuren afgekondigd tussen Isra\u00ebl en Iran, maar niet door onderhandelingen, een verdrag of wederzijds begrip. Het kwam tot stand door een eenzijdige aankondiging van de Amerikaanse president Donald Trump, die vervolgens werd besproken en goedgekeurd door het Isra\u00eblische kabinet onder leiding van premier Benjamin Netanyahu. Wat volgt is geen vrede, maar een gevaarlijke pauze: een staakt-het-vuren zonder consensus of gedetailleerde overeenkomst, gebaseerd op omstreden verhalen en onopgeloste doelstellingen. Dit staakt-het-vuren is hooguit een pauze voor de volgende, veel rampzaliger daad. De Isra\u00eblische regering heeft zich slechts twaalf dagen teruggetrokken uit Gaza, om vervolgens weer terug te keren. Met zijn oorlog tegen Iran heeft de premier op korte termijn misschien een kleine opleving gekregen, maar niets dat hem zal beschermen tegen de toenemende kritiek die hem te wachten staat.\n\nVoor Isra\u00ebl is het verhaal over de resultaten van de oorlog tegen Iran triomfalistisch. De regering van Netanyahu beweert al haar strategische doelstellingen te hebben bereikt: het nucleaire programma van Iran lamleggen, belangrijke regerings- en militaire infrastructuur vernietigen, meer dan een dozijn hoge nucleaire wetenschappers vermoorden, tijdens het hoogtepunt van de aanval onbetwiste luchtmacht boven Iran verwerven en het Iraanse raketprogramma vernietigen. Netanyahu ging zelfs zo ver dat hij Isra\u00ebl uitriep tot \u201csupermacht\u201d.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s bewering dat het raketprogramma van Iran volledig is ontmanteld, wordt met scepsis ontvangen. Maar de laatste momenten voor het staakt-het-vuren vertelden een ander verhaal. Iran lanceerde op het laatste moment een salvo raketten, die Isra\u00eblische doelen troffen en zeven doden veroorzaakten. Het laatste woord was niet aan Netanyahu, maar aan Iran, dat zich in explosieve bewoordingen uitsprak. Dat paste niet bij de theatrale persoonlijkheid van Netanyahu, die opdracht gaf tot een aanval die Donald Trump (gedeeltelijk) tegenhield, wetende dat een soortgelijke oorlogsdaad een schending van het staakt-het-vuren zou zijn en een bredere reactie zou uitlokken.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

De bezorgdheid gaat verder dan vragen over het militaire succes of falen \u2013 ze strekt zich uit tot de veiligheid van het milieu en de mens. Als de centrifuges actief waren toen ze werden geraakt, zijn er dan radioactieve stoffen vrijgekomen? Zijn er doden of gewonden gevallen? Is er sprake van meetbare radioactieve besmetting? Tot nu toe heeft geen enkele internationale instantie, ook de IAEA niet, een definitieve publieke beoordeling gegeven. Het agentschap heeft toegang gevraagd tot de getroffen locaties en opgeroepen tot een volledige inspectie van de Iraanse uraniumvoorraden, maar bevestigt dat er tot nu toe geen abnormale stralingsniveaus zijn gemeten.\n\nToch cre\u00ebert het ontbreken van duidelijke, geverifieerde informatie een gevaarlijke leemte.

        "text": "Geschreven door Elijah J. Magnier \u2013 Vertaald door Francis J.\n\nIran lijkt vastbesloten om terug te slaan in de aanhoudende oorlog tussen de VS en Isra\u00ebl. Na Amerikaanse aanvallen op zijn nucleaire infrastructuur heeft de Iraanse legerleider, generaal Abdolrahim Mousavi, een strenge waarschuwing afgegeven: \u201cElke keer dat de Verenigde Staten een misdaad tegen Iran hebben begaan, hebben ze te maken gekregen met een beslissende vergelding \u2013 en deze keer zal dat niet anders zijn. We zullen met alle middelen vechten om onze onafhankelijkheid, onze eenheid en de integriteit van ons regeringssysteem te verdedigen. We vechten niet om te overleven \u2013 we vechten voor de overwinning.\u201d\n\nMeer dan vierentwintig uur na de Amerikaanse aanval werd Isra\u00ebl getroffen door een raket die op Haifa was gericht \u2013 een aanval die langs de luchtverdedigingssystemen glipte zonder dat er ook maar \u00e9\u00e9n sirene afging of een raket werd onderschept. Deze inbreuk legde een ernstige kwetsbaarheid van het Isra\u00eblische verdedigingsschild bloot en onderstreepte de ernst van het zich ontvouwende conflict. Het was ook een duidelijke boodschap: Teheran geeft niet op. Iran lijkt verre van afgeschrikt en klaar om met precisie en vastberadenheid te escaleren. De aanval op Haifa was geen op zichzelf staand incident; hij werd gevolgd door een reeks extra raketaanvallen.\n\nDe Iraanse raketten verhinderen dat de Isra\u00ebli\u2019s kunnen terugkeren naar een normaal leven totdat Iran tevreden is en het laatste woord in deze oorlog heeft gesproken, waarmee het aangeeft dat het bereid is om de voorwaarden voor een toekomstig staakt-het-vuren op eigen voorwaarden te bepalen. Ondertussen lijken de oproepen van Isra\u00ebl tot de-escalatie minder ingegeven door diplomatie dan door tactisch eigenbelang. Premier Benjamin Netanyahu buigt niet voor de druk, maar is op zijn hoede voor diepere en mogelijk onbeheersbare schade binnen de grenzen van Isra\u00ebl. Nu de VS al Iraanse nucleaire installaties heeft aangevallen en Iran heeft bewezen in staat te zijn terug te slaan \u2013 met aanzienlijke schade aan Isra\u00eblische steden tot gevolg \u2013 wil Netanyahu het conflict bevriezen en tegelijkertijd een strategische overwinning claimen.\n\nZijn doel is om de oorlog op zijn voorwaarden te be\u00ebindigen, met een andere partij die bemiddelt in een staakt-het-vuren, waardoor hij zijn politieke kapitaal kan behouden en de militaire positie van Isra\u00ebl intact blijft voor toekomstige onvoorziene omstandigheden. President Donald Trump speelde een centrale rol in het vormgeven van deze dynamiek. Zijn besluit om Iraanse nucleaire installaties te bombarderen zorgde voor een rustige nacht voor de Isra\u00ebli\u2019s \u2013 een actie die in heel Isra\u00ebl, en met name door Netanyahu, breed werd toegejuicht. In de Knesset wapperden Amerikaanse vlaggen naast Isra\u00eblische vlaggen als teken van eenheid, terwijl digitale billboards in Tel Aviv Trump bedankten voor het verdedigen van Isra\u00ebl. Deze publieke uitingen weerspiegelden niet alleen dankbaarheid, maar ook de diepe strategische synchronisatie tussen de twee leiders \u2013 Netanyahu en Trump \u2013 die een oorlog voeren die wordt gekenmerkt door misleiding, berekende verrassingen en strak geco\u00f6rdineerde militaire operaties.Om zijn verzet nog eens extra te onderstrepen, heeft\n\nTeheran verklaard door te gaan met het verrijken van uranium, waarmee het de beweringen van de VS en Isra\u00ebl dat het Iraanse nucleaire programma is ontmanteld, rechtstreeks aanvecht. Deze stap getuigt niet alleen van veerkracht, maar ook van een berekende afwijzing van het verhaal dat de strategische capaciteiten van Iran zijn geneutraliseerd. Bovendien dreigt elke Iraanse vergeldingsactie in dit stadium het zorgvuldig opgebouwde verhaal van Isra\u00ebl dat het de afschrikking tegen Teheran heeft hersteld, te doen instorten. Netanyahu wil nu zijn oorlog op gunstige voorwaarden be\u00ebindigen, omdat hij beweert dat zijn acties het Midden-Oosten fundamenteel hebben hervormd: Iran is verzwakt, zijn bondgenoten zijn ge\u00efsoleerd en de normalisatie met gematigde Arabische staten is bevorderd.\n\nZijn bredere ambitie lijkt te zijn het opleggen van een nieuwe regionale orde waarin Isra\u00ebl de onbetwiste veiligheidsarbiter is, een zelfbenoemde politieagent met de bevoegdheid om preventief op te treden tegen elke actor die als een bedreiging wordt beschouwd. Netanyahu is van mening dat hij ernstige schade heeft toegebracht aan de zogenaamde \u201csjiitische halve maan\u201d \u2013 de as van verzet die zich uitstrekt van Teheran via Jemen en Bagdad tot Beiroet \u2013 die de afgelopen twintig jaar steeds machtiger is geworden. Hij lijkt nu even vastbesloten om het ontstaan van een rivaliserende soennitische coalitie te voorkomen, die mogelijk wordt geleid door Turkije, een land dat hij herhaaldelijk heeft bekritiseerd vanwege zijn groeiende invloed in Syri\u00eb. In de visie van Netanyahu mag geen enkele regionale macht \u2013 sjiitisch of soennitisch \u2013 de strategische architectuur van het Midden-Oosten bewaken, vormgeven of uitdagen. Die rol is volgens hem uitsluitend voorbehouden aan Isra\u00ebl.\n\nOndertussen heeft de Amerikaanse bombardementen op de vreedzame nucleaire installaties van Iran \u2013 in combinatie met wat Teheran beschouwt als onwettige oorlogsverklaringen van zowel Washington als Tel Aviv \u2013 de vastberadenheid van Iran om een krachtiger afschrikmiddel op te bouwen alleen maar versterkt.Verwacht wordt dat Iran nu de ontwikkeling van zijn raketcapaciteiten zal versnellen en mogelijk zijn deelname aan het Non-proliferatieverdrag (NPV) zal heroverwegen, waardoor internationale inspecties onder toezicht van de Verenigde Naties mogelijk aan banden worden gelegd. Naast het versterken van zijn interne defensie, zou Teheran ook zijn steun aan regionale bondgenoten zoals Ansar Allah in Jemen en Hezbollah in Libanon kunnen verdubbelen, omdat het deze beschouwt als essenti\u00eble pijlers van strategische diepgang in het licht van een vijandige alliantie.\n\nIran staat nu echter voor een cruciale en dringende uitdaging: de wederopbouw van zijn beschadigde nucleaire en militaire infrastructuur. Om dit aan te pakken, zou opperbevelhebber ayatollah Ali Khamenei een beroep kunnen doen op instellingen buiten de begroting, zoals Setad, of putten uit soevereine reserves, zoals het Nationaal Ontwikkelingsfonds van Iran, dat naar schatting tientallen miljarden dollars bevat, om een snel herstel te ondersteunen. Hoewel de exacte bedragen onduidelijk blijven, bieden deze financi\u00eble mechanismen Teheran flexibiliteit om te reageren op oorlogsschade en belangrijke strategische activa te herbouwen.\n\nTegelijkertijd wordt verwacht dat Teheran de militaire en technologische samenwerking met belangrijke partners zoals China en Noord-Korea zal verdiepen en de inspanningen om zijn defensiecapaciteiten te herbouwen en moderniseren zal versnellen. Ondertussen is het vertrouwen van Iran in het Internationaal Atoomenergieagentschap (IAEA) ernstig geschokt, zo niet volledig ondermijnd, door het stilzwijgen van directeur Rafael Grossi na de Amerikaanse en Isra\u00eblische aanvallen op Iraanse nucleaire installaties. Volgens het mandaat van het IAEA moet elke aanval op beveiligde locaties ondubbelzinnig worden veroordeeld, ongeacht de politieke context. Een dergelijke veroordeling is echter niet uitgesproken. Voor Teheran duidt deze omissie niet op neutraliteit, maar op medeplichtigheid. Het falen van het agentschap om de integriteit van de civiele nucleaire infrastructuur te verdedigen, heeft ertoe geleid dat Iraanse functionarissen het IAEA steeds meer zien als een verlengstuk van de inlichtingenbelangen van de VS en Isra\u00ebl, en niet als een onpartijdige internationale instantie.\n\nIn deze context lijkt voortzetting van de samenwerking met een instelling die als politiek gecompromitteerd wordt beschouwd, onhoudbaar. De oorlog heeft ook de alarmerende effectiviteit aan het licht gebracht van meerdere spionagenetwerken die binnen Iran actief zijn \u2013 waarvan vele vermoedelijk rechtstreeks steun hebben verleend aan militaire operaties van de VS en Isra\u00ebl. Deze spionagenetwerken, waarvan sommige naar verluidt zijn ge\u00efnfiltreerd in kritieke infrastructuur en overheidsinstellingen, hebben een doorslaggevende rol gespeeld bij het mogelijk maken van de precisie en co\u00f6rdinatie van de aanvallen. Als reactie hierop zullen de Iraanse veiligheids- en inlichtingendiensten naar verwachting een grootschalige en compromisloze actie ondernemen om deze netwerken op te rollen en interne kwetsbaarheden te dichten. Deze intensievere focus op contraspionage zal echter waarschijnlijk binnenlandse kosten met zich meebrengen: strengere surveillance, meer repressie en een inperking van de burgerlijke vrijheden. In deze oorlogssfeer verschuift het evenwicht tussen nationale veiligheid en persoonlijke vrijheid al duidelijk in het voordeel van het eerste.\n\nSancties, ooit beschouwd als een laatste redmiddel, zijn een standaardmechanisme geworden in het westerse beleid ten aanzien van Iran, ongeacht wie er in Teheran aan de macht is. Ze zijn niet langer reactief, maar structureel. Iran wordt niet gesanctioneerd om wat het doet, maar om wat het vertegenwoordigt: een onafhankelijke, grondstofrijke natie die in staat is haar macht buiten haar grenzen, buiten de westerse invloedssfeer, te projecteren. In deze context hebben sancties een tweeledig doel. Ten eerste zijn ze bedoeld om Iran economisch te verzwakken en zijn vermogen om te investeren in binnenlandse groei of regionale invloed te beperken. Ten tweede zijn ze bedoeld om interne onvrede te zaaien \u2013 door protesten, tekorten en publieke ontevredenheid aan te wakkeren. De strategie is eenvoudig: als Iran niet tot gehoorzaamheid kan worden gedwongen, kan het onder druk worden gezet tot het instort of capituleert.\n\nDeze aanpak weerspiegelt een bredere regionale logica, die erop gericht is een strategisch onevenwicht in het Midden-Oosten te handhaven. De Isra\u00eblische uitzondering Nergens is deze onbalans duidelijker zichtbaar dan in de contrasterende behandeling van Isra\u00ebl en andere regionale machten. Isra\u00ebl beschikt over een geavanceerd leger, een bekend (hoewel niet officieel erkend) nucleair arsenaal en een geschiedenis van extraterritoriale operaties die wereldwijde veroordeling zouden uitlokken als ze door een andere staat zouden worden uitgevoerd. Toch hoeft het land nauwelijks verantwoording af te leggen. Zijn dominantie wordt niet alleen aanvaard, maar ook beschermd.Wanneer Iran defensieve capaciteiten ontwikkelt, afschrikking toepast of regionale bondgenoten steunt, worden deze acties bestempeld als agressie. Wanneer Isra\u00ebl moorden, sabotage of luchtaanvallen uitvoert in buurlanden, worden deze daden algemeen gerechtvaardigd als zelfverdediging.\n\nDeze dubbele moraal komt niet voort uit juridische nuances, maar uit strategische bevoordeling. Vanuit dit perspectief gaat het conflict niet over gedrag, maar over status. Iran wordt niet gestraft voor zijn daden, maar voor wat het durft te worden: een tegenwicht. En geen enkel tegenwicht tegen de Isra\u00eblische hegemonie is aanvaardbaar onder de huidige door de VS gesteunde regionale orde. De kern van de zaak is de weigering van het Westen om strategische gelijkheid in het Midden-Oosten te accepteren. Al decennialang werken de Verenigde Staten en hun bondgenoten eraan om ervoor te zorgen dat slechts \u00e9\u00e9n macht \u2013 Isra\u00ebl \u2013 een overweldigende superioriteit geniet op militair, inlichtingen- en technologisch gebied.\n\nElke speler die dat monopolie wil doorbreken, of het nu Irak onder Saddam Hoessein is, Syri\u00eb onder de Assads of zelfs Turkije wanneer het een onafhankelijk beleid voert, wordt als een bedreiging beschouwd. Iran is de meest veerkrachtige van deze uitdagers. Het heeft een revolutie, een verwoestende oorlog met Irak, decennia van sancties, cyberaanvallen en moordaanslagen overleefd. Desondanks blijft het een regionale speler met invloed die zich uitstrekt van de Golf tot de Middellandse Zee.\n\nVoor de bestaande machtsstructuur is die volharding onaanvaardbaar. Daarom wordt gelijkheid niet alleen ontkend, maar ook gecriminaliseerd en gebombardeerd. De gevolgen voor Iran zijn ingrijpend. Soevereiniteit kan niet langer als vanzelfsprekend worden beschouwd, maar moet actief worden verdedigd. En die verdediging beperkt zich niet langer tot militaire doctrine, maar is nu een principe dat ten grondslag ligt aan de economie, de buitenlandse betrekkingen, het technologiebeleid en zelfs de culturele identiteit. Volgens Teheran worden de regels selectief toegepast en strategisch ingezet als wapen.\n\nTerwijl Iran in het mondiale discours vaak wordt afgeschilderd als een verstorende factor, ziet Teheran zichzelf als een speler binnen een systeem dat gematigdheid bestraft en onderwerping beloont. Als vrede alleen kan worden gekocht ten koste van strategische verlamming, dan wordt vrede voor veel Iraanse leiders een valstrik. Soevereiniteit als verzet. De oorlog die door de Verenigde Staten en Isra\u00ebl is ontketend, heeft niet alleen fysieke schade aangericht, maar ook ideologische duidelijkheid gebracht. Het heeft de laatste illusies weggenomen dat diplomatie of gematigdheid Iran een plaats van respect zouden kunnen opleveren binnen de door het Westen gedomineerde orde. Het geloof dat strategische terughoudendheid zou worden beloond, is ingestort onder luchtaanvallen, sancties en het stilzwijgen van instellingen die belast zijn met de handhaving van het internationaal recht. De les voor Iran is ondubbelzinnig: soevereiniteit wordt niet geschonken, maar moet onophoudelijk worden opge\u00ebist.\n\nOmdat Teheran gelijkheid en erkenning worden ontzegd, kiest het voor een houding van permanent verzet. Zijn toekomst zal niet worden bepaald door een beroep op het Westen, maar door het streven naar autonomie, strategische allianties en een verharde afschrikkingspolitiek. Wat Isra\u00ebl en zijn bondgenoten afschrikking noemen, beschouwt Iran nu als provocatie. Wat het Westen agressie noemt, ziet Iran als overleven. En in deze asymmetrische oorlog van verhalen blijft \u00e9\u00e9n waarheid overeind: zolang soevereiniteit wordt bestraft en macht wordt gemonopoliseerd, zal er geen vrede heersen, maar alleen een wisselend en gevaarlijk evenwicht van confrontatie.\n\nOne-Time Monthly Yearly Make a one-time donation Make a monthly donation Make a yearly donation Choose an amount \u20ac5.00 \u20ac15.00 \u20ac100.00 \u20ac5.00 \u20ac15.00 \u20ac100.00 \u20ac5.00 \u20ac15.00 \u20ac100.00 Or enter a custom amount Your contribution is appreciated.

        "text": "Sovereignty Under Siege: Iran, the West, and the Illusion of Choice\n\nBy Elijah J. Magnier \u2013\n\nIran appears unwavering in its resolve to retaliate in the face of the ongoing U.S.-Israeli war. Following American strikes on its nuclear infrastructure, Iran\u2019s Army Chief, General Abdolrahim Mousavi, delivered a stark warning: \u201cEvery time the United States has committed a crime against Iran, it has faced a decisive retaliation\u2014and this time will be no different. We will fight with all our means to defend our independence, our unity, and the integrity of our ruling system. We are not fighting for survival\u2014we are fighting for victory.\u201d\n\nMore than twenty-four hours after the U.S. assault, Israel was struck by a missile targeting Haifa\u2014an attack that slipped past its air defence systems without triggering a single siren or interceptor. The breach exposed a serious vulnerability in Israel\u2019s defensive shield and underscored the gravity of the unfolding conflict. It also sent a clear message: Tehran is not backing down. Far from deterred, Iran appears ready to escalate with precision and intent. The Haifa strike was not an isolated incident; it was followed by a series of additional missile attacks. The Iranian missiles are forbidding the Israelis from returning to a normal life until it is satisfied to say the last world in this war, signalling Iran\u2019s willingness to shape the terms of any future ceasefire on its own terms.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel\u2019s calls for de-escalation appear driven less by diplomacy than by tactical self-interest. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, far from bowing to pressure, is wary of deeper and potentially uncontrollable damage within Israel\u2019s borders. With the U.S. having already targeted Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and Iran proving its capacity to strike back\u2014inflicting significant harm on Israeli cities\u2014Netanyahu now seeks to freeze the conflict while claiming strategic victory. His aim is to end the war on his terms, with another party brokering a ceasefire, allowing him to retain political capital while keeping Israel\u2019s military posture intact for future contingencies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump played a central role in shaping this dynamic. His decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities ensured a quiet night for Israelis\u2014an action widely celebrated across Israel, and particularly by Netanyahu. At the Knesset, American flags flew beside Israeli ones in a show of unity, while digital billboards in Tel Aviv thanked Trump for defending Israel. These public displays reflected not just gratitude but the deep strategic synchronization between the two leaders\u2014Netanyahu and Trump\u2014waging a war defined by deception, calculated surprise, and tightly coordinated military operations.\n\nFurther underscoring its defiance, Tehran has declared its intention to continue enriching uranium\u2014directly challenging U.S. and Israeli claims that the Iranian nuclear program has been dismantled. The move signals not only resilience but a calculated rejection of the narrative that Iran\u2019s strategic capabilities have been neutralized.\n\nMoreover, any Iranian retaliation at this stage threatens to shatter Israel\u2019s carefully crafted narrative of having reestablished deterrence against Tehran. Netanyahu now seeks to conclude his war on favourable terms, having claimed that his actions have fundamentally reshaped the Middle East\u2014weakening Iran, isolating its allies, and advancing normalization with moderate Arab states.\n\nHis broader ambition appears to be the imposition of a new regional order in which Israel serves as the undisputed security arbiter\u2014a self-appointed policeman with the authority to strike pre-emptively at any actor perceived as a threat. Netanyahu believes he has inflicted serious damage on the so-called \u201cShia Crescent\u201d\u2014the axis of resistance stretching from Tehran through Yemen, Baghdad, and Beirut\u2014which has grown more formidable over the past two decades. He now seems equally determined to prevent the emergence of a rival Sunni coalition, potentially led by Turkey, a country he has repeatedly criticized for its growing influence in Syria. In Netanyahu\u2019s vision, no regional force\u2014Shia or Sunni\u2014should be allowed to patrol, shape, or challenge the strategic architecture of the Middle East. That role, he believes, belongs solely to Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. bombing of Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear facilities\u2014combined with what Tehran sees as unlawful declarations of war by both Washington and Tel Aviv\u2014has only deepened Iran\u2019s determination to build a more formidable deterrent.\n\nIran is now expected to accelerate development of its missile capabilities and may reconsider its participation in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), potentially restricting international inspections conducted under United Nations oversight.\n\nBeyond bolstering its internal defence, Tehran may also double down on its support for regional allies such as Yemen\u2019s Ansar Allah and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, viewing them as vital pillars of strategic depth in the face of a hostile alliance.\n\nYet, Iran now faces a critical and immediate challenge: the reconstruction of its damaged nuclear and military infrastructure. To address this, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may tap into off-budget institutions like Setad or draw from sovereign reserves such as the National Development Fund of Iran\u2014estimated to hold tens of billions of dollars\u2014to support rapid recovery. Though the exact sums remain unclear, these financial mechanisms offer Tehran flexibility in responding to wartime damage and rebuilding key strategic assets.\n\nAt the same time, Tehran is expected to deepen military and technological cooperation with key partners such as China and North Korea, accelerating efforts to rebuild and modernize its defence capabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u2019s trust in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been deeply shaken\u2014if not entirely eroded\u2014by the silence of its Director, Rafael Grossi, following the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Under the IAEA\u2019s mandate, any attack on safeguarded sites should be unequivocally condemned, regardless of the political context. Yet no such condemnation was issued. For Tehran, this omission signals not neutrality, but complicity. The agency\u2019s failure to defend the integrity of civilian nuclear infrastructure has led Iranian officials to increasingly view the IAEA not as an impartial international body, but as an extension of U.S. and Israeli intelligence interests. In this context, continued cooperation with an institution perceived as politically compromised appears untenable.\n\nThe war has also exposed the alarming effectiveness of multiple espionage networks operating within Iran\u2014many believed to have directly supported U.S. and Israeli military operations. These spy rings, some reportedly embedded in critical infrastructure and government institutions, played a decisive role in enabling the precision and coordination of the attacks. In response, Iran\u2019s security and intelligence services are expected to launch a sweeping and uncompromising crackdown to dismantle these networks and seal internal vulnerabilities. However, this intensified focus on counterintelligence is likely to come at a domestic cost: tighter surveillance, increased repression, and a contraction of civil liberties. In this wartime atmosphere, the balance between national security and personal freedom is already shifting decisively toward the former.\n\nSanctions, once framed as a tool of last resort, have become a default mechanism of Western policy toward Iran\u2014regardless of who holds power in Tehran. They are no longer reactive but structural. Iran is sanctioned not for what it does, but for what it represents: an independent, resource-rich nation capable of projecting power beyond its borders, outside the Western sphere of influence.\n\nIn this context, sanctions serve a dual purpose. First, they aim to economically weaken Iran, constraining its ability to invest in domestic growth or regional influence. Second, they are designed to sow internal discontent\u2014fuelling protests, shortages, and public dissatisfaction. The strategy is simple: if Iran cannot be coerced into compliance, it can be pressured until it collapses or capitulates.\n\nThis approach reflects a broader regional logic\u2014one that seeks to enforce a strategic imbalance across the Middle East.\n\nThe Israeli Exception\n\nNowhere is this imbalance more visible than in the contrasting treatment of Israel and other regional powers. Israel maintains a sophisticated military, a known (though undeclared) nuclear arsenal, and a history of extraterritorial operations that would provoke global condemnation if undertaken by any other state. Yet it faces little to no accountability. Its dominance is not only accepted\u2014it is protected.\n\nWhen Iran develops defensive capabilities, asserts deterrence, or supports regional allies, these actions are labelled as aggression. When Israel carries out assassinations, sabotage, or airstrikes in neighbouring countries, these acts are broadly justified as self-defence. This double standard is not born of legal nuance\u2014it stems from strategic favouritism.\n\nSeen from this perspective, the conflict is not about behaviour, but about status. Iran is not punished for its actions, but for what it dares to become: a counterweight. And no counterweight to Israeli hegemony is tolerable under the current U.S.-backed regional order.\n\nThe core issue is the West\u2019s refusal to accept strategic parity in the Middle East. For decades, the United States and its allies have worked to ensure that only one power\u2014Israel\u2014enjoys overwhelming superiority in military, intelligence, and technological domains. Any actor that seeks to challenge that monopoly, whether Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Syria under the Assads, or even Turkey when asserting independent policy, is treated as a threat.\n\nIran is the most resilient of these challengers. It has survived a revolution, a devastating war with Iraq, decades of sanctions, cyberattacks, and assassinations. Despite this, it remains a regional actor with influence extending from the Gulf to the Mediterranean. For the existing power structure, that persistence is unacceptable. Thus, parity is not just denied\u2014it is criminalized and bombed.\n\nThe consequences for Iran are profound. Sovereignty can no longer be assumed; it must be actively defended. And that defence is no longer limited to military doctrine\u2014it is now a principle that governs economics, foreign relations, technology policy, and even cultural identity. In Tehran\u2019s view, the rules are selectively applied and strategically weaponized.\n\nWhile the global narrative often casts Iran as a disruptor, Tehran sees itself operating within a system that punishes moderation and rewards submission. If peace can only be purchased at the cost of strategic paralysis, then for many Iranian leaders, peace itself becomes a trap.\n\nSovereignty as Resistance\n\nThe war launched by the United States and Israel has inflicted not only physical damage, but ideological clarity. It has stripped away the last illusions that diplomacy or moderation could earn Iran a place of respect within the Western-dominated order. The belief that strategic restraint would be rewarded has collapsed under airstrikes, sanctions, and the silence of institutions tasked with upholding international law.\n\nThe lesson for Iran is unambiguous: sovereignty is not granted\u2014it must be asserted, relentlessly. Denied parity and recognition, Tehran is turning to a posture of permanent resistance. Its future will be shaped not by appeals to the West, but by the pursuit of autonomy, strategic alliances, and hardened deterrence.\n\nWhat Israel and its allies call deterrence; Iran now sees as provocation. What the West labels aggression, Iran views as survival. And in this asymmetrical war of narratives, one truth remains: as long as sovereignty is punished and power is monopolized, peace will not prevail\u2014only a shifting and dangerous balance of confrontation.\n\nOne-Time Monthly Yearly Make a one-time donation Make a monthly donation Make a yearly donation Choose an amount \u20ac5.00 \u20ac15.00 \u20ac100.00 \u20ac5.00 \u20ac15.00 \u20ac100.00 \u20ac5.00 \u20ac15.00 \u20ac100.00 Or enter a custom amount Your contribution is appreciated.

Alors que les n\u00e9gociations stagnent et que les pr\u00e9paratifs militaires s\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e8rent, les responsables iraniens semblent recalibrer leur posture, passant d\u2019un engagement prudent \u00e0 une dissuasion pr\u00e9emptive. Pour la direction iranienne, le co\u00fbt d\u2019une h\u00e9sitation per\u00e7ue pourrait d\u00e9sormais d\u00e9passer les risques d\u2019une confrontation. Le ministre des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res Abbas Araghchi a ouvert les n\u00e9gociations \u00e0 Vienne vendredi dernier, marquant une avanc\u00e9e diplomatique partielle. Les discussions ont repris entre l\u2019Iran et les puissances occidentales, signalant une volont\u00e9 mutuelle de dialogue. Toutefois, le fond des discussions a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 de profondes divergences. Les \u00c9tats-Unis et l\u2019Union europ\u00e9enne auraient exig\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat total de l\u2019enrichissement d\u2019uranium par l\u2019Iran, le d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement de son programme de missiles et la rupture avec ses alli\u00e9s r\u00e9gionaux\u2014des conditions que T\u00e9h\u00e9ran a cat\u00e9goriquement rejet\u00e9es. La r\u00e9ponse iranienne, \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident Masoud, fut sans \u00e9quivoque : aucun compromis ne sera fait sur ces piliers de la doctrine de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale. N\u00e9anmoins, les n\u00e9gociateurs iraniens ont laiss\u00e9 la porte ouverte \u00e0 un dialogue futur\u2014\u00e0 condition que l\u2019Occident fournisse des garanties cr\u00e9dibles attestant que l\u2019Iran ne cherchera pas \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper l\u2019arme nucl\u00e9aire. Ainsi, la diplomatie reste envisageable, mais \u00e0 condition que les lignes rouges soient reconnues comme intangibles. Derri\u00e8re ces pourparlers se profile un calcul g\u00e9opolitique plus large. T\u00e9h\u00e9ran consid\u00e8re ces exigences maximalistes comme moins li\u00e9es \u00e0 la non-prolif\u00e9ration qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019avancement de l\u2019agenda strat\u00e9gique de Tel-Aviv par Washington et Bruxelles. Selon T\u00e9h\u00e9ran, la diplomatie occidentale est instrumentalis\u00e9e pour atteindre des objectifs que les strat\u00e8ges militaires isra\u00e9liens reconnaissent comme inaccessibles sans une intervention am\u00e9ricaine \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle.

        "paragraph_summary": "In an article by Elijah J. Magnier, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has heightened its threat level, warning that Israel's Dimona nuclear reactor could become a legitimate target if Israeli aggression increases. The IRGC also stated that U.S. naval assets in the region would be attacked if Washington directly enters the conflict. This escalation reflects Iran's growing belief that diplomacy is no longer the primary path pursued by the U.S. Amid stalled negotiations and accelerated military preparations, Iranian officials are shifting from cautious engagement to preemptive deterrence. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently resumed negotiations in Vienna, indicating a partial diplomatic advance, but significant disagreements remain. The U.S. and EU have demanded Iran halt uranium enrichment, dismantle its missile program, and sever ties with regional allies\u2014conditions Iran has firmly rejected. Iranian President Masoud emphasized no compromise on these national security pillars, though negotiators remain open to future dialogue if credible guarantees are provided that Iran will not pursue nuclear weapons. Tehran views these maximalist demands as part of a broader geopolitical strategy by Washington and Brussels to advance Tel Aviv's strategic agenda, which Iran believes cannot be achieved without large-scale U.S. intervention.",

La position de l\u2019Iran \u00e9tait sans \u00e9quivoque : elle ne brandirait pas de drapeau blanc, elle ne s\u2019autod\u00e9truirait pas. Et elle n\u2019accepterait que des termes garantissant son droit souverain de riposter si tout accord futur \u00e9tait viol\u00e9.

His strategy is clear: shift attention from vulnerabilities to military performance, while lobbying Washington to intervene and neutralise Iran\u2019s offensive capabilities\u2014capabilities he knows cannot be fully dismantled, neither on the nuclear nor the missile front.\n\nAs Iranian missiles rained down on strategic sites in Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Be\u2019er al-Saba\u2019, Tehran simultaneously dispatched a diplomatic envoy to Vienna with an unambiguous message: there will be no nuclear negotiations under fire and no negotiation whatsoever about Iran\u2019s missile program. Iran was ready to proceed with the nuclear negotiations due four days after the surprised attack, a date agreed with President Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Iranian army responded on the battlefield with a calculated show of force\u2014striking Israel\u2019s urban and military centres as a statement of resilience, deterrence, and calibrated readiness. Iran\u2019s position is unequivocal: it will not raise a white flag, nor will it self-destruct. But it will only accept terms that guarantee the sovereign right to retaliate if any future agreement is violated.\n\nThere have been tactical victories and setbacks on both sides. The conflict unfolded in ways neither party fully anticipated. Despite extensive planning and a surprise Israeli offensive involving high-level assassinations and hundreds of aerial strikes, both countries engaged without a full control of modern hybrid warfare\u2019s evolving nature.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

        "text": "Geschreven door Elijah J. Magnier \u2013 Vertaald door Francis J.\n\nNu de confrontatie tussen Isra\u00ebl en Iran escaleert tot een volledige oorlog, neemt Teheran niet langer alleen maar aanvallen voor lief, maar profileert het zich als een strategische macht die in staat is om langdurige en multidimensionale schade toe te brengen. Door een zorgvuldig afgestemde combinatie van ballistische, hypersonische en drone-aanvallen, in combinatie met de voortdurende ontmanteling van clandestiene inlichtingennetwerken, neemt Iran niet alleen wraak op Isra\u00ebl, maar bepaalt het ook zelf de regels van het spel. De boodschap aan Washington is onmiskenbaar: elk besluit van de VS om formeel aan de oorlog deel te nemen, zal enorme gevolgen hebben.\n\nIn tegenstelling tot Isra\u00ebl beschikt de Verenigde Staten over een uitgebreid netwerk van militaire bases rondom Iran \u2013 in Irak, Koeweit, Qatar, Bahrein, de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten en Syri\u00eb \u2013 die allemaal binnen het bereik liggen van het groeiende raketarsenaal van Iran. De recente integratie van hypersonische capaciteiten in het arsenaal van Iran heeft deze kwetsbaarheid nog vergroot, waardoor de aanwezigheid van de VS is veranderd van een afschrikkende kracht in een potenti\u00eble last in geval van escalatie.\n\nTe midden van dit precaire landschap zal de Iraanse minister van Buitenlandse Zaken Abbas Araghchi naar Zwitserland reizen voor spoedoverleg met zijn Europese collega\u2019s in een poging de crisis te de-escaleren. In reactie op een diplomatiek initiatief van de VS \u2013 onder leiding van presidentieel gezant Steve Witkoff \u2013 heeft Teheran echter een duidelijke rode lijn getrokken: er zullen geen onderhandelingen over nucleaire kwesties plaatsvinden zolang het Iraanse grondgebied militair wordt aangevallen.\n\nVoor Teheran staat de vernietiging van zijn nucleaire installaties \u2013 hoe belangrijk ook \u2013 niet gelijk aan het einde van zijn nucleaire programma. De wetenschappelijke en technische expertise van Iran is verspreid, veerkrachtig en diep ge\u00efnstitutionaliseerd. De Islamitische Republiek heeft duidelijk gemaakt dat zij haar verrijkings- en raketcapaciteiten met nog meer verfijning kan herbouwen, dankzij de ervaring die zij tijdens de oorlog heeft opgedaan en nieuwe veiligheidsprotocollen. Zelfs de veelgeprezen Amerikaanse GBU-57 \u201cbunkerbuster\u201d-bom, die is ontworpen om versterkte installaties zoals Fordo te vernietigen, biedt geen garantie voor totale vernietiging. Maar zelfs als dat wel het geval zou zijn, zou dit de langetermijncapaciteiten en nucleaire kennis van Iran niet neutraliseren.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

Magnier\n\nAs the Israel\u2013Iran confrontation intensifies into a full-scale war, Tehran is no longer merely absorbing attacks\u2014it is asserting itself as a strategic force capable of inflicting sustained and multidimensional damage. Through a calibrated combination of ballistic, hypersonic, and drone-based assaults, alongside the continuous dismantling of clandestine intelligence networks, Iran is not only retaliating against Israel but shaping the battlefield on its own terms. The message to Washington is unmistakable: any U.S. decision to formally enter the war will carry enormous consequences.\n\nUnlike Israel, the United States maintains a vast network of military bases encircling Iran\u2014in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, and Syria\u2014all well within range of Iran\u2019s expanding missile arsenal. The recent integration of hypersonic capabilities into Iran\u2019s arsenal has amplified these vulnerabilities, transforming the U.S. footprint from a deterrent force into a potential liability in the event of escalation.\n\nAmid this precarious landscape, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is scheduled to travel to Switzerland for urgent consultations with European counterparts in an effort to de-escalate the crisis. However, in response to a U.S. diplomatic initiative\u2014spearheaded by presidential envoy Steve Witkoff\u2014Tehran has drawn a clear red line: no negotiations on nuclear issues will take place while Iranian territory remains under military attack.\n\nFor Tehran, the destruction of its nuclear facilities\u2014however significant\u2014is not tantamount to the end of its nuclear programme. Iran\u2019s scientific and technical expertise is dispersed, resilient, and deeply institutionalised. The Islamic Republic has made it clear that it can rebuild its enrichment and missile capabilities with greater sophistication, shaped by wartime experience and new security protocols. Even the much-vaunted U.S. GBU-57 \u201cbunker buster\u201d bomb, designed to target fortified installations like Fordo, may not guarantee total destruction. But even if it did, it would not neutralise Iran\u2019s long-term capabilities and nuclear knowledge.\n\nThis war has reinforced a critical strategic lesson for Tehran: it cannot rely on imported uranium or externally mediated agreements to preserve its national security. The earlier U.S. proposal for Iran to purchase enriched uranium on the open market is now perceived as untenable. Instead, Tehran views domestic enrichment as the only viable\u2014and negotiable\u2014platform going forward. The breakdown of trust, fuelled by Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 JCPOA and Israel\u2019s ongoing military aggression in coordination with Washington, has only hardened Iran\u2019s resolve to fortify its sovereign control over its nuclear future.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel finds itself increasingly overextended\u2014militarily, economically, and\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

The war underscores Iran's lesson that reliance on external uranium or agreements is untenable, emphasizing domestic enrichment as essential for national security. This stance is reinforced by the breakdown of trust following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 JCPOA and ongoing Israeli aggression, leaving Israel increasingly overextended.",

        "text": "Geschreven door Elijah J. Magnier \u2013\n\nVertaald door Francis J.\n\nIn de oorlog die Isra\u00ebl tegen Iran heeft verklaard, is een machtsbalans ontstaan: Isra\u00ebl domineert het luchtruim boven Iran, terwijl de Iraanse raketten Isra\u00ebl verhinderen zijn luchtruim veilig te stellen. Isra\u00ebl is in staat om elke locatie binnen het 1,6 miljoen vierkante kilometer grote grondgebied van Iran te bombarderen, net zoals Iran elke locatie binnen het 20.000 vierkante kilometer grote grondgebied van Isra\u00ebl kan aanvallen en vernietigen. In de eerste dagen zette Iran zijn oudere generatie ballistische raketten in \u2013 naast een beperkt aantal hypersonische raketten \u2013 om de reactie van Isra\u00ebl te testen en zijn meerlaagse onderscheppingssystemen en het personeel dat deze bedient uit te putten.\n\nOp dinsdag veranderde Iran echter zijn aanpak: het lanceerde de eerste generatie Fattah-1 hypersonische raketten, die alle beoogde doelen met succes raakten. Bovendien lijkt de eerste golf van verrassingsaanvallen van Isra\u00ebl, samen met de secundaire doelen, binnen de eerste dagen van het conflict te zijn uitgeput. Vanuit militair oogpunt vormt dit een ernstig dilemma voor de commandostructuur: de oorspronkelijke doelstellingen zijn in overeenstemming met de oorspronkelijke politieke doelstellingen bereikt. Het Isra\u00eblische commando heeft nu verdere instructies van de politieke leiders nodig om het bereik van de doelen uit te breiden \u2013 verdergaand dan het nucleaire programma, zoals oorspronkelijk door de regering was aangegeven, tot ook de vernietiging van de raketcapaciteiten van Iran.\n\nDe Isra\u00eblische premier Benjamin Netanyahu koestert echter bredere ambities: hij streeft naar een regimewisseling in Iran. Hij heeft ontmoetingen gehad met leden van de Iraanse oppositie en heeft, zoals hij opzettelijk openbaar heeft gemaakt, interviews gegeven aan Iran International, een mediakanaal dat de oppositie vertegenwoordigt. Hij ging zelfs zo ver dat hij suggereerde dat de moord op grootayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei \u2013 een spiritueel leider met tientallen miljoenen aanhangers \u2013 niet kon worden uitgesloten. Hij noemde zijn militaire campagne \u201cRising Lion\u201d, een berekende knipoog naar de vlag met de leeuw en de zon van de oppositie onder leiding van de zoon van de sjah, Reza Pahlavi. De moord op de hoogste leider van Iran zou echter niets veranderen aan het verloop van het conflict.\n\nVoor Iran is de dood van Sayyed Khamenei een te verwachten gebeurtenis en het is onwaarschijnlijk dat zijn opvolger minder vijandig tegenover Isra\u00ebl of de Verenigde Staten zal staan. Gezien de omvang van wat de VS en hun bondgenoot Iran in deze oorlog hebben aangedaan \u2013 en hoe behendig het plan is bedacht en uitgevoerd in samenwerking tussen Isra\u00ebl en de VS \u2013 zal de vervanging van de Opperste Leider niets veranderen aan de aard van het verzet.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

        "text": "Dans la guerre que d\u00e9clare Isra\u00ebl contre l\u2019Iran, un \u00e9quilibre des forces s\u2019est dessin\u00e9 : Isra\u00ebl domine l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien iranien, tandis que l\u2019Iran contr\u00f4le celui au-dessus d\u2019Isra\u00ebl. Isra\u00ebl peut frapper n\u2019importe quel lieu du territoire iranien, \u00e9tendu sur 1,6 million de kilom\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s, tout comme l\u2019Iran peut toucher n\u2019importe quel endroit d\u2019Isra\u00ebl, qui ne fait que 20 000 kilom\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s. Au d\u00e9but des hostilit\u00e9s, l\u2019Iran a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 ses missiles balistiques de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente \u2014 accompagn\u00e9s d\u2019un nombre limit\u00e9 de missiles hypersoniques \u2014 pour tester les r\u00e9ponses isra\u00e9liennes et \u00e9puiser ses syst\u00e8mes d\u2019interception multistrates ainsi que les personnels associ\u00e9s. Toutefois, mardi, l\u2019Iran a modifi\u00e9 sa strat\u00e9gie : il a lanc\u00e9 le missile hypersonique de premi\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Fattah\u20111, atteignant avec succ\u00e8s tous les objectifs d\u00e9sign\u00e9s.\n\nDe surcro\u00eet, la premi\u00e8re vague d\u2019attaques surprises isra\u00e9liennes, ainsi que celles visant des cibles secondaires, semblent avoir \u00e9puis\u00e9 le stock de cibles d\u00e8s les premiers jours du conflit. D\u2019un point de vue militaire, cela constitue un dilemme s\u00e9rieux pour les cha\u00eenes de commandement : le catalogue d\u2019objectifs initialement pr\u00e9vu en fonction des intentions politiques a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9. L\u2019\u00e9tat-major isra\u00e9lien requiert d\u00e9sormais de nouvelles directives politiques afin d\u2019\u00e9largir le spectre de ses frappes \u2014 d\u00e9passant le seul programme nucl\u00e9aire, comme annonc\u00e9 initialement, pour viser aussi les capacit\u00e9s balistiques iraniennes.\n\nCependant, le Premier ministre isra\u00e9lien Benjamin Netanyahou nourrit des ambitions bien plus vastes : il vise un changement de r\u00e9gime en Iran. Il a rencontr\u00e9 des membres de l\u2019opposition iranienne et, comme il l\u2019a publi\u00e9 volontairement, accord\u00e9 des interviews \u00e0 Iran International, m\u00e9dia de l\u2019opposition. Il a m\u00eame \u00e9voqu\u00e9 comme \u00ab non exclu \u00bb l\u2019assassinat du grand ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei \u2014 figure spirituelle suivie par des dizaines de millions de personnes. Il a baptis\u00e9 son offensive militaire \u00ab Lion en pleine ascension \u00bb, clin d\u2019\u0153il manifeste au drapeau du Lion et du Soleil de l\u2019opposition, port\u00e9e par Reza Pahlavi, fils du Shah.\n\nPourtant, l\u2019\u00e9limination du Guide supr\u00eame iranien ne changerait pas la dynamique du conflit. En Iran, la mort de Khamenei est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, et son successeur ne sera certainement pas moins hostile \u00e0 Isra\u00ebl ou aux \u00c9tats\u2011Unis. Au vu de l\u2019ampleur de l\u2019impact inflig\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019Iran par les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis et leur alli\u00e9 \u2014 et de la mani\u00e8re dont cette op\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7ue et coordonn\u00e9e entre Isra\u00ebl et Washington \u2014 le remplacement du Guide supr\u00eame ne fera pas fl\u00e9chir la r\u00e9sistance.\n\nAinsi, r\u00e9aliser les ambitions de Netanyahou n\u00e9cessiterait une d\u00e9cision des plus risqu\u00e9es, et certaines conditions essentielles font encore d\u00e9faut \u2014 tant sur le plan politique que militaire. Premi\u00e8rement, Isra\u00ebl doit s\u2019assurer qu\u2019Iran ne peut plus riposter : que son arsenal balistique est \u00e0 sec, ses stocks d\u00e9truits, et qu\u2019il est incapable de remplacer ces munitions. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir atteint ce seuil qu\u2019Isra\u00ebl pourrait passer \u00e0 la phase suivante \u2014 frapper les infrastructures p\u00e9troli\u00e8res et gazi\u00e8res iraniennes, afin d\u2019an\u00e9antir son \u00e9conomie sans retenue. Une telle op\u00e9ration \u00e9largirait consid\u00e9rablement la liste des cibles potentielles de l\u2019aviation isra\u00e9lienne, ouvrant la voie \u00e0 une campagne de bombardements impitoyables.\n\nIsra\u00ebl viserait aussi \u00e0 an\u00e9antir la marine iranienne et \u00e0 d\u00e9manteler son industrie militaire, rendant le pays enti\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rable. Il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 men\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations similaires \u2014 notamment en Syrie, apr\u00e8s la chute de Bachar el-Assad \u2014 frappant sans provocation et alors m\u00eame que Damas n\u2019avait manifest\u00e9 aucune hostilit\u00e9.\n\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, Netanyahou doit semer le chaos total en Iran \u2014 \u00e0 l\u2019image de celui qui r\u00e8gne aujourd\u2019hui en Libye \u2014 car l\u2019opposition ne peut gouverner un pays aussi vaste. Elle manque \u00e0 la fois d\u2019organisation et de moyens. Instaurer le d\u00e9sordre en Iran constitue un objectif strat\u00e9gique majeur : neutraliser durablement l\u2019Iran et ses alli\u00e9s comme menace r\u00e9gionale pour les d\u00e9cennies \u00e0 venir. L\u2019Iran ne partage pas de fronti\u00e8re avec Isra\u00ebl, et plonger un pays de 100 millions d\u2019habitants \u2014 riche en ressources naturelles, entour\u00e9 de sept \u00c9tats voisins, et situ\u00e9 au c\u0153ur d\u2019un corridor \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique mondial vital \u2014 dans le chaos constituerait une invitation ouverte \u00e0 l\u2019intervention \u00e9trang\u00e8re. Les cons\u00e9quences pourraient \u00eatre catastrophiques, impr\u00e9visibles, et profond\u00e9ment d\u00e9stabilisantes pour l\u2019ensemble du continent asiatique.\n\nSubscribe to get access Read more of this content when you subscribe today.

        "paragraph_summary": "In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, a balance of power has emerged where Israel dominates Iranian airspace, while Iran controls the skies over Israel. Both nations possess the capability to strike anywhere within each other's territories. Initially, Iran employed older ballistic missiles and a limited number of hypersonic missiles to test and deplete Israel's multi-layered interception systems. However, Iran has since shifted its strategy, successfully deploying its first-generation hypersonic missile, Fattah-1. Israel's initial surprise attacks quickly exhausted its target list, prompting military leaders to seek new political directives to expand their strike scope beyond Iran's nuclear program to include its ballistic capabilities. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu harbors broader ambitions, including regime change in Iran, and has engaged with Iranian opposition figures. He has even suggested the potential assassination of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, though such an action would not alter the conflict's dynamics. Achieving Netanyahu's goals would require crippling Iran's retaliatory capabilities and creating chaos within the country, akin to the situation in Libya. This strategy aims to neutralize Iran as a regional threat, but it risks catastrophic and destabilizing consequences for the broader region.",

        "text": "The last great campaign of John F. Kennedy\u2019s life was not the battle for reelection he did not live to wage, but the struggle for a sustainable peace with the Soviet Union. To Move the World recalls the extraordinary days from October 1962 to September 1963, when JFK marshaled the power of oratory and his remarkable political skills to establish more peaceful relations with the Soviet Union and a dramatic slowdown in the proliferation of nuclear arms.\n\n\n\nKennedy and his Soviet counterpart, Nikita Khrushchev, led their nations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the two superpowers came eyeball to eyeball at the nuclear abyss. This near-death experience shook both leaders deeply. Jeffrey D. Sachs shows how Kennedy emerged from the Missile crisis with the determination and prodigious skills to forge a new and less threatening direction for the world. Together, he and Khrushchev would pull the world away from the nuclear precipice, charting a path for future peacemakers to follow.\n\n\n\nDuring his final year in office, Kennedy gave a series of speeches in which he pushed back against the momentum of the Cold War to persuade the world that peace with the Soviets was possible. The oratorical high point came on June 10, 1963, when Kennedy delivered the most important foreign policy speech of the modern presidency. He argued against the prevailing pessimism that viewed humanity as doomed by forces beyond its control. Mankind, argued Kennedy, could bring a new peace into reality through a bold vision combined with concrete and practical measures.\n\n\n\nAchieving the first of those measures in the summer of 1963, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, required more than just speechmaking, however. Kennedy had to use his great gifts of persuasion on multiple fronts\u2014with fractious allies, hawkish Republican congressmen, dubious members of his own administration, and the American and world public\u2014to persuade a skeptical world that cooperation between the superpowers was realistic and necessary. Sachs shows how Kennedy campaigned for his vision and opened the eyes of the American people and the world to the possibilities of peace.\n\n\n\nFeaturing the full text of JFK\u2019s speeches from this period, as well as striking photographs, To Move the World gives us a startlingly fresh perspective on Kennedy\u2019s presidency and a model for strong leadership and problem solving in our time.",

Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, both Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev were motivated to steer the world away from nuclear catastrophe. In his final year, Kennedy delivered pivotal speeches, notably on June 10, 1963, advocating for peace with the Soviets and challenging the prevailing Cold War pessimism. His efforts culminated in the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, achieved through persuasive diplomacy with allies, Congress, and the public. Jeffrey D.

        "title": "Spying on Iran: How MI6 infiltrated the IAEA",
        "url": "https://thegrayzone.com/2025/07/01/spying-iran-mi6-infiltrated-iaea/",
        "text": "Leaked confidential files indicate the International Atomic Energy Agency was infiltrated by a veteran British spy who has claimed credit for sanctions on Iran. The documents lend weight to the Islamic Republic\u2019s accusation that the nuclear watchdog secretly colluded with its enemies.\n\nA notorious British MI6 agent infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on London\u2019s behalf, according to leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone. The agent, Nicholas Langman, is a veteran intelligence operative who claims credit for helping engineer the West\u2019s economic war on Iran.\n\nLangman\u2019s identity first surfaced in journalistic accounts of his role in deflecting accusations that British intelligence played a role in the death of Princess Diana. He was later accused by Greek authorities of overseeing the abduction and torture of Pakistani migrants in Athens.\n\nIn both cases, UK authorities issued censorship orders forbidding the press from publishing his name. But Greek media, which was under no such obligation, confirmed that Langman was one of the MI6 assets withdrawn from Britain\u2019s embassy in Athens.\n\nThe Grayzone discovered the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the journeyman British operative in a trove of leaked papers detailing the activities of Torchlight, a prolific British intelligence cutout. The bio of the longtime MI6 officer reveals he \u201cled large, inter-agency teams to identify and defeat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons technology, including by innovative technical means and sanctions.\u201d\n\nIn particular, the MI6 agent says he \u201cworked to prevent WMD proliferation through\u2026 support for the [IAEA] and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] and through high level international partnerships.\u201d\n\nLangman\u2019s CV credits him with playing a major role in organizing the sanctions regime on Iran by \u201c[building] highly effective and mutually supportive relations across government and with senior US, European, Middle and Far Eastern colleagues for strategy\u201d between 2010 and 2012. He boasts in his bio that this achievement \u201cenabled [the] major diplomatic success of [the] Iranian nuclear and sanctions agreement.\u201d\n\nThe influence Langman claimed to have exerted on the IAEA adds weight to Iranian allegations that the international nuclear regulation body colluded with the West and Israel to undermine its sovereignty. The Iranian government has alleged that the IAEA supplied the identities of its top nuclear scientists to Israeli intelligence, enabling their assassinations, and provided critical intelligence to the US and Israel on the nuclear facilities they bombed during their military assault this June.\n\nThis June 12, under the direction of its Secretary General Rafael Grossi, the IAEA issued a clearly politicized report recycling questionable past allegations to accuse Iran of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The next day, Israel attacked the country, assassinating nine nuclear scientists as well as numerous top military officials and hundreds of civilians.\n\nIranian former Vice President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif has since called for the IAEA\u2019s Grossi to be sacked, accusing him of having \u201cabetted the slaughter of innocents in the country.\u201d This June 28, the Iranian government broke ties with the IAEA, refusing to allow its inspectors into the country.\n\nWhile Iranian officials may have had no idea about the involvement of a shadowy figure like Langman in IAEA business, it would likely come as little surprise to Tehran that the supposedly multilateral agency had been compromised by a Western intelligence agency.\n\nLangman\u2019s name placed under official UK censorship order\n\nIn 2016, Langman was named a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, the same title bestowed on fictional British spy James Bond. By that point, the supposed secret agent held the dubious distinction of being publicly \u2018burned\u2019 as an MI6 operative on two separate occasions.\n\nFirst, in 2001, journalist Stephen Dorril revealed that Langman had arrived in Paris weeks prior to Princess Diana\u2019s fatal car crash in the city on August 31 1997, and was subsequently charged with conducting \u201cinformation operations\u201d to deflect widespread public speculation British intelligence was responsible for her death.\n\nThen, in 2005, he was formally accused by Greek authorities of complicity in the abduction and torture of 28 Pakistanis in Athens. The Pakistanis, all migrant workers, were suspected of having had contact with individuals accused of perpetrating the 7/7 bombings in London, July 2005.\n\nBrutally beaten and threatened with guns in their mouths, the victims \u201cwere convinced their interrogators were British.\u201d When Greek media named Langman as the MI6 operative who oversaw the migrants\u2019 torture, British news outlets universally complied with a government D-notice \u2013 an official censorship order \u2013 and kept his identity under wraps when reporting on the scandal.\n\nLondon vehemently denied any British involvement in torturing the migrants, with then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw dismissing the charge as \u201cutter nonsense.\u201d In January 2006 though, London admitted MI6 officers were indeed present during the Pakistanis\u2019 torture, although officials insisted the operatives played no active part in their arrests, questioning or abuse.\n\nFollowing his withdrawal from Athens, Langman returned to London to head the UK Foreign Office\u2019s Iran Department, a shift which highlights his importance to MI6 and suggests the British government had no qualms about his allegedly brutal evidence gathering methods.\n\nBritain\u2019s Foreign Office collaborates closely with MI6, whose agents use it as cover just as the CIA does with State Department diplomatic postings.\n\nMI6\u2019s man on Iran takes credit for \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy\n\nWhile leading the Foreign Office\u2019s Iran Department from 2006 \u2013 2008, Langman oversaw a team seeking to \u201cdevelop understanding\u201d of the Iranian government\u2019s \u201cnuclear program.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly what that \u201cunderstanding\u201d entailed. But the document makes clear that Langman then \u201cgenerated confidence\u201d in that assessment among \u201cEuropean, US and Middle Eastern agencies\u201d in order to \u201cdelay programme [sic] and pressurise Iran to negotiate.\u201d The reference to \u201cMiddle Eastern agencies\u201d strongly implied MI6 cooperation with Israel\u2019s Mossad intelligence service.\n\nIn April 2006, Tehran announced it had successfully enriched uranium for the first time, although officials denied any intention to do so for military purposes. This development may have triggered Langman\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has rejected any suggestion it harbors ambitions to possess nuclear weapons. Its denials were corroborated by a November 2007 US National Intelligence Estimate expressing \u201chigh confidence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted\u201d any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment remained unchanged for several years, and was reportedly shared by the Mossad, despite Benjamin Netanyhau\u2019s constant declarations that Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nLangman\u2019s IAEA support work overlaps with Iran sanctions blitz\n\nInternational governmental attitudes towards Iran changed abruptly between 2010 and \u201812. During this period, Western states and intergovernmental institutions initiated an array of harshly punitive measures against the country, while Israel ramped up its deadly covert operations against Iran\u2019s nuclear scientists.\n\nThis period precisely overlapped with Langman\u2019s tenure at the Counter-Proliferation Centre of the UK Foreign Office. His bio implies he used this position to influence the IAEA and other UN-affiliated organizations to foment a campaign of global hostility towards Iran.\n\nIn June 2010, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1929, which froze the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 assets, and banned overseas financial institutions from opening offices in Tehran. A month later, the Obama administration adopted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. This set off a global chain of copycat sanctions by Washington\u2019s vassals, who often imposed even more stringent measures than those levied by the UN and US.\n\nIn March 2012, the EU voted unanimously to cut Iranian banks out of the SWIFT international banking network. That October, the bloc imposed the harshest sanctions to date, restricting trade, financial services, energy and technology, along with bans on the provision of insurance to Iranian companies by European firms.\n\nBBC reporting on the sanctions acknowledged European officials merely suspected Tehran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but lacked concrete proof. And behind the scenes, the MI6 operative Langman was claiming credit for helping legitimize the allegations against Iran.\n\nNuclear agreement lays foundations for war\n\nFollowing the Western-led campaign isolation of Iran from 2010 \u2013 2012, over its purported nuclear weapon program, the Obama administration negotiated a July 2015 agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the JCPOA\u2019s terms, the Islamic Republic agreed to limit its nuclear research activities in return for sanctions relief. In the years that followed, the IAEA was granted virtually unlimited access to Tehran\u2019s nuclear complexes, ostensibly to ensure the facilities were not used to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nAlong the way, IAEA inspectors collected vast amounts of information on the sites, including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents. The Iranian government has since accused the Agency of furnishing the top secret profiles of its nuclear scientists to Israel. These include the godfather of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Mohsen Fakrizadeh, who was first publicly named in a menacing 2019 powerpoint presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The following year, the Mossad assassinated Fakrizadeh in broad daylight with a remote-controlled machine gun.\n\nInternal IAEA documents leaked this June indicated that IAEA Secretary General Rafael Grossi has enjoyed a much closer relationship with Israeli officials than was previously known, and suggested he leveraged his cozy ties with Tel Aviv to secure his current position.\n\nDuring a June 24 interview with Fox News\u2019 war-crazed anchor Martha MacCallum, Grossi did not deny making the inflammatory claim that \u201c900 pounds of potentially enriched uranium was taken to an ancient site near Isfahan.\u201d Instead the IAEA director asserted, \u201cWe do not have any information on the whereabouts of this material.\u201d\n\nWell before Grossi rose to the top of the IAEA with Western and Israeli backing, the agency appears to have been penetrated by a British intelligence agent who took responsibility in his bio for engineering the West\u2019s economic attack on Iran.\n\nThe IAEA has not responded to an email from The Grayzone seeking clarification on its relationship with Langman and the MI6.",

His efforts reportedly involved fostering international cooperation to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, aligning with the period when harsh sanctions were imposed on the country. The revelations have intensified Iranian criticism of the IAEA, leading to a severance of ties, and have raised questions about the agency's impartiality and its relationship with Western intelligence agencies.",

        "text": "After Ted Cruz\u2019s humiliation by Tucker Carlson, attention has focused on a top staffer of the self-proclaimed \u201cleading defender of Israel in the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nOn June 18, former Fox host Tucker Carlson published a video which, though marketed as an interview, was more of a snuff film. Over the course of two hours, Carlson can be seen rhetorically disemboweling his debate opponent, US Senator Ted Cruz, on the politician\u2019s determination to see the US attack Iran on Israel\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhile Cruz presents himself as a Christian Zionist moved by his own zealotry to support Israel, the politician\u2019s Tel Aviv-driven policy line can also be traced back to his Senior Advisor for Policy and Communications, an Israeli-born Zionist lobbyist named Omri Ceren.\n\nBefore overseeing Cruz\u2019s public relations, Ceren managed his foreign policy docket as his national security advisor. Prior to joining the Senator\u2019s staff, Ceren served as the press director for The Israel Project, a Zionist pressure group which was forced to close down after being exposed as a de facto Israeli government front by Al Jazeera\u2019s groundbreaking undercover investigation, The Lobby. Before that, Ceren cut his teeth lobbying for Ivory Coast dictator Laurent Gbagbo, who relied on Ceren as a registered foreign agent lending his marketing expertise to the embattled regime.\n\nIn discussing Tucker Carlson\u2019s demolition of Ted Cruz, I pointed out that Cruz\u2019s foreign policy handler is Omri Ceren, a longtime Israel lobbyist and Israeli citizen aligned with Netanyahu Ceren\u2019s sister, Merav, is an ex-Israeli Defense Min staffer who served in Mike Waltz\u2019s NSC pic.twitter.com/BqAnYxXlw0 \u2014 Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) June 20, 2025\n\nCeren has consistently opposed a nuclear deal with Iran since at least 2015, when he declared that any agreement would simply ensure Tehran was \u201cable to cheat with impunity.\u201d At a talk hosted by the neocon Hudson Institute think tank in 2018, he suggested Washington should continue preaching about \u201cfreedom\u201d and encouraging Iranian protesters to pursue regime change while simultaneously maintaining Trump\u2019s ban on Iranians entering the US.\n\nOmri Ceren, right wing Israel lobbyist from The Israel Project, says the US should preach \u201cfreedom\u201d to Iranians while maintaining Trump\u2019s ban on Iranians seeking entry to the US. So much solidarity here. pic.twitter.com/8wYl29dJIn \u2014 Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) January 16, 2018\n\nOmri\u2019s sister, Merav Ceren, previously worked under the supervision of the Israeli Defense Ministry, as well as another Israeli government cutout in Washington, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The pair were born in Haifa, Israel, with Merav embarking on her career of Israel lobbying as a college student.\n\nUpon Merav Ceren\u2019s appointment to head the Israel and Iran desks of Trump\u2019s National Security Council in April 2025, one Israeli publication declared her \u201cOne of Our Own.\u201d The authors went on to boast that Ceren\u2019s \u201cpresence\u2026 in the discussion rooms gives significant space to voice Israeli interests.\u201d Just a month later, however, she was fired as tensions between the Republican Party\u2019s America First and Israel First wings came to a head.\n\nWhile his sister looked for a new gig, Omri Ceren continued to represent his home country as the national security advisor to a senator who has pantomimed \u201cAmerica First\u201d conservatism while zealously advancing Israel\u2019s objectives. Cruz\u2019s messaging since the US bombed Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities on June 21 clearly bears his Israeli advisor\u2019s imprimatur.\n\nSince the attack, Cruz has posted 14 comments on Twitter/X. 12 of them consisted of breathless statements cheering the bombing or attacks on opponents of the war, whom he branded as \u201cthe death to America crowd.\u201d The remaining two posts expressed affection for the senator\u2019s hometown NBA team, the Houston Rockets.",

        "text": "Leaked war plans sent to the US NSC instructed Kiev to carry out \u201cISIS\u201d-style drone attacks on Russian trains and rail bridges, foreshadowing a series of deadly Ukrainian attacks this May and June.\n\nA coterie of British and American academics advising the US National Security Council explicitly urged Ukraine adopt the tactics of ISIS in a detailed proposal for \u201canti-rail drone operations,\u201d according to leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone.\n\nThe aggressive war plans recommended in the files eerily foreshadowed Ukraine\u2019s Operation Spider Web, which consisted of a series of brazen drone attacks waged inside Russia between May 24 and June 1 \u2013 the eve of scheduled negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. A pair of Ukrainian bombings of Russian trains in Bryansk on May 31 and Kursk and the following day left seven dead, and injured more than 30 people, including two children.\n\nThe attacks on Russian rail infrastructure have continued since the launch of Operation Spiderweb, suggesting the British-born strategy has heavily influenced the thinking of Kiev\u2019s increasingly desperate military.\n\nThe leaked plans reviewed by The Grayzone explore the use of \u201cinexpensive drones\u201d as \u201ca low-cost means for disrupting Russian logistics,\u201d but also include blueprints for terror attacks composed by three \u201cdrone experts\u201d before being passed to the Biden administration\u2019s then-Director for Russia at the National Council, Col. Tim Wright.\n\nThose experts belonged to a secret academic-intelligence cell called Project Alchemy, whose existence was first exposed by The Grayzone, and which was founded with a mission to \u201cto keep Ukraine fighting\u201d by imposing \u201cstrategic dilemmas, costs and frictions upon Russia.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported here, Project Alchemy researchers called \u201cto take a page from ISIS\u2019 playbook,\u201d presenting the jihadist group\u2019s psychological operations as a model for Ukrainian attacks on Russian civilians. The Grayzone can now reveal that Alchemy\u2019s team also urged US war planners to look to the Islamic State for inspiration in using commercial drones for attacks on Russian civilian targets.\n\nOne academic advising the Alchemy cell, Zachary Kallenborn of George Mason University, recommended Ukraine carry out \u201ctwo-stage attacks like ISIS did frequently\u201d on Russian-held railways, suggesting that Kiev first \u201cbreak the track, and wait for the engineers to come to fix it, then use the drone to kill them.\u201d In other words: double tap kamikaze drone strikes.\n\n\u201cDrones also could provide ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] in finding and tracking trains to support larger actions,\u201d with satellite imagery exploited for targeting purposes, Kallenborn added.\n\nAn unnamed Durham University researcher consulted by the NSC declared that \u201cISIS showed in their battles against the Iraqi military\u201d that drones could be \u201cmodified via a simple drop mechanism\u2026 to serve as effective munitions delivery platforms.\u201d The conversion of everyday commercial drones into munitions-bearing killing machines would prove one of the most deadly tactics of the war for both sides.\n\nThe origin of Kiev\u2019s \u2018drone swarm\u2019 offensives?\n\nDuring a meeting between military historians from Kansas State University and faculty from the Command and General Staff School at Ft. Leavenworth, academic war planners discussed \u201cthe idea of using inexpensive drones to prevent Russia from using captured Ukrainian railroads to resupply their combat units.\u201d The academics then delivered the proposal to \u201cthree drone experts in the Ukraine Working Group who each provided their analysis for how to achieve this.\u201d\n\nA separate leaked document describes the Working Group as a vast collection of \u201cstrategic studies, military technology and Eastern Europe regional studies experts\u201d who \u201ccame together to analyze the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to think deeply about policy options\u201d which could \u201cassist Ukraine\u2019s defense (short of deploying combat forces).\u201d The Working Group was composed of \u201capproximately 60 experts hailing from states throughout NATO.\u201d\n\nThe operations file begins by noting that, \u201cwhen operating in its own territory,\u201d the Russian army \u201crelies on its well-developed rail system which is integrated with Ukraine\u2019s domestic rail network.\u201d As Russian forces moved deeper into Ukraine, the Working Group forecasted that they would \u201cincreasingly need to rely on Ukraine\u2019s rail system or face logistic-induced paralysis as their lines of supply lengthen and their road-based logistical become increasingly inefficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question should therefore be posed as to whether inexpensive drones can be used to hinder Russian efforts to use those portions of Ukraine\u2019s railway network they have captured,\u201d the document stated. An academic using the initials \u201cM.E.D.\u201d who hailed from Britain\u2019s prestigious Durham University declared, \u201cif Ukrainian forces could sustain attacks on occupied railroads, they could hamper Russian forces\u2019 ability to operate deeper inside of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhile believing it \u201cunlikely that drone attacks, even kamikaze attacks, could bring down bridges\u201d \u2013 although this \u201cwould be ideal\u201d \u2013 they suggested \u201ccommercial drones could be modified with a sufficient explosive to inflict meaningful damage of railroads, it would greatly complicate Russian efforts.\u201d After all, \u201ceven a small amount of damage would force rail traffic to stop until repairs could be made to the line.\u201d\n\nThese attacks \u201ccould be carried out away from major stations likely to have active air defenses,\u201d and \u201caugment attacks by stay-behind guerrilla forces.\u201d M.E.D. cited a July 2018 paper on Islamic State\u2019s \u201cinnovative\u201d use of drones published by the West Point military academy\u2019s \u201ccombating terrorism center\u201d as a reference point for such tactics. It discussed \u201ccreative ways\u201d ISIS had deployed \u201csimple, low-cost, and replaceable devices\u201d to devastating effect against its adversaries, which could be replicated by the US and its allies.\n\nM.E.D. postulated that \u201cif larger drones could be procured, of if light commercial aircraft could be modified to fly as drones, they might be able to damage rail bridges enough to force substantive repairs, which would greatly slow rail traffic\u201d \u2013 a proposal which closely resembles the June 1 attacks on rail bridges in Russia\u2019s Bryansk and Kursk regions. \u201cAnother possibility\u201d was \u201cto use a number of commercial drones in a swarm attack\u201d comparable to Ansar Allah\u2019s September 2019 strikes on Aramco sites in Saudi Arabia, \u201cwherein a number of thermite munitions are used to weaken steel or concrete infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if the rail bridges are not destroyed outright weakening key areas \u2013 perhaps through the use of suicide drones striking them directly after triggering their payload \u2013 would necessitate close inspection and hinder the ability to use the bridges safely,\u201d M.E.D. concluded. Throughout the proxy war, Ukraine has regularly deployed drone swarms against Russian targets, in some cases inflicting significant damage.\n\n\u201cTrack switches would probably be good targets too\u201d\n\nAnother \u201cdrone expert\u201d consulted by the St. Andrews cabal was Dominika Kunertove, formerly of Swiss university ETH Zurich\u2019s Center for Security Studies. Kunertove currently serves as director of \u201ca research project on future drone warfare and technology\u201d at the Atlantic Council, the semi-official, arms-industry funded think tank of NATO in Washington DC.\n\nKunertove suggested using drones to strike \u201canything that uses\u201d railroads, rather than railways themselves, as this would mean \u201cneither side would be able to use railroads for some time (in case [Ukraine] recaptures\u2026territory previously held by Russians.\u201d This June, Kiev destroyed a military supply train carrying heavy armor, including tanks and artillery systems in an effort dubbed Operation Spiderweb 2.0.\n\nMeanwhile, Zachary Kallenborn, a self-described \u201cwar doctor in training\u201d from George Mason University\u2019s Schar School, noted the \u201climited payloads\u201d offered by commercial drones, with \u201conly a few pounds\u201d of explosive able to be attached to them, meant \u201cthe best bet would be to hit sensitive, difficult to repair targets to maximize harm.\u201d While admitting to \u201cnot know too much about rail infrastructure,\u201d he suggested \u201cswitching yards, engine houses, or the equipment to load and unload trains\u201d as prospective targets.\n\n\u201cTrack switches would probably be good targets too,\u201d Kallenborn said, as \u201ca hit would disrupt multiple lines and\u2026would be tougher to repair.\u201d He went on to advocate \u201c[thinking] about how drones can support broader anti-rail operations.\u201d While \u201cslowing\u201d operations intended were \u201cdefinitely good,\u201d Kallenborn believed it would be \u201cbe more useful to use drones\u201d to target \u201csupply trains themselves,\u201d echoing Dominika Kunertove\u2019s suggestions.\n\nKallenborn specifically highlighted five commercial drone models which could be outfitted with explosives and sent to disrupt rail operations, including the $2,200 DJI Mavic III, which Ukrainian forces used in their attack on a Russian fuel train this May 24.\n\n\u201cAll of these would need to be modified to allow carrying and dropping of any munitions, which will increase the cost,\u201d Kallenborn wrote. But \u201cdepending on model, there may be secondary suppliers who can help with that,\u201d he noted.\n\nStill, Kallenborn appeared to express some cynicism about the utility of drones. He urged the National Security Council to \u201cconsider the opportunity cost of drones vs other approaches.\u201d He speculated there were \u201cprobably a lot of tracks\u2026 in relatively isolated areas where planting explosives by hand might be plausible and might be better timed to fix a train.\u201d\n\nThat task that could be handily carried out by secret Operation Gladio-style \u201cstay-behind guerrilla forces\u201d which other British academics proposed standing up as part of a proposal to strike \u201csensitive, difficult to repair targets to maximize harm\u201d in Russian territory.\n\nIn the face of constant Russian battlefield gains and a looming reduction in Washington\u2019s military aid to Ukraine, the British government remains committed to spending vast sums on ensuring Kiev has a vast supply of drones at its disposal at all times.\n\nAs Ukraine places drone attacks on Russian infrastructure at the heart of its increasingly desperate strategy, Project Alchemy\u2019s ISIS-inspired plans are more relevant than ever.",

        "text": "A Trump official tells The Grayzone that Israel\u2019s Mossad is using CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US CENTCOM\u2019s Gen. Michael Kurilla to influence Trump with cooked intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Inside the White House, dissenters have been isolated, setting the stage for a regime change war that could cost American lives.\n\nListen to/watch Max Blumenthal read this article here.\n\nAn official in the administration of President Donald Trump has told The Grayzone that CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Kurilla have become vehicles for Israel\u2019s Mossad and military as they seek to manipulate the US into attacking Iran. The Trump official referred to Ratcliffe as \u201cMossad\u2019s stenographer.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official, Ratcliffe and Kurilla have pressured Trump to join Israel\u2019s war more directly by regurgitating overblown briefings they received from the Israeli military and Mossad director David Barnea \u2013 but without informing the president that the intelligence was derived from a foreign third party.\n\nDuring the Trump administration\u2019s meetings with Israeli intelligence officials including Barnea, the official said the Israelis have demonstrated a single-minded focus on regime change, clamoring for authorization to assassinate Iran\u2019s leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Israeli officials have emphasized that the moment to take out Khamenei is now.\n\nThe issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capacity is of secondary concern in the Israelis\u2019 presentations, which the official characterized as tactless, hyper-aggressive exercises in fear-mongering. At one point, the Trump official recalled, an Israeli intelligence briefer declared that Iran could transfer a nuclear weapon to Yemen\u2019s Houthi militia in less than a week.\n\nAccording to the official, Trump\u2019s lead negotiator with Iran, Steve Witkoff, has been pushing the president to preserve the diplomatic track. However, an Israeli assassination of Khamanei would almost certainly be the nail in the coffin of nuclear negotiations \u2013 which is precisely why the Israelis seem so determined to do it.\n\nIf the US enters the war by attacking Iran, the official fears that Iran will activate IRGC-backed Popular Mobilization Units to attack US troops and bases in Iraq and Syria, leading to American casualties and triggering escalation well beyond the initial scope of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nHaving launched a damaging war of attrition with Iran, Tel Aviv is deploying every mechanism at its disposal to compel the US to lurch headlong into the conflict it initiated, but which it can not finish on its own.\n\nInside the Trump administration, the source told The Grayzone that top officials who have questioned the logic of attacking Iran, such as Director of Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and her deputy, former CIA officer and director for the National Counter-Terrorism Center Joe Kent, have been excluded from meetings by White House Chief of Staff Suzie Wiles.\n\nTaking the lead in briefing the president is a highly suggestible CIA director groomed by Israel since he first entered Congress.\n\nAIPAC leader boasts of influence over top Trump natsec officials in leaked audio obtained by @MaxBlumenthal At a closed AIPAC session, the group's CEO explained how they cultivated special \"access\" to Rubio, Waltz, and Ratcliffe Full audio & report: https://t.co/eVrwghYzox pic.twitter.com/OkZ7sVpWBZ \u2014 The Grayzone (@TheGrayzoneNews) April 9, 2025\n\nAIPAC director boasts of influence over Ratcliffe\n\nThis April, The Grayzone released exclusive audio of remarks by AIPAC CEO Elliot Brandt to an off-the-record Israel lobby session in Washington DC. Boasting of his organization\u2019s success in recruiting members of Congress, he described CIA Director John Ratcliffe as a \u201clifeline\u201d inside the administration.\n\n\u201cYou know that one of the first candidates I ever met with as an AIPAC professional in my job when he was a candidate for Congress was a guy named John Ratcliffe,\u201d Brandt recalled. \u201cHe was challenging a long time member of Congress in Dallas. I said, this guy looks like he could win the race, and, we go talk to him. He had a good understanding of issues, and a couple of weeks ago, he took the oath as the CIA director, for crying out loud. This is a guy that we had a chance to speak to, so there are, there are a lot \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call them lifelines, but there are lifelines in there.\u201d\n\nBesides Ratcliffe, AIPAC CEO Elliott Brandt also named Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, two former Republican congressmen cultivated by AIPAC in advance of their appointment to key national security positions in the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThey all have relationships with key AIPAC leaders from their communities,\u201d said the AIPAC CEO. \u201cSo the lines of communication are good should there be something questionable or curious, and we need access on the conversation.\u201d\n\nThis May, Waltz was outed by colleagues for secretly coordinating with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to orchestrate a US attack on Iran, costing him his job as National Security Council director. Secretary of State Rubio assumed the role of acting National Security Director, granting him control over more cabinet level positions than any US official since Henry Kissinger. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe quickly emerged as the key channel of Israeli influence in the administration.\n\nThe CIA director has come a long way since entering politics as the mayor of a backwater Texas town with a population of 7000.\n\nA small town Texas mayor becomes big time Israeli asset\n\nWith no experience in the US military or intelligence, Ratcliffe spent the early part of his political career as mayor of Heath, a small town outside of Dallas, which was broken by a year-long stint as a US Attorney between 2007-08. He entered Congress in 2014, and emerged two years later as one of Trump\u2019s fiercest attack dogs on the Judiciary Committee. The backbencher also served on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nTrump rewarded Ratcliffe\u2019s loyalty by nominating him as Director of National Intelligence in 2019, but quickly withdrew the nomination after Ratcliffe was exposed for lying about his role in several federal terrorism cases.\n\nHis most absurd embellishment was on the prosecution of the directors of the Dallas-based Holy Land Foundation, in which he boasted that \u201che convicted individuals who were funneling money to Hamas behind the front of a charitable organization.\u201d In fact, Ratcliffe played no discernible role in the case at all, prompting several Republican senators to withdraw support for his nomination when the lie came to light.\n\nIt is notable nonetheless that Ratcliffe sought credit for taking down the Holy Land Foundation, as the case was one of the most politicized and legally dubious prosecutions of the Bush-era \u201cwar on terror,\u201d leading to life sentences for Palestinian American defendants whose only crime was sending charitable donations to organizations in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip which were not on any government watchlist, and which also received support from the International Committee of the Red Cross and USAID. What\u2019s more, the case was heavily influenced by Israeli intelligence.\n\nFollowing a mistrial that proved embarrassing for the US government, Israel\u2019s Mossad dispatched an agent to Texas to testify against the Holy Land directors. The judge allowed the agent to testify in secret, with the courtroom cleared, and under an assumed identity as \u201cAvi.\u201d The agent proceeded to brandish a series of questionable documents that supposedly proved the Holy Land Foundation was set up as the nexus of a vast terrorist financing network that had enabled several suicide bombings by Hamas.\n\nWhile Ratcliffe\u2019s fantastical claims about his role in the case tanked his nomination in 2019, Trump successfully installed him as DNI the following year, paving the way for his nomination as CIA director upon Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\nIn 2024, the Jewish Daily Forward listed Ratcliffe among \u201cTrump\u2019s Jewish advisors and pro-Israel cabinet.\u201d\n\nChief of Staff Suzie Wiles isolates Trump with \u201cIsrael\u2019s favorite general\u201d\n\nThe Trump official told The Grayzone that White House Chief of Staff Suzie Wiles has ensured that the president remains surrounded by Ratcliffe and Gen. Michael Kurilla in briefings related to Iran.\n\nRatcliffe is said to take dictation from the Mossad and read the documents they\u2019ve prepared to the president without any sense of critical detachment, or disclose that the assessments came from a foreign liaison rather than US intelligence.\n\nThen there is Gen. Kurilla, who appears singularly focused in meetings with Trump on making the case for a US attack on Iran. In 2024, the pro-Netanyahu Israeli outlet Israel Hayon described Kurilla as \u201ca vital asset to Israel.\u201d The UK\u2019s Telegraph referred to Kurilla this June as \u201cIsrael\u2019s favorite general.\u201d\n\nFormer Pentagon officials have even speculated that Israel\u2019s decision to launch an unprovoked surprise attack on Iran this June 13 was partially influenced by Kurilla\u2019s looming retirement in July, as Tel Aviv did not want to go to war without him present at CENTCOM.\n\nThe Trump official told The Grayzone that Wiles has excluded Trump\u2019s Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, from crucial meetings where US intervention in Iran was discussed. That included a June 8 meeting at Camp David where Ratcliffe used a clumsy sports metaphor to insist that Iran was just days away from producing a nuclear weapon: \u201cIt\u2019s like saying a football team marched 99 yards down the field, got to the one yard line and, oh, they don\u2019t have the intention to score,\u201d he argued to Trump.\n\nTwo days later, Gabbard released a social media video invoking the American military\u2019s destruction of the Japanese city of Hiroshima with a nuclear bomb in 1945, and warned that a similar horror could soon unfold because \u201cpolitical elite warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers.\u201d\n\nTrump was reportedly infuriated by her comments. Asked by a reporter about Gabbard\u2019s testimony this March that Iran had not restarted its nuclear weapons program, Trump grumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said,\u201d then echoed Ratcliffe\u2019s view \u2013 and by extension, that of the Israelis: \u201cI think they were very close to having [a nuclear weapon].\u201d\n\nThis may explain why Gabbard released a June 20 statement on Twitter/X insisting that her views on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment were faithfully aligned with Trump\u2019s, and had been distorted by a \u201cdishonest media\u201d seeking to \u201cmanufacture division.\u201d Though the statement reaffirmed her commitment to President Trump, her assessment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program did not differ from the evaluation she delivered in March, which determined Iran was not currently pursuing a nuclear bomb.\n\n\u201cAmerica has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months,\u201d Gabbard claimed on Twitter/X, \u201cif they decide to finalize the assembly.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Trump official, Chief of Staff Wiles has also excluded Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth from meetings on Iran, relying instead on Kurilla to represent the US military.\n\nVice President JD Vance has held a parallel series of meetings on Iran, the official said. In contrast to those controlled by Wiles, Vance has encouraged robust debate and included diverse perspectives. In public, however, Vance is constrained by the obligation to demonstrate loyalty to Trump.\n\nFor his part, Trump\u2019s views are said to be shaped by constant exposure to Fox News, which has transformed in the past two weeks into a 24/7 commercial for war on Iran. Fox News\u2019 coverage has become so transparently influenced by Israel\u2019s propaganda machine that Steve Bannon, the former White House chief of staff and intellectual architect of the America First movement, called for a Foreign Agents Registration Act investigation of the network.\n\nAs Trump heads back to Washington on June 21, Bannon lamented that \u201cthe party is on,\u201d suggesting the president had decided to go to war on Israel\u2019s behalf.",

        "paragraph_summary": "An article from The Grayzone reveals that an official from the Trump administration claims Israel's Mossad is manipulating CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Kurilla to influence President Trump with exaggerated intelligence on Iran's nuclear program. This manipulation aims to push the US into a conflict with Iran, potentially leading to regime change and American casualties. The official describes Ratcliffe as a \"stenographer\" for Mossad, regurgitating Israeli intelligence without disclosing its foreign origin to Trump. Israeli officials, during meetings with the Trump administration, have focused on regime change, even suggesting the assassination of Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Meanwhile, dissenters within the administration, such as Director of Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, have been sidelined by White House Chief of Staff Suzie Wiles. The article also highlights AIPAC's influence over key Trump national security officials, including Ratcliffe, and the role of media, particularly Fox News, in shaping public opinion towards a potential war with Iran.",

        "text": "Four senior executives at Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI have been formally appointed lieutenant colonels in the US Army following the creation of a \u201cspecial\u201d unit created for rich Big Tech mavens seeking military leadership roles.\n\nOn June 13, the Army announced the creation of Detachment 201, otherwise known as the \u201cExecutive Innovation Corps,\u201d which it describes as \u201ca new initiative designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation.\u201d\n\nFour ultra-wealthy executives from top tech companies were sworn in to the unit ahead of President Trump\u2019s heavily promoted military parade, which was itself sponsored by Palantir. The Army\u2019s top spokesman declared that Detachment 201 was \u201cbeing created to bring in tech innovation executives leaders to help the Army\u201d with the recruitment and the subsequent training of \u201ctech focused people.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy bringing private-sector know-how into uniform, Det. 201 is supercharging efforts like the Army Transformation Initiative, which aims to make the force leaner, smarter, and more lethal,\u201d the Army wrote in an official statement.\n\nGEN George and I are thrilled to welcome four brilliant minds from the tech sector to the @USArmy! Today, we commissioned four exceptional individuals as Lieutenant Colonels in the Army's Detachment 201 (Executive Innovation Corps).\n\nTheir unique skills will be instrumental in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/zyZTaDNKOW \u2014 Secretary of the Army (@SecArmy) June 14, 2025\n\nPalantir is by far the S&P 500\u2019s top performing stock of the year, thanks in large part to the gargantuan contracts it has raked in from the Trump administration. According to the company\u2019s founder, Alex Karp, Palantir \u201cis here to disrupt\u2026 and when it\u2019s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.\u201d\n\nShares of the dystopian data firm, which is named after the all-seeing orb used by the evil wizard Saruman to surveil Middle Earth in the Lord of the Rings, skyrocketed to an all-time high following Israel\u2019s unprovoked assault on Iran.\n\nElsewhere, Karp has eagerly embraced the model of disaster capitalism, remarking, \u201cbad times are very good for Palantir because we build products\u2026 that are built for danger.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Palantir has come to dominate the Western information sphere, and now enjoys unfettered access to the sensitive data of citizens in countries from the US to the UK. With customers including the Department of Defense, CIA, NSA, FBI, ICE, and the Special Operations Command, Palantir has become a one-stop shop for weaponized AI-based data analysis. Amid the ruins of the national security state\u2019s obsessive search for enemies overseas, Palantir built a reputation for being both user-friendly and slavishly obedient to the military establishment.\n\n\u201cIf you do not feel comfortable supporting the legitimate efforts of America and its allies in the context of war, don\u2019t join Palantir,\u201d Karp declared.\n\nIn an article published on the day that military officials revealed the creation of Detachment 201, Mumbai-born Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar revealed he was among the four members of the \u201cnation\u2019s business elite\u201d selected for a \u201cspecial corps\u201d meant to \u201cdeploy their technical talents in service of the [US] government.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater today, on the eve of the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th birthday, I will raise my right hand, take an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and commission as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve\u2019s newly formed Detachment 201: Executive Innovation Corps,\u201d he boasted.\n\nSankar was joined by what he described as \u201csome of the most impressive minds from the world of technology: Kevin Weil, the chief product officer of OpenAI; Andrew \u201cBoz\u201d Bosworth, the chief technology officer of Meta; and Bob McGrew, formerly the chief research officer of OpenAI and engineering director of Palantir Technologies, where I work as chief technology officer.\u201d\n\nThe creation of the techie Poindexter Patrol was necessary, Sankar suggested, due to a geopolitical \u201csea change\u201d in which \u201cWars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific\u201d have \u201cfocused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization.\u201d\n\nDespite his obvious glee at being fast tracked to military leadership, Sankar acknowledged it was an unusual arrangement.\n\n\u201cA decade ago, it would\u2019ve been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly align with the U.S. military. Equally, it would\u2019ve been out of character for the military to enlist the support of the nation\u2019s business elite\u2014 much less to create a special corps so they could deploy their technical talents in service of the government.\u201d\n\nThe Palantir executive pointed to \u201cexploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes from shipping containers\u201d as attacks which \u201cprove that technology has once again changed the battlefield,\u201d and that \u201cour military has to change with it.\u201d\n\nWith their newly-minted lieutenant colonels a world away, Palantir\u2019s corporate officer corps will not be rallying the troops for the next war. But safely ensconced behind their digital curtain, they\u2019ll be watching \u2014 and talking the next generation of nerds into signing up, too.",

        "text": "Leaked files reviewed by The Grayzone expose the covert war waged by British intelligence against Russia in the Black Sea, outlining Ukrainian \u201choney trap\u201d plots along with blueprints for blowing up the Kerch Bridge.\n\nSensitive documents reviewed by The Grayzone indicate that the United Kingdom is the central architect behind Ukrainian military operations targeting Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet. Among other explosive findings, the files reveal high-ranking British military and intelligence figures drew up detailed plans to \u201cmaximize attrition of [Moscow\u2019s] Black Sea Fleet,\u201d plotted to blow up the Kerch Bridge connecting Crimea to mainland Russia with fertilizer bombs, and even devised blueprints for a series of submersibles which would allow Ukrainian divers to plant mines on Russian ships and infrastructure.\n\nFurther machinations include an explicit \u201choney trap\u201d plan which called for establishing a brothel secretly run by British intelligence in Crimea. There, Russian-speaking female Ukrainian agents would ply \u201cdrunken sailors\u201d from the Russian navy for information.\n\nThe schemes were assembled by Project Alchemy, a secret British military planning cell whose existence was first exposed by The Grayzone.\n\nAlchemy\u2019s intelligence-aligned director, Dominic Morris, once embedded with British special forces in Afghanistan while serving as a \u201cpolitical officer\u201d for the UK embassy. The first of the relevant files was sent on April 14, 2022 \u2014 the same day Ukraine achieved its most spectacular naval success of the war when it sank Russia\u2019s flagship in the region, the Moskva.\n\nThat feat was cheered by Western media, with the New York Times heralding the ship\u2019s destruction as a \u201csignal triumph \u2013 a display of Ukrainian skill and Russian ineptitude.\u201d As the previously-unpublished files show, admirers of the operation also included Project Alchemy\u2019s Dominic Morris, who saw an opportunity to \u201cdefeat the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet\u201d and immediately began crafting plans to sink the rest of Moscow\u2019s warships.\n\nThe destruction of the Moskva purportedly both surprised and panicked the Biden administration, as they apparently didn\u2019t believe Ukraine possessed missiles capable of striking such a target and, according to one mainstream report, \u201chadn\u2019t intended to enable the Ukrainians to attack such a potent symbol of Russian power.\u201d But the attack apparently convinced the White House and Pentagon to double down on their military support for Kiev \u2013 and as the documents show, it had the same effect across the pond.\n\nIn response to an April 23, 2022 brief authored by a fellow cell member on the importance of Western powers supporting Ukrainian \u201cland\u201d operations, Morris declared \u201cthe sinking of Moskva\u201d meant Kiev should focus predominantly on \u201cmaritime\u201d operations instead. After complaining that \u201capart from a little bit of moving tanks and planes around a peaceful Europe,\u201d NATO was \u201cnot doing any fighting,\u201d Morris wrote that he saw a chance for the UK to eliminate every Russian vessel in the region without even going to war.\n\n\u201cYou could defeat the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet\u201d with \u201csubthreshold options,\u201d he wrote, referring to gray zone tactics which the British military has officially defined as \u201call activity up to, but not crossing, the legal definition of armed conflict.\u201d Morris specifically proposed \u201ccommando raids\u201d as \u201ca fab subthreshold activity that will scare the shit out of\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe attack on the Moskva appeared to serve as a catalyst for Alchemy\u2019s \u201cBlack Sea Operations,\u201d which were already being assembled within a few hours of the news breaking. In a document dated the same day as the ship sank, Morris boasted that the \u201ccurrent situation in Ukraine gives the West an ideal opportunity to degrade Russian military capability by destroying as much Russian equipment as possible,\u201d and went on to outline a series of multi-pronged and phased operations targeting Russia across the Black Sea. \u201cInflicting a high casualty rate must continue,\u201d because \u201clots of dead soldiers returning to the mainland will have a big impact on public opinion\u201d in Russia, Alchemy\u2019s Morris declared.\n\nProject Alchemy also proposed a joint UK-Ukrainian intelligence operation in which \u201cfemale agents\u201d were surreptitiously inserted into Russian navy \u201cadmin posts.\u201d In phase one of the operation, Morris proposed \u201csetting up a bar and brothel\u201d in Crimea to \u201cgain intelligence from drunken sailors,\u201d and serve as a \u201choney trap\u201d for military and intelligence officers. \u201cThe agents must be Russian speakers and attractive, able to manipulate, playing to the weakness of the average Russian male,\u201d he stressed.\n\nIn the second phase, Morris proposed an \u201cunconventional option\u201d for blowing up Kerch Bridge, in which \u201ca hijacked Russian flagged bulk carrier loaded with fertiliser rigged with explosives\u201d would be parked under the Bridge and detonated. Morris \u201cassessed this will be a significant kinetic event that will be able to blast four \u2013 six pillars on the bridge, rendering it unusable for a long period of time.\u201d Given Kerch Bridge \u201cwas Putin\u2019s crowning glory after taking Crimea,\u201d he suggested its total destruction had the potential to foment a palace coup in the Kremlin.\n\nThe Kerch Bridge\u2019s collapse, and the infiltration of spies into Crimea, would lay foundations for the third phase: the \u201cmain offensive\u201d of seizing the peninsula. Alchemy\u2019s previously established \u201choney traps\u201d could establish covert \u201csafe houses and weapon stores\u201d in advance of the mission, Morris suggested. Next, \u201ca direct attack against Sevastopol using a tanker fully laden with fuel into Strilets Bay.\u201d This would be \u201cin essence a fire ship creating further panic\u201d and \u201csending a strong signal to the Russian Navy [that] nowhere is safe in the region.\u201d\n\nFinally, Morris advocated that Ukraine pursue a strategy of \u201ccontainment\u201d by seeking to \u201cdisrupt\u201d and \u201ccapture/reflag the [Black Sea Fleet.]\u201d The idea, the Alchemy chief explained, was \u201cto target the Black Sea Fleet with the aim of destroying as many ships as possible,\u201d as Moscow\u2019s warships were \u201ctrapped with little places to hide\u201d there. He urged the \u201cuse of civilian vessels retrofitted\u201d with British-supplied weaponry, and proposed \u201cambushes using hijacked Russian ships to lure in a warship to be attacked by portable anti-ship missiles.\u201d\n\nWhile no such operation ever materialized, Sevastopol has been a consistent target of Kiev\u2019s drone and missile blitzes throughout the conflict. In fact, the \u201cBlack Sea Operations\u201d memo identified the Nakhimov Naval Academy in the Crimean capital as an ideal target for such attacks. The institution has been repeatedly rocked by Ukrainian strikes during this period. An incendiary strike on Kerch Bridge did come to pass in October 2022 \u2013 and as The Grayzone revealed at the time, it was almost certainly the outcome of blueprints prepared by Project Alchemy.\n\nIn a secret memo one month later, Alchemy leader Dominic Morris stated approvingly that the \u201cattack on Kerch\u201d had \u201churt\u201d the Russians. Noting that a relatively high-ranking Russian politician was personally dispatched to oversee the Bridge\u2019s reconstruction, Morris claimed this underlined the attack\u2019s political significance to the Kremlin, and added: \u201cIt is not an easy repair, they need to replace road [sic] in each direction (ie the one that wasn\u2019t hit) and bad weather is slowing them.\u201d\n\nOn April 16, just two days after the Moskva went under, Alchemy\u2019s plans had already morphed into a \u201cCONOPS\u201d \u2013 military jargon which the US Department of Defense defines as a \u201cstatement that clearly and concisely expresses what the joint force commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources.\u201d The document, which is entitled \u201cBuilding Ukraine [sic] Maritime Raiding Capability\u201d and closely matches a secret British presentation previously exposed by The Grayzone, describes the Moskva\u2019s sinking as \u201ca significant blow to Russian naval capability\u201d that left the rest of the Black Sea Fleet \u201cvulnerable to missile attack.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alchemy, the sinking of more ships would \u201cforce the Russian navy farther away from the Ukraine coast or into port, opening the potential for the Ukrainian Navy to launch littoral, inshore, coastal and riverine raiding operations.\u201d The cell noted \u201cthe exploitable sea area\u201d was \u201crelatively small\u201d \u2013 \u201cjust 160 nautical miles from Odessa to Sevastopol as an example,\u201d which was \u201cwell within the range of small assault crafts.\u201d\n\nUkrainian marines and naval forces were to be equipped and trained by the British to allow for \u201cambushing\u2026 Russian engineer and Spetsnaz reconnaissance teams\u201d and \u201charassing Russian forces in hit and run operations from the waterways.\u201d These teams would also be charged with \u201c[taking] out coastal radar stations,\u201d and thus \u201cblinding Russian forces.\u201d As these stations were \u201clikely to be well defended,\u201d such attacks would \u201chave to be well planned and hit at lightning speed to ensure success and escape,\u201d Alchemy wrote, insisting that \u201cagent[s] already inserted into Crimea\u201d from mainland Russia would \u201cprovide intelligence for the naval commandos.\u201d\n\nThe battle plans specifically called for Ukrainian commandos to \u201cHunt and destroy any Russian patrol craft operating in Dniprovska Gulf and conduct beach reconnaissance from Kilburn [sic] Spit to Yahorlyk Bay to identify good landing locations for a larger assault force for a future counter attack.\u201d\n\nThe Kinburn spit, a narrow sandbar which comprises the far western end of the Crimean peninsula, has been a frequent target of Ukrainian raids since Russia\u2019s seizure of the territory.\n\nIn the document, Alchemy suggested \u201cspecialist training for chosen men\u201d who spoke Russian to carry out \u201ccovert undercover missions.\u201d They would also receive training in the use of small arms, sabotage \u201cto disrupt civil installations such as electrical substations, railways, cyber, hacking skills, locksmith training, advanced unarmed combat,\u201d and how \u201cto identify high ranking military officers for assignation while off duty in Crimea.\u201d\n\nUkraine trained in planting limpet mines\n\nA leaked Project Alchemy proposal from September 2022 outlined an elaborate scheme based on input from three unnamed British companies to target Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet while harbored in Sevastopol, strike \u201ccivilian vessels\u201d used by Russia to move troops and equipment in the Dnipro River, and carry out night-time raids on \u201cother maritime environment [sic] being used\u201d by Russian forces. The planned military campaign was known as \u201cThe Tauris Project.\u201d\n\nThe document noted that Russia\u2019s Navy \u201cneed to refuel and reprovision in-between deployments,\u201d and Sevastopol \u201cis the primary port\u201d for this purpose. According to Alchemy, Sevastopol was the one place Moscow\u2019s Kilo Class submarines were \u201cvulnerable to attack,\u201d because in other areas the crafts were \u201cable to operate with impunity as Ukraine does not possess the subsurface capability to counter the threat.\u201d\n\nIn Sevastopol, however, the Black Sea Fleet could \u201ceasily be destroyed by combat swimmers delivered covertly\u201d via crewed submersibles that allow divers to deploy underwater covertly, which are known in military parlance as Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs). As Alchemy explained, \u201cOnce the combat swimmers are in the port they can attach limpet mines to [Russian] ships and submarines before slipping silently back to Chornomorsk.\u201d\n\nAlchemy and its unnamed confederates thus designed an SDV \u201cspecifically for operating in the coastal area of Ukraine,\u201d with \u201ca superior range to reach Sevastopol from Chornomorsk.\u201d The file suggested these vehicles could also be deployed along riverbanks to \u201cdestroy shipping and hit targets out of range of conventional weapon systems\u201d and \u201cprovide intelligence on enemy movements.\u201d Dubbed the Tauris 1, it purportedly boasted \u201cstate of the art\u201d technology, and was \u201ccapable of operating surfaced or submerged.\u201d\n\nThe Tauris 1 would reportedly transport \u201cone pilot and navigator plus four combat swimmers to remote locations on covert missions to include, surveillance, infiltration, mine clearance & mine laying,\u201d with a system \u201cdesigned to be fast when operating on the surface\u201d \u2013 at up to 30 knots \u2013 and \u201cultra-quiet when submerged\u2026with a very low radar signature when operating sub-surface at snorkeling depth.\u201d Meanwhile, it could be parked on sea and riverbeds, or automatically surfaced via \u201ca coded ping sequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that the SDVs will give the Ukrainian Navy a huge advantage in disrupting, destroying key [Russian] assets and wider forces deployed in the south,\u201d the document bragged. It foresaw 24 \u2013 48 Ukrainian Marines and naval personnel being trained over \u201can eight-week course in a secret location in the UK,\u201d overseen by a technical team and instructors comprising \u201cformer SDV pilots and navigators who served in the UK Special Forces community.\u201d This would include \u201ctactical training and limpet mine training.\u201d\n\nBritain exploits Ukraine for Black Sea control\n\nThe document predicted it would take a year to construct the Tauris 1 SDVs, at an eye-popping price of \u00a36 \u2013 8 million per vehicle. While there is no evidence that Kiev took Alchemy and its partners up on the proposition, there have been numerous examples of kamikaze Ukrainian commando raids on Russian-held territory, often using jet skis. In addition to the Kinburn Spit, the Tendra Spit, which sits 20 kilometers to its south, has also been a repeat target.\n\nA typically ill-fated raid which took place on February 28, 2024 saw five Ukrainian assault boats immediately come under intensive Russian fire as they approached the Tendra Spit, leaving dozens dead and just one watercraft able to escape the scene.\n\nEven doggedly anti-Russian news outlets in Britain were forced to acknowledge the debacle, with The Telegraph lambasting the operation as a \u201cfailure\u201d and noting that it was \u201cnot clear what the Ukrainian forces were attempting to achieve.\u201d The suicidal raids have drawn comparisons to Kiev\u2019s calamitous attempt to capture Krynky, which as The Grayzone revealed, was planned and directed by Project Alchemy.\n\nElsewhere, British-backed attacks on Russia\u2019s forces in the Black Sea have been more successful. In March 2024, following a series of well-publicized sinkings of Russian warships, the UK\u2019s then-Defence Minister Grant Shapps boasted that drones and missiles supplied by London had helped Kiev \u201clay waste to nearly 30 per cent\u201d of the Russian Navy stationed there. On top of weaponry, it\u2019s likely the Ukrainian strikes relied heavily on targeting intelligence provided by Britain\u2019s RC-135 spy planes, which ramped up surveillance of Russia assets in Black Sea following the proxy war\u2019s outbreak.\n\nToday, London remains determined to neutralize Russia\u2019s presence in the Black Sea. In January 2025, a defense contractor and British government-funded think tank known as the Council on Geostrategy floated the idea of deploying a British naval task force to the region, to \u201creshape\u201d its \u201cgeopolitics.\u201d The Ministry of Defence then invited \u201cindustry partners from NATO, Ukraine, and Five-Eyes countries\u201d to submit designs and plans for \u201cthe development of a versatile, fast, and low-observable maritime system designed for operations in Ukraine and beyond.\u201d\n\nBefore the month was over, a UK minister confirmed in parliament that in an attempt \u201cto support Ukraine,\u201d the Ministry of Defence had developed two \u201cnew uncrewed maritime [systems]\u201d that were \u201cundergoing final testing,\u201d which it dubbed \u2018Snapper\u2019 and \u2018Wasp.\u2019 The uniquely British obsession with exploiting the proxy war to obliterate Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet may seem peculiar, given its relative lack of impact on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, the true motivation was clearly spelled out in a March 2022 Council on Geostrategy report, which declared that the hostilities in Ukraine meant London\u2019s \u201cstake in the Black Sea region has been elevated.\u201d The paper detailed how control of the region was essential for Britain\u2019s intended \u201ctilt\u201d to the Indo-Pacific, which was laid out in the official July 2021 \u201cintegrated review\u201d of UK security and defense strategy. As the Council on Geostrategy explained, \u201cany power controlling the Black Sea would be able to exert significant pressure on the key maritime communication lines from Europe to the Indo-Pacific.\u201d\n\nThis February, a spate of explosions was reported on tankers in the Mediterranean which had recently stopped at Russian ports. Italian investigators suspect Kiev was responsible for carrying out at least one of these incidents using limpet mines \u2014 the same weapon they were trained to use by British intelligence.\n\nThree years after the Moskva\u2019s sinking, Russia still maintains several naval assets in the Black Sea. However, its fleet is unable to leave the confines of Moscow-controlled waters in the east. Just how much responsibility Britain bears for this feat remains unclear, but Project Alchemy\u2019s files demonstrate a substantial role for the UK since the onset of the war.",

The sinking of the Russian flagship Moskva in April 2022 served as a catalyst for these operations, prompting increased Western military support for Ukraine. Despite some operations not materializing, the UK has continued to support Ukraine's efforts to challenge Russia's naval presence in the Black Sea, with ongoing attacks on Russian-held territories and the development of new maritime systems. The UK's involvement is driven by strategic interests in controlling the Black Sea region, which is crucial for its geopolitical ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.",

We have no way of monitoring or tracking them,\u201d he said.\n\nNetanyahu effectively confirms Israel is running guns to the \u201clawless criminals\u201d in Gaza who a former Defense minister calls \u201cSalafi jihadists [who] began identifying with ISIS.\u201d First they propped up Hamas to prevent a secular gov\u2019t\u2014now they\u2019re propping up ISIS to prevent Hamas pic.twitter.com/2Eitsd3ETk \u2014 Wyatt Reed (@wyattreed13) June 5, 2025\n\nAn initial statement released by Netanyahu\u2019s office didn\u2019t deny the allegation. \u201cIsrael is acting to defeat Hamas in various and diverse ways, upon the recommendation of all heads of the security establishment,\u201d the office said.\n\nLater, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel has been arming \u201cclans\u201d in southern Gaza. \u201cOn the advice of security officials, we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas. This is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers. The publication of this only benefits Hamas \u2013 but Lieberman doesn\u2019t care,\u201d he said, according to The Jerusalem Post.\n\nIsraeli military sources told The Times of Israel that Israel has been arming a group described as a \u201ccriminal gang of jihadists\u201d led by Yasser Abu Shabab, a member of one of the largest clans in southern Gaza. Israel has been providing Abu Shabab\u2019s gang with Kalashnikov rifles, including some that were seized from Hamas.\n\nAccording to the Times, Hamas sources speaking to Lebanon\u2019s Al-Akhbar newspaper said that members of Abu Shabab\u2019s gang belong to an extremist Salafi faction that has had run-ins with Hamas.\n\nAbu Shabab\u2019s gang has been operating in Israeli-controlled areas of southern Gaza and has been involved in looting aid shipments. Last year, an internal UN memo identified Abu Shabab\u2019s gang as \u201cthe main and most influential stakeholder behind systematic and massive looting\u201d of aid trucks. Haaretz also reported last year that the Israeli military was allowing armed gangs to loot aid convoys and extort protection fees from drivers.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Abu Shabab admitted that he and his group \u201ctake from trucks\u201d but claimed they didn\u2019t touch \u201cfood, tents, or supplies for children.\u201d According to a report from The New Arab, Abu Shabab is affiliated with Shadi al-Soufi, another gang leader who was detained by Hamas in 2020 over an alleged murder. The report said al-Soufi fled Gaza with the help of ISIS and returned following the start of Israel\u2019s genocidal war.\n\nAbu Shabab, who was imprisoned by Hamas for drug trafficking before an Israeli airstrike allowed him to escape, recently released a video where he said his new armed group \u201ccleared\u201d eastern Rafah of Hamas fighters and said Palestinians could return to the area, which is under the control of the IDF.\n\nYair Golan, another Israeli opposition leader and retired IDF general, slammed Netanyahu for arming the gang in a post on X. \u201cNetanyahu, who transferred billions to Hamas in cash suitcases, based on a misguided notion that Hamas is an \u2018asset\u2019 and that it would end in flip-flops, is now promoting a new dangerous notion: arming a Gazan militia with ties to ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu is dangerous to Israel\u2019s security. Instead of securing a deal, creating arrangements with the moderate Sunni axis, and bringing back the hostages and security to Israel\u2019s citizens, he is creating a new ticking bomb in Gaza,\u201d Golan added.",

        "text": "The Trump administration has charged the surveillance firm Palantir with agglomerating the US population\u2019s personal data across government agencies, raising alarm about a centralized spying tool targeting hundreds of millions without oversight. Wall Street responded to the news by sending Palantir\u2019s stock price to unprecedented heights.\n\nDuring an end-of-year investor call this February, Palantir co-founder and militant Zionist Alex Karp bragged that his company was making a financial killing by enabling mass murder.\n\n\u201cPalantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it\u2019s necessary, to scare enemies,\u201d he stated, adding: \u201cAnd on occasion, kill them.\u201d\n\nCIA seed front company Palantir's CEO Alex Karp brags about how good business is to shareholders while admitting .. \"When it's necessary to scare enemies and on occasion kill them .. And we hope you're in favor of that\" Right before he dumped $1.23 Billion in company stock pic.twitter.com/gLdiMLS4xj \u2014 Nightwatch N8 (@NightwatchN8) February 20, 2025\n\nOn this front, Karp claimed Palantir was \u201ccrushing it,\u201d and he professed to be \u201csuper-proud of the role we play, especially in places we can\u2019t talk about.\u201d\n\nKarp went on to predict social \u201cdisruption\u201d ahead that would be \u201cvery good for Palantir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a revolution. Some people are going to get their heads cut off,\u201d he warned, suggesting that his firm was producing the most vital technology enabling elites to restore control during the coming unrest.\n\nPalantir is already playing a decisive role in the besieged Gaza Strip, where its products assists Israel\u2019s application of a ferocious AI targeting system known as Lavender which directs its ongoing genocide. In the face of public protest, Karp has acknowledged that he is directly involved in killing Palestinians in Gaza, but insisted the dead were \u201cmostly terrorists.\u201d\n\nAt the start of January, the overtly pro-Israeli firm\u2019s board of directors gathered in Tel Aviv for its first meeting of the new year. Since then, its financial fortunes have improved dramatically.\n\nThroughout May, Palantir\u2019s stock exploded, making it the S&P 500\u2019s top-performing company. On June 2, Palantir\u2019s share price hit an all-time high, a year-on-year jump of 512%, turbocharging the company\u2019s market value to roughly $311 billion. Driving this abrupt burst of investor exuberance was a series of lucrative deals signed with multiple US government agencies since Donald Trump took office, and the expectation Palantir will ink massive contracts going forward.\n\nPalantir\u2019s products expand mass surveillance at home, Pentagon targeting across the globe\n\nOn May 30th, the New York Times published a lengthy probe linking these deals to an executive order signed by Trump in March, calling for seamless, mass sharing of data across government agencies through a Palantir application called Foundry.\n\nThe report did not explain to readers how Palantir emerged as a small startup thanks to sponsorship from the CIA\u2019s venture capital wing, In-Q-Tel, which gifted Peter Thiel\u2019s company $2 million in 2004. Instead, the paper leaned in to a partisan angle playing on Democratic fears that Trump could abuse a unified database to target political foes.\n\nNonetheless, the Times provided valuable insight into Palantir\u2019s penetration of a vast array of US government agencies, by raking in more than $113 million in federal government spending since Trump took office, on top of \u201cadditional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon.\u201d In late May, the company\u2019s existing contract with the Department of Defense was beefed up by $795 million, bringing it to an eye-popping total award of $1.3 billion.\n\nPalantir currently provides the Pentagon with AI targeting software known as Maven, which it uses in battlefields from Syria to Yemen to Ukraine and beyond. The contract will last until at least May 2029. The Trump administration\u2019s fondness for Palantir has placed its data analytics and storage tool Foundry in at least four federal agencies, including the DHS and Health and Human Services Department. Talks are also apparently ongoing with the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service to adopt the resource. This would facilitate merging all these agencies\u2019 datasets.\n\nAccording to the Times, Palantir was selected to deliver on Trump\u2019s order to enhance intradepartmental data sharing by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. At least three DOGE members previously worked at the company, while two others have worked at Thiel-funded firms. The outlet cited leaked screenshots indicating DHS officials exchanged emails with DOGE in February about merging citizen records, while quoting nameless Palantir employees worrying \u201cabout collecting so much sensitive information in one place,\u201d particularly given the allegedly \u201csloppy\u201d approach to security of \u201csome DOGE employees\u201d.\n\nWhile focusing heavily on the risks posed by Trump\u2019s embrace of Palantir technology, the Times acknowledged in passing the company \u201chas long worked\u201d with different branches of the US federal government, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In February 2022, Palantir was enlisted by the Biden administration to manage Covid vaccine distribution. Meanwhile, in April, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s \u201cremoval operations team\u201d gave Palantir $30 million \u201cto build a platform to track migrant movements in real time.\u201d\n\nKarp, for his part, has infuriated Trump\u2019s base by boasting during an interview in Davos, Switzerland in 2023 that he \u201csinglehandedly stopped the rise of the far-right in Europe\u201d through an application called PG. The following February, he claimed before an audience at the Future Investment Initiative Institute that by supposedly stopping \u201cinnumerable terror attacks\u201d across Europe, Palantir prevented the resurgence of fascism.\n\n\u201cI love when I\u2019m getting yelled at in cities in Europe,\u201d Karp declared. \u201cKeep yelling at me\u2026 the only reason why someone\u2019s not goose-stepping between me and you is my product,\u201d he laughed.\n\nCIA agent and head of Palantir Alex Karp says his company\u2019s software \u201csingle-handedly\u201d stopped the \u201cfar right\u201d in Europe. Founded in 2003 with funding from the CIA\u2019s In-Q-Tel program, Palantir\u2019s only client before 2008 was the CIA. pic.twitter.com/Shq0uA5x16 \u2014 Reed Cooley (@ReedCooley) May 31, 2025\n\nPalantir penetrates the West as privatized national security state backbone\n\nFor years, Palantir has been at the heart of US-led efforts to neutralize Iran\u2019s alleged nuclear program. It has created a predictive analytical tool dubbed Mosaic for the purpose, used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and US officials to visualize ties between the people, places and material involved in the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear activities. Data harvested and pored over by the resource includes potentially tainted material supposedly stolen from Tehran by Mossad.\n\nSuch work mimics the services Palantir has provided for US government agencies such as the CIA, DHS, FBI, and Pentagon. These entities routinely turn over untold quantities of data to the firm to exploit for a variety of applications. For example, Palantir\u2019s Gotham tool has been weaponized by the US military to supposedly predict insurgent attacks. In Afghanistan, it combined maps, intelligence briefings, and incident reports for mission planning, leading Bloomberg to dub Palantir the \u201csecret weapon\u201d of the so-called war on terror.\n\nMeanwhile, documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden indicate the US signals intelligence giant and its British counterpart GCHQ have relied heavily on Palantir\u2019s products. A leaked 2011 presentation connected the company\u2019s wares to multiple secret Five Eyes spying operations, and provided glowing personal testimonials from the agencies\u2019 analysts. One crowed: \u201c[Palantir] is the best tool I have ever worked with. It\u2019s intuitive, i.e. idiot-proof, and can do a lot you never even dreamt of doing.\u201d\n\nLocal law enforcement agencies are also making use of Gotham. The total number of forces worldwide using the technology is unknown, but leaked Los Angeles Police Department training documents on Gotham, including an \u2018Intermediate Course\u2019 and an \u2018Advance Course,\u2019 shed significant light on the tool\u2019s internal workings. The sheer volume of data collected on citizens \u2013 whether they are law-abiding, are suspected of having committed a crime, or are simply connected to individuals accused of wrongdoing \u2013 is staggering.\n\nThis includes sex, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots, surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, tattoos, scars, piercings and other identifying features. Such a cutting-edge service doesn\u2019t come cheap, and Gotham subscriptions run to millions of dollars annually. The vast windfall reaped from multiple state entities since Palantir\u2019s inception has made the firm\u2019s founders very wealthy indeed \u2013 Karp\u2019s personal worth alone is currently estimated at $12.2 billion \u2013 and allowed the company to go public in September 2020.\n\nOn top of the privacy concerns raised by a secretive company with access to so much private data, the practical efficacy of Palantir\u2019s technology has also come under scrutiny its Foundry application was implanted in Britain\u2019s NHS in December 2020. That\u2019s when Palantir was awarded a legally dubious no-bid contract to run the Service\u2019s Covid-19 Data Store for two years despite warnings that the company could preside over \u201can \u2018unprecedented\u2019 transfer of citizens\u2019 private health information\u201d into its own database.\n\nThe following year, the NHS awarded Palantir a $447 million contract to build a \u201cFederated Data Platform\u201d combining the medical records of all British citizens. Next, the British government paid millions to a consultancy firm called KPMG to market Palantir\u2019s platform to local NHS Trusts, which oversee the administration of individual hospitals throughout the country. Since then, several senior medical officials have warned that Palantir\u2019s technology was inferior to current systems, and could actually hinder NHS work.\n\nYet British PM Keir Starmer has continued his government\u2019s cooperation with Palantir, even visiting the company\u2019s offices in downtown Washington DC immediately after meeting with Trump this February. Louis Mosley, the head of Palantir UK, cheered Starmer\u2019s attitude after the visit: \u201cYou could see in his eyes that he gets it. The ambition is there \u2013 the will is there.\u201d\n\nPalantir\u2019s Mosley happens to be the grandson of Sir Oswald Mosley, the World War II-era Nazi sympathizer who led the British Union of Fascists.\n\nKeir Starmer made a special trip to Palantir while he was visiting the US at the end of February & apparently \"enthused about how Britain wouldn\u2019t over-regulate AI, instead seizing its opportunities in pursuit of 'a new economic deal' with advanced technology at its core.\" pic.twitter.com/piC0vdL76b \u2014 12 Ball (@BoltzmannBooty) March 21, 2025\n\nWhile Thiel\u2019s personal affinity for Trump and close relationships with key members of the president\u2019s cabinet may have eased Palantir\u2019s entry into sensitive government areas, the company\u2019s current trajectory has been years in the making. Having penetrated the national security state of countries across the West, the firm and its messianic CEO are working to consolidate a trans-Atlantic network of control with unprecedented powers, lucrative profits, and a growing body count.",

Co-founder Alex Karp has openly boasted about the company's financial success and its controversial role in global conflicts, including its involvement in the Gaza Strip and its predictive tools used against Iran's nuclear program. Palantir's technology, such as the Foundry and Gotham applications, has been integrated into numerous U.S. federal agencies and international entities, raising significant privacy concerns. The company's influence extends to local law enforcement and international health systems, with mixed reviews on its efficacy. Despite privacy and ethical concerns, Palantir continues to expand its reach, bolstered by strategic relationships and government contracts, positioning itself as a key player in the global surveillance and data analytics landscape.",

Two former US officials told the Qatari-owned outlet Middle East Eye that Reilly \u201chad won the trust of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several Israeli businessmen close to him.\u201d\n\nIf true, this would mean Israel\u2019s military-intelligence apparatus is effectively laundering massive sums of money through a weaponized aid scheme that forms the linchpin of its plan to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza. A leaked internal GHF document acknowledged that the food distribution centers and residential compounds it was constructing in Gaza could be perceived as \u201c\u2018concentration camps\u2019 with biometrics.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe GHF model appears integral to Israel\u2019s stated plan to occupy 75% of the Gaza Strip, forcing starving and homeless Palestinians into what its military has branded as \u201chumanitarian islands\u201d designed to \u201cdivide and rule\u201d the decimated enclave. It is also a clear attempt at replacing UNRWA, the United Nations agency that has tended to the needs of Gaza\u2019s refugee population since 1949, and which the Israeli Knesset designated as a terrorist organization in 2024.\n\nGHF\u2019s creation can be traced directly to the Israeli government\u2019s COGAT office, which presides over the siege of Gaza, as well an Israeli entrepreneur named Liran Tancman, who was described in one report as \u201ca reservist in the IDF\u2019s 8200 signals intelligence unit, who called for using biometric identification systems outside the distribution hubs to vet Palestinian civilians.\u201d\n\nWith no legal standing or formal mandate to operate in Gaza, GHF now operates at the pleasure of Israel\u2019s occupation army. But with an endorsement from the Trump administration, and with US mercenary muscle maintaining its dystopian distribution centers, the scheme functions behind an American facade.\n\nJust a day before GHF\u2019s planned roll-out in Gaza, the organization\u2019s CEO, Jake Wood, resigned in protest, condemning the group\u2019s failure to uphold \u201chumanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality.\u201d Next, GHF\u2019s COO, David Burke, fled for the emergency exit. David Kohler, a Swiss board member, has also resigned without explanation.\n\nFollowing their departure, leadership of the murky outfit passed to John Acree, a former USAID administrator who recently accused the President of giving a \u201cfree pass\u201d to Russia in a rambling Facebook post lashing out at the \u201ccriminal\u201d Trump for defunding his longtime employer.\n\nEven after the situation at GHF\u2019s militarized aid outpost in western Rafah ended in mayhem on May 27, a network of shady mercenary firms including Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions have continued to offer high-paying positions to potential guns-for-hire.\n\nA job listing for UG Solutions appeals to \u201csnipers\u201d with \u201cprior experience in combat zones,\u201d the \u201chighest level of weapons proficiencies,\u201d and \u201cadvanced combat skills\u201d who could \u201coperate effectively in high-threat environments.\u201d Preference would be given to \u201cSpecial Forces qualified personnel,\u201d as well as \u201cpersonnel with OSINT/Intelligence Background.\u201d\n\nUG Solutions\u2019 founder, Jameson Govoni, has described himself as a \u201cdegenerate from Boston\u201d who \u201cjoined the Army as fast as I possibly could to inflict pain on the people who inflicted pain on us.\u201d He also founded a company called \u201cAlcohol Armor\u201d that markets hangover recovery solutions supposedly based on his expertise in getting wasted. \u201cIn the military, we\u2019re hands down the worst drinkers in the fucking world. I\u2019ve had my stomach pumped,\u201d Govoni\u2019s business partner, Glenn Devitt, boasted.\n\nPhillip Reilly, the normally publicity hungry former CIA field operative who founded Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) \u2013 a partner of GHF and UG Solutions \u2013 has not spoken on the record to any media organization to date about his apparently lucrative exploits in Gaza.\n\nSRS first appeared in Gaza this January, when a collection of middle aged mercenaries portrayed in US media as \u201csuburban dads\u201d established a checkpoint along the Netzarim Corridor, an area severing Gaza\u2019s northern and central regions which the Israeli military has used as a base for abusing and massacring civilians.\n\nAn SRS document circulated to potential supporters (see below) appealed for \u201chumanitarian partners\u201d to help transform its checkpoint into \u201can aid distribution point.\u201d Days later, GHF was founded in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nA GHF document distributed to the media in early May listed an array of corporate heavy hitters and former US officials as board members, and boasted of partnerships with financial institutions like Goldman Sachs. Its board included Raisa Sheynberg, a former Treasury Department official who served on the public policy team of Meta\u2019s original Libra cryptocurrency project, and David Beasley, the former South Carolina governor and ex-head of the World Food Program.\n\nThe press release pledged that GHF leaders would put \u201chumanity first\u201d as they \u201cpursue pragmatic approaches to intractable problems.\u201d\n\nAmong the most notable figures implicated in the GHF scandal is Nate Mook, the former CEO of World Central Kitchen.

As shown by Israeli journalist Uri Blau, incorporating documents filed with Swiss authorities list Mook as the founder of GHF. He was also named as a board member of the group on the document GHF distributed to the media about its launch. Since the resignation of GHF\u2019s leadership, however, Mook has denied any formal role in the group while refusing to discuss the issue with journalists.\n\nAndres owes much of his image as a globe-trotting humanitarian hero to a 2022 public relations vehicle packaged as a documentary and humbly entitled, \u201cWe Feed People.\u201d The film as directed by Hollywood bigwig Ron Howard and produced by Mook, who worked at the time as the CEO of World Central Kitchen (WCK).\n\nAccording to his bio at the arms industry-funded McCain Institute, where he currently serves as \u201cSpecial Advisor on Ukraine,\u201d Mook boasts that he has worked with Andres since 2012, \u201cbuilding WCK from one employee and under $1 million per year to $400 million in global impact in 2022.\u201d\n\nDespite his condemnation of GHF, Andres played an early and important role in the project to subvert Gaza\u2019s humanitarian aid system away from the UN, and into line with Israeli objectives. As The Grayzone reported, Andres oversaw WCK\u2019s effort in 2024 to construct a pier made of the rubble of homes in Gaza, which would have enabled the offloading of aid to kitchens it ran across Gaza in coordination with the Israeli military.\n\nWhen Spain\u2019s then-Minister for Social Rights, Ione Belarra charged Israel with genocide in Gaza, Andres leapt to the apartheid state\u2019s defense, insisting on Twitter/X that Israel was merely \u201cdefending its citizens,\u201d declaring that Belarra did \u201cnot deserve to be minister,\u201d and accusing her of \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d sympathies.\n\nAll the while, Andres continued to cozy up to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who appointed him as a \u201cculinary ambassador\u201d for the Department of State in Feb. 2023. As recently as Sept. 2024, nearly a year into Israel\u2019s genocidal siege of Gaza, Andres was seen partying at a reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art alongside Blinken, then National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, and corruption-stained New York Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nLess than six months had passed since the American-supplied Israeli military murdered seven WCK employees in a targeted double-tap strike on their aid convoy on April 1, 2024. Yet Andres is still seeking friendly collaboration with Israeli occupation authorities, expressing his thanks to the COGAT siege administrators as recently as this May 28.\n\nWe welcome your help @cogat and thanks for listening to our request. @WCKitchen has been asking for the Saladine Street route\u2026where we all feel is safer for drivers and Palestinian families receiving aid. We need to bring the number of trucks to 500 a day so we can really feed\u2026 https://t.co/WjU5vsyKY4 \u2014 Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\ud83e\udd58\ud83c\udf73 (@chefjoseandres) May 28, 2025\n\nGHF forced out of Switzerland, flees to safer ground in US\n\nThis May 29, Swiss officials announced that GHF was violating several laws for foundations registered in that country. The shadowy organization subsequently announced that it is moving its operations to the US, where it is likely to receive less scrutiny from a Trump administration that endorsed its creation.\n\nThough its chaotic launch in Gaza generated international headlines, GHF remains shrouded in mystery, with masked mercenaries manning its operations on the ground, and a cast of corporate lawyers operating behind a series of shell companies whose coffers have filled up with millions of dollars from an unknown source.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that seems certain about the opaque entity is that its presence will deliver more misery to the population of Gaza behind the guise of charity.",

        "paragraph_summary": "The article discusses allegations against the Israeli government for allegedly laundering large sums of money through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a shadowy organization purportedly aimed at providing aid to Gaza. Top Israeli lawmakers, including Avigdor Lieberman and Yair Lapid, have accused the government of using GHF and associated mercenary firms to implement a plan to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza by forcing Palestinians into concentration camp-like hubs. The GHF, founded in Switzerland under mysterious circumstances, is reportedly funded by the Israeli military-intelligence apparatus and aims to replace the UN's role in Gaza. The chaotic distribution of aid by GHF led to violence, with Israeli soldiers reportedly firing on crowds of hungry Palestinians. The foundation has been criticized for its lack of transparency and humanitarian principles, with key figures like Nate Mook and Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s distancing themselves from the organization. GHF's operations have faced legal challenges in Switzerland, prompting a move to the US, where it is expected to face less scrutiny. Despite its stated humanitarian goals, GHF's presence in Gaza is seen as exacerbating the suffering of the local population.",

        "text": "Files reviewed by The Grayzone reveal a shocking foreign meddling scandal, as British state prosecutors are seen colluding with Israeli authorities to classify anti-genocide protesters as terrorists and imprison them on heavily politicized grounds.\n\nDocuments released by the British government reveal that London has been coordinating with Israeli officials to prosecute protestors associated with activist group Palestine Action for disrupting the operations of Elbit Systems, which manufactures deadly weapons being used in the genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe documents highlight a years-long Israeli influence campaign, and suggest that Tel Aviv\u2019s meddling has prompted London to abandon well-established legal standards in order to charge anti-genocide activists under highly politicized counter-terror provisions.\n\nOne especially revealing document shows the British Attorney General\u2019s Office (AGO) furnishing their Israeli counterparts with guidance on how to avoid an arrest warrant for war crimes, reassuring them that the Crown Prosecutorial Service (CPS) \u201chas strengthened the procedural safeguards around the issuing of private arrest warrants in recent years.\u201d\n\nThe Israelis have been on edge since former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni was forced to cancel a trip to London in 2009 after a UK court issued an arrest warrant for her involvement in the blood-stained assault on Gaza that year. Leaked Israeli Ministry of Justice files revealed how Tel Aviv subsequently initiated an intensive \u2013 and ultimately successful \u2013 lobbying campaign to guarantee its officials \u201cspecial mission\u201d certificates which allowed them to visit London without the fear of arrest. As Declassified UK reported, the British government has granted Israel three special mission certificates through the Gaza genocide.\n\nAnother startling file released by the British government revealed that Nicola Smith, the Head of International Law at Britain\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office, shared \u201ccontact details\u201d for UK prosecutors and counter-terror investigators with Israel\u2019s deputy ambassador to London.\n\nThe email was sent to Israel\u2019s deputy envoy, Daniela Grudsky Ekstein, with the subject line \u201cNicola Smith to Israelis re CPS/SO15 contact details,\u201d indicating the UK government had referred Tel Aviv directly to the CPS, or Crown Prosecutorial Service, as well as to SO15, London\u2019s counter-terror squad, to advance the prosecution of activists affiliated with Palestine Action.\n\nSmith\u2019s email, sent on September 9, 2024, came less than two weeks after Ekstein and Smith held an in-person meeting on August 29, 2024, at Israel\u2019s notoriously spy-infested embassy in London. The message is chummily addressed from \u201cNicky\u201d to \u201cDaniela,\u201d suggesting warm relations between the two.\n\nEarlier that month, 10 Palestine Action activists were imprisoned after raiding an Elbit factory in Filton, South West England. They destroyed Israeli quadcopters constructed on the grounds. These small drones have been routinely used to maim and murder Palestinian civilians in the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\nActivists who demonstrated against Elbit are currently being detained under \u201ccounter-terror\u201d powers, despite facing non-terror related charges such as criminal damage, prompting UN rapporteurs to issue a statement condemning their confinement. The CPS has indicated it will argue their offenses had a \u201cterrorist connection\u201d in order to maximize their sentences.\n\nThe files released by the British government suggest the Israeli government has pushed for incarceration and prosecution of the Palestine Action demonstrators, who were known at the time as the \u201cFilton 10.\u201d\n\nThe August 2024 rendezvous was not the first face-to-face interaction between Smith, the international law advisor to the UK AGO, and the deputy Israeli ambassador, Ekstein. A month beforehand, the two met alongside Israeli Embassy Counsellor of Political Affairs Yosef Zilberman and UK AGO Director Douglas Wilson. The back-to-back meetings hint at frequent coordination between the British and Israeli embassies \u2013 a notion reinforced by declassified emails reviewed by The Grayzone from May 2022 showing Israeli embassy officials in London secretly met with AGO representatives, including Wilson.\n\nThough records of the summit are redacted, it seems Tel Aviv was trying to interfere in ongoing cases against Palestine solidarity protesters. In a subsequent email to Israeli embassy apparatchiks, Wilson signed off, \u201cI know from previous experience there is well-established direct contact between [our] legal teams, both between capitals and via our missions in New York.\u201d\n\nThree months after AGO officials provided the Israeli embassy with contact details of the officers investigating the activists behind the raid of the Filton facility, ten more Palestine Action demonstrators involved in the action were arrested. Eight were subsequently charged and remanded in prison under the same counter-terror powers as the previous ten, and the group is now referred to as the \u201cFilton 18.\u201d If Israel was in any way responsible for this move, it would represent a clear breach of core CPS code, and another layer in what appears to be a major foreign meddling scandal.\n\nAs the Service\u2019s General Principle 2.1 explicitly states, British \u201cprosecutors must be free to carry out their professional duties without political interference and must not be affected by improper or undue pressure or influence from any source.\u201d\n\nPalestine Action cofounder Huda Amori has insisted that Tel Aviv is influencing the British prosecutions of anti-genocide protesters. \u201cThere is clear evidence showing continuous political and foreign interference in Palestine Action cases,\u201d Amori told The Grayzone, and that \u201cthe ongoing prosecutions of journalists and activists who dare stand up for Palestine is politically motivated, and done under the influence of the Israeli embassy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny violation of the independence of the judiciary is an abuse of process under the rule of law,\u201d she continued. \u201cTherefore, the prosecutions must be stopped and the prisoners freed.\u201d\n\nLong-running secret collusion\n\nEmails obtained by The Grayzone show collusion between British law enforcement bodies, Elbit Systems, and the Israeli embassy in London has been ongoing for several years. On March 2, 2022, then-Home Secretary Priti Patel met with Elbit\u2019s British CEO Martin Fausset. The meeting\u2019s explicit objective was to reassure the international death merchant \u201cthat the criminal protest acts against Elbit Systems UK are taken seriously\u201d by authorities in London.\n\nA briefing note for Patel outlined \u201ckey points to raise\u201d with Fausset. \u201cPalestine Action\u2019s criminal activity is for the police to investigate,\u201d one note stated. But while local law enforcement were ostensibly \u201coperationally independent of government,\u201d the document revealed that Home Office officials had \u201cbeen in contact with the police about [Palestine Action].\u201d\n\nThe declassified record is heavily redacted, although an unexpurgated segment on \u201clines to take\u201d during the secret summit directed Patel to \u201cthank Martin for the work Elbit does in support of the British Armed Forces.\u201d A subsequent internal email discussing the meeting was then dispatched to various senior Home Office \u201ccounter-terror\u201d officials, including Michael Stewart, then-chief of Britain\u2019s notorious PREVENT program.\n\nThe email summarized the meeting and \u201cimmediate next steps as a priority.\u201d Fausset was quoted complaining that \u201cthe protests Elbit were experiencing from Palestine Action were getting more and more severe,\u201d with \u201cwell organised, funded and trained\u201d protesters, and \u201ca significant online effort to mobilise and train.\u201d Patel was reportedly \u201cdeeply concerned about everything she heard,\u201d and proposed a variety of measures be taken in response.\n\nBecause the documents are heavily redacted, it is unclear what occurred at Patel and Fausset\u2019s meeting. Prior to their discussion, not a single Palestine Action member had been convicted for targeting Elbit Systems. Just one month later though, the British state made the unusual step of appealing the acquittal of four activists who toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in June 2020. The perpetrators walked free after asserting human rights defenses, which had been employed by Palestine Action demonstrators to beat charges of criminal damage on previous occasions.\n\nHowever, in the Colston case, the court ruled that human rights defenses could only be relied on in cases of vandalism of public property, not in cases where criminal damage has been caused to private property. Because Elbit is a private company, the Attorney General\u2019s Office used this determination to dramatically increase prosecutions of Palestine Action activists.\n\n\u2018Terror\u2019 accusations continue despite lack of charges\n\nThe Grayzone has reviewed a declassified February 1, 2023 email sent by a redacted, presumably internal British government source to AGO Director Douglas Wilson, describing a meeting six days earlier between his office and several Israeli diplomats. \u201cThe meeting was at the Embassy\u2019s request and covered a variety of topics,\u201d first and foremost a \u201cjoint declaration\u201d between London and Tel Aviv\u2019s respective Ministries of Justice. It was presented by Israel\u2019s then-Deputy Ambassador to Britain, Oren Marmorstein, now chief of the Zionist entity\u2019s public affairs and media division.\n\nThe declaration \u201csought closer bilateral cooperation between the two ministries on mutual areas of responsibility\u201d \u2013 \u201cnamely, legislation and legal reform, civil and criminal law and legal education.\u201d As this fell outside the AGO\u2019s jurisdiction, Wilson \u201cundertook to engage the relevant leads in the Ministry of Justice on this topic for them to engage with the [Israeli] Embassy.\u201d This followed an email to Tel Aviv\u2019s London-based diplomats in which British Justice officials promised they\u2019d be \u201cin contact with you shortly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General would be delighted to meet with her Israeli counterpart if you have any suggestion of suitable dates for a meeting in London,\u201d the email cheerily added.\n\nThe interpretation that Tel Aviv influences British laws to the detriment of Palestine solidarity activists is reinforced by numerous sections of London\u2019s National Security Act, which came into force December 2023. These passages give every appearance of being custom built to legally neutralize Palestine Action\u2019s wrecking campaign against Elbit Systems.\n\nPriti Patel introduced the legislation in her capacity as Home Secretary. She was reinstated to government in 2019 after being forced to resign from a previous position in November 2017 for holding 12 secret meetings with Israeli officials without official authorization or notification.\n\nOn April 19, 2023 Britain\u2019s then-Policing Minister Chris Philp met with representatives of the AGO, Home Office, several police forces and bodies, Elbit Systems, and the company\u2019s French arms supplier Thales, to discuss \u201cPalestine Action criminality.\u201d According to an internal readout, \u201cMinister Philp opened the meeting [by] emphasising that the UK government wants to make sure that UK based business can continue in their lawful activity.\u201d A representative of Elbit \u201cgave an overview of Palestine Action (PA) attacks on initially Elbit and now their supply chain.\u201d Due to heavy redactions, it\u2019s unclear what decisions, if any, were made regarding prosecutions of activists.\n\nBut if the prior meeting between Elbit and then-Home Secretary Patel was any indication, acquittal and conviction of Palestine Action members was likely a key subject of interest for attendees. During their March 2022 discussion, the British government openly acknowledged that Palestine Action \u201cdoes not meet the threshold for proscription\u201d as a terrorist group under British law, \u201cas they do not commit, participate in, prepare for, promote, encourage, or otherwise be concerned with acts of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe recent invocation of counter-terror powers to imprison Palestine Action demonstrators may indicate the British government has identified a legal fudge that allows authorities to treat the group as a terrorist entity, despite its lack of formal proscription. The Filton 18\u2019s pre-trial detention period runs to 182 days, well in excess of typical limits for non-terror-related crimes. Their contact with the outside world is also severely restricted, again contrary to standard British jurisprudence.\n\nThis May 1, British prosecutors inexplicably announced that \u201cterrorism connections\u201d would also be considered in the trial of 10 Palestine Action demonstrators who attacked Elbit supplier Instro Precision in June 2024. Again, the charges \u2013 aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder \u2013 did not fall under even the most expansive definition of terrorism. Such considerations, the CPS states, will only be explored at the point of sentencing.\n\nThe documentation reviewed by The Grayzone strongly implies these unprecedented breaches of long-established legal standards directly result from an extensive campaign of Israeli influence and meddling.\n\nThe mother of one imprisoned but as yet unconvicted Filton 18 activist told The Grayzone that revelations of AGO officials readily involving Israeli officials in the prosecution of her 21-year-old daughter Zoe made her \u201cfeel physically sick.\u201d Zoe has now been in prison for eight months without trial. It will have been 15 months by the time her trial begins in November.\n\n\u201cZoe took direct action against Elbit Systems because she could not bear to see her country being complicit in a genocide,\u201d said the jailed activist\u2019s mother. \u201cShe saw the UK committing war crimes by arming Israel, so she took action to uphold international law. Now we know it\u2019s that same unholy alliance between Israel and the UK that conspired to use UK counter terror powers against Zoe and the Filton 18.\u201d",

        "text": "Leaked documents show the supposedly self-reliant anti-Kremlin outlet Mediazona asked the UK gov\u2019t for \u00a3300,000. With foreign funding drying up, the \u201cindependent\u201d news site now faces financial crisis.\n\nMediazona, the self-styled \u201cindependent\u201d Russian outlet which partners with the BBC to track the deaths of Russian troops, requested hundreds of thousands of pounds directly from the British government, according to a tranche of leaked official documents.\n\nHaving mainly targeted Russians since its founding in 2014 by members of the Western-backed troupe of provocateurs known as Pussy Riot, Mediazona has largely remained off the radar of news consumers in the West. But that changed with the outbreak of full-scale war in Ukraine. Since the first day of the conflict, Mediazona has collaborated with the BBC Russian Service on a project tracking the deaths of Russian servicemen through open source methods. Mediazona describes \u201cthe work [as] meticulous and time-consuming,\u201d requiring \u201crelentless efforts of journalists.\u201d\n\nWho or what was footing the bill was left unmentioned in the description of the initiative, which was clearly designed to foment dissent and opposition to the proxy war among Russian citizens. Now, leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone indicate that between 2020 and 2023, Mediazona was in line for vast, secret grants for anti-Kremlin agitation from the British Foreign Office, under the official auspices of London\u2019s opaque \u201cGlobal Britain Fund.\u201d\n\nFrom Pussy Riot to Mediazona\n\nLeaked files related to the information warfare effort show London earmarked a myriad of NGOs, rights groups, and news outlets in Russia to receive hundreds of thousands of pounds in order to undermine the Kremlin with propaganda and supposed civil society initiatives. Among the most prominent proposed repeat recipients was Mediazona.\n\nOne prospective grant from the Foreign Office would have transferred a whopping \u00a3300,000 between 2020 \u2013 2023 to the outlet, which describes itself in the application as \u201cRussia\u2019s leading independent and socially focused media company.\u201d\n\nBoasting that \u201cMediazona contributes to the discussion of many legal and structural problems haunting Russian society and state, and also reports on foreign events (including in the UK) that have implications for Russians,\u201d the proposal laid out the \u201ckey objectives set for Mediazona,\u201d which included \u201c[challenging] the official version of events by providing audiences with high-quality investigative journalism, compelling eye witness accounts and live feeds from the ground.\u201d If approved, Mediazona would also \u201cdevelop critical thinking amongst young Russians through the proactive use of social media networks and interactive content.\u201d\n\nThe applicants bragged that Mediazona\u2019s \u201cprominent status on the Russian-language internet\u201d meant \u201cissues raised through its publications\u201d would \u201chave measurable resonance, stimulating constructive engagement between multiple stakeholder groups including public officials.\u201d\n\nMediazona would be expected to produce \u201caround 120 news articles per week, at least 18 investigative reports per month and a series of online feeds delivered from crucial events across Russia.\u201d The Foreign Office pledged, \u201cthis programming will serve to expose corruption and the abuse of power whilst bringing credible and authentic voices into the public domain.\u201d In addition, the editorial team hoped to \u201cforge new partnerships with key players in the Russian and international media landscape, thereby ensuring powerful multiplier effects.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the British Foreign Office received a petition for \u00a3150,000 over two years on behalf of Zona Prava, an NGO which was also founded by Pussy Riot. The organization would expose alleged human rights abuses in Russian prisons, via \u201cpublic events\u201d such as \u201chot lines, round tables, seminars, information events with the invitation of public figures and government representatives.\u201d Meanwhile, in \u201cclose cooperation\u201d with Mediazona, Zona Prava would produce \u201cat least 800 materials in federal and regional media\u2026 at least 10 videos\u201d and potentially one or two documentaries.\n\nBritish intel circumvents \u2018foreign agent\u2019 law\n\nThe leaked documents make clear that the British were aware that their activities were illegal under Moscow\u2019s Foreign Agent law. A funding application for Equal Rights Trust, a Global Britain Fund recipient charged with lawfare operations referred to cryptically as \u201ctargeted strategic litigation\u201d explicitly describes a British government-funded effort to evade the new law. \u201cAs part of our current project\u201d being financed by the UK Foreign Office, ERT wrote that it \u201chas undertaken an extensive risk assessment of the Russian context, including commissioning an independent consultant to produce a report on the Foreign Agent Law.\u201d As a result, \u201cERT is now well-versed\u201d in various \u201cprocedures to mitigate the risks of transferring funds to Russia,\u201d which \u201callowed for the ongoing successful implementation of activities despite the Foreign Agent law.\u201d\n\nThese procedures included \u201cdiversifying means of transferring of funds, on-going assessment on methods of transfer, clear lines of communication with the recipient on when and how transfers are made, neutral codes and payment reference for bank records, and maximum amounts per transfer and numbers of transfers using the same method.\u201d\n\nERT concluded that \u201cit is simpler and safer for all concerned to work without a formal partner to distribute funds to project beneficiaries,\u201d and instead \u201cwork with a series of informal partners through consultancy agreements.\u201d ERT was said to have \u201cutilised this approach to great success in similar environments.\u201d\n\nIt is unknown if the Global Britain projects involving Mediazona went ahead, and, if so, whether they used such \u201cprocedures\u201d to launder the money. But the outlet\u2019s long standing public alliance with the British state, via the project mapping Russian war casualties with the BBC\u2019s Russian Service, highlights the outlet\u2019s perceived utility as a conduit for anti-Kremlin agitprop.\n\nMediazona lashes out at damaging leaks with libelous allegations\n\nIf financing did flow to Mediazona under \u201cGlobal Britain,\u201d it would not have been the first time London covertly supported the group\u2019s activities. In February 2021, leaks reported by The Grayzone revealed how Mediazona had, alongside Meduza, received covert backing from British intelligence in the form of \u201caudience segmentation and targeting support\u201d some years prior. The assistance formed part of a wider clandestine effort to \u201cweaken the Russian state\u2019s influence.\u201d While Mediazona\u2019s top brass issued no official statement or response to the disclosures, a retort of sorts was promptly forthcoming.\n\nDays after this outlet\u2019s reporting appeared, Mediazona published a sensational exclusive, claiming Amnesty International\u2019s decision to rescind Western-backed, imprisoned Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny\u2019s \u201cprisoner of conscience\u201d status resulted from a sinister Kremlin-orchestrated \u201ccampaign,\u201d led by \u201cindividuals tied\u201d to Russian state broadcaster RT. The supposed culprits were The Grayzone\u2019s Aaron Mat\u00e9, and a freelance writer and translator known as Katya Kazbek \u2013 neither of whom were tied to RT in any way.\n\nMat\u00e9\u2019s apparent sin was revealing how Amnesty had revoked Navalny\u2019s status \u201cgiven the fact that he advocated violence and discrimination and he has not retracted such statements.\u201d For her part, Kazbek stood accused of posting a viral Twitter thread documenting Navalny\u2019s lengthy history of racism, xenophobia, and association with and promotion of Neo-Nazi figures and groups, which he consistently refused to repudiate. She was subsequently doxxed by Bellingcat editor Natalia Antonova, who revealed sensitive private details, including her home address.\n\nAmnesty International issued a statement explicitly denying \u201cexternal pressure\u201d from any source influenced its decision to remove Navalny from its list of \u201cprisoners of conscience.\u201d Nevertheless, Mediazona\u2019s hatchet job was promptly translated into English by Meduza, where its charges were seized upon by mainstream Navalny endorsers and Western news outlets, including the BBC.\n\nMeduza\u2019s then-investigative editor, Alexey Kovalev, appeared to acknowledge the bogus story was revenge for articles exposing Britain\u2019s clandestine support of both Mediazona and Kovalev\u2019s employer, Meduza. In a 2021 tweet, Kovalev accused the author of this article of having \u201cunleashed a careless conspiracy theory,\u201d insisting that the leaked documents exposing those ties were \u201cfake.\u201d In closing, he sneered: \u201cconsider us square.\u201d\n\nBut the documents, and recent announcement by both Mediazona and Meduza, indicate that claims of secret Western sponsorship for the supposedly-independent outlets were anything but \u201cfake.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy plea posted across their social media accounts entitled \u201cMediazona on the brink,\u201d the group groaned that they were \u201crunning out of money\u201d and urgently needed 5,000 monthly subscribers just \u201cto stay afloat.\u201d After Western sanctions forced Visa and Mastercard out of Russia, \u201cfunding from our readers\u201d dried up, they wrote, explaining that the Ukraine proxy war\u2019s outbreak \u201ccollapsed\u201d the outlet\u2019s business model \u201covernight.\u201d\n\nMediazona claimed they\u2019d already begun laying off staff as a result of budget cuts, warning if their subscriber target was not reached, layoffs \u201cwill have to continue.\u201d Before the war, they claimed, the outlet was funded \u201calmost [emphasis added] entirely\u201d by reader donations. This glaring caveat strongly suggests they had been at least partially backed by government funding \u2013 a notion seemingly confirmed in a February 28 Euractiv interview with Nikita Dulnev, director of Mediazona\u2019s Central Asia branch, who directly linked his outlet\u2019s financial woes to the Trump administration\u2019s shutdown of USAID.\n\nDulnev was described by Euractiv as one of many \u201cmedia professionals in Eastern European countries\u201d who fear Washington\u2019s \u201cabrupt funding cut\u201d to local propaganda projects \u201ccould inflict lasting damage on the region\u2019s media infrastructure.\u201d In the article, Dulnev lamented, \u201cfor years, we had some support and didn\u2019t diversify much. That\u2019s why we had to pause our work.\u201d Dulnev\u2019s LinkedIn profile lists him as formerly employed by the \u201cKhodorkovsky network.\u201d\n\nThat international anti-Kremlin propaganda group was formed by London-residing exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was released with members of Pussy Riot in December 2013 as a \u201cmagnanimous gesture\u201d by Moscow towards the Russian opposition. Since then, Khodorkovsky has openly plotted Vladimir Putin\u2019s downfall, though the full extent of this agitation is unknown.\n\nPussy Riot cofounders Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova launched Mediazona almost immediately after their release alongside Khodorkovsky. A 2014 press release announcing their outlet\u2019s founding explicitly linked Mediazona\u2019s creation to the lack of \u201cspace for anything in [Russian] media that criticizes Putin\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nIt was thus evident from day one that Mediazona was intended to serve as an extension of Pussy Riot\u2019s political activism in Russia, which previously included Tolokonnikova\u2019s participation in a public orgy at a Moscow museum in 2008, and other incendiary, criminal acts that would get perpetrators jailed almost anywhere in the world. The outlet quickly became a dependable megaphone for Western-sponsored opposition figure Alexei Navalny until his February 2024 death.\n\nA February 2025 New York Times report confirmed Meduza had been in receipt of unacknowledged funds from USAID, a traditional US intelligence cutout, amounting to 15% of its annual income. This budgetary shortfall, they claimed, was sufficient to put the outlet\u2019s entire future in jeopardy, and inflict more damage on its operations than previous alleged \u201ccyberattacks, legal threats and even poisonings of its reporters.\u201d The New York Times noted that financing for opposition media outlets from other foreign governments was \u201ctiny in comparison with American funding\u201d cut by the Trump administration.\n\nMoreover, \u201ctraditional media supporters\u201d such as the CIA-connected Ford Foundation and George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations have \u201cabandoned much of [their] media funding\u201d outright. This abrupt lack of overseas bankrolling for anti-Kremlin propaganda operations was parenthetically acknowledged in Mediazona\u2019s desperate March 31 plea for reader donations, which lamented that \u201cgrants from various foundations\u201d are no longer forthcoming \u201cin the current situation.\u201d It appears Mediazona is also a victim of the US-led cessation of foreign funding for \u2018independent\u2019 media projects targeting enemy states.\n\nAs funding from Western governments dries up, Pussy Riot has launched a page on OnlyFans. The group\u2019s \u201cfetish/kink friendly\u201d official profile on the website, widely used by sex workers, promises paying subscribers \u201cdaily exclusive photos and videos,\u201d \u201cone on one chatting,\u201d \u201ccustom content and items,\u201d and \u201cexceptional service for all your personal requests.\u201d\n\nAt the time of publication, promotional offers on three and six-month subscriptions are offered. It is unknown how many NATO member states, if any, have availed themselves of the opportunity.",

The British Foreign Office had earmarked substantial funds for Mediazona through the Global Britain Fund to support its investigative journalism and anti-Kremlin activities. However, with Western funding sources drying up, Mediazona faces severe financial difficulties, prompting a plea for reader donations to sustain its operations. This situation highlights the broader challenges faced by anti-Kremlin media outlets as traditional funding sources, including those from the US and other Western entities, have been reduced or cut off entirely. Meanwhile, Pussy Riot has turned to platforms like OnlyFans to generate income, reflecting the dire financial straits faced by these groups.",

        "text": "The confidence trickster was at it again on his visit to The Hague, reluctantly meeting members of the overly large family that is NATO. President Donald Trump was hoping to impress upon all present that allies of the United States, whatever inclination and whatever their domestic policy, should spend mightily on defence, inflating the margins of sense and sensibility against marginal threats. Never mind the strain placed on the national budget over such absurd priorities as welfare, health or education.\n\nThe marvellous irony in this is that much of the budget increases have been prompted by Trump\u2019s perceived unreliability and capriciousness when it comes to European affairs. Would he, for instance, treat obligations of collective defence outlined in Article 5 of the organisation\u2019s governing treaty with utmost seriousness? Since Washington cannot be relied upon to hold the fort against the satanic savages from the East, various European countries have been encouraging a spike in defence spending to fight the sprites and hobgoblins troubling their consciences at night.\n\nThe European Union, for instance, has put in place initiatives that will make getting more weaponry and investing in the military industrial complex easier than ever, raising the threshold of defence expenditure across all member countries to 3.5% of GDP by the end of the decade. And then there is the Ukraine conflict, a war Brussels cannot bear to see end on terms that might be remotely favourable to Russia.\n\nThe promised pecuniary spray made at the NATO summit was seen by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte as utterly natural if not eminently sensible. Not much else was. It was Rutte who remarked with infantile fawning that \u201cSometimes Daddy has to use tough language\u201d when it came to sorting out the murderous bickering between Israel and Iran. Daddy Trump approved. \u201cHe likes me, I think he likes me,\u201d the US president crowed with glowing satisfaction.\n\nRutte\u2019s behaviour has been viewed with suspicion, as well it should. Under his direction, NATO headquarters have made a point of diminishing any focus on climate change and its Women, Peace, and Security agenda. He has failed to make much of Trump\u2019s mania for the annexation of Greenland, or the President\u2019s gladiatorial abuse of certain leaders when visiting the White House \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky and South Africa\u2019s Cyril Ramaphosa come to mind. \u201cHe is not paid to implement MAGA policy,\u201d grumbled a European NATO diplomat to Euroactive.\n\nIn his doorstep statement of June 25, Rutte made his wish known that the NATO collective possess both the money and capabilities to cope, not just with Russia \u201cbut also the massive build-up of military in China, and the fact that North Korea, China and Iran, are supporting the war effort in Ukraine\u201d. Lashings of butter were also added to the Trump ego when responding to questions. \u201cWould you really think that the seven or eight countries not at 2% [of GDP expenditure on defence] at the beginning of this year would have reached the 2% if Trump would not have been elected President of the United States?\u201d It was only appropriate, given the contributions of the US (\u201cover 50% of the total NATO economy\u201d), that things had to change for the Europeans and Canadians.\n\nThe centrepiece of the Hague Summit Declaration is a promise that 5% of member countries\u2019 gross GDP will go to \u201ccore defence requirements as well as defence and security-related spending by 2035 to ensure our individual and collective obligations\u201d. Traditional bogeyman Russia is the predictable antagonist, posing a \u201clong-term threat [\u2026] to Euro-Atlantic security\u201d, but so was \u201cthe persistent threat of terrorism\u201d. The target is optimistic, given NATO\u2019s own recent estimates that nine members spend less than the current target of 2% of GDP.\n\nWhat is misleading in the declaration is the accounting process: the 3.5% of annual GDP that will be spent \u201con the agreed definition of NATO defence expenditure by 2035 to resource core defence requirements, and to meet NATO Capability Targets\u201d is one component. The other 1.5%, a figure based on a creative management of accounts, is intended to \u201cprotect our critical infrastructure, defend our networks, ensure our civil preparedness and resilience, unleash innovation, and strengthen our defence industrial base.\u201d\n\nAnother misleading element in the declaration is the claimed unanimity of member states. The Baltic countries and Poland are forever engaged in increasing their defence budgets in anticipation of a Russian attack, but the same cannot be said of other countries less disposed to the issue. Slovakia\u2019s Prime Minister Robert Fico, for instance, declared on the eve of the summit that his country had \u201cbetter things to spend money on\u201d. Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has also called the 5% target \u201cincompatible with our world view\u201d, preferring to focus on a policy of prudent procurement.\n\nRutte seemed to revel in his role as wallah and jesting sycophant, making sure Trump was not only placated but massaged into a state of satisfaction. It was a sight all the stranger for the fact that Trump\u2019s view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is a warm one. Unfortunately for the secretary general, his role will be forever etched in the context of European history as an aspiring warmonger, one valued at 5% of the GDP of any of the NATO member states. Hardly a flattering epitaph.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "During a NATO summit in The Hague, President Donald Trump pushed for increased defense spending among allies, driven by perceived threats and his own unpredictability, while NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte supported this stance, despite internal disagreements and skepticism from some member countries.",
        "paragraph_summary": "During a visit to The Hague, President Donald Trump urged NATO allies to significantly increase their defense spending, overshadowing domestic priorities like welfare and education. Ironically, this push for higher military budgets is partly driven by European concerns over Trump's unpredictable stance on collective defense, as outlined in NATO's Article 5. In response, the European Union has set initiatives to raise defense expenditure to 3.5% of GDP by the decade's end, partly fueled by the ongoing Ukraine conflict. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte supported the increased spending, despite criticism of his alignment with Trump's policies and his neglect of issues like climate change. The Hague Summit Declaration ambitiously aims for 5% of GDP to be allocated to defense by 2035, though skepticism remains about the feasibility and unanimity of this target among member states. Rutte's sycophantic behavior towards Trump was noted, highlighting the complex dynamics within NATO as it grapples with perceived threats from Russia and other global powers.",

        "url": "https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/27/hasties-sensible-advice-more-transparency-on-us-forces-in-australia/",
        "text": "It was a blast to a past wiped out by amnesia, social media and mental decrepitude. Andrew Hastie, Australia\u2019s opposition minister for home affairs, had been moved by an idea: greater transparency was needed regarding the US military buildup in Australia. It was an inspiration overdue by some decades, but it was worthwhile in its unaccustomed sensibility.\n\nIn an interview with the Insiders program on the ABC, Hastie proved startling in proposing that Australia needed \u201cto have a much more mature discussion about our relationship with the United States. I think we need greater transparency.\u201d He proceeded to recall the frankness of US Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth\u2019s testimony before the US Senate Armed Services Committee, which saw China named \u201cas the pacing threat\u201d in the Indo Pacific. Australia, Japan and the Philippines were mentioned as part of \u201cthe integrated deterrence that the US is building in the region.\u201d\n\nThis saddled the Albanese government with significant obligations to the Australian people. Be clear, suggests Hastie. Be transparent. \u201cI think we need to talk about operationalising the alliance, building guard rails for combat operations, and of course defining our sovereignty. And this will make things clearer for us so that we can better preserve our national interest.\u201d With admirable clarity, Hastie places the Australian security establishment in the dock for interrogation. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a vassal stage, we\u2019re an ally and a partner and I think it\u2019s time that we had a good discussion about what that looks like.\u201d\n\nGiven that Australia already hosts a rotational US Marine force in Darwin from April to November, the Pine Gap signal intelligence facility in Alice Springs, and, in due course, the Submarine Rotational Force out of Perth from 2027 (\u201ceffectively a US submarine base\u201d), it was time to consider what would happen if, say, a war were to be waged in the Indo Pacific. It was \u201cabout time we started to mature the [relationship] model and we\u2019re open to the Australian people what it means for us\u201d.\n\nThese views are not those of a closet pacifist wishing away the tangles of the US imperium. Having spent his pre-political life in the Australian Defence Forces as a member of the special services, he knows what it\u2019s like playing valet in the battlefield to Washington\u2019s imperial mandarins. Not that he rejects that role. Fear of abandonment and Freudian neuroses tend to pattern the Australian outlook on defence and national security. Yet there was something comforting in his awareness that the American garrisoning of its ally for future geopolitical brawling needed explanation and elucidation.\n\nThe response from Australia\u2019s Defence Minister Richard Marles was typical. Spot the backbone of such a figure and find it wanting. US intentions and operations in Australia, he insisted, were adequately clear. Australians need not be troubled. There was, he told reporters during a visit to London to meet his UK counterpart John Healey \u201cactually a high degree of transparency in relation to the United States presence in Australia.\u201d The Australian government had \u201clong and full knowledge and concurrence arrangements in relation to America\u2019s force posture in Australia, not just in relation to Pine Gap, but in relation to all of its force posture in Australia.\u201d Reiterating another fable of defence orthodoxy, Marles was also convinced Australia\u2019s sovereignty in terms of how the US conducted its operations had been spared. Given Canberra\u2019s abject surrender to Washington\u2019s whims and interests with the AUKUS trilateral pact, this is an unsustainable claim.\n\nTo this day, we have sufficient anecdotal evidence that Pine Gap, notionally a jointly run facility between US and Australian personnel, remains indispensable to the Pentagon, be it in navigating drones, directing bombing missions and monitoring adversaries. The Nautilus Institute, most capably through its senior research associate Richard Tanter, has noted the base\u2019s use of geosynchronous signals intelligence (SIGINT) satellites, Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) and its acquisition in the early 2000s of a FORNSAT/COMSAT (foreign satellite/communications satellite) function.\n\nThis makes Australia complicit in campaigns the United States pursues when it chooses. Dr Margaret Beavis, Australian co-chair of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), outlined the potential consequences: \u201cWe risk accelerating nuclear proliferation, we risk Pine Gap becoming a target, Tindal airbase becoming a target.\u201d\n\nAll efforts to raise the matter before the vassal representatives in Canberra tends to end in a terminating cul-de-sac. Regarding the latest use of US B-2 stealth bombers in targeting Iran\u2019s three primary nuclear facilities, the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, was curt: \u201cWe are upfront, but we don\u2019t talk about intelligence\u201d. The bombing had been a \u201cunilateral action taken by the United States.\u201d Australian candour has its limits.\n\nThere is also no clarity about what the US military places on Australian soil when it comes to nuclear weapons or any other fabulous nasties that make killing in the name of freedom\u2019s empire so glorious and reassuring. As a signatory to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (SPNFZ), Australia would be in violation of its obligations, with Article 5 obligating each party \u201cto prevent in its territory the stationing of any nuclear explosive device.\u201d Yet deploying B-52 bombers at the RAAF Tindal base would suggest just that, though not all such bombers are adapted to that end.\n\nThe naval gazing toadies in foreign affairs and defence have come up with a nice exit from the discussion: such weapons, if they were ever to find themselves on US weapons platforms on Australian soil, would only ever be in transit. In a Senate estimates hearing in February 2023, Defence Department secretary Greg Moriarty blithely observedthat, while the stationing of nuclear weapons was prohibited by the treaty, nuclear-armed US bombers could still pay a visit. \u201cSuccessive Australian governments have understood and respected the longstanding US policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on particular platforms.\u201d It is precisely that sort of deferential piffle we can do without.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "Andrew Hastie, Australia's opposition minister for home affairs, has called for greater transparency and a mature discussion about Australia's military relationship with the United States, highlighting concerns about the implications of US military presence and operations on Australian soil, while the current government maintains that existing transparency is sufficient.",

This includes the presence of US Marines in Darwin, the Pine Gap intelligence facility, and the upcoming Submarine Rotational Force in Perth. Hastie, drawing from his military background, stresses the importance of defining Australia's sovereignty and national interests amidst fears of being a mere vassal to US interests. In contrast, Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles claims there is already sufficient transparency regarding US operations in Australia, a stance critiqued as unsustainable given the lack of clarity on nuclear weapons and other military activities. The article highlights the complexities and potential risks of Australia's involvement in US-led military strategies, including nuclear proliferation concerns and treaty violations, while criticizing the deferential attitude of Australian officials toward US policies.",

        "text": "It\u2019s official. If not, it ought to be. Israeli forces freely butcher Palestinians in Gaza of all stripes, standing and states of desperation. They do so casually or indifferently or maliciously. True, they might get the odd militant here and there, but the supposedly professional Israeli Defense Forces is rather good at killing civilians. In what is becoming an almost daily occurrence, Israeli security personnel are slaughtering those seeking humanitarian aid from facilities that are obscenely restricted and appallingly located. What is unclear in the process is how devastating Palestinian militias armed and supported by the Israelis have been in pushing up the mortality count.\n\nIn one incident on June 17, Israeli tanks \u2013 not exactly a light form of population control \u2013 fired into a crown scrounging for aid from trucks in Gaza. The resulting death toll was impressively outrageous: 59 killed. A further 14 were also killed by IDF gunfire and air strikes in the enclave, taking the death toll for June 17 to 73. On this occasion, Israel\u2019s normally mendacious publicity arm in the IDF seemed to concede that the firing had taken place. It followed that yet another cleansing review would take place.\n\nAccording to Reuters, a witness by the name of Alaa interviewed at Nasser Hospital saw the following spectacle of gore: \u201cAll of a sudden, they let us move forward and made everyone gather, and then shells started falling, tank shells.\u201d\n\nThe IDF breezily stated that it was \u201caware of reports regarding a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following the crowd\u2019s approach. The details of the incident are under view. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to minimise harm as much as possible to them while maintaining the safety of our troops.\u201d\n\nThe previous day, 34 people awaiting to collect food were killed by IDF personnel near an aid centre operated by the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a body whose dubious credentials never cease to amaze. Eyewitnesses in the crowd, including Heba Jouda and Mohamed Abed, recall Israeli troops firing on Palestinians massed around 4 a.m. at the Flag Roundabout prior to the scheduled opening of the Rafah food centre. The roundabout is located some hundreds of metres from the GHF centre, and has been the site of numerous shootings. \u201cFire was coming from everywhere,\u201d stated Jouda, a worn figure who has made the harrowing journey to the aid centre a number of times. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse by the day.\u201d\n\nThe International Committee on the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed receiving 200 people at its field hospital located in the Al-Mawasi area near Rafah. Up till that point, the ICRC stated that it had been \u201cthe highest number received by the Red Cross Field Hospital in one mass casualty incident.\u201d Carrie Garavan, a British Red Cross nurse working at the field hospital, notes the daily flow of casualties into the facility, most of whom have been queuing for food. \u201cWe are having mass casualty incidents almost every day, sometimes twice a day.\u201d\n\nThe GHF, for its part, is lukewarm to the fattening butcher\u2019s bill. None of the shooting incidents, claimed a spokesperson to The Associated Press, \u201chave occurred at our sites or during operating hours.\u201d Implying that those seeking aid were responsible for their own demise, the spokesperson went on to explain that they had moved \u201cduring prohibited times \u2026 or trying to take a shortcut.\u201d How irresponsible of them.\n\nIn oral evidence given to the UK Foreign Affairs Committee on June 16, Anna Halford, the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res emergency coordinator for Gaza, found it \u201cdifficult to overstate at what point this is neither a humanitarian enterprise nor a system.\u201d The entire Israeli aid effort in Gaza, as things stood, \u201cwas basically lethal chaos.\u201d Prior to the current lethal order of aid distribution, 400 to 500 community-level points were functioning for those seeking food. Kitchens cooking hot meals and bakeries supplying bread were plentiful. The numbers currently operating had plummeted to four.\n\nHalford\u2019s picture of what is being provided is grisly. The rations are only of the dry variety. There is an absence of clean water and cooking fuel, with no cooking gas entering the enclave since March 2. Substitute kerosene has proven woefully inadequate, causing those using it burns. Food is cooked on broken wooden pallets, salvaged plastic taken from piles of rubbish or turned up cardboard boxes.\n\nAs for the justification given by Israel for the imposition of such onerous, cruel restrictions to the provision of aid \u2013 the deviation and theft of aid by Hamas or allied forces \u2013 Halford, speaking on behalf of MSF, was sharp in rebuke. While no aid system could ever guarantee against some deviation or theft of supplies, Israel had never offered any evidence to back its claims. \u201cIt is a strawman; it is a specious and cynical position meant to undermine a humanitarian system that was actually functioning.\u201d And that is precisely the point of the current, sanguinary exercise.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The article criticizes Israeli forces for their frequent and deadly attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, particularly those seeking humanitarian aid, and highlights the severe restrictions and chaos in the aid distribution system, which is exacerbated by Israel's unsubstantiated claims of aid diversion by Hamas.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The article highlights the dire situation in Gaza, where Israeli forces are accused of routinely killing Palestinian civilians under the guise of targeting militants, with recent incidents resulting in high casualties among those seeking humanitarian aid. On June 17, Israeli tanks fired on a crowd in Gaza, killing 59 people, while additional IDF actions brought the day's death toll to 73. Eyewitnesses describe indiscriminate firing on civilians, including those queuing for food. The International Committee on the Red Cross reported a significant influx of casualties at its field hospital, reflecting the escalating violence. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, criticized for its handling of aid distribution, deflects responsibility by blaming victims for being in prohibited areas. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res criticizes the Israeli aid system as chaotic and lethal, with severe restrictions leading to inadequate food and water supplies. The justification for these restrictions, allegedly to prevent aid theft by Hamas, is dismissed as unfounded by MSF, which argues that the system previously functioned effectively.

        "text": "There is a throbbing complaint among Western powers, including those in the European Union and the United States. Iran is not playing by the rules. Instead of accepting with dutiful meekness the slaughter of its military leadership and scientific personnel, Tehran decided, promptly, to respond to Israel\u2019s pre-emptive strikes launched on June 13. Instead of considering the dubious legal implications of such strikes, an act of undeclared war, the focus in the European Union and various other backers of Israel has been to focus on the retaliation itself.\n\nTo the Israeli attacks conducted as part of Operation Rising Lion, there was studied silence. It was not a silence observed when it came to the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 by Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. Then, the law books were swiftly procured, and obligations of the United Nations Charter cited under Article 2(4): \u201cAll members shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of any state.\u201d Russia was condemned for adopting a preventive stance on Ukraine as a threat to its security: that, in Kyiv joining NATO, a formidable threat would manifest at the border.\n\nIn his statement on the unfolding conflict between Israel and Iran, France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron made sure to condemn \u201cIran\u2019s ongoing nuclear program\u201d, having taken \u201call appropriate diplomatic measures in response.\u201d Israel also had the \u201cright to defend itself and ensure its security\u201d, leaving open the suggestion that it might have been justified resorting to Article 51 of the UN Charter. All he could offer was a call on \u201call parties to exercise maximum restraint and to de-escalate.\u201d\n\nIn a most piquant response, Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories stated that, \u201cOn the day Israel, unprovoked, has attacked Iran, killing 80 people, the president of a major European power, finally admits that in the Middle East, Israel, and only Israel, has the right to defend itself.\u201d\n\nThe German Foreign Office was even bolder in accusing Iran of having engaged in its own selfish measures of self-defence (such unwarranted bravado!), something it has always been happy to afford Israel. \u201cWe strongly condemn the indiscriminate Iranian attack on Israeli territory.\u201d In contrast, the foreign office also felt it appropriate to reference the illegal attack on Iran as involving \u201ctargeted strikes\u201d against its nuclear facilities. Despite Israel having an undeclared nuclear weapons stockpile that permanently endangers security in the region, the office went on to chastise Iran for having a nuclear program that violated \u201cthe Non-Proliferation Treaty\u201d, threatening in its nature \u201cto the entire region \u2013 especially Israel.\u201d Those at fault had been found out.\n\nThe President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, could hardly improve on that apologia. She revealed that she had been conversing with Israeli President Isaac Herzog about the \u201cescalating situation in the Middle East.\u201d She also knew her priorities: reiterating Israel\u2019s right to self- defence and refusing to mention Iran\u2019s, while tagging on the statement a broader concern for preserving regional stability. The rest involved a reference to diplomacy and de-escalation, toward which Israel has shown a resolute contempt with regards Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nThe assessment offered by Mohamed ElBaradei, former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was forensically impressive, as well as being icily dismissive. Not only did he reproach the German response for ignoring the importance of Article 2(4) of the Charter prohibiting the use of force subject to the right to self-defence, he brought up a reminder: targeted strikes against the nuclear facilities of any party \u201care prohibited under Article 56 of the additional protocol of the Geneva Conventions to which Germany is a party\u201d.\n\nElBaradei also referred anyone exercised by such matters to the United Nations Security Council 487 (1981), which did not have a single demur in its adoption. It unreservedly condemned the attack by Israel on Iraq\u2019s Osirak nuclear research reactor in June that year as a violation of the UN Charter, recognised that Iraq was a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and had permitted the IAEA inspections of the facility, stated that Iraq had a right to establish and develop civilian nuclear programs and called on Israel to place its own nuclear facilities under the jurisdictional safeguards of the IAEA.\n\nThe calculus regarding the use of force by Israel vis-\u00e0-vis its adversaries has long been a sneaky one. It is jigged and rigged in favour of the Jewish state. As Trita Parsi put it with unblemished accuracy, Western pundits had, for a year and a half, stated that Hamas, having started the Gaza War on October 7, 2023 bore responsibility for civilian carnage. \u201cWestern pundits for the past 1.5 days: Israel started the war with Iran, and if Iran retaliates, they bear responsibility for civilian deaths.\u201d The perceived barbarian, when attacked by a force seen as superior and civilised, will always be condemned for having reacted most naturally, and most violently of all.",

        "text": "Pre-emptive attacks in international law are rarely justified. The threat must evince itself through an obvious intent to inflict injury, evidence preparations that show the threat to be what Michael Walzer calls a \u201csupreme emergency\u201d, and arise in a situation where risk of defeat would be dramatically increased if force is not used.\n\nReaching an assessment on that matter is almost impossible. Evidence of such a threat by the aggressor state is bound to be speculative, concealing other strategic objectives that make that action amount to illegal, preventive war. Israel\u2019s ongoing attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure are taking place in the absence of nuclear weapons, motivated by the hypothetical scenario that such weapons would be irretrievably developed and used against the Jewish state. Iran, in other words, was being punished for a thought crime.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces released a statement expressing the rationale: \u201cWeapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are a threat to the State of Israel and a significant threat to the entire world. The State of Israel will not allow a regime whose goal is the destruction of the State of Israel to possess weapons of mass destruction.\u201d\n\nThere is even a concession on the part of IDF officials that triumphant success in the operation is not assured; Israelis needed to brace themselves before the inevitable reaction. \u201cI can\u2019t promise absolute success,\u201d declared Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir. Tehran \u201cwill attempt to attack us in response, the expected toll will be different to what we are used to.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Minister Israel Katz offers some wishful thinking in justifying the attack. \u201cWe are now at a critical juncture. If we miss it, we will have no way to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons that will endanger our very own existence.\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu preferred lashings of hyperbole. \u201cIf we don\u2019t attack, then it\u2019s 100% that we will die,\u201d he declared in a video statement to the nation.\n\nThis is the language of self-denial, both on the issue of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear option indefinitely \u2013 an unsustainable policy in the absence of peaceful dissuasion \u2013 and the belief that such operations will result in some form of contained, well-behaved retaliation. With typical perversity, these attacks are taking place in step with demands by US President Donald Trump that Tehran resort to meek diplomacy, an effort that is bound to have been extinguished by these attacks.\n\nAnd what of the threat posed by Iran? In March this year, the US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the assessment was \u201cthat Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.\u201d But Netanyahu had already given a directive in November 2024 to thwart alleged efforts by Tehran to build a nuclear device. \u201cThe directive,\u201d he confirms, \u201ccame shortly after the assassination of [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah\u201d.\n\nThe broader Israeli logic here is less the coherence of the nuclear threat than one of settling scores and crippling a rival it has long accused of directing operations against its interests, if not directly than through its proxy militias.\n\nAs for the logic of non-acquisition, not much can be made of it. The advent of the Colt 45 revolver in the late 1800s arguably calmed the American West by granting those with less power and influence a means of asserting their will against the powerful and landed. It became \u201cthe Peacemaker\u201d, sometimes described as \u201cthe Great Equalizer.\u201d As part of that same logic, the late international relations theorist Kenneth N. Waltz proposed that nuclear weapons made war less likely, believing that \u201cthe gradual spread of nuclear weapons is to be more welcomed than feared.\u201d He even went so far as to argue in 2012 that Iran\u2019s acquisition of nuclear weapons would \u201cmost likely [\u2026] restore stability to the Middle East.\u201d It was Israel\u2019s durable nuclear monopoly in the Middle East that \u201clong fueled instability\u201d in the region.\n\nThe invention of nuclear weaponry was a statement of intent that possessing such a weapon would be akin to acquiring the shielding protection of a patron deity. This is a lesson the Israelis should know better than most, having themselves stealthily acquired an undeclared nuclear inventory. To not have it would weaken you, diminish international standing, making the non-possessor vulnerable to attack.\n\nNorth Korea learned this salutary lesson, motivated by two supreme examples: the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the US-led \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d, and the collective attack on Libya in 2011, ostensibly under the doctrine of responsibility to protect. The disarmament efforts made by Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s Libya rendered them vulnerable to attack. Lacking a terrifying deterrent, they were contemptuously rolled.\n\nAttempts to control proliferation have been imperfect, largely because the nuclear option has never been entirely demystified. Despite the admirable strides made in international law to stigmatise nuclear weapons, best reflected in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, not to mention the tireless labours of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the nuclear weapons club remains a permanent provocation and incitement to non-nuclear weapons states. It is the red rag to the bull.\n\nThese attacks will do little to weaken the resolve of the mullahs in Teheran. They are roguish undertakings, murderous in their scope (the killing of scientists and their families stands out), and sneering of international law. Netanyahu\u2019s absurd lecturing to the Iranian populace \u2013 we are bombing you to free you \u2013 will fall flat. Most consequential will be confirmation on the part of the Islamic State that acquiring a nuclear weapon is more imperative than ever.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The article argues that Israel's pre-emptive attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure are unjustified under international law, as they are based on speculative threats and could provoke further instability, while also highlighting the broader geopolitical implications and historical context of nuclear deterrence.",

These actions are framed as pre-emptive measures against a hypothetical future threat, given that Iran is not currently developing nuclear weapons, according to U.S. intelligence. Israeli officials justify the attacks by citing the potential threat of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, despite the lack of concrete evidence of such development. The article critiques this stance, suggesting it is more about settling scores and maintaining regional dominance than addressing an immediate threat. It also contrasts Israel's actions with historical examples, like North Korea's nuclear development, which was driven by the perceived need for deterrence after observing the fate of non-nuclear states like Iraq and Libya. The piece argues that such attacks are counterproductive, likely reinforcing Iran's resolve to pursue nuclear capabilities, and critiques the broader failure of international efforts to control nuclear proliferation effectively.",

        "text": "They really ought to be doing more. But in the scheme of things, the sanctioning of Israeli\u2019s frothily fanatical ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich by New Zealand, Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom and Australia is a reminder to the Israeli government that ethnic cleansing, mass killing and the destruction of a people will receive some comment. But a closer look at the trumpeted move does little to suggest anything in the way of change or deterrence, certainly not in Gaza, where the cataclysm continues without restraint.\n\nAccording to the joint statement, both politicians \u201chave incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.\u201d The violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank had \u201cled to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of whole communities.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning for the imposition of such sanctions tends to minimise Ben-Gvir and Smotrich\u2019s zealous defence of programmatic and systematic displacement and removal of Palestinian existence in the Strip, despite the statement claiming that \u201cthis cannot be seen in isolation\u201d. The statement fails to note the warnings from the International Court of Justice that Palestinians in Gaza face the risk of genocide, with a final decision pending on the matter.\n\nSingling out individual members of the Netanyahu cabinet as the convenient lunatics and the devilishly possessed is a point of convenience rather than effect. It is true that, even by certain Israeli standards, a figure like Ben-Gvir is a bit too pungent, a convict of racist incitement, the procurer of assault rifles to West Bank settlers and an advocate for the full annexation of the territory. But identifying the villainous monsters conceals the broader villainous effort, and the Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong did as much in simply calling the two ministers \u201cthe most extreme proponents of the unlawful and violent Israeli settlement enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe report of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, prefers to note the broader role played by such agents of power as the Israeli security forces, which it accuses of committing war crimes in directing attacks against the civilian population in Gaza, wilful killing and intentionally launching attacks that \u201cwould cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians\u201d. Killing civilians seeking shelter in schools also implicated the forces \u201cin the crime against humanity of extermination.\u201d The canvas of responsibility, in other words, is panoramic and large.\n\nPity, then, that the latest expression of small means by these five powers does not extend to a complete halt to military cooperation, the selling of arms, or engagement across various fields of industry. That would have diminished the hypocrisy somewhat, something that the countries in question are unlikely to do. More\u2019s the pity that the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been spared this fit of moral clarity. When considered in substance, the two ministers face the sorts of restrictions that will be mildly bruising at best: travel bans and the freezing of assets.\n\nThe move by the Australian Labor government and its counterparts was, in the broader scheme of things, a modest one. It was also worth remembering that Canberra\u2019s decision was made in sheepish fashion, with Wong previously stating that Australia would never unilaterally make such a move, as \u201cgoing it alone gets us nowhere\u201d. It was seen by Greens Senator Nick McKim as \u201cfar too little and far too late\u201d. Sanctions were needed against the \u201cIsraeli industrial war machine.\u201d On the other hand, Alex Ryvchin, co-chief of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry suggests that these measures can become a martyr\u2019s tonic. \u201cThey have little support in Israel, but this is the sort of measure that will boost their notoriety and make them perhaps more popular\u201d.\n\nLooking ever the marionette in the show, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio flapped about in condemning the sanctions, which \u201cdo not advance US-led efforts to achieve a ceasefire, bring all hostages home and end the war.\u201d Bereft of skills in argumentation, he could only warn US allies \u201cnot to forget who the real enemy is.\u201d\n\nThe sanctions seemed to cause the condemned two less grief than Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar, who derided the decision as \u201coutrageous\u201d, \u201cscandalous\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d It was all part of \u201ca planned and coordinated pressure campaign.\u201d Ben-Gvir was almost smug with the attention and bursting with semitic pride. \u201cWe survived Pharoah, we will also survive [British Prime Minister] Keir Starmer,\u201d he tooted in a statement.\n\nSmotrich even seemed thrilled by the timing of it all, having been at the inauguration of a new Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Hebron when he heard the news. \u201cI heard Britain had decided to impose sanctions on me because I am thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state,\u201d he boasted. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a better moment for this.\u201d\n\nOne point is certainly true: the selective moves against the dastardly two leaves the murderous apparatus intact, and the IDF war machine undiminished. Most of all, it will do nothing to halt the construction of a single settlement or save a single Palestinian from dispossession.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The sanctions imposed by New Zealand, Canada, Norway, the UK, and Australia on Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich for inciting violence and human rights abuses against Palestinians are largely symbolic and unlikely to effect meaningful change or deter ongoing actions in Gaza, as they do not address broader military cooperation or arms sales with Israel.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The recent sanctions imposed by New Zealand, Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Australia on Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich serve as a symbolic gesture against their extremist rhetoric and actions, which have incited violence and human rights abuses against Palestinians. However, the sanctions, which include travel bans and asset freezes, are criticized as insufficient and largely symbolic, failing to address the broader systemic issues of ethnic cleansing and violence in Gaza and the West Bank. Critics argue that these measures do little to deter the ongoing conflict or halt the construction of Israeli settlements, as they do not extend to halting military cooperation or arms sales. The move is seen as a modest and delayed response, with some suggesting it could inadvertently increase the notoriety of the sanctioned ministers. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have dismissed the sanctions as part of a coordinated pressure campaign, and the broader Israeli military operations remain unaffected.",

        "text": "It is one of those things that should be recorded and replayed for eternity: Israel, in order to guard some misplaced sense of security, happily backs Palestinian groups in order to divide themselves. Hamas, seen now as an existential monster, was tolerated and even supported for lengthy stints in efforts to undermine the various factions in the Palestinian Liberation Organisation represented by Fatah.\n\nIn his 2008 work, Hamas vs. Fatah, Jonathan Schanzer, writes how the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, the inspirational font for Hamas, was seen as an opportunity by the Israelis when taking root in Gaza. \u201cBy the late 1970s, the Israelis believed that they had found Fatah\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel.\u201d Israeli strategy permitted the Brotherhood to thrive, going so far as to allow the cleric Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to operate a network of welfare, medical and education services. These had been sorely neglected by Fatah in the Gaza Strip. This approach effectively licensed the emergence of fundamentalism, seen, curiously enough, as more manageable than the military adventurism of the PLO.\n\nThe First Intifada in 1987 spurred on the creation by Yassin and his followers of Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (\u201cIslamic Resistance Movement\u201d). The 1988 charter of the organisation we know as Hamas, more youthful, and leaner, and hungrier than their Fatah rivals, made its purpose clear: \u201cThere is no solution for the Palestinian question except through jihad\u201d.\n\nIn 2009, while surveying the ruins of a neighbour\u2019s bungalow in Moshav Tekuma, the retired Israeli officer Avner Cohen, who had served in Gaza for over two decades, was rueful. \u201cHamas, to my regret,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cis Israel\u2019s creation.\u201d Sustenance and encouragement from the Jewish state had effectively emboldened a mortal enemy.\n\nSuch a record should chasten wise legislators and leaders. But the only lesson history teaches is that its grave lessons are left unlearned, with disastrous, inimical mistakes made anew. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is proof of that contention. His various governments proudly backed the policy of division between the Gaza Strip and West Bank, defanging Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the latter while propping up Hamas in the former. Every now and then, the Israeli Defense Forces would keep Hamas in bloody check, a strategy that came to be called \u201cmowing the grass\u201d.\n\nIsrael\u2019s support for Hamas has come in the form of work permits (up to 3,000 granted to Gazans in 2021, rising to 10,000 during the Bennett-Lapid government), and suitcases, heavy with Qatari cash, entering the Strip through crossings since 2018. In 2019, Netanyahu was quoted as telling a Likud faction meeting that opponents of a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Hamas. Five years prior, Bezalel Smotrich, the current firebrand, pro-ethnic cleansing Finance Minister, declared with candour that \u201cThe Palestinian Authority is a burden, and Hamas is an asset.\u201d\n\nWith Hamas now the target and sworn enemy, the PM feels that the same, failed experiment adopted at stages since the 1970s can be replicated: backing and encouraging yet another group of Palestinians to undermine any sovereign cause.\n\nThe central figure and beneficiary of this latest folly is the shady Yasser Abu Shabab, a Rafah resident from a Bedouin family known for a spotty criminal record. Calling itself the \u201cAnti-Terror Service\u201d or the Popular Forces, and possessing assault rifles and equipment seized from Hamas, his \u201cclan\u201d, as reports have described it, has a committed record of looting humanitarian aid in Gaza. In Netanyahu\u2019s eyes, these rapacious poachers have turned into opportunistic game keepers, partially guarding the paltry aid that is currently being sent into Gaza under the supervision of the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\n\nGeorgios Petropoulos, a senior United Nations official based in Gaza last year, calls Abu Shabab \u201cthe self-styled power broker of east Rafah.\u201d For his part, Abu Shabab admits to looting aid trucks, but only \u201cso we can eat, not so we can sell.\u201d The looting proclivities of such groups is well noted, with the head of the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupied Palestinian territories, Jonathan Whittall, making a damning accusation on May 28: \u201cThe real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point in Gaza.\u201d\n\nOn May 21, Abu Shabab\u2019s group posted on Facebook that \u201c92 trucks were secured and entered areas under the protection of our popular forces, and exited safely under our supervision.\u201d Details on which organisation was behind hiring the transporting vehicles were not given.\n\nWith rumours bubbling that the Israeli government had embarked on this latest course of action, Netanyahu came clean. \u201cOn the advice of security officials, we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas,\u201d he announced in a posted video with usual, glowing cynicism. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d The strategy \u201conly saves the lives of Israeli soldiers and publicising this only benefits Hamas.\u201d\n\nThe advice purportedly given by Shin Bet to Netanyahu to arm Gaza militias opposed to Hamas was an expedient measure, largely occasioned by the PM\u2019s continued refusal to involve the Palestinian Authority in the strip.\n\nNot all Israeli lawmakers were impressed by Netanyahu\u2019s latest effort at supposed cleverness. Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats in the Knesset, condemned him as a threat to Israeli security. \u201cInstead of bringing about a deal, making arrangements with the moderate Sunni axis, and returning the hostages and security of Israeli citizens, he is creating a new ticking bomb in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, Avigdor Lieberman, is of the view that the transfer of weapons to Abu Shabab\u2019s outfit was done unilaterally. \u201cThe Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with the Islamic State group,\u201d he told the public broadcaster Kan. \u201cTo my knowledge, this did not go through approval by the cabinet.\u201d\n\nWith humanitarian aid now at the mercy of a group scorned by UN officials, humanitarian workers and certain Israeli politicians \u2013 a rare coming together of minds \u2013 the next round of errors is playing out with rich, quixotic stupidity. Israel further adds to its own insecurity, while Abu Shabab knows all too well the views of his family, expressed in chilling statement: \u201cWe affirm that we will not accept Yasser\u2019s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.\u201d",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The article discusses Israel's historical strategy of supporting Palestinian groups like Hamas to undermine Fatah, a tactic that has backfired, leading to increased insecurity and the rise of new problematic factions such as Yasser Abu Shabab's group, which is now involved in looting humanitarian aid in Gaza under Israeli oversight.",

This strategy backfired as Hamas became a formidable adversary, with Israel's past support described as having created its own enemy. Despite this, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to employ similar tactics, recently supporting a group led by Yasser Abu Shabab in Gaza to counter Hamas. This group, known for looting humanitarian aid, has been armed by Israel, drawing criticism from various quarters, including Israeli politicians and UN officials. Critics argue that this approach exacerbates insecurity and instability in the region, with Netanyahu's actions seen as creating a new threat rather than fostering peace.",

        "text": "\n\nUnpopular governments always retreat to grounds of lazy convenience. Instead of engaging in exercises of courage, they take refuge in obvious distractions. And there is no more obvious distraction than preparing for war against a phantom enemy.\n\nThat is exactly where the government of Sir Keir Starmer finds itself. Despite a mammoth majority and a dramatically diminished Tory opposition, the Prime Minister acts like a man permanently besieged, his Labour Party seemingly less popular than Typhoid Mary. His inability to be unequivocal to questions of whether he will contest the next election suggest as much.\n\nThe same cannot be said about his enthusiasm for the sword and sabre. There are monsters out there to battle, and Sir Keir is rising to the plate. Sensing this, the military mandarins, most prominently General Sir Roland Walker, head of the Army, have been more than encouraging, seeing the need to ready the country for war by 2027. Given the military\u2019s perennial love affair with astrology, that state of readiness could only be achieved with a doubling of the Army\u2019s fighting power and tripling it by 2030.\n\nGiven that background, the UK Strategic Defence Review (SDR) was commissioned in July 2024. Led by former Labour Defence Secretary and NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson, the freshly released report promises a fat boon for the military industrial complex. Like all efforts to encourage war, its narrative is that of supposedly making Britain safer.\n\nStarmer\u2019s introduction is almost grateful for the chance to out the blood lusting enemy. \u201cIn this new era for defence and security, when Russia is waging war on our continent and probing our defences at home, we must meet the danger head on.\u201d The placing of noble Ukraine into the warming fraternity of Europe enables a civilisational twist to be made. The Russian military efforts in Ukraine are not specific to a murderous family affair and historical anxieties but directed against all Europeans. Therefore, all Europeans should militarise and join the ranks, acknowledging that \u201cthe very nature of warfare is being transformed\u201d by that conflict.\n\nIn pursuing the guns over butter program, Starmer recapitulates the sad theme of previous eras that led to global conflict. As Europe began rearming in the 1930s, a prevalent argument was that people could have guns and butter. Greater inventories of weaponry would encourage greater prosperity. So, we find Starmer urging the forging of deeper ties between government and industry and \u201ca radical reform of procurement\u201d, one that could only be economically beneficial. This would be the \u201cdefence dividend\u201d, another nonsense term the military industrial complex churns out with such disconcerting ease.\n\nThe foreword from the Defence Secretary, John Healey, outlines the objectives of the SDR. These include playing a leading role in NATO \u201cwith strengthened nuclear, new tech, and updated conventional capabilities\u201d; moving the country to a state of \u201cwarfighting readiness\u201d; nourishing the insatiable military industrial Moloch; learning the lessons of Ukraine (\u201charnessing drones, data and digital warfare\u201d); and adopting a \u201cwhole-of-society approach\u201d, a sly if clumsy way of enlisting the civilian populace into the military enterprise.\n\nThe review makes 62 recommendations, all accepted by the grateful government. Some \u00a315 billion will go to the warhead programme, supporting 9,000 jobs, while \u00a36 billion will be spent on munitions over the course of the current Parliament. A \u201cNew Hybrid Navy\u201d is envisaged, one that will feature Dreadnought and the yet to be realised SSN-AUKUS submarines, alongside \u201csupport ships\u201d and \u201cautonomous vessels to patrol the North Atlantic and beyond.\u201d Submarine production is given the most optimistic assessment: one completion every 18 months.\n\nThe Royal Air Force is not to miss out, with more F-35s, modernised Typhoons, and the next generation of jets acquired through the Global Combat Air Programme. To his splurge will be added autonomous fighters, enabling global reach.\n\nMindless assessments are abundant in the Review. The government promises a British army 10 times \u201cmore lethal to deter from the land, by combining more people and armoured capability with air defence, communications, AI, software, long-range weapons, and land drone swarms.\u201d Some 7,000 new long-range weapons will be built and a New CyberEM Command established \u201cto defend Britain from daily attacks in the grey zone.\u201d Keeping those merchants of death happy will be a new Defence Exports Office located in the Ministry of Defence, one intended \u201cto drive exports to our allies and growth at home.\u201d\n\nThe fanfare of the report, festooned with fripperies for war, conceals the critical problems facing the British armed forces. The ranks are looking increasingly thinned. (In 2010, regular troop numbers stood at 110,000; the current target of 73,000 soldiers is being barely met.) Morale is ebbing. The state of equipment is embarrassingly poor. The UK\u2019s celebrated submarine deterrent is somewhat less formidable in the deterrence department, with its personnel exhausted and subject to unpardonably lengthy stints at sea. The 204-day patrol by HMS Vanguard is a case in point.\n\nWhether the SDR\u2019s recommendations ever fructify remains the hovering question. It\u2019s all very good to make promises about weapons programmes and boosting a country\u2019s readiness to kill, but militaries can be tardy in delivery and faulty in execution. What saves the day may well be standard ineptitude rather than any firebrand conviction in war. To the unready go the spoils.",

        "paragraph_summary": "The article critiques the UK government's focus on military expansion under Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, suggesting it serves as a distraction from domestic unpopularity. Despite a strong parliamentary majority, Starmer's Labour Party faces declining support, prompting a pivot towards military readiness against perceived threats, notably Russia. The UK Strategic Defence Review, led by Lord George Robertson, advocates significant military investments, including a \u00a315 billion warhead program and a \"New Hybrid Navy.\" The review's 62 recommendations, all accepted by the government, emphasize enhanced NATO roles, technological advancements, and a \"whole-of-society\" military approach. However, the article highlights critical issues within the armed forces, such as dwindling troop numbers, low morale, and outdated equipment, questioning the feasibility of these ambitious military plans. Ultimately, the piece suggests that the government's focus on militarization may mask deeper systemic problems and inefficiencies within the defense sector.",

        "text": "Recipe author Nagi Maehashi, unmoved by her own numbing banality, is peeved. Her target: Penguin books and author Brooke Bellamy. Her accusation: the apparent copying of recipes for caramel slice and baklava from Maehashi\u2019s RecipeTin Eats website, released in Bellamy\u2019s Bake with Brooki, published in October last year. \u201cProfiting from plagiarised recipes is unethical,\u201d she huffed, \u201ceven if it is not copyright infringement \u2013 and undermines the integrity of the entire book.\u201d Rather indulgently, Maehashi goes on to decry this as a \u201cslap in the face to every author who puts in the hard work to create original content rather than cutting corners.\u201d The question left begging is whether this is ever possible for a cookbook.\n\nBellamy, who has the combined weight of 3 million followers on TikTok and Instagram, has flatly denied the accusation. \u201cI did not plagiarise any recipes in my book which consists of 100 recipes I have created over many years,\u201d she claims on Instagram. \u201cIn 2016, I opened my first bakery. I have been creating my recipes and selling them commercially since October 2016.\u201d The social media figure is candid in admitting that she did not invent any of the recipes listed in her book dealing with cookies, cupcakes, brownies or cakes.\n\nOn the issue of the caramel slice, Bellamy merely observes that the RecipeTin Eats recipe, published in March 2020, \u201cuses the same ingredients as my recipe, which I have been making and selling since four years prior.\u201d Evidently not a pugilist, Bellamy has even offered to remove the caramel slice and baklava recipes from any future reprints of her book, a point \u201ccommunicated to Nagi swiftly through discussions\u201d.\n\nAnother author from cookbook land, Adam Liaw, abandons his kitchen implements briefly to explain the finer points of intellectual property in light of this dispute. As an intellectual property lawyer in his previous non-cooking life, he suggests that the copyright \u201cdoesn\u2019t protect the recipe itself. It protects the publication of the exact same written form of that recipe. None of the recipes written in the world would reach the standards necessary to obtain patent protection.\u201d\n\nA closer look at the claim is one of plagiarism. This is an interesting point, given the multitude of borrowings, replications and, along the way, adjustments, that come along with the use of recipes. Professor John Swinson from the University of Queensland adds insult to injury to Maehashi\u2019s case by simply stating that the steps involved in making the recipe were \u201cnot very expressive\u201d. When looking at a comparison between the two recipes in question, one is left with a similar impression. \u201cYou can\u2019t protect a cake or cookie,\u201d Swinson clarifies. \u201cYou can only protect how it\\s expressed, not the end result, and most recipes are just factual instructions\u201d.\n\nA sticking point here is the issue of attribution. Under the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), there are various described moral rights, as distinct from economic rights. These include the right of attribution (that the author be identified and named as the author of that work); the right against false attribution (the right of the author to prevent someone else from being credited as the author of their work; and the right of integrity (the right of an author to ensure that the work is not subjected to derogatory treatment harmful to the author\u2019s honour or reputation).\n\nHistorically speaking, the publication of recipes drawn from the vast archive of cookery is more than standard. We find Isabella Beeton in October 1861, a co-editor of the Englishwoman\u2019s Domestic Magazine pillaging at will any number of recipes for The Book of Household Management. As food boffin and author Helana Brigman points out, this book of revelation for Victorian readers, one that allayed fears about \u201chow much should a family of five spend on groceries\u201d, had nothing that was her own. In writing her book, Beeton made generous use of readers\u2019 submissions.\n\nThe fact remains that, however murky one might assume the laws on copyright were on the subject, neither US nor British copyright laws (ditto Australia\u2019s equivalent) protect a listing of ingredients, even those found in formulas, compounds, or prescriptions. Broadly speaking, claiming some ownership over a dish is much like asserting control over the air and its vapours.\n\nAn iconoclastic Jonathan Meades takes the torch to such proprietary assertions in his The Plagiarist in the Kitchen: A Lifetime of Culinary Thefts. His work eschews \u201cculinary originality\u201d, being an \u201canti-cookbook\u201d favouring \u201cthe daylight robbery of recipes, to hijacking techniques and methods, to the notion that in the kitchen there is nothing new and nor can there be anything new.\u201d\n\nMeades rightly notes that the pathology of originality arises from the emergence of the cult chef, the God creator in the kitchen. In an interview, he notes how it began \u201cin upscale restaurants in Spain and then in Britain with Heston Blumenthal.\u201d\n\nThe entire grievance on Maehashi\u2019s part has given Bellamy even more oxygen for her enterprise, with the latter preferring to repair back to the bakery. Two new stores are set to open in Queensland in July. An international pop-up store in the United Arab Emirates is planned to open by the end of the year, adding to existing ones in the Middle East. If Bellamy was ever a thief in the kitchen, the enterprise is doing quite nicely.",

Bellamy, who has a significant social media following, denies the allegations, asserting that her book contains 100 original recipes she developed over years of running her bakery. She acknowledges not inventing the recipes for cookies, cupcakes, brownies, or cakes in her book but offers to remove the disputed recipes from future editions. Intellectual property experts, including Adam Liaw and Professor John Swinson, explain that copyright does not protect recipes themselves, only their specific written expression, and that most recipes are factual instructions not eligible for protection. The debate highlights the complexities of intellectual property in the culinary world, where originality is often questioned. Despite the controversy, Bellamy's business continues to thrive, with plans for new store openings in Queensland and the United Arab Emirates.",

        "text": "As the world was readying for the Second World War, the insightful humane Austrian author Stefan Zweig made the following glum observation: \u201cOpenly and flagrantly, certain countries express their will to expand and make preparations for war. The politics of rearmament is pursued in broad daylight and at breakneck speed; every day you read in the papers arguments in favour of armaments expansion, the idea that it reduces unemployment and provides a boost to the stock exchange.\u201d\n\nThis is not so different from the approval by European Union countries on May 27 of a \u20ac150 billion loan program known as the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) borrowing scheme. A press release from the European Council stated that the scheme \u201cwill finance urgent and large-scale investments in the European defence technological and industrial base (EDTIB)\u201d with the intention of boosting \u201cproduction capacity, making sure defence equipment is available when needed, and to address existing capability gaps \u2013 ultimately strengthening the EU\u2019s overall defence readiness.\u201d\n\nThe statement also makes a central rationale clear: that SAFE will enable continued European support for Ukraine, linking its defence industry to the program. Despite not being an EU member, Kyiv will be able to participate in the scheme. Interestingly enough, the United Kingdom, despite leaving the EU, will also be able to participate via a separate agreement.\n\nDisbursements to interested member states upon demand, considered along national plans \u201cwill take the form of competitively priced long-maturity loans, to be repaid by the beneficiary member states.\u201d\n\nThe scheme further anticipates the types of weaponry, euphemistically titled \u201cdefence products\u201d, that will feature. As outlined by the European Council on March 6, these will comprise two categories: the first covering, amongst others, such products as ammunition and missiles, artillery systems, ground combat capabilities with support systems; the second, air and missile defence systems, maritime surface and underwater capabilities, drones and anti-drone systems and \u201cstrategic enablers\u201d including air-to-air refuelling, artificial intelligence and electronic warfare.\n\nThe broader militarisation agenda is confirmed by linking SAFE with broader transatlantic engagement and \u201ccomplementarity with NATO.\u201d It will \u201cstrive to enhance interoperability, continue industrial cooperation, and ensure reciprocal access to state-of-the-art technologies with trusted partners.\u201d Significantly, the emphasis is on collaboration: a minimum of three countries must combine when requesting funding for SAFE defence projects.\n\nThere seems to be something for everyone: the militarist, the war monger and the merchants of death. Global Finance, a publication dedicated to informing \u201ccorporate financial professionals\u201d, was already praising the SAFE proposal in April. \u201cThe initiative has the potential to transform the business models of many top European defense groups \u2013 like Saab, which has traditionally relied on contracts from the Swedish state to grow its sales.\u201d What a delight it will be for such defence companies to move beyond the constraints on sales imposed by their limiting governments. A veritable European market of death machinery is in the offing.\n\nThe fund is intended for one, unambiguous purpose: war. The weasel word \u201cdefence\u201d is merely the code, the cipher. Break it, and it spells out aggression and conflict, a hankering for the next great military confrontation. The reason is traditional, historic and irrational: the Oriental despotic eminence arising from the Asian steppes, people supposedly untutored in the niceties of European good manners and democracy. Not that European manners and democracy is in splendid health. A mere glance at some of the candidates suggests decline in institutional credibility and scepticism. But we can always blame the Russians for that, deviously sowing doubt with their disinformation schemes.\n\nThe initiative, and its tightening of ties with arming Ukraine, has made such critics as Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n sound modestly sensible. \u201cWe need to invest in our own armies, but they expect us to fund Ukraine\u2019s \u2013 with billions, for years to come,\u201d he declared in a post on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear: Hungary will not pay. Our duty is to protect our own people.\u201d\n\nThe approval of the fund by the European Commission has also angered some members of the European Parliament, an institution which has been treated with near contempt by the European Commission. European Parliament Presidente Roberta Metsola warned Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier in May to reconsider the use of Article 122 of the EU Treaty, which should be used sparingly in emergencies in speeding up approvals with minimal parliamentary scrutiny. Bypassing Europe\u2019s invigilating lawmakers risked \u201cundermining democratic legitimacy by weakening Parliament\u2019s legislative and scrutiny functions\u201d. The Council\u2019s resort to Article 122 potentially enlivened a process that could see a legal case taken to the European Court of Justice.\n\nThe European Parliament\u2019s Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) has also supported a legal opinion repudiating the Commission\u2019s cavalier approach in approving the fund. According to that tartly reasoned view, Article 122 was an inappropriate justification, as the threshold for evoking emergency powers had simply not been met.\n\nIronically, the rearmament surge is taking place on both sides of the Atlantic, at both the behest of the Trump administration, ever aggrieved by Europe not pulling its military weight, and Moscow, characterised and caricatured as a potential invader, the catalyst for decorating a continent with bristling weaponry. The former continues to play hide and seek with Brussels while still being very much in Europe, be it in terms of permanent garrisons and military assets; the latter remains a convenient excuse to cross the palms of the military industrial establishment with silver. How Zweig would have hated it.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "The European Union's approval of the \u20ac150 billion Security Action for Europe (SAFE) loan program, aimed at bolstering defense capabilities and supporting Ukraine, has sparked criticism for its militaristic focus, potential undermining of democratic processes, and parallels to pre-World War II rearmament, while also highlighting tensions within the EU and with external partners like the UK.",

Critics argue that the scheme, which allows non-EU members like Ukraine and the UK to participate, is a thinly veiled push towards militarization, benefiting defense companies and potentially leading to increased aggression and conflict. The approval process, criticized for bypassing the European Parliament's scrutiny, has sparked legal and political challenges, with some EU members like Hungary opposing the financial burden of supporting Ukraine's defense. The article suggests that this rearmament trend reflects historical anxieties and geopolitical tensions, reminiscent of Zweig's era, and raises concerns about democratic legitimacy and the motivations behind such military investments.",

        "text": "On April 22, militants from The Resistance Front (TRF), a group accused by Indian authorities of being linked to the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group, slaughtered 26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam in the Indian administered portion of Kashmir. This came as a rude shock to the Indian military establishment, who decided that rebellious sentiments in the region had declined. (In March 2025, an assessment concluded that a mere 77 active militants were busying themselves on India\u2019s side of the border.)\n\nThe feeling of cooling tensions induced an air of complacency. Groups such as the TRF, along with a fruit salad of insurgent outfits \u2013 the Kashmir Tigers, the People\u2019s Anti-Fascist Front, and the United Liberation Front of Kashmir \u2013 were all spawned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s August 2019 revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted Kashmir singular autonomy. TRF has been particularly, and violently opposed, to the resettlement of the Kashmiri pandits, which they see as an effort to alter the region\u2019s demography.\n\nThe murderous incident raised the obvious question: Would Modi pay lip service to the 1972 Shimla Agreement, one that divided Kashmir into two zones of administration separated by a Line of Control? (A vital feature to that agreement is an understanding that both powers resolve their disputes without the need for third parties.)\n\nThe answers came promptly enough. First came India\u2019s suspension of the vital Indus Water Treaty, an essential agreement dealing with the distribution of water from India to Pakistan. Pakistan reciprocated firmly by suspending the Shimla Agreement, expelling Indian military diplomats, halting visa exemptions for Indian citizens and closing the Wagah border for trade.\n\nHindu nationalism proved particularly stirred, and Modi duly fed its cravings. On May 7, India commenced Operation Sindoor, involving what were purportedly precision missile attacks on nine militant camps in Pakistan and the Jammu and Kashmir area controlled by Islamabad. The operation itself had a scent of gendered manipulation, named after the vermillion used by married Hindu women to symbolise the durable existence of their husbands. Two female military officers \u2013 Colonel Sofiya Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh \u2013 were tasked with managing the media pack.\n\nThe Indian briefings celebrated the accuracy of the strikes on what were said to be the sites of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen. 31 suspected terrorists were said to have perished, though Pakistan insisted that civilians had been killed in this apparent feast of forensic precision. India\u2019s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh would have none of it: Indian forces had only \u201cstruck only those who harmed our innocents\u201d.\n\nThe next day, it was operations against Pakistan\u2019s air defence systems in Lahore that stole the show. The inevitable Pakistani retaliation followed on May 10, with the Indian return serve against 11 Pakistan air bases. What followed is one version: Pakistan\u2019s military broke into a sweat. A cessation of hostilities was sought and achieved. Armchair pundits on the Indian side celebrated: India had successfully targeted the terrorist cells supported by Pakistan. If one is to read Anubhav Shankar Goswami seriously, Operation Sindoor was a stroke of genius, threatening \u201cthe Pakistan Army\u2019s strategic shield against terrorists\u201d.\n\nMore accurately, this was a lovely little spilling of blood with weaponry between callow sibling throats, a pattern familiar since 1947. The two countries have fought four full blown conflicts, two over Kashmir. Along the way, they have made the world a lot safer by acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nThere was something for everyone in this retaliatory and counter retaliatory feast. India claimed strategic proficiency, keeping censorship on the matter tight. Pakistan could claim some prowess in shooting down five Indian jets, using Chinese weaponry including the J-10. With pride and pomp, they could even appoint Pakistani Army chief Asim Munir to the post of Field Marshal, an absurdly ceremonial gesture that gave the impression that the army had restored its tattered pride. It was to be expected that this was ample reward for his, in the words of the government, \u201cstrategic leadership and decisive role\u201d in defeating India.\n\nThe only ones to be notably ignored in this display of subcontinental machismo were the Kashmiris themselves, who face, in both the Pakistan and Indian administered zones, oppressive anti-terrorism laws, discriminatory practices and suppression of dissent and free speech.\n\nUltimately, the bickering children were convinced to end their playground antics. The fact that the overbearing headmaster, the unlikely US President Donald Trump, eventually brought himself to bear on proceedings must have irritated them. After four days of conflict, the US role in defusing matters between the powers became evident. Kashmir, which India has long hoped to keep in museum-like storage, away from the international stage, had been enlivened. Trump even offered his services to enable New Delhi and Islamabad a chance to reach a more enduring peace. Praise for the president followed, notably from those wishing to see the Kashmir conflict resolved.\n\nIn one sense, there seems little reason to worry. These are countries seemingly linked to sandpit grievances, scrapping, gouging and complaining about their lot. Even amidst juvenile spats, they can bicker yet still sign enduring ceasefires. In February 2021, for instance, the militaries of both countries cobbled together a ceasefire which ended four months of cross-border skirmishes. A mere two violations of the agreement (how proud they must have been) was recorded for the rest of the year. In 2022, a solitary incident of violation was noted.\n\nA needlessly florid emphasis was made on the conflict by Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Meta. This was an encounter lacking \u201cdecisive victory and no clear political end\u201d. It merely reinstated \u201cthe India-Pakistan hyphenation\u201d. In one sense, this element of hyphenation \u2013 the international perception of two subcontinental powers in an eternal, immature squabble \u2013 was something India seemed to be marching away from. But Prime Minister Modi, despite his grander visions for India, is a sectarian fanatic. History shows that fanaticism tends to shrink, rather than enlarge the mind. In that sense, he is in good company with those other uniformed fanatics in uniform.",

        "text": "Shocking it might be, yet still part of an old pattern. The US Department of Homeland Security is floating the idea of using a reality television program to select immigrants vying for US citizenship. Whether this involves gladiatorial combat or inane pillow battles remains to be seen, though it is bound to involve airhead celebrity hosts and a set of fabricated challenges. What matters is the premise: the reduction of a government agency\u2019s functions to a debauched spectacle of deceit, desperation and televisual pornography. Much, in some ways, like the Trump administration itself.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, television producer Rob Worsoff, the man behind the Duck Dynasty reality show, comes clean in his monstrous intentions behind this proposed series he hopes to call The American: he has been pursuing this seedy project since the days of the Obama administration, hoping for some amoral stakeholder to bite. Worsoff, in true fashion, denies that such a project is intended as malicious (\u201cthis isn\u2019t the \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 for immigrants\u201d), let alone denigrating the dignity of human worth. In the grand idea of full bloom, optimistic America, it is intended as hopeful, but most of all, competitive. Forget equal protection and a fair evaluation of merits; here is a chance for Social Darwinism to excel.\n\nWorsoff insists he is free of political ideology. \u201cAs an immigrant myself, I am merely trying to make a show that celebrates the immigration process, celebrate what it means to be American and have a national conversation about what it means to be American, through the eyes of people who want it most\u201d. He proposes to do this by, for instance, sending immigrants to San Francisco where they find themselves in a mine to retrieve gold. Another would see the contestants journey to Detroit, where they will be placed on an auto assembly to reassemble a Model-T Ford chassis.\n\nThe winners would end up on the Capitol steps, presumably to receive their citizenship in some staged ceremony for television. The losing contestants would go home with such generous prizes as a Starbucks gift card or airline points.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has apparently spoken to Worsoff on this steaming drivel, with the producer describing the response as \u201cpositive\u201d. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, it is said, has not officially \u201c\u2018backed\u2019 or even reviewed the pitch of any scripted or reality show. The Department of Homeland Security receives hundreds of television show pitches a year.\u201d The mind can only dissipate in despair at such an observation, unsurprising in a land where the television, or televisual platforms, remain brain numbing instructors.\n\nThat the DHS is considering this is unremarkable. The department has already participated in television projects and networks, To Catch a Smuggler being a case in point. Noem has also made much of the camera when it comes to dealing with immigrants. An ad campaign costing US$200 million promises to feature her admonishing illegal immigrants to return to their countries. No doubt the hairdressing and makeup department will be busy when tarting her up for the noble task.\n\nBroadcasters in a number of countries have also found the unsuspecting migrant or foreign guest captured by television irresistible viewing. It\u2019s not just good, couch potato fun, but also a chance to fan prejudice and feed sketchy stereotypes. The reality TV show Border Security, which first aired on Australia\u2019s free-to-air Channel 7 in 2004, proved to be a pioneering model in this regard. Not only did it provide a chance to mock the eating habits of new arrivals as food stuffs were confiscated by customs officers with names like \u201cBarbs\u201d, the program could also impute an intention to attack the Australian agricultural sector with introduced pests and diseases. These depictions went hand in hand with the demonising strategy of the Australian government towards unwanted asylum seekers and refugees (\u201cStop the Boats!\u201d was the cry), characterised by lengthy spells of detention in an offshore tropical gulag.\n\nThe plight of the vulnerable immigrant has also become a matter of pantomime substitution, an idea supposedly educative in function. Why not act out the entire migrant experience with reality television individuals with particularly xenophobic views?\n\nIn February, this is exactly what took place in a reality television show vulgarly titled Go Back to Where You Come From aired on the UK\u2019s Channel 4, running four episodes where selected, largely anti-immigration participants, according to Channel 4, \u201cexperience some of the most perilous parts of the refugee journeys\u201d. It comes as little surprise that the series is modelled on an Australian precursor made in the early 2010s.\n\nEven pro-immigrant groups were reduced to a state of admiring stupor, with the Refugee Council, a British charity, praising the worth of such shows to \u201chave huge potential to highlight the stories behind the headlines\u201d. Gareth Benest, advocacy director at the International Broadcasting Trust charity, also thought it instructive that the participants \u201cface the reality of irregular migration and to challenge their preconceptions.\u201d\n\nFrench politician Xavier Bertrand failed to identify similar points, calling the program \u201cnauseating\u201d. In his attack on the experiment, he saw the deaths across the English Channel as \u201ca humanitarian tragedy, not the subject of a game\u201d. But a game it has become, at least when placed before the camera.",

The show, tentatively titled \"The American,\" aims to celebrate the immigration process and spark a national conversation about American identity, though it has been criticized for reducing a serious governmental function to a spectacle. Worsoff, who claims no political agenda, envisions challenges like mining for gold in San Francisco or assembling a Model-T Ford in Detroit, with winners receiving citizenship and losers getting consolation prizes like gift cards. While DHS has not officially endorsed the project, it has shown interest, reflecting a broader trend of using reality TV to address immigration issues, as seen in other countries. Such shows have been both praised for highlighting immigrant stories and criticized for trivializing serious humanitarian issues.",

        "text": "Contrary to the propaganda of moral upstarts, terrorism pays. It proves rewarding. It establishes states and reconstitutes others. It encourages change, for ill or otherwise. The stance taken, righteously pitiful, on not negotiating with those who practise it, is as faulty as battling gravity. The case of Syria\u2019s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is a brilliant example of this. While seen as a new broom that did away with the government of President Bashar al-Assad in such stunning fashion, al-Sharaa\u2019s bristles remain blood speckled.\n\nThe scene says it all: a meeting lasting 37 minutes in Riyadh with a US President holding hands in communal machismo with a bearded Jihadi warrior who once had a $10 million bounty on his head. Present was the delighted Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joining by telephone.\n\nIt proved most rewarding for al-Sharaa, who has become a salesman for the new Syria, scrubbing up for appearances. His main message: remove crushing sanctions barring access to investment and finance. It also proved rewarding for the efforts made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in convincing the Trump administration that a new approach towards Damascus was warranted. \u201cThe sanctions,\u201d reflected Trump, \u201cwere brutal and crippling and served as an important, really, an important function nevertheless at the time, but now it\u2019s their time to shine.\u201d But lifting sanctions would offer Syria \u201ca chance at greatness\u201d. This signalled a striking volte face from the stance taken in December 2024, when Trump expressed the view that Syria was \u201ca mess\u201d, not a friend of the United States and not deserving of any intervention from Washington.\n\nIn remarks made by Trump to journalists keeping him company, the US President expressed admiration for the strongman, the brute, the resilient survivor. \u201cTough guy, very strong past.\u201d And what a past, one marked by links to al-Qaeda via the affiliate Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that were only severed in 2017. HTS\u2019s predecessor, Jabhat al-Nusra, was commanded by al-Sharaa, then known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. In January 2017, HTS was born as a collective of Salafi jihadists comprising Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zinki, Liwa al-Haq, Jaysh al-Sunna and Jabhat Ansar al-Din.\n\nEven at present, a shadow lingers over al-Sharaa\u2019s interim government. In March, over 100 people were butchered in the coastal city of Banias. These atrocities were directed against the Alawite minority and instigated by militias affiliated with the new regime, ostensibly as part of a response to attacks in Latakia and Tartous from armed groups affiliated with the deposed Assad regime. According to Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Agn\u00e8s Callamard, \u201cthe authorities failed to intervene to stop the killings. Once again, Syrian civilians have found themselves bearing the heaviest cost as parties to the conflict seek to settle scores.\u201d\n\nThe announcement by Trump on lifting US sanctions sent officials scurrying. While the plan to bring Syria out of the cold had been on the books for some months, the timing, as with all things with the US president, was fickle. Presidential waivers on sanctions do, after all, only go so far and the more technically minded will have to pour over the details of repeal.\n\nThe Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered a dose of clarification some 24 hours after the announcement. \u201cIf we make enough progress, we\u2019d like to see the law repealed, because you\u2019re going to struggle to find people to [invest] in a country when [at any point] in six months, sanctions could come back. We\u2019re not there yet. That\u2019s premature.\u201d\n\nProgress is in the works, with Rubio meeting his Syrian counterpart, Foreign Minister Asad Hassan al-Shaibani in Antalya on May 15. In comments from State Department spokesman, Tammy Bruce, the Secretary \u201cwelcomed the Syrian government\u2019s calls for peace with Israel, efforts to end Iran\u2019s influence in Syria, commitment to ascertaining the fate of US citizens missing or killed in Syria, and elimination of all chemical weapons.\u201d\n\nIn answers to a press gathering, Rubio revealed how much of a success al-Sharaa has been in wooing Washington. \u201cWe have governing authorities there now who have expressed, not openly and repeatedly, that they do \u2013 that this is a nationalistic movement designed to building their country in a pluralistic society in which all the different elements of Syrian society are able to live together.\u201d There had also been an interest in normalising ties with Israel and \u201cdriving out foreign fighters and terrorists and others that would destabilize the country and are enemies of this transitional authority.\u201d\n\nWhile no mention is made of al-Sharaa\u2019s own colourful, bloodied past, the previous ruler, Assad, comes in for scathing mention. His rule was \u201cbrutal\u201d, one characterised by gassing and murdering \u201chis own people\u201d. It was Assad who sowed the seeds that would allow foreign fighters to take root in Syria\u2019s soil. How curious that HTS would have attracted those very same fighters.\n\nThings have come full circle. The Assad dynasts, who kept a watchful eye on fundamentalist Islamists, are gone. The Islamists, with their various backers, Turkey and Saudi Arabia being most prominent, are now nominally in charge. The rest is a confidence trick that might, given al-Sharaa\u2019s recent performance, just work.",

The article highlights the complex geopolitical dynamics involving key players like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and the ongoing challenges faced by Syria, including sectarian violence and the influence of foreign fighters. Despite al-Sharaa's controversial history, his efforts to present a more inclusive and stable Syria have gained some traction internationally, though skepticism remains about the long-term viability and sincerity of these changes.",

        "text": "They seemed made for each other. A former reality television star, with dubious real estate credentials, a freakish alienation from the truth, and the various leaders of the Gulf States, who never found truthful assessments that worthwhile anyway. This was certainly no time to be frugal and modest. Many a country might be dealing with soaring prices, inaccessible housing markets, and the cost of eggs, but nothing would be spared in spoiling US President Donald Trump with overpriced kitsch and exotica. Here was the MAGA brand in full flower.\n\nWith crude indulgence, Saudi Arabia\u2019s putative leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, pampered and spoiled the US president with hospitality and a spray of undertakings and agreements during the first part of his Arabian Gulf tour. Six US-made F-15 fighters piloted by the Saudis escorted Air Force One as it approached Riyadh on May 13. There was the coffee ceremony within the royal terminal in the airport, a limousine flanked by white Arabian horses, and a decorative honour guard equipped with golden swords.\n\nThis was a time for luxury and boundless bad taste, not bleeding hearts and bleating consciences. Memories of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, murdered in October 2018 on orders by the crown prince, could be silenced if not expunged altogether. As for climate change, what of it? On golden chairs in the royal place, the Crown Prince and US President could bask in each other\u2019s triumphal, emetic glow. Trump exclaimed that \u201cwe like each other a lot\u201d. In a speech, he also uttered words of music to the royal: no foreign leader should be \u201cgiving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs.\u201d\n\nAn extravagant luncheon that followed featured a veritable Who\u2019s Who of American corporatocracy, among them Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Jane Fraser of Citicorp, Ruth Porat of Google, and Alex Karp of Palantir.\n\nThe value of the agreements reached between Riyadh and Washington approximate to US$600 billion, if one is to trust the anomalous \u201cfact sheets\u201d released by the White House. The nature of these commitments was not exactly clear, though they promise to cover energy security, defence, technology and access to critical minerals. Terms with little clarity (\u201cglobal infrastructure\u201d, for instance) were thrown around. Naturally, Trump will not be outdone in any deal, insisting that this was all part of the America First Trade and Investment Policy that is placing \u201cthe American economy, the American worker, and our national security first.\u201d\n\nA few examples were mentioned, though these figure as ongoing commitments: the plans of Saudi Arabia\u2019s DataVolt to invest US$20 billion in US data centres and energy infrastructure; the promise by Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD and Uber to invest US$80 billion in \u201ccutting-edge transformative technologies in both countries.\u201d The inevitable defence sales agreement was also praised, one hailed as the largest in history. Worth almost US$142 billion, it will involve over a dozen US defence firms supplying the Kingdom with equipment and technology in air force and space capabilities, air and missile defence, maritime and coastal security, border security and land forces and improved information and communication systems.\n\nThis was merely the start of the Trump Splash Show. Onward to Qatar, where another ceremonial escort of F-15 fighter planes greeted the president. Clearly, the ruling Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was not going to be outdone by his Saudi counterparts. For a change, however, the president\u2019s motorcade travelling from Doha airport to Amiri Diwan was greeted by a cavalry of mounted camels. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen camels like that in a long time,\u201d fluted the impressed leader. \u201cAnd really, we appreciate it very much.\u201d But showing that imperishable tradition can exist alongside technological progress, red Tesla Cybertrucks also featured in the motorcade. This was a sweet gesture, given that Elon Musk\u2019s company has an inventory of unsold Cybertrucks worth US$800 billion languishing in dealerships.\n\nWith the welcome indulgence concluded, the serious discussions began. These were primarily focused on aviation, defence and energy priorities. Of note was a contract with Doha for 210 Boeing-made 787 Dreamliners and 777x aircraft worth US$96 billion. The US plane maker has been struggling of late, bedevilled by mishaps and questions about the quality of its manufacture. But glossy salvations are possible in the garden of MAGA make believe. \u201cCongratulations to Boeing,\u201d cooed Trump. \u201cGet those planes out there.\u201d\n\nThe contract was part of a number of economic commitments from Qatar initially claimed by the White House to be worth a staggering US$1.2 trillion. As mathematics is not the strong suit of the Trump administration, the same announcement also qualifies the over trillion dollar boast by announcing \u201ceconomic deals totalling more than $243.5 billion between the United States and Qatar, including an historic sale of Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines to Qatar Airways.\u201d Also included is an almost US$2 billion agreement allowing Qatar to acquire the MQ-9B remotely piloted aircraft system from General Atomics, and a US$1 billion agreement for Doha\u2019s purchase of Raytheon\u2019s small unmanned aircraft integrated defeat system.\n\nIn a shameless effort to outdo Riyadh, the Qatari royal family threw in a luxury 747 plane worth $400 million for the US Department of Defense, intended for Trump\u2019s use as a temporary substitute Air Force One. Reported as being a \u201cpalace in the sky\u201d, the president sees it as a gift of infinite, irrefutable generosity. \u201cIt\u2019s a great gesture from Qatar,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cI appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of offer.\u201d\n\nAs with his keenness to avoid anything that might ruffle feathers, or disturb restful camels, this was not a trip for presidential agitation. He was far away from irritating European allies. Here was Qatar, previously accused by Trump of being a sponsor of terrorism, rehabilitated in golden glory. Forget the security implications and brazen corruption inherent in such a move: all the parties concerned could gloat without consequential censure.",

        "text": "The agreement between Washington and Kyiv to create an investment fund to search for rare earth minerals has been seen as something of a turn by the Trump administration. From hectoring and mocking the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before the cameras on his visit to the US capital two months ago, President Donald Trump had apparently softened. It was easy to forget that the minerals deal was already on the negotiating table and would have been reached but for Zelensky\u2019s fateful and ill-tempered ambush. Dreams of accessing Ukrainian reserves of such elements as graphite, titanium and lithium were never going to dissipate.\n\nDetails remain somewhat sketchy, but the agreement supposedly sets out a sharing of revenues in a manner satisfactory to the parties while floating, if only tentatively, the prospect of renewed military assistance. That assistance, however, would count as US investment in the fund. According to the White House, the US Treasury Department and US International Development Finance Corporation will work with Kyiv \u201cto finalize governance and advance this important partnership\u201d, one that ensures the US \u201can economic stake in securing a free, peaceful, and sovereign future for Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn its current form, the agreement supposedly leaves it to Ukraine to determine what to extract in terms of the minerals and where this extraction is to take place. A statement from the US Treasury Department also declared that, \u201cNo state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s Minister of Economy, Yulia Svyrydenko, stated that the subsoil remained within the domain of Kyiv\u2019s ownership, while the fund would be \u201cstructured\u201d on an equal basis \u201cjointly managed by Ukraine and the United States\u201d and financed by \u201cnew licenses in the field of critical materials, oil and gas \u2013 generated after the Fund is created\u201d. Neither party would \u201chold a dominant vote \u2013 a reflection of equal partnership between our two nations.\u201d\n\nThe minister also revealed that privatisation processes and managing state-owned companies would not be altered by the arrangements. \u201cCompanies such as Ukrnafta and Energoatom will stay in state ownership.\u201d There would also be no question of debt obligations owed by Kyiv to Washington.\n\nThat this remains a \u201cjoint\u201d venture is always bound to raise some suspicions, and nothing can conceal the predatory nature of an arrangement that permits US corporations and firms access to the critical resources of another country. For his part, Trump fantasised in a phone call to a town hall on the NewsNation network that the latest venture would yield \u201cmuch more in theory than the $350 billion\u201d worth of aid he insists the Biden administration furnished Kyiv with.\n\nSvyrydenko chose to see the Reconstruction Investment Fund as one that would \u201cattract global investment into our country\u201d while still maintaining Ukrainian autonomy. Representative Gregory Meeks, the ranking Democrat on the House of Foreign Affairs Committee, thought otherwise, calling it \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s extortion of Ukraine deal\u201d. Instead of focusing on the large, rather belligerent fly in the ointment \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 the US president had \u201cdemonstrated nothing but weakness\u201d towards Moscow.\n\nThe war mongering wing of the Democrats were also in full throated voice. To make such arrangements in the absence of assured military support to Kyiv made the measure vacuous. \u201cRight now,\u201d Democratic Senator Chris Murphy saidon MSNBC television, \u201call indications are that Donald Trump\u2019s policy is to hand Ukraine to Vladimir Putin, and in that case, this agreement isn\u2019t worth the paper that it\u2019s written on.\u201d\n\nOn a certain level, Murphy has a point. Trump\u2019s firmness in holding to the bargain is often capricious. In September 2017, he reached an agreement with the then Afghan president Ashraf Ghani to permit US companies to develop Afghanistan\u2019s rare earth minerals. Having spent 16 years in Afghanistan up to that point, ways of recouping some of the costs of Washington\u2019s involvement were being considered. It was agreed, went a White House statement sounding all too familiar, \u201cthat such initiatives would help American companies develop minerals critical to national security while growing Afghanistan\u2019s economy and creating new jobs in both countries, therefore defraying some of the costs of United States assistance as Afghans become more reliant.\u201d\n\nGhani\u2019s precarious puppet regime was ultimately sidelined in favour of direct negotiations with the Taliban that eventually culminated in their return to power, leaving the way open for US withdrawal and a termination of any grand plans for mineral extraction.\n\nA coterie of foreign policy analysts abounded with glowing statements at this supposedly impressive feat of Ukrainian diplomacy. Shelby Magid, deputy director of the Atlantic Council think tank\u2019s Eurasia Centre, thought it put Kyiv \u201cin their strongest position yet with Washington since Trump took office\u201d. Ukraine had withstood \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d to accept poorer proposals, showing \u201cthat it is not just a junior partner that has to roll over and accept a bad deal\u201d.\n\nTime and logistics remain significant obstacles to the realisation of the agreement. As Ukraine\u2019s former minister of economic development and current head of Kyiv school of economics Tymofiy Mylovanov told the BBC, \u201cThese resources aren\u2019t in a port or warehouse; they must be developed.\u201d Svyrydenko had to also ruefully concede that vast resources of mineral deposits existed in territory occupied by Russian forces. There are also issues with unexploded mines. Any challenge to the global rare earth elements (REEs) market, currently dominated by China (60% share of production of raw materials; 85% share of global processing output; and 90% manufacturing share of rare earth magnets), will be long in coming.",

While details remain vague, the agreement suggests a revenue-sharing model and hints at potential military assistance, which would be considered US investment in the fund. The arrangement allows Ukraine to control mineral extraction decisions, maintaining state ownership of key companies, and ensuring no Russian benefactors from the war can profit from Ukraine's reconstruction. Despite being framed as a joint venture, there are concerns about US corporations gaining access to Ukraine's resources, with critics like Representative Gregory Meeks labeling it as \"Donald Trump\u2019s extortion of Ukraine deal.\" The agreement faces logistical challenges, including the development of resources in Russian-occupied territories and competition with China's dominance in the global rare earth elements market. While some see the deal as a diplomatic success for Ukraine, others, including Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, criticize it for lacking assured military support, potentially undermining its value.",

        "text": "The occasion of electing another Pope was a spectacle in time and, in many ways, outside it. It was the one rare occasion in the twenty-first century where ancient ceremony, the old boy network \u2013 many presumptive virgins \u2013 along with festive dressing up, were seen with admiration rather than suspicion. Feminists were nowhere to be heard. Women knew their place; the phallocrats were in charge. Secret processes and factions, unscrutinised by media or any temporal body, could take place in secure, deliberative seclusion. Reverential followers of unquestioning loyalty turned up to the square of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome awaiting the news of the election. Then, the white smoke rises from the Sistine Chapel\u2019s chimney, with gasps of excitement and elation.\n\nTaking a punt on who the new leader of the Catholic Church will be once the conclave of Cardinals concludes is a failing bet. A mischievous remark was once made by an Australian commentator on Church matters that you would have better chances picking a winner at the Melbourne Cup horse race than the next pontiff.\n\nThe choice of Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, Prefect of the Dicastery of Bishops, was suitably surprising. Few had their cards on a pick from the United States, let alone a pick from Chicago, Illinois. But ever politic, the church narrative was quick to point out his naturalised status as a Peruvian and his elevation to the position of Bishop of Chiclayo in September 2015. He had been an Augustinian missionary. Not only was he a Western hemispheric representative, but one who doubled up as truly American, comprising North and South. This was an identitarian jackpot, a treat for the advertising wing of the Vatican.\n\nClues on what Leo\u2019s reign will look like are few in number. \u201cWe must seek together,\u201d he urges, \u201chow to be a missionary Church, a Church that builds bridges, dialogue, always open to receive like this square with its open arms, all, all who need our charity, our presence, dialogue and love.\u201d His choice of name suggests a lineage of diplomatic and doctrinal-minded figures.\n\nMuch Fourth Estate commentary has been vague, laden with cryptic references and snatches of speculation. In the absence of detail, obsession over minutiae becomes paramount. He turned up in the garb of Benedict XVI, suggested one observer on the BBC World Service, but spoke like his immediate predecessor, Pope Francis I. \u201cWe saw a balance of the aesthetics of the traditional church,\u201d opined Charlie Gillespie of Sacred Heart University, \u201calong with language that sounded like Pope Francis.\u201d\n\nAny use of the term \u201cmoderate\u201d is also bound to be meaningless, though Leo\u2019s brother, John Prevost, has aired his own prediction: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any extremes either way.\u201d Such a figure is straitjacketed by doctrine and buttoned up by process. One who is bound to follow ancient texts drafted by the superstitious, however modernised in interpretation, will be caged by them. In 2012, for instance, Prevost was revealing on that very issue when commenting on church attitudes to homosexuality. Certain Western values, he thought, proved sympathetic to views \u201cat odds with the gospel\u201d, one of them being the \u201chomosexual lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe same cannot be said about Leo\u2019s attitudes to migrants and the poor. A social media account bearing Prevost\u2019s name did not shy away from attacking the immigration policy of the Trump administration via a number of reposted articles. In February, for instance, an article from the National Catholic Reporter titled \u201cJD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn\u2019t ask us to rank our love for others\u201d featured. Suffice to say that his selection did not impress certain figures in the MAGA movement, most notably Steve Bannon. Calling Leo the \u201cworst pick for MAGA Catholics,\u201d Bannon sniffed a conspiracy. \u201cThis is an anti-Trump vote by the globalists that run the Curia \u2013 this is the pope Bergoglio [Francis I] and his clique wanted.\u201d\n\nThe orbit of other problems will also be impossible for the new pontiff to escape. The stain of clerical sex abuse remains an immovable reminder of organisational defect and depravity. Terrier like activists continue their sorties against the Church, demanding redress and publishing their findings on such outlets as ConclaveWatch.org. Earlier this year, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), along with Nates Mission, another survivors\u2019 organisation, named the then Cardinal Prevost as one of six figures seminal in covering up sexual abuse in the church. These formed a dossier of complaints submitted to Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state. According to the campaigners, the dossier documenting claims of mismanagement and cover-ups marked \u201cthe first time multiple high-ranking cardinals have been targeted \u2026 by co-ordinated, survivor-led action.\u201d\n\nAn open letter published on May 8 by SNAP also proved sharp on the election. \u201cThe sex offender in the collar commits two crimes: one against the body, and one against the voice. The grand pageantry around your election reminds us: survivors do not carry the same weight in this world as you do.\u201d The organisation further stated that Prevost, when provincial of the Augustinians, permitted Father James Ray, a priest accused of child abuse with restricted ministry since 1991, to reside at the Augustinians\u2019 St. John Stone Friary in 2000.

        "paragraph_summary": "The election of a new Pope, Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, was marked by traditional ceremony and secrecy, with little media scrutiny and a focus on ancient rituals. Prevost's selection, a surprise to many, was seen as a politically astute choice, reflecting his dual identity as both American and Peruvian. His papal vision emphasizes a missionary church open to dialogue and charity, though his past comments suggest a conservative stance on issues like homosexuality. His election has drawn criticism from some quarters, including MAGA supporters who view it as an anti-Trump move, and from survivors of clerical sex abuse, who accuse him of past cover-ups. Despite his moderate image, Leo XIV faces significant challenges, including addressing the church's history of sexual abuse and navigating complex global issues.",

        "text": "Killing civilians wholesale, starving them to convince those unaffected to change course, and shepherding whole populations like livestock into conditions of further misery would all qualify as heinous crimes in international law. When it comes to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, this approach is seen as necessary politics, unalloyed by the restraints of humanitarianism. When confronted with these harsh realities on the ground, unequivocal denials follow: This is not happening in Gaza; no one is starving. And if that were the case, blame those misguided savages in Hamas.\n\nAs the conflict chugs along in pools of blood and bountiful gore, the confused shape of Israel\u2019s intentions continues in all its glorious nebulousness. Pretend moderation clouds murderous desire. There is no sense that those unfortunate Israeli hostages captured by Hamas in its assault on October 7, 2023 matter anymore, being merely decorative for the imminent slaughter. There is even less sense that Hamas will be cleansed and removed from the strip, however attractive this idea continues to be.\n\nSuch evident limits have not discouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet, who have decided that more force, that old province of the unimaginative, is the answer. According to the PM, the cabinet had agreed on a \u201cforceful operation\u201d to eliminate Hamas and salvage what is left of the hostage situation.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, Brigadier-General Effie Defrin, has explained on Israeli radio that the offensive will apparently ensure the return of the hostages. What follows will be \u201cthe collapse of the Hamas regime, its defeat, its submission\u201d. Anywhere up to two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza will be herded into the ruins of the south. Humanitarian aid will be arranged by the Israeli forces, to be possibly distributed through approved contractors.\n\nThe IDF chief of staff, Lt. General Eyal Zamier, confirmed that the approved plan will involve \u201cthe capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas and the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas.\u201d\n\nWithin the Israeli cabinet, ethnocentric and religious fires burn with bright fanaticism. The Israeli Finance Finister Bezalel Smotrich remains a figure who ignores floral subtlety in favour of the blood-stained sledgehammer. He remains that coherent link between cruel lawmaking and baffling violence. \u201cWithin a few months,\u201d he boasts, \u201cwe will be able to declare that we have won. Gaza will be totally destroyed.\u201d With pompous certitude, he also claimed that the next six months would see Hamas cease to exist.\n\nSuch opinions, expressed at the \u201cSettlements Conference\u201d organised by the Makor Rishon newspaper in Ofra, a West Bank settlement, gives a sense of the flavour. Palestinians are to be \u201cconcentrated\u201d on land located between the Egyptian border and the arbitrarily designated Morag Corridor. As with any potential abuser keen to violate his vulnerable charges while justifying it, Smotrich tried to impress with the idea that this was a \u201chumanitarian\u201d zone that would be free of \u201cHamas and terrorism\u201d.\n\nThe program here is clear in its chilling crudeness. Expulsion, relocation, transfer. These are the words famously used to move on populations of sizeable number in history, often at enormous cost. That this should involve lawmakers of the Jewish state adds a stunning, if perverse poignancy to this. They, the moved on in history, the expelled and the condemned wanderers, shall expel others and condemn them in turn. Smotrich also points the finger to desperation and hopelessness, the biting incentives that propel migration. The Palestinians will feel blessed in their banishment. \u201cThey will be totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places.\u201d\n\nImpossible to ignore in Smotrich\u2019s steaming bile against the Palestinians is the broader view that no Palestinian state can arise, necessitating urgent, preventative poisoning. In addition to the eventual depopulation of Gaza, plans to reconstitute the contours of the West Bank, ensuring that Israeli and Palestinian traffic are separated to enable building and construction for settlements as a prelude to annexation, are to be implemented.\n\nThe issue of twisting and mangling humanitarian aid in favour of Israel\u2019s territorial lust has raised some tart commentary. A statement from the Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, a forum led by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), does not shy away from the realities on the ground. All supplies, including those vital to survival, have been blocked for nine weeks. Bakeries and community kitchens have closed, while warehouses are empty. Hunger, notably among children, is rampant. Israel\u2019s plan, as presented, \u201cwill mean that large parts of Gaza, including the less mobile and most vulnerable people, will continue to go without supplies.\u201d\n\nThe UN Secretary General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator have confirmed that they will not cooperate in the scheme, seeing that it \u201cdoes not adhere to the global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.\u201d\n\nThe same point has been made by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Despite all being solid allies of Israel, they have warned that violations of international law are taking place. \u201cHumanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and a Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change\u201d.\n\nTo date, a promise lingers that the offensive will only commence once US President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar takes place. But no ongoing savaging of Gaza with some crude effort at occupation will solve the historical vortex that continues to drag the Jewish state risk and oblivion.",

        "text": "The dust had barely settled on the Australian federal election on May 3 before the hagiographers, mythmakers and revisionists got to work. If history is seen as a set of agreed upon facts, there was a rapidly growing consensus that Labor\u2019s imposing victory had been the result of a superb campaign, sparkling in its faultlessness.\n\nThis did not quite match pre-election remarks and assessments. The government of Anthony Albanese had been markedly unconvincing, marked by dithering, short sightedness and a lack of conviction. It had, rather inexplicably, made the conservative Coalition led by that cruel, simian looking automaton Peter Dutton, look electable.\n\nOverall, the campaign on the part of both sides of politics was consistently dull and persistently mediocre. Expansive, broad ideas were eschewed in favour of minutiae and objects of bribery: tax matters, cutting fuel excise, forgiving some student debt, improved Medicare services and child care assistance. Issues such as the parlous reliance of Australia upon US security interests, not to mention the criminally daft obligations of the AUKUS security pact, or a detailed, coherent policy on addressing environmental and climate challenges, were kept in storage.\n\nWhat did become evident in the weeks leading up to the poll was that the Coalition policy palette, which never went beyond blotches of law and order (terrorism, criminal refugees, paedophilia forefront themes), mild bribes for \u201ccost of living relief\u201d; and illusory nuclear energy, failed to appeal. Its campaign lacked the barely modest bite of Labor, largely because it had been eclipsed by such oxygen drawing events as US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff regime and the death of Pope Francis I.\n\nIt had also misread the mood of the electorate in pushing policies with a tangy Trump flavour, notably the proposed removal of 41,000 jobs from the public sector and the establishment of something similar to the US Department of Government Efficiency . (Country Liberal Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price unhelpfully promised to \u201cmake Australia great again.\u201d) The Coalition, Dutton admitted after being accused by Labor of being \u201cDOGE-y Dutton\u201d, had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and \u201cgot it wrong\u201d. The focus would be, instead, on natural attrition. There were also scrappy sorties on the cultural war front, featuring lashings of undesirable press outlets, such as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Guardian (\u201chate media\u201d, according to Dutton), and the presence of \u201cwokeism\u201d in schools.\n\nFlimsy soothsayers could also be found, many endorsing a Liberal-Nationals victory. \u201cFor the first time in my journalistic career,\u201d beamed Sharri Markson of Sky News Australia on May 1, \u201cI\u2019m going to offer a pre-election editorial, endorsing one side of politics [\u2026] A Dutton prime ministership would give our great nation the fresh start we deserve.\u201d With vigorous drumbeating, Markson could only see \u201cour values under threat \u2013 from enemies and abroad\u201d \u2013 and retaining Anthony Albanese as prime minister was dangerous. With the analytical skill of an unread, hungover undergraduate, the political astrologist found the PM a victim of \u201cfar-left ideology\u201d, something \u201cout of step with mainstream Australia.\u201d\n\nWith Labor\u2019s victory assured, the fiscal conservatives at the Australian Financial Review proved sniffy, noting that Labor\u2019s record on the economy did not warrant another term \u201cbut the Coalition has not made the case to change the government.\u201d More explicit, with hectoring relish, was Australia\u2019s premier shock jock of the press stable, Andrew Bolt. \u201cNo, the voters aren\u2019t always right,\u201d he wrote scoldingly in the News Corp yellow press. \u201cThis time they were wrong, and this gutless and incoherent Coalition should be ashamed.\u201d Australians were set to \u201cget more\u201d of policies that had \u201cleft this country poorer, weaker, more divided and deeper in debt\u201d.\n\nOne is reminded of Henry Kissinger\u2019s rebuke of Chilean democracy at the election of the socialist leader Salvador Allende. As one of US foreign policy\u2019s chief malefactors, he refused to accept the proposition that a country could \u201cgo communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people.\u201d Democracy was only worthy if directed by the appropriate interests.\n\nSenator Price, evidently rattled by the result, returned to the Trumpian well, hoping to draw attention to claims of irregular voting in rural polling booths. The Australian Electoral Commission, she told the ABC, \u201chas been alerted to this over and over and does little with it. I urge the ABC, as a taxpayer funded organisation, to go out and see what is occurring.\u201d\n\nThere are other evident patterns that emerged in the vote. The old division between urban, metropolitan areas and rural and country communities has been coloured with sharpness. The Liberal Party, which must win seats in urban Australia, finds itself marginalised before its allies, the Nationals, who have retained their complement in regional and country areas. Party voices and strategists lament that not more was done after the 2022 defeat, with the Liberals refusing to address, among other things, the failure to appeal to female voters or the youth vote.\n\nDisappointing in such stonking majorities is the assumption that minority parties and independents can be ignored, if not with contempt, then with condescending politeness. Labor may well be soaring with the greatest return of seats in its history, but attitudes of the electorate can harden quickly. The move away from the major parties, as a trend, continues, and there is no room for complacency in a new Albanese government.",

Both parties ran lackluster campaigns, focusing on minor issues rather than addressing significant topics like Australia's reliance on US security interests or climate policy. The Coalition's campaign, marked by Trump-like policies and cultural war rhetoric, failed to resonate with voters, leading to internal admissions of strategic errors. Media figures like Sharri Markson and Andrew Bolt expressed disappointment with the election outcome, criticizing Labor's policies and the Coalition's failure to present a compelling alternative. The election also highlighted the growing divide between urban and rural voters, with the Liberal Party struggling to appeal to urban areas while the Nationals maintained their rural support.

        "text": "The murder and starvation of populations in real time, subject to rolling coverage and commentary, is not usually the done thing. These are the sorts of activities kept quiet and secluded in their vicious execution. In the Gaza Strip, these actions are taking place with a confident, almost brazen assuredness.\n\nIsrael has the means, the weapons and the sheer gumption to do so, and Palestinians in Gaza find themselves with few options for survival. The strategic objectives of the Jewish state, involving, for instance, the elimination of Hamas, have been shown to be nonsensically irrelevant, given that they are unattainable. Failed policies of de facto annexation and occupation are re-entering the national security argot.\n\nIn yet another round of proceedings, this time initiated by a UN General Assembly resolution, the International Court of Justice is hearing from an array of nations and bodies (40 states and four international organisations) regarding Israel\u2019s complete blockade of Gaza since March 2. Also featuring prominently are Israel\u2019s efforts to attack the United Nations itself, notably UNRWA, the relief agency charged with aiding Palestinians.\n\nAs counsel for the Palestinians, Blinne N\u00ed Ghr\u00e1laigh outlined the central grievances. The restrictions on \u201cthe fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, [Israel\u2019s] attacks on the United Nations and on UN officials, property and premises, its deliberate obstruction of the organisation\u2019s work and its attempt to destroy an entire UN subsidiary organ\u201d lacked precedent \u201cin the history of the organisation\u201d. Being not only \u201cantithetical to a peace-loving state\u201d, such actions were \u201ca fundamental repudiation by Israel of its charter obligations owed both to the organisation and to all UN members and of the international rule of law\u201d.\n\nIsrael had further closed all relevant crossings into the Strip and seemingly planned \u201cto annex 75 square kilometres of Rafah, one-fifth of Gaza, to [its] so-called buffer zone, permanently. This, together with Israel\u2019s continuing maritime blockade, cuts Gaza and its people off from direct aid and assistance and from the rest of the world\u201d.\n\nThe submission by N\u00ed Ghr\u00e1laigh went on to document the plight of Palestinian children, 15,600 of whom had perished, with tens of thousands more injured, missing or traumatised. Gaza had become \u201chome to the largest cohort of child amputees in the world, the largest orphan crisis in modern history, and a whole generation in danger of suffering from stunting, causing irreparable physical and cognitive impairments\u201d.\n\nSouth Africa, which already has an application before the Court accusing Israel of violating the UN Genocide Convention, pointed to the international prohibition against \u201cstarvation as a method of warfare, including under siege or blockade\u201d. Its representative Jaymion Hendricks insisted that Israel had \u201cdeployed the full range of techniques of hunger and starvation\u201d against \u201cthe protected Palestinian population, which it holds under unlawful occupation.\u201d The decision to expel UNRWA and relevant UN agencies should be reversed, and access to food, medicine and humanitarian aid resumed.\n\nIn a chilling submission to the Court, Zane Dangor, director general of South Africa\u2019s Department of International Relations and Cooperation, detected a scheme in the cruelty. \u201cThe humanitarian aid system is facing total collapse. This collapse is by design.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s response, one increasingly rabid to the obligations of humanitarian and international law, was best stated by its Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa\u2019ar. In announcing that Israel would not participate in oral proceedings derided as a \u201ccircus\u201d, he restated the long held position that UNRWA was \u201can organisation infiltrated beyond repair by terrorism.\u201d Courts were once again being abused \u201cto try and force Israel to cooperate with an organisation that is infested with Hamas terrorists, and it won\u2019t happen\u201d.\n\nThen came an agitated flurry of accusations shamelessly evoking the message from \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s \u201cJ\u2019Accuse\u201d note of 1898, penned during the convulsions of the Dreyfus Affair: \u201cI accuse UNRWA. I accuse the UN. I accuse the Secretary General, I accuse all those that weaponize international law and its institutions in order to deprive the most attacked country in the world, Israel, of its most basic right to defend itself.\u201d\n\nThe continuing blackening of UNRWA was also assured by Amir Weissbrod of Israel\u2019s foreign ministry, who reiteratedthe claims that the organisation had employed 1,400 Palestinians with militant links. Furthermore, some had taken part in Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. That such a small number had participated was itself striking and should have spared the organisation the savaging it received. But Israel has longed for the expulsion of an entity that is an accusing reminder of an ongoing, profane policy of oppression and dispossession.\n\nIn her moving address to the Court, N\u00ed Ghr\u00e1laigh urged the justices to direct Israel to allow aid to enter Gaza and re-engage the offices of UNRWA. Doing so might permit the re-mooring of international law, a ship increasingly put off course by the savage war in Gaza. The cold, somewhat fanatical reaction to these proceedings in The Hague by Israel\u2019s officials suggest that anchoring international obligations, notably concerning Palestinian civilians, is off the list.",

        "text": "Universities are in a bind. As institutions of learning and teaching, knowledge learnt and taught should, or at the very least could, be put into practice. How unfortunate for rich ideas to linger in cold storage or exist as the mummified status of esoterica. But universities in the United States have taken fright at pro-Palestinian protests since October 7, 2023, becoming battlegrounds for the propaganda emissaries of Israeli public relations and the pro-evangelical, Armageddon lobby that sees the end times taking place in the Holy Land. Higher learning institutions are spooked by notions of Israeli brutality, and they are taking measures.\n\nThese measures have tended to be heavy handed, taking issue with students and academic staff. The policy has reached another level in efforts by amphibian university managers to ban various protest groups who are seen as creating an environment of intimidation for other members of the university tribe. That these protesters merely wish to draw attention to the massacre of Palestinian civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, and the fact that the death toll, notably in the Gaza Strip, now towers at over 50,000, is a matter of inconvenient paperwork.\n\nEven worse, the same institutions are willing to tolerate individuals who have celebrated their own unalloyed bigotry, lauded their own racial and religious ideology, and deemed various races worthy of extinguishment or expulsion. Such a man is Israel\u2019s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who found himself permitted to visit Yale University at the behest of the Jewish society Shabtai, a body founded by Democratic senator and Yale alumnus Cory Booker, along with Rabbi Shmully Hecht.\n\nShabtai is acknowledged as having no official affiliation with Yale, though it is stacked with Yale students and faculty members who participate at its weekly dinners. Its beating heart was Hecht, who arrived in New Haven after finishing rabbinical school in Australia in 1996.\n\nThe members of Shabtai were hardly unanimous in approving Ben-Gvir\u2019s invitation. David Vincent Kimel, former coach of the Yale debate team, was one of two to send an email to a Shabtai listserv to express brooding disgruntlement. \u201cShabtai was founded as a space for fearless, pluralistic Jewish discourse,\u201d the email remarks. \u201cBut this event jeopardizes Shabtai\u2019s reputation and every future.\u201d In views expressed to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Kimel elaborated: \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned that we\u2019re increasingly treating extreme rhetoric as just another viewpoint, rather than recognizing it as a distortion of constructive discourse.\u201d The headstone for constructive discourse was chiselled sometime ago, though Kimel\u2019s hopes are charming.\n\nAs a convinced, pro-settler fanatic, Ben-Gvir is a fabled-Torah basher who sees Palestinians as needless encumbrances on Israel\u2019s righteous quest to acquire Gaza and the West Bank. Far from being alone, Ben-Gvir is also the member of a government that has endorsed starvation and the deprivation of necessities as laudable tools of conflict, to add to an adventurous interpretation of the laws of war that tolerates the destruction of health and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAfter a dinner at President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort (the bad will be fed), Ben-Gvir was flushed with confidence. He wrote on social media of how various lawmakers had \u201cexpressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed in order to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home safely.\u201d By any other standard, this was an admission to encouraging the commission of a war crime.\n\nIn July last year, Israel\u2019s State Prosecutor Amit Aisman reportedly sought permission from Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to open a criminal investigation into Ben-Gvir for alleged incitement of violence against residents of Gaza. The move was said to be a gesture to placate the International Court of Justice as it considers the genocide case filed by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza. In a string of increasingly agitated interim orders, the ICJ has asked that Israel comply, as signatory member, with the obligations imposed by the United Nations Genocide Convention. These include prohibitions against incitement to genocide.\n\nIncitement has become something of a nervous tic for the minister. In November 2023, for instance, Ben-Gvir remarked that \u201cWhen we say Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy \u2013 they\u2019re all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.\u201d Seeing himself as essentially immune to any form of prosecution, Ben-Gvir gave the State Prosecutor a sound verbal thrashing, claiming that it was \u201ctrying to make an Israeli minister stand trial for \u2018incitement\u2019 against citizens of an enemy state that danced on the blood our soldiers on the streets of Gaza on October 7.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to protests against Ben-Gvir\u2019s visit, Yale stated that the student encampments set up on April 22 on Beinecke Plaza were in violation of the university\u2019s policies on the use of outdoor spaces. Students already on notice for previous protests along similar lines would face \u201cimmediate disciplinary action\u201d. With dulling predictability, the university revealed that it was looking into \u201cconcerns \u2026 about disturbing anti-Semitic conduct at the gathering\u201d.\n\nUniversity officialdom had also focused on the activities of Yalies4Palestine, a student organisation whose club status was revoked for \u201csending calls over social media for others to join the event\u201d. The statement makes the claim that the group \u201cflagrantly violated the rules to which the Yale College Dean\u2019s Office holds all registered student organizations\u201d. Consequently, the body cannot receive funding from Yale sources, use the university name, participate in relevant student activities, or book spaces on the campus.\n\nThis profaning of protest in a university setting is a convenient trick, using the popular weasel words of \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d while deploying, more generically, the pitiful policy inventory that makes freedom of expression an impossibility. Mobilised accordingly, they can eliminate any debate, any discussion and any idea from the campus for merely being stingingly contrarian or causing twinges of intellectual discomfort. The moment the brain aches in debate, the offended howl and the administrators suppress. Play nice, dear university staff and students, or don\u2019t play at all. Besides, Ben-Gvir, by Yale standards, is a half-decent fellow.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "U.S. universities are facing backlash for their heavy-handed responses to pro-Palestinian protests, while simultaneously allowing controversial figures like Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to speak, highlighting a tension between freedom of expression and institutional policies on campus.",

In response, many institutions have taken heavy-handed measures against students and faculty involved in these protests, often banning groups seen as creating an intimidating environment, despite their aim to highlight the high civilian death toll in Gaza. Meanwhile, controversial figures like Israel\u2019s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, known for his extreme views and incitement against Palestinians, have been welcomed at events such as those organized by Yale's Jewish society, Shabtai. This has sparked internal dissent and criticism from members who view such invitations as damaging to constructive discourse. Yale's administration has responded to protests against Ben-Gvir's visit by enforcing strict policies against student demonstrations, particularly targeting groups like Yalies4Palestine, whose club status was revoked for violating university rules. This situation reflects a broader trend where universities, under the guise of maintaining safety and order, are curbing freedom of expression and stifling debate, thereby undermining their role as spaces for open intellectual engagement.",

Importantly, criticism is coming from those who have, at points, swooned at the prospect of acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine capability assuming, erroneously, that Australia somehow needs it.\n\nA report by the Strategic Analysis Australia think tank has found that AUKUS, despite the increasingly vain promise of supplying the Royal Australian Navy with nuclear powered submarines in 2032, has already become its own, insatiable beast. As beast it is, with the cost over the next four years for the submarine program coming in at A$17.3 billion, exceeding by some margin the capital budget of the Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) at A$12.7 billion. One of the authors of the report, Marcus Hellyer, notes that \u201cin terms of acquisition spending, the SSN [nuclear-powered attack submarine] enterprise has already become the ADF\u2019s [Australian Defence Force\u2019s] \u2018fourth service\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe report notes some remarkable figures.Expenditure on SSNs is estimated to be somewhere between A$53 billion and A$63 billion between 2024-2034, with the next five years of the decade costing approximately A$20 billion. The amount left over for the following years comes in at $33 to $44 billion, necessitating a target of $10 billion annually by the end of the financial decade in the early 2030s. What is astounding is the amount being swallowed up by the ADF\u2019s investment program in maritime capabilities, which will, over the coming decade, come to 38% of the total investment.\n\nThe SSN program has made its fair share in distorting the budget.The decade to 2033-4 features a total budget of A$330 billion.But the SSN budget of $53-63 billion puts nuclear powered submarines at 16.1% to 19.1% more than either the domains of land and air relevant to Australia\u2019s defence. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to grasp how unusual this situation is,\u201d the report notes with gravity. \u201cMoreover, it\u2019s one that will endure for decades, since the key elements of the maritime domain (SSNs and the two frigate programs) will still be in acquisition well into the 2040s. It\u2019s quite possible that Defence itself doesn\u2019t grasp the situation that it\u2019s gotten into.\u201d\n\nTo add to the more specialist literature calling large parts of AUKUS expenditure into question comes the emergence of disquiet in political ranks. Despite the craven and cowardly bipartisan approval of Australia\u2019s dottiest military venture to date, former Labor senator Doug Cameron, who fronts the Labor Against War group, is a symptom of growing dissent. \u201cThere are other more realistic and cost-effective strategies to protect our territorial integrity without subjugating ourselves to a dangerous, unpredictable and unworthy Trump administration.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the political aisle, former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is pessimistically inclined to the view that Australia will never get those much heralded submarines. \u201cThere will be Australian sailors serving on US submarines, and we\u2019ll provide them with a base in Western Australia.\u201d Furthermore, Australia would have \u201clost both sovereignty and security and a lot of money as well.\u201d\n\nThe spineless disposition of Australia\u2019s political cadres may prove irrelevant to the forced obsolescence of the agreement, given the scrutiny of AUKUS in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The pugilistic nature of the tariff system imposed by the Trump administration on all countries, friendly or adversarial, has brought particular focus on the demands on naval and submarine construction. Senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, told an AUKUS dinner in Washington this month that \u201cWe are already having trouble getting these ships and subs on time [and] on budget. Increase those prices \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nTaine\u2019s point is logical enough, given that steel and aluminium have been targeted by particularly hefty rates.Given the array of products requiring exchange in the AUKUS arrangement, tariffs would, the senator reasons, \u201cslow us down and make things harder\u201d.\n\nAnother blow also looms.On April 9, the White House ordered the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to comb through the procurement of US Navy vessels in order \u201cto improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes\u201d and contribute to the Trump administration\u2019s Maritime Action Plan. Consistent with Trump\u2019s near obsession of reviving national industry, the order seeks \u201cto revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity.\u201d\n\nAustralian taxpayers have every reason to be further worried about this, given the order\u2019s emphasis that US departments and agencies pursue \u201call available incentives to help shipbuilders domiciled in allied nations partner to undertake capital investment in the US to help strengthen the shipbuilding capacity of the US\u201d. Given that that US submarine industrial base is already promised $US3 billion from Australia\u2019s pockets, with $500 million already transferred in February, the delicious exploitation of Canberra\u2019s stupidity continues apace.\n\nIn the UK, the House of Commons Defence Committee this month announced a parliamentary inquiry into the defence pact, which will evaluate the agreement in light of changes that have taken place since 2021.\u201cAUKUS has been underway for three years now,\u201d remarked Defence Committee chairman and Labour MP, Tan Dhesi. \u201cThe inquiry will examine the progress made against each of the two pillars, and ask how any challenges could be addressed.\u201d\n\nThe first pillar, perennially spectral, stresses the submarine component, both in terms of transferring Virginia class SSNs to Australia and the construction of a bespoke nuclear-powered AUKUS submarine; the second focuses on the technological spread of artificial intelligence, quantum capabilities, hypersonic advances and cyber warfare. While Dhesi hopes that the inquiry may throw up the possibility of expanding the second pillar, beady eyes will be keen to see the near non-existent state regarding the first.But even the second pillar lacks definition, prompting Kaine to suggest the need for \u201csome definition and some choices\u201d. Nebulous, amorphous and foolish, this absurd pact continues to sunder.",

The alliance is further scrutinized due to tariff issues under the Trump administration, which complicate naval construction timelines and costs. In the UK, a parliamentary inquiry will assess AUKUS's progress and challenges, particularly the vague and underdeveloped second pillar concerning technological advancements. Overall, AUKUS is criticized as a misguided and costly venture that may compromise Australia's sovereignty and security.",

        "text": "In recent months, the Israeli Defense Forces have been much taken by a term that augurs poorly for peaceful accord in the Middle East. \u201cSecurity zones\u201d are being seized in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria. Land is, for claimed reasons of self-defence, being appropriated with brazen assuredness.It is hard, however, to see this latest turn as anything other than a de facto military occupation, a situation that will prolong the crisis of vulnerability the Jewish state so wishes to overcome. Israel\u2019s insecurities are much the result of various expansions since 1948 that have only imperilled it to future attack and simmering acrimony. The pattern threatens to repeat itself.\n\nIn Syria, Israel rapidly capitalised on the fall of the Assad regime by shredding the status quo. Within a matter of 11 days after the fleeing of the former President Bashar Al-Assad to Moscow, and again on February 1 this year, satellite images showed six military sites being constructed within what is nominally the UN-supervised demilitarised zone, otherwise known as the Area of Separation. A seventh is being constructed outside the zone and in Syria proper. Such busy feats of construction have also accompanied Israeli encroachment on the land of Syrian civilians, coupled with vexing housing raids, road closures and unsanctioned arrests.\n\nAll this has taken place despite undertakings from Syria\u2019s transitional President Ahmed al-Sharaa that he would recognise the 1974 agreement made with Israel, one which prohibits Israel from crossing the Alpha Line on the western edge of the Area of Separation. \u201cSyria\u2019s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and war, does not allow for new confrontations,\u201d admitted the new leader on December 14, 2024. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was only scornful, regarding the 1974 agreement between the two countries as a dead letter buried by history. \u201cWe will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border,\u201d he snottily declared.\n\nLebanon is also facing a stubborn IDF, one that refuses to abide by the Israel-Hezbollah agreement last November which promised the withdrawal of both forces from southern Lebanon, leaving the Lebanese army to take over the supervising reins. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, who faces the herculean task of removing Hezbollah\u2019s weapons while potentially integrating members of its group into the Lebanese army, has found his task needlessly onerous. In recent discussions with US deputy Mideast envoy Morgan Ortagus, the Lebanese leader reasoned \u201cthat Israel\u2019s presence in the five disputed points gives Hezbollah a pretext to keep its weapons.\u201d\n\nOn April 16, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz promised that such security zones would provide relevant buffers to shield Israeli communities.Ominously, the IDF would \u201cUnlike in the past [not evacuate] areas that have been cleared and seized\u201d. They would \u201cremain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza \u2013 as in Lebanon and Syria.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, it is becoming increasingly clear that any prospect of Palestinian autonomy or political independence is to be strangled and snuffed out. Israel has already arbitrarily created the \u201cMorag Corridor\u201d, which excises Rafah from the Strip, and the Netzarim Corridor, which severs Gaza in half. Katz has also promised that the policy of blocking all food, medicine and other vital supplies to Gaza implemented on March 2 will continue, as it \u201cis one of the main pressure levers preventing Hamas from using it as a tool with the population\u201d.\n\nDisplacement orders, euphemised as \u201cevacuation orders\u201d, have become the staple of operating doctrine, the means of creating buffers of guns and steel. On April 11, Israeli authorities issued two such orders, effectively \u201ccovering vast areas in northern and southern Gaza\u201d, according to UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric. \u201cTogether, these areas span more than 24 square kilometres \u2013 roughly the size of everything south of Central Park here in Manhattan.\u201d Within these zones of military seizure lie medical facilities and storage sites filled with vital supplies.\n\nThe UN Human Rights office also expressed its concerns about Israel seemingly \u201cinflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life increasingly incompatible with their continued existence as a group in Gaza.\u201d The population was being \u201cforcibly transferred into ever shrinking spaces with little or no access to life-saving services, including water, food, and shelter, and whey they continue to be subject to attacks.\u201d Engaging in such conduct against a civilian population within an occupied territory, the office pointedly observes, satisfies the definition of a forcible transfer, being both a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute of 1998.\n\nThe latest doctrine of appropriation and indeterminate occupation adopted by Katz and the IDF has not impressed the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel, long advocating for the release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas. \u201cThey promised that the hostages come before everything,\u201d came the organisation\u2019s aggrieved observation. \u201cIn practice, however, Israel is choosing to seize territory before the hostages.\u201d In doing so, the prerogatives of permanent conflict and habitual predation have displaced the more humane prerogatives of peace.",

In Lebanon, Israel's refusal to adhere to the Israel-Hezbollah agreement complicates President Joseph Aoun's efforts to disarm Hezbollah. In Gaza, Israel's creation of corridors and blockade of essential supplies undermines Palestinian autonomy, with displacement orders affecting vast areas and raising concerns from the UN about potential violations of international law. The IDF's strategy, emphasizing permanent occupation over the release of Israeli hostages, has drawn criticism from advocacy groups, highlighting a shift towards sustained conflict rather than peace efforts.",

        "text": "Island states tend to be anxious political entities. Encircled by water, seemingly defended by natural obstacles, the fear of corrupting penetration is never far. Threats of such unwanted intrusion are embellished and magnified. In the case of Australia, these have varied from straying Indonesian fishermen who are seen as terrors of border security, to the threatened establishment of military bases in the Indo-Pacific by China. With Australia facing a federal election, the opportunity to exaggerate the next threat is never far away.\n\nOn April 14, the specialist military publication Janes reported that Indonesia had \u201creceived an official request from Moscow, seeking permission for Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) aircraft to be based at a facility in [the country\u2019s] easternmost province.\u201d The area in question is Papua, and the relevant airbase, Biak Numfor, home to the Indonesian Air Force\u2019s Aviation Squadron 27 responsible for operating surveillance aircraft of the CN235 variety.\n\nIndonesian government sources had informed the magazine of a request received by the office of the defense minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, following a February meeting with the Security Council of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu. This was not the first time, with Moscow making previous requests to Jakarta for using a base for its long-range aircraft.\n\nThe frazzled response in Australia to the possibility of a Russian presence on Indonesian soil betrays its presumption. Just as Australia would rather not see Pacific Island states form security friendly ties with China, an anxiety directed and dictated by Washington, it would also wish those in Southeast Asia to avoid the feelers of other countries supposedly unfriendly to Canberra\u2019s interests.\n\nOpposition leader, Peter Dutton, who has an addict\u2019s fascination with security menaces of the phantom variety, sprung at the claims made in Janes. \u201cThis would be a catastrophic failure of diplomatic relations if [Australian Foreign Minister] Penny Wong and [Prime Minister] Anthony Albanese didn\u2019t have forewarning about this before it was made public,\u201d he trumpeted. \u201cThis is a very, very troubling development and suggestion that somehow Russia would have some of their assets based in Indonesia only a short distance from, obviously, the north of our country.\u201d\n\nThe Albanese government has tried to cool the confected heat with assurances, with the PM reaffirming Canberra\u2019s support for Ukraine while stating that \u201cwe obviously do not want to see Russian influence in our region\u201d. It has also accused Dutton for a streaky fabrication: that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto had \u201cpublicly announced\u201d the details.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Defence Minister, Richard Marles, also informed the press that he had spoken to his counterpart Sjamsoeddin, who duly replied \u201cin the clearest possible terms [that] reports of the prospect of Russian aircraft operating from Indonesia are simply not true.\u201d\n\nBesides, a country such as Indonesia, according to Marles, is of the friendly sort. \u201cWe have a growing defence relationship with Indonesia. We will keep engaging with Indonesia in a way that befits a very close friend and a very close friendship between our two countries.\u201d This sweetly coated nonsense should have gone out with the fa\u00e7ade-tearing acts of Donald Trump\u2019s global imposition of tariffs, unsparing to adversaries and allies alike.\n\nMarles continues to operate in a certain twilight of international relations, under the belief that the defense cooperation agreement with Jakarta \u201cis the deepest level defense agreement we\u2019ve ever had with Indonesia, and we are seeking increasing cooperation between Australia and Indonesia at the defense level.\u201d Whether this is, the case hardly precludes Indonesia, as an important regional power, from conducting defense and foreign policy on its own terms with countries of its own choosing.\n\nIn January, Jakarta officially added its name to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) group, an alternative power alignment that has been foolishly disregarded in terms of significance by the United States and its satellites. Subianto\u2019s coming to power last October has also heralded a warmer turn to Moscow in military terms, with both countries conducting their first joint naval drills last November in the Java Sea near Surabaya. (Indonesia is already a market for Russian fighter jets, despite the cloud of potential sanctions from the US Treasury Department.) For doing so, self-appointed disciplinarians, notably such pro-US outlets as the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, have questioned the country\u2019s fabled non-aligned foreign policy. Engaging Russia in cooperative military terms supposedly undermined, according to the think tank\u2019s publication The Strategist, Jakarta\u2019s \u201cown stated commitment to upholding international law.\u201d\n\nSuch commentary is neither here nor there. The Indonesian military remains jealous and proprietary, taking a dim view of any notion of a foreign military base. Retired Major General TB Hasanuddin, who is also a Member of Commission I of the Indonesian House of Representatives, points to constitutional and other legal impediments in permitting such a policy. \u201cOur constitution and various laws and regulations expressly prohibit the existence of foreign military bases.\u201d\n\nAny criticism of Jakarta\u2019s recent gravitation to Moscow also refuses to acknowledge the flexible, even sly approach Indonesia has taken to various powers. It has done so while maintaining a firm independence of mind. In the afterglow of the naval exercises with the Russian Navy, Indonesia\u2019s armed forces merrily went about the business of conducting military exercises with Australia, named Keris Woomera. Between November 13 and 16 last year, the exercise comprised 2,000 personnel from the navy, army and air force from both countries. As Australia frets and fantasizes about the stratagems of distant authoritarian leaders, Indonesia has the last laugh.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "Australia's anxiety over potential Russian military presence in Indonesia highlights its broader concerns about foreign influence in the region, despite reassurances from both Indonesian and Australian officials that such reports are unfounded, while Indonesia continues to maintain its independent foreign policy by engaging with multiple global powers.",

The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, attempted to downplay these concerns, emphasizing strong defense ties with Indonesia and dismissing the claims as false. Despite these reassurances, the article highlights Indonesia's independent foreign policy, noting its recent inclusion in the BRICS group and military cooperation with Russia, which has drawn criticism from pro-US entities. The Indonesian military's stance against foreign bases is underscored, with legal and constitutional barriers preventing such developments.

        "text": "Apparently, he is addicted to it. The French President, Emmanuel Macron, adores using perfume. The variety: Dior Eau Sauvage. Dior states that the perfume is characterised by notes of Calabrian bergamot and Papua New Guinean vanilla extract. The company is also keen to glorify elements of power and nobility in the scent.\n\nApparently, the use of that particular fragrance by the France\u2019s head of state happens to be \u201cindustrial\u201d in application, \u201cat all hours of the day\u201d, intended to impress \u201cless-accustomed visitors\u201d with \u201cthe floral and musky scent, as refined as it is powerful.\u201d A former aide is quoted as claiming that the President\u2019s use is far from subtle, a way of \u201cmarking his territory\u201d. Former minister Stanislas Guerini is also found stating that \u201ceveryone holds their breath for a few moments before [his] arrival.\u201d That\u2019s if we believe the findings of Le Parisien journalist Olivier Beaumont in The Tragedy of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e (La Trag\u00e9die de L\u2019\u00c9lys\u00e9e).\n\nThe field of scent and odours teems with what might be loosely called analysis of the self-evident and palpably obvious. Scent is worn for calculated reasons: for impression, the pursuit of sex, an expression of power. An article in Women\u2019s Wear Daily from June 1990 is pungent with examples, much of it featuring garden gnome psychology. \u201cThose who select a different fragrance for every occasion use scents as a means of shaping their social image,\u201d Mark Snyder, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota is quoted as saying. \u201cAll odors trigger an emotional response,\u201d one Susan Schiffman, medical psychologist at Duke University blandly states.\n\nAccording to the book, Macron\u2019s choice of fragrant dousing is driven by power \u2013 and ensuring that everyone else working with him knows about it. \u201cJust as Louis XIV made his perfumes an attribute of power when he paraded through the galleries of Versailles, Emmanuel Macron uses his as an element of his authority at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.\u201d\n\nThese revelations about Macron\u2019s excessive use have caused something of a ripple. \u201cIt is one thing at a school dance or nightclub when you are a horny teen,\u201d writes Zoe Strimpel in The Spectator. \u201cOutside of these contexts, it can be a nauseating, terrible thing.\u201d The Daily Telegraph dives into the shallow currents of social media to use the term\u201cblusher blindness\u201d, meant to signify \u201can inability to objectively gauge how much blusher one is applying \u2013 often resulting in overly roughed cheeks.\u201d\n\nTips are offered for Macron with unasked, hollow generosity, many amounting to a shoddy excuse to plump for preferred products. (The \u201cMr President Could Do Far Better\u201d discipline.) Fragrance journalist (they do exist), Alice du Parcq is more than up to the task. \u201cScent can be truly very potent, so if you\u2019re spending time in close proximity to a lot of other people you should be a little more gentle with your approach,\u201d she chides. Avoid, she advocates, spraying on wrists. Why not the top of each forearm? \u201cThis makes the scent last longer as it\u2019s less likely to come off every time you wash your hands.\u201d The fragrance lingers, as \u201cthe skin is more textured and it also clings to an arm hair, which is porous.\u201d\n\nThe advertising note emerges from the opinions of Thomas Dunckley, who markets himself as \u201cfragrance expert, writer, trainer, event host and speaker\u201d. He suggests that products less concentrated in fragrance oils might be appropriate when seeking a balance. \u201cAn eau de cologne is a good way for a man to wear a pleasant fragrance without making a statement or overpowering.\u201d He throws in the recommended products: Eau de Guerlain and Acqua di Parma.\n\nThe disciplinarian view is most evident in the commentary that accuses the French leader of revealing a character fault. As with one of his predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy, size and stature are matters of comment regarding Macron, implying that a manufactured defect requires remedies of exaggeration. Small men demand large substitutes, broad covers, gargantuan distractions. The spare frame will not do.\n\nIf one has to use perfume, suggests Strimpel, why not do so differently? \u201cA French leader might, one would think, go for something more openly, proudly elite, since he is not hamstrung by the modern British obsession with appearing to be one of the people,\u201d she squawks. A fault is swiftly detected: immaturity. Perhaps Macron confused his abode of power with the school where he met his wife, Brigitte, \u201cplanting the seed (or perhaps it was the scent?) that would eventually lead her to return his passion.\u201d\n\nThe fragrance analysts and perfumeries will be delighted to know that a head of state is so enamoured with a specific product. Those wishing to make a fuss about workplace attitudes and dispositions will also add, and have added, their worthless observations. Ultimately, the use, or otherwise, of French power would not come down to a fragrance but a decision marked by other considerations. The fragrance cabal and tabloid titterers may have you think otherwise.",

        "text": "The law enforcement breed can be a pretty dark lot. To be paid to think suspiciously leaves its mark, fostering an incentive to identify crimes and misdemeanours with instinctive compulsion. Historically, this saw the emergence of quackery and bogus attempts to identify criminal tendencies. Craniometry and skull size was, for a time, an attractive pursuit for the aspiring crime hunter and lunatic sleuth. The crime fit the skull.\n\nWith the onset of facial recognition technologies, we are seeing the same old habits appear, with their human creators struggling to identify the best means of eliminating compromising biases. A paper published by IBM researchers in April 2019 titled \u201cDiversity in Faces\u201d shows that doing so ends up returning to old grounds of quackery, including the use of \u201ccraniofacial distances, areas and ratios, facial symmetry and contrast, skin color, age and gender predictions, subjective annotations, and pose and resolution.\u201d\n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in identifying a form of predictive criminality perpetuates similar sins. Police, to that end, have consistently shown themselves unable to resist the attractions supposedly offered by data programs and algorithmic orderings, however sophisticated. These can take such crude forms as those advanced by Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco, a devotee of that oxymoronic pursuit \u201cintelligence-led policing,\u201d stacked with its snake oil properties. A 2020 Tampa Bay Times piece on the exploits of that Florida county\u2019s sheriff\u2019s office made it clear that Nocco was keen on creating \u201ca cutting-edge intelligence program that could stop crime before it happened.\u201d\n\nThe counter to this was impressive in its savagery. Such forms of law enforcement featured, in the view of criminologist David Kennedy of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, \u201cOne of the worst manifestations of the intersection of junk science and bad policing\u201d, in addition to its utter lack of \u201ccommon sense and humanity\u201d.\n\nThe trend towards data heavy systems that supposedly offer insight into inherent, potential criminality has captured police departments in numerous countries. A recommendation paper from the European Crime Prevention Network notes the use of \u201cAI tools in hopes of rendering law enforcement more effective and cost-efficient\u201d across the European Union. Predictive policing is singled out as particularly attractive, notably as a response to smaller budgets and fewer staff.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the government\u2019s Ministry of Justice has taken to AI with gusto through the Homicide Prediction Project, a pilot program that hoovers up data from police and government data sets to generate profiles and assess the risk of a person committing murder. The program, commissioned by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in 2023 and involving the MoJ, the Home Office, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and the Metropolitan Police in London, only came to light because of a Freedom of Information request by the charity Statewatch.\n\nAccording to the Data and Analysis unit within the MoJ the data science program explores \u201cthe power of MOJ datasets in relation to assessment of homicide risk\u201d, the \u201cadditional power of the Police National Computer dataset\u201d in doing the same, and \u201cthe additional power of local police data\u201d. It also seeks to review the characteristics of offenders that increase such a risk, exploring \u201calternative and innovative data science techniques to risk assessment and homicide.\u201d\n\nWhat stands out in the program is the type of data shared between the agencies. These include types of criminal convictions, the age a person first appeared as a victim (this includes domestic violence), and the age a person had their first encounter with the police. But also included are such matters as \u201chealth markers which are expected to have predictive power\u201d, be they on mental health, addiction issues, suicide, self-harm and disability.\n\nThe use of predictive models is far from new for the wonks at the MoJ. Those used in the Offender Assessment System (OASys) have been previously found to profile people differently in accordance with their ethnicities. The National Offender Management service noted in a 2015 compendium of research and analysis of the system between 2009 and 2013, \u201cRelative predictive validity was greater for female than male offenders, for White offenders than offenders of Asian, Black and Mixed ethnicity, and for older than younger offenders.\u201d\n\nStatewatch researcher Sofia Lyall has little to recommend the program, renamed for evidently more palatable consumption the Sharing Data to Improve Risk Assessment program. \u201cTime and again, research shows that algorithmic systems for \u2018predicting\u2019 crime are inherently flawed.\u201d The Homicide Prediction Project was \u201cchilling and dystopian\u201d, profiling individuals \u201cas criminals before they have done anything.\u201d She is also convinced that the system will, as with others, \u201ccode in bias towards racialized and low-income communities\u201d while posing grave threats to privacy.\n\nThe unit claims that the work is only intended for dry research purposes, with \u201cno direct operational or policy changes\u201d arising because of it, or any individual application to a \u201cperson\u2019s journey through the justice system.\u201d This is a nonsensical assertion, given the sheer temptations open to officials to implement a program that uses hefty data sets in order to ease the task of rigorous policing. The representatives of law enforcement crave results, even those poorly arrived at, and algorithmic expediency and actuarial fantasy is there to aid them. The \u201cprecrime\u201d dystopia portrayed in Philip K. Dick\u2019s The Minority Report (1956) is well on its way to being realised.",

        "paragraph_summary": "The article discusses the historical and ongoing challenges of using predictive technologies in law enforcement, highlighting the persistence of biases and flawed methodologies. Historically, dubious practices like craniometry were employed to predict criminal behavior, and similar issues are resurfacing with modern technologies like facial recognition and AI-driven predictive policing. These systems, despite their sophistication, often perpetuate biases and lack common sense and humanity, as exemplified by controversial programs in the U.S. and the U.K. The U.K.'s Homicide Prediction Project, for instance, uses vast datasets to assess murder risk but has been criticized for profiling individuals as potential criminals before any crime is committed, raising concerns about privacy and inherent biases against marginalized communities. Despite claims that such programs are for research purposes only, the temptation to use them operationally is strong, echoing dystopian themes from Philip K. Dick's \"The Minority Report.\"",

        "text": "It was a massacre. Fifteen emergency workers, butchered in cold blood by personnel from the Israeli Defense Forces in southern Gaza on March 23. It all came to light from a video that the IDF did not intend anyone to see, filmed by Red Crescent paramedic Rifaat Radwan in the last minutes of his life. Caught red handed, the wires and levers of justification, mendacity and qualification began to move.\n\nThe pattern of institutional response is a well-rehearsed one. First came the official claim that the troops only opened fire because the convoy approached them \u201csuspiciously\u201d, enshrouded in darkness, with no headlights or evidence of flashing lights. The movement of the convoy had not, it was said, been cleared and coordinated with the IDF, which had been alerted by operators of an overhead UAV. Soldiers had previously fired on a car containing, according to the Israeli account, three Hamas members. When that vehicle was approached by the ambulances, IDF personnel assumed they were threatened, despite lacking any evidence that the emergency workers were armed. On exiting the vehicles, gunfire ensues. Radwan\u2019s final words: \u201cThe Israelis are coming, the Israeli soldiers are coming.\u201d\n\nThen comes the qualification, the \u201chand in the cookie jar\u201d retort. With the video now very public, the IDF was forced to admit that they had been mistaken in the initial assessment that the lights of the ambulance convoy had been switched off, blaming it on the sketchy testimony of soldiers. Also evident are clear markings on the vehicles, with the paramedics wearing hi-vis uniforms.\n\nAfter being shot, the bodies of the 15 dead workers were unceremoniously buried in sand (\u201cin a brutal and disregarding manner that violates human dignity,\u201d according to the Red Crescent) \u2013 supposedly to protect them from the ravages of wildlife \u2013 with the vehicles crushed by an armoured D9 bulldozer to clear the road. Allegations have been made that some of the bodies had their hands tied and were shot at close range, suggesting a willingness on the part of the military to conceal their misdeeds. The IDF has countered by claiming that the UN was informed on the location of the bodies.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent society is adamant: the paramedics were shot with the clear intention of slaying them. \u201cWe cannot disclose everything we know,\u201d stated Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, president of the Red Crescent in the West Bank, \u201cbut I will say that all the martyrs were shot in the upper part of their bodies, with the intent to kill.\u201d\n\nThe IDF, after a breezy inquiry, claimed that it \u201crevealed that the force opened fire due to a sense of threat following a previous exchange of fire in the area. Also, six Hamas terrorists were identified among those killed in the incident.\u201d This hardly dispels the reality that those shot were unarmed and showed no hostile intent. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and Palestinian rescuers have offered a breakdown of those killed: eight staff members from the Red Crescent, six from the Palestinian Civil Defence, and one employee from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.\n\nThe OCHA insists that the first team comprised rescuers rather than Hamas operatives. On being sought by additional paramedic and emergency personnel, they, too, were attacked by the IDF.\n\nThe findings of the probe into the killings were presented on April 7 to the IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir by the chief of the Southern Command, Maj. Gen. Yaniv Asor. On doing so, Zamir then ordered that the General Staff Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism be used to \u201cdeepen and complete\u201d the effort. That particular fact-finding body is risibly described as independent, despite being an extension of the IDF. Self-investigation remains a standard norm for allegations of impropriety.\n\nSince October 7, 2023, the death toll of health workers in the Gaza Strip has been impressively grim, reaching 1,060. Health facilities have been destroyed, with hundreds of attacks launched on health services. The World Health Organization update in February found that a mere 50% of hospitals were partially functional. Primary health care facilities were found to be 41% functional. Medical personnel have been harassed, arbitrarily detained and subjected to mistreatment. A report from Healthcare Workers Watch published in February identified 384 cases of unlawful detention since October 7, 2023, with 339 coming from the Gaza Strip and 45 from the West Bank.\n\nIn the opinion of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories since 1967, Francesca Albanese, \u201cThis is part of a pattern by Israel to continuously bombard, destroy and fully annihilate the realisation of the right to health in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe IDF, which claims to be fastidious in observing the canons of international law, continues to dispel such notions in killing civilians and health workers. It also continues to insist that its soldiers could never be guilty of a conscious massacre, culpable for a blatant crime. The bodies of fifteen health workers suggest otherwise.",

Allegations suggest some victims were shot at close range, and their bodies were buried in sand and vehicles crushed, hinting at an attempt to hide the incident. The IDF's internal investigation claimed a perceived threat led to the shooting and identified six Hamas members among the dead, though the UN and Palestinian rescuers assert the victims were unarmed rescuers. The incident is part of a broader pattern of violence against health workers in Gaza, with over 1,060 killed since October 7, 2023, amid widespread attacks on health facilities. The UN Special Rapporteur and other organizations criticize Israel for undermining health rights in Gaza, while the IDF maintains its adherence to international law despite evidence suggesting otherwise.",

        "text": "It was yet another unwelcome development for Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s technology titan Meta, the parent company of Facebook. The High Court of Kenya has found that the US-based entity can be sued over its alleged role in disseminating content that incited violence in neighbouring Ethiopia. While the case can be heard in Kenya, the essential harm is alleged to have taken place during the 2020-2022 civil war in Ethiopia\u2019s northern region of Tigray.\n\nEthiopians Abrham Meareg and Fisseha Tekle, the latter a former Amnesty International researcher, along with The Katiba Institute, charge Meta with promoting harmful content from November 2020 to November 2022. Meareg, alleges that his father Meareg Amare Abrha, an academic then in the employ of Bahir Dar University, was killed outside his home in 2021 in the saturating aftermath of threatening, inciting posts on Facebook. These included details about where he lived, along with false allegations of corruption and the provision of assistance to the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front. Tekle, for his part, faced a hail of hateful posts and activity on Facebook for his human rights work in Ethiopia.\n\nAs cited in the ruling by High Court judge Lawrence Mugambi, the petitioners also make various other arguments. One is that Meta\u2019s \u201cFacebook algorithm recommends content that amounts to propaganda for war, incitement to violence and advocacy to the Facebook users in Kenya.\u201d Meta is also accused of \u201cgranting preferential treatment to users in other countries as opposed to Facebook users in Africa\u201d, thereby making it discriminative in nature. \u201cThe darker the content,\u201d the petition asserts, \u201cthe higher the likelihood it will be prioritized.\u201d\n\nThe petitioners demand that Meta make a formal apology for the killing of Meareg Amare Abrhal and establish a restitution fund for victims of hate speech and incitement on Facebook to the value of 250 billion KSH (US$2 billion), with an additional 50 billion KSH (US$400 million) for harm arising from sponsored posts. The company is to also alter Facebook\u2019s algorithm to halt the promotion of viral hate and adjust the algorithm in favour of demoting incitements to violence, including death threats and doxing. This would be along lines similar to what was adopted in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots of January 6, 2021.\n\nImportant here is also the demand that Meta ensure the recruitment of sufficient numbers of content moderators for Facebook to guard against any repetition of those harms caused in East and Southeastern Africa, with particular attention paid to Ethiopia.\n\nThe argument by Meta was a tried and failed one. Kenyan courts, it argued, could not hear the case, as Meta was not a Kenyan company. It had contended that the Kenyan Constitution had no extraterritorial reach and could not be said to apply to events taking place in Ethiopia. Nor did it have a base of operation in Kenya. Any relevant claim, accordingly, could only be heard in the US judicial system.\n\nThe Court found, however, that it was empowered to determine whether rights protected under the Kenyan Bill of Rights were breached, even in the novel circumstances posed by the use of artificial intelligence. It followed that the petition raised \u201csubstantial questions of law\u201d, thereby satisfying the threshold requirements of the Constitution.\n\nAs the ruling goes on to mention, \u201cThe issues raised are substantial and transcend the interests of the parties involved in the Petition. These are matters of general public importance relating to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms in the digital era.\u201d An uneven number of judges, as stipulated by section 165 of the Constitution of Kenya, will be empanelled by Chief Justice Martha Koome, even as Meta\u2019s legal representatives seek to appeal the decision.\n\nLawyers representing the company should have known better. The jurisdictional argument has been run in two separate cases involving the unlawful sacking of content moderators working for Facebook in Kenya in 2022 and 2023. Kenyan courts have given short shrift to claims that they lack jurisdiction no less than three times. To this can be added defeats for Meta in the Employment and Labour Relations Court and the Court of Appeal. This particular High Court ruling is notable for, in its words, helping identify \u201ca clear jurisprudential path that ensures observance of human rights in a borderless digital community.\u201d\n\nNora Mbagathi, executive director of the Katiba Institute, underlined the salience of the decision: \u201cThe court here has refused to shy away from determining an important global matter, recognising that homegrown issues must be addressed directly by our courts.\u201d Abrham Meareg also had sharp words for Zuckerberg, who \u201cmay imagine that justice begins and ends at the US border.\u201d It is yet another example of holding the conduct of tech behemoths to account for the convulsive information ecosystem they have so blithely created and exploited.",

They demand a formal apology, a restitution fund of $2 billion, and changes to Facebook's algorithm to prevent the promotion of hate speech.

        "text": "Paranoia manifests in various ways. It can eat away individuals in desperate solitude, whittling away sanity and balance. It can be enlisted in the making of policy. The latter can be particularly dangerous, notably when readying for a fantastic threat. For the Baltic States, Poland and Finland, there is much talk about the Russia threat, one that will supposedly manifest in boots, armour and missiles once the war against Ukraine concludes. Unfortunately, that talk is now manifesting in preparations for war. So eager are these countries in making such preparations, they are willing to exit important treaties in doing so.\n\nThe 1997 Ottawa Convention, otherwise known as the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, is one such document. The number of state parties is impressive: 164 in all. The omissions are, however, also notable, including the United States, China, Russia, India and Pakistan. Despite such impediments, the Convention has been instrumental in inducing a near halt of global production and reduction in the deployment of these weapons.\n\nWith the vibrant war chat that has gripped European capitals, the stockpiling and use of landmines is now being revisited as a genuine possibility. Even Ukraine, which is a signatory to the Convention, has received landmines from the United States and stated that its compliance with the treaty \u201cis limited and is not guaranteed.\u201d\n\nLast month, the defence ministers of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia released a statement expressing their belief \u201cthat in the current security environment it is paramount to provide our defence forces with flexibility and freedom of choice to potentially use new weapons systems and solutions to bolster our defence of the alliance\u2019s vulnerable Eastern flank.\u201d For that reason, a unanimous recommendation was made: that all parties withdraw from the Ottawa Convention. \u201cWith this decision, we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our territory and freedom.\u201d\n\nThis liberation from obligations imposed by international humanitarian law was seen as entirely consistent \u2013 and here, perversity creeps in \u2013 with all states\u2019 continued willingness to observe it, \u201cincluding the protection of civilians during an armed conflict. Our nations will continue to uphold these principles while addressing our security needs.\u201d\n\nEstonia\u2019s Defence Minister, Hanno Pevkur, attempted to give the recommendation some context, while trying to dispel notions that these countries had somehow scorned important legal obligations, let alone a global consensus on landmines. \u201cDecisions regarding the Ottawa Convention should be made in solidarity and coordination within the region. At the same time, we currently have no plans to develop, stockpile, or use previously banned anti-personnel landmines.\u201d\n\nIn a post on the X platform, Finland\u2019s President Alex Stubb declared his country\u2019s intention to join the four states, while still making the claim that \u201cFinland will always be a responsible actor in the world\u201d. The decision, which was already being considered last November given Russia\u2019s liberal use of such weapons in Ukraine, was made \u201cbased on a thorough assessment by the relevant ministries and the Defence Forces.\u201d\n\nRather anomalously, Stubb went on to claim that Finland was \u201ccommitted to its international obligations on the responsible use of mines.\u201d Similarly, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Sari Essayah told reporters that Helsinki would \u201cuse mines in a responsible way, but it\u2019s a deterrent we need.\u201d\n\nFinland\u2019s Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, in keeping with language that has become very modish, also stated that exiting the Ottawa Convention would allow preparations \u201cfor the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way\u201d. Despite admitting that Finland was not in any immediate danger from Moscow, he was confident that it posed a continuing, European-wide threat.\n\nGiven that such devices are indiscriminate and lingering in their lethal and maiming potential, squaring their use with the dictates of international customary law is nigh impossible. Despite their inherently clumsy nature, their skulking defenders can be found. In January 2020, then US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper authored a memorandum reversing a 2014 ban on US production and acquisition of antipersonnel landmines, while permitting their use outside any future conflict on the Korean Peninsula. In doing so, he insisted in rather novel reading that landmines were essential to \u201cbecoming more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready across a range of potential contingencies and geographies.\u201d\n\nIn its 2023 Landmine Monitor report, Human Rights Watch found that the active remnants of landmines killed more than 1,600 people and injured 3,015 in 2022. Of these, 85% were civilians, with children accounting for half of them. (So much for the protective principle and civilians.) The report also noted various groups most vulnerable to such weapons: nomads, hunters, herders, shepherds and agricultural workers, along with refugees and internally displaced persons.\n\nWith such grim assessments and bloody statistics, the recent volte face towards international humanitarian law by Poland, Finland and the Baltic states seems even more remarkable and ill-founded. Paranoia is producing its casualties.",
        "one_sentence_summary": "In response to perceived threats from Russia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic states are considering withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel mines, prioritizing national security over international humanitarian law despite the significant civilian risks associated with landmines.",
        "paragraph_summary": "The article discusses the resurgence of paranoia-driven military strategies among the Baltic States, Poland, and Finland, fueled by fears of a Russian threat post-Ukraine war. This paranoia is leading these countries to reconsider their commitments to the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans the use of anti-personnel landmines. Despite the Convention's success in reducing global landmine production and deployment, these nations are contemplating withdrawal to enhance their military flexibility, citing security concerns. This shift is paradoxical, as they claim to uphold international humanitarian principles while preparing to potentially use these indiscriminate weapons. Finland, in particular, has joined this movement, despite previously considering itself a responsible global actor. The article highlights the inherent contradiction in these countries' stance, as landmines have a devastating impact on civilians, with Human Rights Watch reporting significant casualties in 2022. The move away from international humanitarian law by these nations is seen as a dangerous response to perceived threats, driven by paranoia rather than rational assessment.",
