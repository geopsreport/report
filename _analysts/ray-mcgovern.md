    summary: "In his article, Dennis Kucinich argues that the vision of America as a nation governed by laws, as envisioned during the Revolution in 1776, is under threat today, particularly under the leadership of President Trump. He draws parallels between the actions of Trump and the grievances listed against King George III in the Declaration of Independence, suggesting that Trump's unilateral decisions, disregard for constitutional checks and balances, and assaults on civil rights and liberties reflect a modern form of tyranny. Kucinich calls for a recommitment to the principles of equality, justice, and the rule of law, urging the American people to actively defend these ideals to prevent the erosion of democracy and ensure that the nation remains true to its founding values. He emphasizes that the preservation of freedom relies on an engaged and informed citizenry."

    summary: "In his article, Andrew P. Napolitano argues that the United States has transformed from a republic founded on the principles of individual liberty and limited government, as articulated by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence, into an empire characterized by tyranny and overreach. He questions whether true independence exists when citizens are governed by a distant authority that engages in actions such as undeclared wars, mass surveillance, and the erosion of due process. Napolitano emphasizes that the foundational values of natural law, consent of the governed, and the protection of natural rights have been largely abandoned, leading to a government that claims excessive powers and undermines personal freedoms. He warns that unchecked government poses a significant threat to liberty, suggesting that it may need to be altered or abolished to prevent further erosion of individual rights."

    date: 2025-07-04 00:18
    summary: "Americans are increasingly turning away from mainstream media (MSM) and seeking out independent online platforms, with Consortium News being a notable example that has been challenging conventional narratives for three decades. The outlet has consistently critiqued the establishment's positions on various significant issues, including the Iraq War, Russiagate, the Assange case, and the Ukraine crisis. As it celebrates its 30th anniversary, Consortium News encourages supporters to declare their independence from mainstream media manipulation by contributing to its mission on Independence Day."
  - title: "US Supreme Court Affirms the Imperial Presidency"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/03/us-supreme-court-affirms-the-imperial-presidency/
    date: 2025-07-03 19:28
    summary: "In a recent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue universal injunctions against presidential actions, effectively prioritizing executive power over judicial oversight. This decision arose from a challenge to former President Trump's executive order aimed at restricting birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents. The Court's 6-3 ruling allows Trump to implement his order while leaving the question of its constitutionality unresolved. Dissenting justices expressed concern that this ruling undermines the rule of law and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations who may lack the resources to challenge government actions individually. The implications of this decision could lead to a fragmented legal landscape where only those with means can seek justice, raising alarms about the potential erosion of constitutional rights."
  - title: "Black People & US Birthright Citizenship"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/03/black-people-us-birthright-citizenship/
    date: 2025-07-03 18:55
    summary: "In her article, Margaret Kimberley discusses the implications of Donald Trump's executive order aimed at redefining birthright citizenship, which could potentially strip citizenship rights from marginalized groups, particularly Black Americans. She highlights the historical context of citizenship in the U.S., noting that the 14th Amendment was a crucial remedy for the injustices faced by Black people, especially following the Dred Scott decision. The proposed changes in citizenship documentation could create barriers for individuals who may lack the necessary proof of their parents' citizenship, leading to a risk of statelessness. Kimberley warns that if birthright citizenship is altered, it could empower future presidents to redefine citizenship at will, undermining hard-won rights for Black Americans. She emphasizes the need for vigilance, as the pursuit of restricting citizenship could inadvertently harm the very groups it aims to protect, and urges caution against trusting a system that has historically failed to uphold legal protections for Black citizens."
  - title: "The Billionaire Frenzy Over Zohran Mamdani"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/03/the-billionaire-frenzy-over-zohran-mamdani/
    date: 2025-07-03 16:32
    summary: "In the wake of Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, corporate elites and billionaires are expressing alarm over the potential shift towards policies that prioritize social justice over profit. Norman Solomon highlights the historical sentiment of John Jay, emphasizing the tension between oligarchs and the democratic aspirations of the populace. The article notes that while Mamdani's grassroots campaign mobilized 40,000 volunteers, the establishment, represented by figures like former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, could still pose a significant threat by splitting the anti-Mamdani vote. Wealthy donors are already strategizing to back alternative candidates against Mamdani, fearing the implications of his progressive policies. The article draws parallels to previous electoral battles, suggesting that the fight for democracy and social equity in New York is far from over, as powerful interests regroup to maintain their influence."
  - title: "Chris Hedges: The Genocide Profiteers"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/02/chris-hedges-the-genocide-profiteers/
    date: 2025-07-03 00:32
    summary: "In her recent report, Francesca Albanese, the Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, calls for over 1,000 corporations, including major firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Lockheed Martin, to sever ties with Israel or face accountability for their complicity in war crimes against Palestinians. The report highlights how these entities profit from the Israeli occupation and the ongoing genocide in Gaza, describing the situation as a "captive market" for corporate exploitation. Albanese emphasizes that the military operations in Gaza serve as a testing ground for advanced military technologies, which are then marketed globally. The report also criticizes international banks, charities, and universities for their roles in sustaining the Israeli military and its operations. Following the report's release, the U.S. government has called for Albanese's dismissal, accusing her of promoting antisemitism and undermining the global economy. The article argues that the network of corporations and institutions supporting Israel's actions are complicit in the genocide and must be held accountable."
  - title: "Britain’s Long History of Spying on Iran"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/02/britains-long-history-of-spying-on-iran/
    date: 2025-07-02 23:37
    summary: "The U.K. has a long history of covert operations in Iran, involving both attempts to undermine its government and secret dealings, including the sale of chemical weapons materials. British intelligence agencies, particularly MI6 and GCHQ, have engaged in various activities such as orchestrating a coup in 1953 to remove the democratically elected prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq, supporting the shah's regime, and later collaborating with the Islamic Republic for intelligence purposes. Notably, GCHQ's Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) employed cyber warfare tactics and social media manipulation to monitor and disrupt Iranian opposition movements. Despite publicly distancing itself from military actions against Iran, the U.K. has been deeply involved in espionage and influence operations aimed at controlling Iran's political landscape and nuclear ambitions, often in collaboration with U.S. and Israeli intelligence."
  - title: "SCOTT RITTER: If It Wants, Iran Is Days From the Bomb"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/02/scott-ritter-if-it-wants-iran-is-weeks-from-a-bomb/
    date: 2025-07-02 18:00
    summary: "Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector, argues that Iran has the capability to produce a nuclear weapon within days if the political decision is made, particularly in light of recent conflicts with Israel. Following a series of missile exchanges, Iranian officials have indicated a potential shift in their stance on nuclear weapons, suggesting that the religious fatwa against them could be lifted if national security is threatened. Ritter highlights that Iran has advanced its nuclear program significantly, with the ability to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels and the necessary components for a nuclear bomb already in place. Despite U.S. intelligence asserting that Iran has not yet decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, Ritter warns that the current geopolitical climate and Iran's declarations imply a readiness to act swiftly should the Supreme Leader give the order. The article underscores the implications of the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which has allowed Iran to expand its nuclear capabilities and position itself as a de facto nuclear power."
  - title: "Iran Damaged 33,000 Structures in Israel"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/02/iran-damaged-33000-structures-in-israel/
    date: 2025-07-02 05:53
    summary: "The Israeli daily Haaretz reports that the damage from Iran's recent counterattack on Israel has resulted in nearly 33,000 applications for financial assistance due to damaged structures. Despite efforts by Israeli authorities to limit media coverage, the extent of destruction is becoming clear, with significant failures of the Iron Dome air defense system allowing Iranian missiles to cause widespread damage. In Tel Aviv alone, 480 buildings were affected, with many severely damaged, while the overall impact of the attacks has left 29 civilians dead and thousands of homes and vehicles damaged. The report highlights that the current situation is far worse than during the 1991 Gulf War, where fewer missiles caused less destruction. In addition to civilian infrastructure, Iranian strikes also targeted military bases and key facilities, further exacerbating the damage."
  - title: "Help Us Fight the Psyopcracy"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/01/help-us-fight-the-psyopcracy-2/
    date: 2025-07-02 01:39
    summary: "In an article by Joe Lauria, Cathy Vogan introduces the term "psyopcracy" to describe the pervasive influence of psychological operations (PSYOP) on public perception, particularly in the context of U.S. media and foreign policy. The piece highlights how disinformation campaigns, often orchestrated by U.S. intelligence agencies, shape narratives that mislead the American public about wars and conflicts, such as those in Vietnam, Iraq, Ukraine, and Gaza. Lauria argues that these operations create entrenched false beliefs, portraying the U.S. as a benevolent force while obscuring its aggressive motives. Consortium News, where Lauria writes, aims to combat this manipulation by exposing the truth behind these narratives and challenging the accepted realities shaped by psyops."
  - title: "Jeffrey Sachs: A Comprehensive Middle East Peace Deal"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/01/jeffrey-sachs-a-comprehensive-middle-east-peace-deal/
    date: 2025-07-02 01:03
    summary: "In their article, Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares argue that Israel's aggressive and destabilizing actions across the Middle East, driven by a desire to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, have led to widespread violence and turmoil from Libya to Iran. They contend that Israel's strategy of regime change, particularly against Iran, is both reckless and counterproductive, as it undermines peace efforts and exacerbates regional instability. The authors propose a comprehensive peace plan that includes recognizing Palestine as a state, withdrawing Israeli forces from occupied territories, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful nuclear program. They emphasize that a genuine commitment to peace is essential for U.S. interests and regional stability, urging a shift away from supporting Israel's current policies."
  - title: "Chris Hedges: Gaza’s Hunger Games"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/01/chris-hedges-gazas-hunger-games/
    date: 2025-07-01 17:28
    summary: "In his article for ScheerPost, Chris Hedges argues that the Israeli government's strategy in Gaza employs starvation as a weapon of genocide against the Palestinian population, drawing parallels to historical instances of orchestrated famine used in genocides. He highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Palestinians are subjected to systematic violence and deprivation, forced to risk their lives for scarce food supplies at heavily guarded aid distribution points. Hedges describes the brutal tactics employed by Israeli soldiers, including shooting unarmed civilians and treating them as a hostile force, while also criticizing international complicity in the ongoing violence. He asserts that the ultimate goal of these actions is the complete annexation of Gaza, with Palestinians being reduced to a state of desperation and humiliation, as the region becomes increasingly uninhabitable."
  - title: "EU Buying Weapons Tested on Palestinians"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/01/eu-buying-weapons-tested-on-palestine/
    date: 2025-07-01 16:00
    summary: "The article by Jessica Buxbaum discusses how Israel is capitalizing on Europe's rearmament in response to perceived threats from Russia, particularly as NATO and EU nations increase military budgets and seek new defense partners amid a shifting geopolitical landscape. Despite facing accusations of genocide in the International Court of Justice, Israel has seen a significant rise in arms sales to European countries, with imports of Israeli weaponry increasing dramatically. Nations like Spain, Germany, and Poland have made substantial purchases of Israeli military technology, even as they publicly criticize Israel's actions in Gaza. The article highlights the ethical implications of these arms deals, noting that many European governments continue to engage with Israel despite international treaties aimed at preventing arms transfers that could lead to human rights violations. As Europe prepares for potential conflict, Israel's military technology, tested in occupied territories, becomes increasingly integrated into European defense systems, raising questions about the morality of profiting from such transactions."
  - title: "Jonathan Cook: Attacking a Chant, Aiding a Genocide"
    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/06/30/jonathan-cook-attacking-a-chant-aiding-a-genocide/
    date: 2025-07-01 00:49
    summary: "In a recent article, Jonathan Cook critiques the moral outrage expressed by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the media over a chant by the punk band Bob Vylan at Glastonbury, which called for "Death to the IDF," while ignoring the ongoing violence and alleged genocide perpetrated by the Israeli military against Palestinians in Gaza. Cook argues that the focus on the band's words distracts from the real atrocities committed by the Israeli government, which has been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians, including children. He highlights the hypocrisy of the BBC and the U.K. government, which prioritize condemning symbolic expressions of dissent over addressing the actual violence and suffering inflicted on civilians. Cook suggests that this moral panic serves to obscure the complicity of Western governments and media in Israel's actions, allowing them to evade accountability for their role in the ongoing conflict."
