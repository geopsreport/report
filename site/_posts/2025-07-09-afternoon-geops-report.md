As the global order continues to fragment, recent developments reveal mounting pressures on Western leadership, shifting alliances in the Middle East, and intensifying domestic and international scrutiny of U.S. policy.

**U.S. Policy in the Middle East: Executive Power and Public Dissent**

The expansion of executive authority under President Trump is drawing renewed attention, particularly following his administration’s crackdown on protests in Los Angeles against ICE raids. **Karen J. Greenberg** draws parallels to the 2020 Portland protests, warning that “the normalization of federal intervention in local law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent for civil liberties.” This comes amid heightened public backlash over U.S. support for Israel, with the country’s largest labor union severing ties with the Anti-Defamation League. As reported by **Ray McGovern**, this move challenges the ADL’s influence on Israel-related education and signals a broader shift in institutional attitudes toward the U.S.-Israel relationship.

**Middle East: Iran Deal and Regional Realignment**

Diplomatic maneuvers continue to reshape the Middle East. President Trump’s recent White House dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu finalized an Iran deal intended to consolidate a “New Middle East.” **M.K. Bhadrakumar** notes that this agreement is “aimed at reshaping regional dynamics,” but skepticism remains high regarding its effectiveness and the risk of further escalation. Meanwhile, the aftermath of the U.S.-Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities is still reverberating. **Alastair Crooke** argues that Trump’s approach prioritized “headline-grabbing action over strategic outcomes,” with the attack failing to achieve its intended objectives and potentially fueling further instability.

**Redefining ‘Terrorism’ and Western Policy Flexibility**

A notable shift in U.S. policy language has emerged, with the State Department’s removal of Syria’s Al Qaeda affiliate from its terrorist list. **Caitlin Johnstone** contends that this reflects “the malleability of the term ‘terrorism’ in Western discourse,” allowing it to be deployed or withdrawn to suit shifting geopolitical interests. This move has drawn criticism from analysts who see it as emblematic of broader inconsistencies in U.S. counterterrorism policy.

**Trends and Outlook**

The dominant trends point to growing domestic polarization in the U.S. over Middle East policy, with major institutions and public opinion increasingly at odds with executive decisions. In the region, diplomatic efforts are marked by skepticism and the risk of renewed escalation, as quick-fix strategies fail to deliver stability. The flexible application of terms like “terrorism” further undermines Western credibility. Analysts expect continued volatility, with the potential for both domestic unrest and further regional conflict as the U.S. doubles down on controversial policies amid a rapidly evolving global landscape.
