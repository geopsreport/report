As the global crisis over Gaza continues to reverberate, the last 12 hours have seen new developments in the international security landscape, the politics of information, and the intensifying debate over Western complicity in ongoing conflicts.

**Russia Withdraws from INF Treaty, Escalating Nuclear Tensions**

In a move that has heightened global anxieties, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced Russia’s withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. **Larry C. Johnson** reports that this decision is framed as a direct response to perceived U.S. provocations, signaling a renewed era of nuclear brinkmanship. Analysts warn that the collapse of this key arms control agreement brings the world closer to the threat of nuclear conflict, with both Moscow and Washington now free to develop and deploy intermediate-range missiles previously banned under the treaty. The majority view is that this escalation will further destabilize European security and complicate diplomatic efforts to manage other regional crises.

**Western Media and the Gaza Narrative**

The role of Western media in shaping public understanding of the Gaza crisis remains under scrutiny. **Caitlin Johnstone** criticizes prominent figures such as Piers Morgan for perpetuating misleading narratives and engaging in moral posturing, particularly regarding allegations of genocide and deliberate starvation in Gaza. Johnstone argues that, by August 2025, continued denial of these realities by informed adults is indefensible, and that restrictions on foreign journalists serve to obscure the full extent of the humanitarian disaster. This critique is echoed by a growing chorus of independent analysts who contend that media obfuscation has delayed public reckoning and accountability.

**Dutch Intelligence Labels Israel a ‘State Threat’**

In a significant shift within Europe, the Dutch National Coordinator for Security and Counter-Terrorism (NCTV) has officially classified the Israeli government as a “state threat” in its 2025 threat assessment. **Chris Hedges** highlights that this unprecedented move reflects deepening concerns over the influence of Israeli lobbying on Dutch politics and society. The designation is expected to have far-reaching implications for Dutch-Israeli relations and may embolden other European countries to adopt a more critical stance toward Israel’s policies, particularly in light of the Gaza conflict.

**Trends and Outlook**

The consensus among independent analysts is that the international system is entering a period of heightened instability. Russia’s withdrawal from the INF Treaty and the resulting nuclear tensions are likely to overshadow diplomatic efforts elsewhere, including in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the credibility of Western media and governments continues to erode, both due to their handling of the Gaza crisis and their responses to internal dissent. The Dutch intelligence assessment signals a potential realignment within Europe, with more states possibly reassessing their relationships with Israel. Looking ahead, analysts predict further polarization, increased security risks, and a growing demand for transparency and accountability in both foreign and domestic policy.
