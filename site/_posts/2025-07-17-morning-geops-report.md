As the global order remains unsettled, the past 12 hours have seen new developments in U.S. domestic politics, the ongoing campaign to shape narratives around the Israel-Palestine conflict, and the Western approach to Hezbollah’s military capabilities.

**U.S. Domestic Politics: Trump Faces Backlash from Supporters**

President Donald Trump is experiencing mounting discontent within his own base, particularly among younger supporters. According to **Larry C. Johnson**, Trump’s recent social media post—intended to deflect from the fallout over the Epstein “client list” controversy—has only deepened frustration, with critics accusing him of “mishandling the crisis and making misleading comparisons.” This episode highlights growing fractures within the MAGA movement and signals potential instability in Trump’s political standing as the 2026 election cycle approaches.

**U.S. Teachers Reject Pro-Israel Curriculum**

In a significant move reflecting shifting public sentiment, the National Education Association (NEA) has voted to drop curriculum materials provided by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). **Ray McGovern** reports that the ADL is now appealing to the NEA’s executive committee in an effort to reverse the decision, which was driven by a majority of union delegates. This development underscores a broader trend of resistance to pro-Israel narratives in American institutions and suggests increasing skepticism toward lobbying efforts that seek to influence educational content.

**Hezbollah: U.S. Pursues Targeted Disarmament**

On the international front, the United States continues to refine its approach to Hezbollah in Lebanon. As detailed by **Elijah J. Magnier**, Washington is not seeking the group’s total disarmament, but is instead focusing on the removal of precision-guided missiles and drones—seen as the most acute threat to Israel. This strategy is part of a calculated effort to preserve the regional balance of power while avoiding a broader destabilization of Lebanon. Diplomatic pressure on Lebanese officials is ongoing, but Hezbollah remains resistant, insisting that any agreement must also address Israeli obligations under previous UN resolutions.

**Trends and Outlook**

The majority of analysts agree that U.S. domestic politics are entering a volatile phase, with internal divisions threatening established power bases. In the education sector, resistance to pro-Israel advocacy is gaining momentum, reflecting wider changes in public opinion. Internationally, the U.S. is opting for pragmatic, targeted strategies in the Middle East, though the prospects for diplomatic breakthroughs remain slim amid entrenched positions. Looking ahead, observers expect continued polarization in the U.S., intensifying debates over foreign policy narratives, and persistent instability in key conflict zones.
