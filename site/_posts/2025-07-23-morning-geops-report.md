As the Gaza conflict grinds into its second year and global power realignments accelerate, the past 12 hours have brought new insights into European policy on Gaza, the deepening crisis of governance in Ukraine, and the evolving posture of the BRICS bloc amid Western economic retrenchment.

**Europe’s Stance on Gaza: Profits Over Principles**

Despite widespread public opposition, European governments continue to back Israel’s campaign in Gaza, prioritizing economic and strategic interests over humanitarian concerns. **Medea Benjamin** argues that “Europe is prioritizing profits over the lives of Palestinians,” highlighting a disconnect between official policy and the will of European citizens. This stance is increasingly criticized by analysts as evidence mounts of deliberate starvation and civilian targeting in Gaza. The majority view is that Europe’s alignment with Israeli and U.S. policy is driven by arms sales, energy deals, and broader geopolitical calculations, even as legal and civil society challenges intensify across the continent.

**Ukraine: Power Struggles and Institutional Erosion**

In Ukraine, the internal struggle for power is intensifying as President Zelensky continues to centralize authority. **Larry C. Johnson** notes that Zelensky has appointed Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko as the new prime minister and placed the military-industrial complex under direct Defense Ministry control. This move is widely seen as an effort to sideline rivals and tighten his grip on the government amid ongoing battlefield losses and diplomatic isolation. Analysts warn that these measures, combined with the recent weakening of anti-corruption agencies, signal a slide toward authoritarianism and further instability, with Russia’s military advances compounding Ukraine’s predicament.

**BRICS and the Global Economic Shift**

On the global stage, the BRICS bloc is asserting itself as a counterweight to Western economic dominance. **Patrick Lawrence** observes that Washington’s confrontational approach to BRICS reflects “a lack of historical awareness and understanding,” as the U.S. struggles to adapt to a multipolar world. The consensus among independent analysts is that the BRICS countries, buoyed by growing economic and diplomatic cooperation, are accelerating efforts to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar and build alternative institutions. This trend is expected to further erode Western leverage, especially as domestic austerity and military spending rise in the U.S. and Europe—a dynamic described by **Vijay Prashad** as a “commitment to a future of austerity and conflict.”

**Trends and Outlook**

The prevailing trends point to deepening polarization and instability. Europe’s continued support for Israel, despite public opposition, is fueling domestic unrest and legal challenges. In Ukraine, the centralization of power and erosion of oversight suggest a government under siege, with little prospect for reversal as Russian advances continue. Globally, the rise of BRICS and the shift away from dollar hegemony signal an accelerating transformation of the international order. Most analysts predict that these dynamics will drive further volatility, with few signs of de-escalation or meaningful policy change in the near term.
