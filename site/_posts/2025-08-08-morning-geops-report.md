As the Gaza conflict and global power realignments continue to dominate headlines, the past 12 hours have seen significant new developments in the Gaza crisis, US domestic politics, and the intensifying contest for influence in the Asia-Pacific.

**Gaza: Open Endorsement of Forced Expulsion and Global Solidarity Actions**

The Israeli government has now openly confirmed its intent to pursue total military occupation of Gaza and the forced expulsion of Palestinians, a move previously discussed in covert terms. **Caitlin Johnstone** reports that Prime Minister Netanyahu’s public statements, echoed by President Trump’s endorsement, mark a shift from “covert to overt ethnic cleansing,” with the language of “voluntary migration” being widely condemned as a façade for mass displacement. This escalation has further galvanized international civil society: Italian dockworkers, as noted by **Ray McGovern**, successfully blocked an arms shipment to Israel, and activists from 44 countries are preparing the “largest civilian flotilla in history” to break the Gaza siege, according to **Chris Hedges**. These coordinated actions reflect a rapidly growing global solidarity movement and intensifying pressure on Western governments.

**US Domestic Instability: Political Retaliation and Data Manipulation**

Domestically, the Trump administration’s approach to dissent and data transparency is drawing sharp criticism. **Chris Hedges** highlights two key developments: the firing of Erika McEntarfer, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after she reported unfavorable job numbers, and the administration’s demand for the identities of FBI employees involved in the January 6 investigation. These actions are seen as attempts to suppress inconvenient information and intimidate critics, raising concerns about the erosion of institutional independence and the rule of law.

**Asia-Pacific: US Expands Intelligence Operations to Counter China**

In the Asia-Pacific, the US is stepping up its intelligence presence. **Mick Hall** reports on the expansion of FBI operations in New Zealand, aimed at countering Chinese influence as part of the Five Eyes alliance. This move is interpreted as another example of US interference in regional affairs, heightening tensions with Beijing and underscoring the region’s growing importance in the broader contest for global influence.

**Trends and Outlook**

The convergence of open Israeli policy shifts, mounting global solidarity actions, and signs of US domestic and international assertiveness points to a period of heightened instability and polarization. The majority view among analysts is that Israel’s strategy, now publicly endorsed by the US, will further isolate both countries diplomatically and intensify calls for accountability. Meanwhile, the US’s increasingly aggressive posture—both at home and abroad—signals a willingness to use coercive tools to maintain its position, but also risks backlash and further erosion of legitimacy. The coming weeks are expected to bring intensified activism, greater scrutiny of Western policy, and escalating geopolitical competition in key regions.
