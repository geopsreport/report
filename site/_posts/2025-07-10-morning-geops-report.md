As the global order continues to shift in the aftermath of the Israel-Iran conflict, the past 12 hours have seen new fractures emerge in Western political discourse, further scrutiny of US and UK counterterrorism policy, and intensifying debate over the decline of US influence amid the rise of BRICS and China.

**Western “Terrorism” Labels Under Fire Amid Policy Contradictions**

The credibility of Western counterterrorism designations is facing renewed challenge. **Caitlin Johnstone** highlights that the US has sanctioned UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese for opposing genocide in Gaza, while simultaneously removing Syria’s Al Qaeda affiliate, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, from its terrorist list after its role in regime change. Meanwhile, the UK has designated the nonviolent anti-genocide group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Johnstone argues these moves “make a nonstop insult to our intelligence,” exposing the political expediency and double standards at play. The widespread backlash from activists and civil society underscores growing skepticism about the legitimacy of Western security narratives, especially as Israel continues its controversial operations in Gaza.

**US Domestic Fractures: Labor and Political Power**

Domestically, the US is witnessing significant institutional pushback against pro-Israel advocacy. **Ray McGovern** reports that the largest US labor union has severed ties with the Anti-Defamation League, challenging its long-standing influence over Israel-related curriculum in schools. This move reflects a broader trend of grassroots and labor organizations distancing themselves from traditional pro-Israel lobbying groups, signaling a shift in public sentiment and the potential for increased debate over US policy in the Middle East.

At the same time, concerns about the concentration of political power are mounting. **Chris Hedges** notes that a new Supreme Court case could further empower wealthy donors, exacerbating the disconnect between public interests and elite influence, especially as military spending and foreign policy decisions remain largely insulated from popular dissent.

**US Global Decline and the BRICS Challenge**

On the international stage, the US faces mounting challenges from the expanding BRICS bloc and China’s continued economic ascent. **Richard D. Wolff** argues that the US response to its relative decline is characterized by “denial and victimization narratives,” particularly under Trump’s rhetoric, which distract from deeper structural issues. Wolff warns that this inward turn and reliance on imperialistic threats risk accelerating the US’s self-destruction, especially as BRICS nations consolidate their economic and political influence.

**Trends and Outlook**

The majority of analysts agree that Western credibility is eroding, both at home and abroad, as contradictions in terrorism designations and foreign policy become more apparent. The US is experiencing growing internal dissent, with labor and grassroots organizations challenging established power structures. Internationally, the rise of BRICS and China is reshaping the global balance, while the US struggles to adapt to a multipolar world. Looking ahead, expect continued scrutiny of Western policy double standards, increased activism challenging elite consensus, and further shifts in global alliances away from US-led frameworks.
