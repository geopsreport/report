As global tensions persist across multiple fronts, new developments are highlighting both the volatility of the current geopolitical landscape and the growing skepticism toward Western policies.

**Protests and Public Backlash Against US-Israeli Policy**

As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Trump at the White House, protests erupted outside, with demonstrators accusing Netanyahu of genocide and condemning US complicity. **Norman Solomon** observes that “many Americans are increasingly aware that the mass murder of certain groups is a troubling aspect of U.S. ideology,” especially in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This public dissent reflects a broader shift in US discourse, with independent journalism and activist voices challenging the normalization of indifference toward large-scale violence in the Middle East.

**BRICS Summit Emphasizes Multilateralism Amid Western Pressure**

At the 17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders from the bloc reiterated their commitment to multilateralism and international law, explicitly condemning US trade policies. **Chris Hedges** reports that BRICS nations are calling for “enhanced cooperation and multilateralism to foster a fairer global order,” positioning themselves as a counterweight to Western economic dominance. The summit’s outcomes signal deepening polarization between the US-led bloc and the expanding BRICS alliance, with the latter now representing a significant share of global population and GDP.

**Ukraine Conflict: Stalemate and Diplomatic Deadlock**

Despite multiple phone conversations between President Trump and President Putin since Trump’s return to office, there has been little progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict. **Patrick Lawrence** notes that the situation “reflects a denial of defeat in a war,” with Ukraine and its Western backers maintaining a facade rather than confronting the reality of the stalemate. Meanwhile, **Andrei Martyanov** highlights the dwindling US stockpile of Patriot missiles, raising questions about the sustainability of further military aid.

**Trends and Outlook**

The dominant trends point to a widening gap between Western governments and public opinion, especially regarding US-Israeli policy and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The BRICS bloc’s growing assertiveness and calls for a multipolar order are intensifying global economic and political competition. In Ukraine, diplomatic inertia and resource constraints suggest a prolonged conflict with little prospect for resolution. Analysts anticipate continued volatility, with mounting pressure on Western leaders to address both domestic dissent and the challenges posed by emerging global alliances.
