As the Gaza conflict and broader geopolitical tensions persist, the past 12 hours have seen significant new developments in Israel’s regional strategy, the Ukraine war, and the evolving US-European relationship.

**Israel Expands Covert Relocation Campaign for Gazans**

Fresh reporting confirms that Israel’s intelligence services, under Mossad Director David Barnea, have escalated a secret diplomatic initiative to persuade third countries to accept Palestinians displaced by the Gaza war. **Elijah J. Magnier** details how this campaign follows Egypt’s rejection of resettlement proposals in the Sinai, with critics widely denouncing the effort as “an attempt at ethnic cleansing.” The move is viewed as a shift from military operations to demographic engineering, and signals Israel’s determination to “export the crisis” despite mounting international condemnation.

**Ukraine: Russian Forces Capture British Military Personnel**

In a major development on the Ukraine front, **Larry C. Johnson** reports that Russian special operations forces have captured two active-duty British Army officers—Colonel Edward Blake and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Carroll—along with a British MI-6 agent during a raid in Ohakiv. Multiple sources corroborate the incident, which is likely to heighten tensions between Moscow and London and further complicate Western involvement in the conflict. The capture of serving officers underscores the deepening covert and direct engagement of NATO states in Ukraine.

**US-EU Trade Deal Criticized as One-Sided**

On the diplomatic and economic front, the recently concluded US-EU trade agreement is drawing sharp criticism for its perceived imbalance. **Michael Hudson** argues that the EU has “failed to achieve its goal of negotiating as an equal partner,” resulting in a deal that overwhelmingly favors US interests. This assessment reflects growing European unease about the bloc’s diminishing leverage and the risks of deeper subordination to Washington, especially as economic and security pressures intensify.

**Trends and Outlook**

The dominant trends remain those of polarization and strategic recalibration. Israel’s push to relocate Gazans is intensifying, with little sign of international consensus or effective deterrence. The Ukraine conflict is entering a new phase of direct confrontation between Russian and Western forces, raising the stakes for all parties. Meanwhile, the US-EU relationship is marked by growing European dissatisfaction and questions about the future of transatlantic cooperation. Analysts expect continued diplomatic friction, rising calls for accountability, and persistent challenges to Western influence in shaping global outcomes.
