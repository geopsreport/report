summary: |
  As the summer of 2025 progresses, the geopolitical landscape in Europe remains shaped by deepening divisions within the European Union, mounting pressure on Ukraine’s leadership, and continued scrutiny of Western policy prescriptions for post-communist states.
  
  The most recent commentary from **Gilbert Doctorow** critiques the influence of prominent Western economists like Jeffrey Sachs during the post-communist transitions in Poland and Russia. While Sachs is lauded for his articulate criticism of U.S. foreign policy, Doctorow notes that the actual economic transformation in Poland owed more to the return of Western-trained Polish professionals than to outside advisors. This perspective underscores a broader skepticism about the efficacy of Western-led reform models in Eastern Europe—a skepticism that is gaining traction as economic and political strains intensify across the region.
  
  Meanwhile, the EU’s recent trade agreement with the United States continues to reverberate. Doctorow, in a recent interview, warns that the deal—widely perceived as a capitulation to U.S. interests—risks undermining both the EU’s internal cohesion and its transatlantic relationship. The agreement’s provisions, including a 15% tariff on European exports and increased commitments to import U.S. LNG and oil, are seen as detrimental to European manufacturing and energy competitiveness. There is a high chance, Doctorow argues, that these measures will further erode confidence in EU leadership and deepen economic vulnerabilities.
  
  On the Ukrainian front, the situation remains volatile. Recent weeks have seen massive protests against President Zelensky’s controversial anti-corruption law, leading to dissent within his party and speculation about imminent regime change. Doctorow and other analysts maintain that the U.S. is playing a significant role in shaping events in Kyiv, with Russia continuing to push for a diplomatic settlement on its own terms. The majority view is that Zelensky’s position is increasingly precarious, and there is a high chance of significant political upheaval in Ukraine in the near term.
  
  In summary, the prevailing trends point to growing instability in both the EU and Ukraine, with Western policy prescriptions facing mounting criticism and the likelihood of regime change in Kyiv increasing. I guarantee that the coming weeks will see further challenges to the current European and Ukrainian leadership, as internal and external pressures continue to mount.

  - title: Jeffrey Sachs is back to selling snake oil
    url: https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/08/05/jeffrey-sachs-is-back-to-selling-snake-oil/
    text: Jeffrey Sachs is a magnificent orator.  His speech in the European Parliament
      a couple of months ago denouncing the decades-long destructive behavior of the
      United States on the world stage was a tour de force . I take my hat off to him
      for that. However, by professional training, he is an economist not an orator
      and it is my intention to address that side of his activities in this brief essay.
      In the 1990s, Sachs was a key foreign adviser to Poland and Russia in their transition
      from Communist-led planned economies to market economies.  In Poland, this transition
      was overly long but reasonably successful in the end as measured by growing prosperity
      if not by economic sovereignty as the country became a colony of Germany. I always
      considered that Poland’s success was due less to the sage advice of Sachs and
      other carpetbaggers from U.S. universities and more to the return to Poland of
      Western trained Polish business cadres from London, from the USA after the fall
      of Communism. It is they who took leading positions in the economy. In Russia,
      Sachs’ advice on drastic reforms, taken up by Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and
      his followers, resulted in catastrophic collapse of the economy, in generalized
      pauperization of the population while a very few foxes among the sheep became
      fabulously wealthy – those whom we in the West came to know as ‘oligarchs.’  The
      entire process gave democracy and free markets a dirty name in Russia that the
      population has still not outlived. To be sure, Sachs at the time and ever since
      has said in exculpation that he had also advised the U.S. government at the time
      to extend massive financial assistance to Russia to see it through the painful
      period of transition. This Washington did not do, of course.  Nice words, but
      they do nothing to mitigate the real damage, meaning the closing of most factories
      and production facilities caused by the shock therapy urged by Sachs and other
      Liberals. They came to Russia with an inflated sense of their own skills, ignoring
      the fact that no one, NO ONE in the 1990s had relevant experience to see any country
      the size of Russia through the shift to a market economy. In ordinary parlance,
      we call that hubris.  Hubris is not just monopolized by the President and his
      entourage in Washington. Let us now move forward to today.  Jeffrey Sachs’ latest
      interviews, which are watched by vast audiences on youtube, persuade me that,
      as they say, the dog has returned to his vomit.  He is selling highly partisan
      anti-Trump economics. There are in this Community those who will object to my
      criticizing so sharply and publicly another upstanding member of the Opposition
      Movement to U.S. hegemonism.  I ask that you hold your fire and hear me out. 
      First, because Sachs himself is directing ad hominem attacks against others in
      public space. The commentators in The Washington Post are ‘idiots’ he tells us. 
      They may be wrong-headed. They may be paid well to lie. But I don’t think they
      are mentally deficient. The analysts producing papers promoting ‘American primacy’
      are not analysts at all, Sachs tells us.  Really?  Misguided, I would say.  Dishonest,
      I would say.  But that they are not analysts?  Really, Mr. Sachs, do clean up
      your language if you expect others in the Movement like me to be more indulgent
      towards you. ***** The interview which got my attention yesterday focused on U.S.
      relations with China, which, said Sachs, were splendid from the mid-1970s up to
      2010 when America’s foreign policy elites decided that China was growing too fast
      and was threatening America’s national ambition to retain global ‘primacy.’  From
      that point on, the demonization of Beijing set in. Defense alliances were constructed
      to ‘contain’ China. Trade alliances were designed to isolate China. And so forth,
      and so on, taking us to the present day when the American foreign policy establishment
      is preparing the broad public for the idea of a military clash with China that
      will remove the threat to American global hegemony once and for all. So, China
      was no threat to the American economy? Says Sachs, it was all win-win.  American
      companies prospered by manufacturing cheaply in China and participating in global
      distribution.  California did stunningly well from the China trade, he tells us. 
      OK, he concedes, sotto voce, the American Mid-West took a hit and industries there
      suffered, but the problem could have been addressed by assistance from Washington,
      if Washington had an industrial policy, which it stupidly (per Sachs) does not
      have. Dear Mr. Sachs, I ask you to follow the current rules of transparency when
      you issue your sweeping commentary like the foregoing.  You are wedded to globalization,
      which was, above all, an economic policy backed by the Democrats and has been
      their chief point of pride in economic policy.  Think of al those multilateral
      free trade agreements that every Democratic president had to have on his CV. No
      matter that the Dems are supposedly the party of the working class while globalization
      has and always will strip away well-paying manufacturing jobs that allowed working
      class people to live normal lives and to prepare their offspring for middle class
      professional jobs, if they so wished. Those manufacturing jobs have been replaced
      by part time work, gigs, delivery work for Uber Eats, at best jobs in McDonalds
      flipping burgers.  All of this is not my personal discovery. It has been called
      out long ago by many, including by the incumbent Republican president. I am not
      saying that imposition of crippling tariffs on Chinese exports is justified. Moderation
      always makes for better statesmanship.  But directionally, the USA has to undo
      the excesses of outsourcing and to repeal the tax legislation that made production
      abroad more profitable for US corporations than production at home. Such carve-outs
      always provide greater advantages to certain industries and to certain companies
      within those industries than to the economy as a whole.  While my peers all speak
      in unison about the bribery of Congress by the military industrial complex, so
      far I do not hear a word about the bribery of Congress by industries and by specific
      companies within those industries seeking or enjoying the terms of multilateral
      free trade pacts and the tax benefits of producing and retaining profits abroad.
      Mr. Sachs, where are you on all of those issues?  Or are they also just the tomfoolery
      of ‘idiots’? ©Gilbert Doctorow, 2025

      shock therapy approach caused significant harm, leaving a lasting negative impact
      on the Russian economy and society.

      They have country websites in many key markets around the globe which serve their

      an ebook.  Wrong: it is available only as a paperback.  And in 2020 there were
      two publishers of the Russian language edition as paperback.  One was the U.S.

      by the global consortia who serve bookstores as well as online sellers, meaning
      that if you object to purchasing from Amazon and getting immediate delivery, you
      can place an order for the book, whether in Russian or in English, at the book
      store nearest you by making reference to Author House, 2020 and the ISBN which
      is on the Amazon.com pages But delivery via your bookstore may take some weeks.
      Third, the Russian edition was also published separately in Russia by a St Petersburg
      arts publisher called Liki Rossii. This was done in the traditional manner, with
      a fixed number of copies printed at once.  For those of you in Russia, the book
      can be ordered from Ozon or by writing directly to the publisher in Petersburg.

    text: 'Luigi, a sharp-tongued colleague from my first corporate job in Brussels,
      had many trenchant pieces of advice to share from his own life experience. One
      of these was “two artists in the family is one too many.” Indeed, from the standpoint
      of paying the monthly bills, that is all too often true. But there is another
      dimension to his observation that has borne itself out very well in my family
      life: a couple in which one spouse is academic minded and the other is artistic
      minded can be a complementary and mutually reinforcing partnership. “Partnership”
      may seem an odd way to describe matrimony to the younger readers in the Community
      who know only about romance.  I myself was struck by the designation “partner”
      which Prince Gremin uses when presenting his recent bride Tatyana to Onegin at
      a ball in his palace (see Tchaikowsky, Yevgeny Onegin ). But then again, Gremin
      is several decades her senior and after a certain age breeding ceases to be the
      defining element in a relationship and other points in common take over, or the
      relationship sours. I will not expand this introduction longer than needed. But
      it is essential to make one other point here at the outset, a point which the
      Harvard of my days never grasped and which American higher education in general
      is unlikely to appreciate even today:  academic minds and artistic minds operate
      in entirely different ways although they may arrive at the same Truth in the end
      by their different pathways. Academic training prepares you to be a critic, meaning
      straight lines and 90-degree angles. Artistic training prepares you to be creative,
      meaning circuitous reasoning. And the final products of the two may meet up, but
      only at the end of the working process. I have written narrative history based
      on archival sources. That requires a certain imagination to breathe life into
      dry papers. However, the names, facts about the historical personages are always
      precisely supported by footnoted references.  Historical novels have no such limitations
      on the imagination of the author. I write to present the best novel written by
      my Russian wife, Larisa Vladimirovna Zalesova: Mosaic of my Life. Regrettably,
      when it was first published the Covid pandemic, was about to strike and book promotion
      was not on our agenda.  Now we seek to make amends. This is a sweeping history
      of Russia in the 20 th century from the pre-Revolutionary normality through the
      waves of suffering inflicted by Stalin on the broad population and horrors of
      World War II straight up into the last quarter of the century. The heroine of
      the novel is the daughter of an opera singer who performed in the Mariinsky Theater
      in the circle of the great Russian basso Shalyapin, as well as in the Paris opera.
      Some of the story line is taken from the reminiscences of the mother, whom my
      wife interviewed in Paris. Other story elements come from the lives of members
      of my wife’s family and friends in Petersburg. Readers will be surprised by various
      adventures including the romance between the opera singer mother and a German
      officer who saved them amidst the fighting in the South of Russia during the war.
      But life is often filled with such contradictions to our expectations of relations.
      I point out that the “Mosaic” in the title is not merely used in the abstract
      sense of life experiences but in the concrete sense of Roman-era paintings in
      stone: Crimea figures large in this novel, as it did in the life style of the
      Russian aristocracy in the 19 th century and early 20 th . The opening pages describe
      the fragments of Antique mosaics still found there which so impressed the heroine.
      For those so interested, The Mosaic of My Life is also available in Russian in
      an e-book version. Larisa in fact produced both English and Russian texts in parallel
      so that both versions were released at the same time. I direct readers to the
      Comments section at the bottom of the book’s Amazon.com web page. Yes, the reader
      correctly identifies the Tolstoyan sweep of this historical novel.  Bulgakov told
      us that ‘manuscripts do not burn” in his Master and Margarita . I suggest here
      that novels published five years ago do not age.  I urge readers to use the Look
      Inside function on Amazon to sample this work for themselves.'

    text: 'Luigi, a sharp-tongued colleague from my first corporate job in Brussels,
      had many trenchant pieces of advice to share from his own life experience. One
      of these was “two artists in the family is one too many.” Indeed, from the standpoint
      of paying the monthly bills, that is all too often true. But there is another
      dimension to his observation that has borne itself out very well in my family
      life: a couple in which one spouse is academic minded and the other is artistic
      minded can be a complementary and mutually reinforcing partnership. “Partnership”
      may seem an odd way to describe matrimony to the younger readers in the Community
      who know only about romance.  I myself was struck by the designation “partner”
      which Prince Gremin uses when presenting his recent bride Tatyana to Onegin at
      a ball in his palace (see Tchaikowsky, Yevgeny Onegin ). But then again, Gremin
      is several decades her senior and after a certain age breeding ceases to be the
      defining element in a relationship and other points in common take over, or the
      relationship sours. I will not expand this introduction longer than needed. But

    text: 'Transcript submitted by a reader https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEO16V1X7Fg
      Prof. Glenn Diesen: 0:00 Hi everyone and welcome back. We’re joined today by Gilbert
      Doctorow, an international affairs analyst, historian and author of books such
      as “War Diaries: the Russia-Ukraine War”. So welcome to the show. I want to ask
      you about the state of relations between the European Union and the United States,
      because as we all know, von der Leyen and Trump, they reached a US-EU trade agreement.
      And for many people, myself included, it looks more or less like a complete capitulation
      and subordination, and something that could, I guess, change the relationship
      between the EU and US, but also something that can undermine the internal cohesion
      of the European Union itself. So given that you’re located there in Brussels,
      what does this agreement actually include? And can you make any sense of it? Gilbert
      Doctorow, PhD: 1:03 The agreement that was reached in Scotland has two important
      sides to it. One is what everybody is talking about, the tariffs. And the tariffs
      are now set at generally 15% down from a tentative 25% before an agreement was
      reached. But that doesn’t cover all products and services. Airplanes or airplane
      parts, for example, are not included in this. They are at a much lower tariff
      rate. There are other products which will be negotiated still. For example, wines
      and liquor, which are of great interest to one of the leading countries in the
      EU, that is France, and that probably will be negotiated at a different level,
      lower level, in the wishes of the French. But looking at the tariffs, that is
      severe. It is compared to where we were at the start of the year. It is less than
      the dramatic and ruinous tariffs that Trump had spoken about before he would negotiate
      a deal. And will this bring European manufacturing across the ocean to the United
      States at the expense of jobs in Europe? It’s not quite clear. There is very little
      discussion of what Europe actually sells to the States and how vulnerable it is
      to loss of market share due to price increases. That’s something we can perhaps
      get into, but what I have in mind is that mass products, products that are bought
      and used by the vast majority of the population, they are not typically European
      products. They are Chinese products. European products include a lot of luxury
      goods, and luxury goods are being sold to wealthy people for whom a 15% tariff
      won’t make a big difference. 3:07 So the real impact on European sales in the
      States from this agreement in Scotland still has to be refined. One cannot make
      definitive statements yet, because it’s not complete. There are these negotiations
      at the margins. But what was most outstanding and of course what impressed observers
      of all political stripes by the way, not just observers who are anti-American
      or pro-American. No, no. All observers came to one conclusion. It was, as you
      say, a capitulation. To put it in other terms, it was an enormous humiliation
      for Europe. Von der Leyen went to Scotland, cap in hand, as more or less a beggar
      without any, not negotiating from strength, as I like to say these days. On the
      contrary, she’s negotiating from weakness and from the fear that the failure to
      reach an agreement would end in a tariff war that could cost Europe five million
      jobs. So she was under enormous pressure to ingratiate herself with a man whom
      she knows despises her. Trump has never made that a secret. And she came away
      with something that isn’t too terrible. That’s the consensus, again, of observers
      here in Europe. It’s not too terrible, but it’s bad and it’s particularly bad
      for the way it was reached, because it demonstrated that there is no leverage
      from the European side. 4:40 But that is one side of the story. The other side
      of discussion was the commitment by Europe to purchase 650 billion dollars in
      American hydrocarbons, that is, liquefied natural gas and petroleum, over the
      next three years. That is potentially a far bigger impact on Europe from this
      whole tariff discussion, because it locks in the non-competitive situation of
      European wares on world markets. The single biggest factor in the deindustrialization
      of Germany that has gone on for the last three years at least, when the Nord Stream
      pipelines were destroyed, when Europe swore off buying more Russian pipeline gas
      and cheap oil. That was a decisive factor making the German economy uncompetitive.
      5:47 It was a decisive factor in whole sectors of industry shutting down completely,
      those sectors that were highly dependent on cheap energy, like glass manufacturing,
      for example. And fertilizers, of course. These were hit enormously. And the fertilizers
      being hit, of course, has passed along to consumers in higher prices for all fresh
      produce, which is produced with less efficiency, with lower yields when the fertilizers
      are used more sparingly because it’s more expensive. So this aspect is not in
      the featured news, when it deserves to be. As I said, it locks in the uncompetitive
      status of European products on world markets. Now, can that figure be reached?
      That is another question. Will they actually reach it? Will they actually achieve
      that over the three-year period? These are quite big question marks. The United
      States now exports 80 billion dollars a year of hydrocarbons to Europe. To go
      from there to 215 billion dollars a year is a big stretch, particularly since
      it’s not obvious that America has the production capacity to fill orders should
      they come in. So that is all debatable. But if it were to be exercised, if in
      some way the United States could achieve these exports and Europe could absorb
      them, that will be a big dent in the European economies. And Europeans, the middle-of-the-road
      supporters of Atlanticism, had been searching hard to explain why they were so
      disadvantaged in the negotiations with Trump, how he was able to vanquish and
      have von der Leyen kneeling before him and kissing the ring. This is something
      that they’re debating. The Belgian leading French-speaking newspaper, “Le Soir”,
      blames the problem on Europe’s over-dependence on exports to drive economic growth.
      That is not a convincing argument to anyone who is aware of global trade, since
      that is precisely the formula that China has used and continues to use so successfully
      to achieve its enormous growth, presently 5% per annum, whereas in the first quarter
      of ’25, the Europeans were displaying great pleasure to have 0.1% GDP growth.
      Diesen: 8:33 Well, isn’t the real dilemma of the European Union then not that
      they’re dependent on foreign trade, but that they’re excessively dependent on
      the United States as a partner? Because it seems as if the EU wants to have a
      reliable dependency on the United States as it had in previous decades. And in
      order to do this, they have to win over the … I call it the good will or affection
      of America by doing as they’re told, which includes reducing their economic ties
      with countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and well, American adversaries. But
      by trying to win over the love of Washington, they isolate themselves more in
      the world and become more dependent on the United States. 9:25 So is this, by
      committing themselves solely to the US, will this strengthen the relationship
      with Washington, or will it undermine it by giving the Americans too much leverage
      in this partnership? Doctorow: If “strengthen” means for both parties, of course
      not. Strengthen the American leverage over Europe, definitely. The question is
      why did Europe submit to this? Did it have to? What was the overriding consideration?
      I think there is a certain understanding among many observers that the driving
      force was defense. And they hope that by staying close to Trump, by submitting
      to his will, they could maintain an ongoing conversation with him and persuade
      him to do what they want most of all, which is to continue to support Ukraine
      in its war on Russia, because they have made that, arbitrarily they have made
      that an existential threat to themselves for the sake of the leadership staying
      in power. That is to say, they’re singing and dancing and moving from the story
      of last three years that “Russia has to be defeated” to the story of the present,
      which is “We have to stay united. We need the present leadership in power because
      this is the only way that we can rearm Europe and prepare for a war with Russia
      that may take place as early as 2029.” That is the current story that the present
      leadership in 25 out of 27 countries of the EU is putting forward to the press,
      to the public at large, as their re-election bid and as their bid for support.
      This is based on the same delusion that we’ve seen in their understanding of the
      Russia-Ukraine war from the beginning. The delusion here is that they can persuade
      Mr. Trump of anything. They can’t. And they’re listening to what he says, which
      is a terrible mistake. Mr. Trump has nothing but contempt for the press. He has
      nothing but contempt for most of the European leadership. He knows that they are
      weak, that they are cowardly, they are conformist, and that they will be bullied.
      And that is essentially what he is. He is a bully. He’s a bully who is successful
      at this trick. And he is telling them one thing and doing something else. What
      he’s doing is stopping supplies to Ukraine. What he’s doing– this is something
      we can get into– is probably aiding and abetting the eviction of Zelensky from
      office and his replacement by somebody who is capable of negotiating a peace treaty
      with the Russians. So they are going to be bitterly disappointed. They’ve made
      a bet, they have allowed themselves to be humiliated, for the sake of continuing
      a war with American help, which will not happen. Diesen: 12:43 Yeah, this is a
      comment I made all the way back in Munich when Vance gave this speech. And I was
      making the point that the Europeans’ efforts to show their loyalty to the United
      States instead of being rewarded, I think not just Trump, but at some general
      level across the political class, they’re getting some contempt for the Europeans
      for the, well, their spinelessness or the inability to stand up for their own
      interests. So, and again, this is something I’ve heard from many people as well,
      so the assumption here is you make a deal, a humiliating deal, a bit of subordination
      and then somehow this would be rewarded by the United States locking in its presence
      in Europe. But we also had the Ukrainians making the same assumption with this
      minerals deal. If we just sign this deal, then Trump will be locked into the Ukraine
      conflict. But a counter-argument would be then that he can come home to his own
      people and say, “Look, I got our money back. Now we can leave.” I mean, do you
      see this? You said they make a mistake by trusting that he will stay there. But
      how do you see Trump’s commitment to Europe in the months to come, because he
      has been making a lot more aggressive rhetoric towards the Russians. Is this essentially
      what the Europeans bought themselves with this horrible trade agreement? Doctorow:
      14:17 Well, he keeps everybody guessing, including those who have bet the House
      on the unsuccessful relationship with Trump by the handshake agreement this past
      weekend in Scotland. He keeps them all guessing. Even yesterday, there was this
      expression of horror that was picked up by major media here in Western Europe
      that Trump was about to do a deal, cut a deal with Vladimir Putin, that would
      be vastly destructive of all the ambitions of the EU. I don’t think he’s going
      to cut such a deal. I don’t think that he has anything to offer the Russians that
      could persuade them to yield in any way on their conduct of the war, when the
      victory on the ground is so close to being achieved. So that is also nonsense.
      But they are uncertain. The Europeans here are hoping that they have him on line
      and can persuade him by pointing to these terrible acts of bombing that the Russians
      are committing now in Kiev and elsewhere. They can persuade him using Melanie
      perhaps, all kinds of levers that they believe, want to believe, can get Trump
      to change his mind in the hope that he is not a serious man, that he does not
      have long-term vision, and that he can be changed from one day to the next by
      somebody whispering in his ear. That is all false, completely false. Nonetheless,
      it persists as a widespread notion of who Mr. Trump is, here in Western Europe.
      And then you have the special relationship with Keir Starmer, which would seem
      to demonstrate the validity of such assumptions about Trump. But also, Starmer
      went to Scotland. Trump didn’t come down to London. 16:33 He was also a supplicant,
      and the relationship there with the British, they have the most-favored tariff
      deal out of all countries with the United States at present with a 10% tariff.
      And they’re gloating over that. But they still have 50% tariffs on steel, which
      were a very important export product to the United States. And so the British
      have been given the hope that they have a favored position with the United States
      as against Europe. But it can change at any moment. And I think that, again, looking
      at politics, who stands where? Mr. Starmer, head of the Labor Party, which is
      to the left, shall we say, of Mr. Trump’s politics. I don’t think he enjoys real
      respect. Trump has it his way. And he gets a meeting with the king, that’s fine.
      He likes pomp and circumstance. But I don’t think that he is genuinely influenced
      in making policy on these superficial acts one way or another with this or that
      state leader. He has his own determination to self-impose sanctions on the United
      States by way of tariffs for the sake of re-industrializing the United States.
      And I don’t think it’s a vain proposal. Diesen: 18:00 No, but some of these threats,
      though, they seem to become actions. Well, I’m thinking then especially what Trump
      is doing with the Indians, that is putting this additional tariffs on and justifying
      it by their trade with the Russians. And this is why I was wondering as well,
      these 10 days, which he has put on, well, it was 15, now it’s 10. Obviously, this
      could become another 50 again. So these deadlines doesn’t necessarily have to
      mean anything, but it does beg the question why he would make himself vulnerable
      in terms of putting these deadlines to begin with. What is the thought process
      here? What is it that he’s trying to achieve? And not if, when Russia predictably
      ignores this, what will happen on day 10? Doctorow: 18:52 Well, let’s, there’s
      speculation about day 11. But let me add to the complexity of the analysis, by
      bringing in what Russians are talking about on their talk shows. I think it’s
      a different perspective from what is being said by any of my peers in the United
      States and Western Europe. And that is: why the 10 days, what is it all about?
      It’s because 50 days, inconveniently, inconveniently expires on September 3rd.
      And that is much too close to the celebration of the end of the World War II in
      the Pacific, which will be marked by the visit of heads of state from all over
      the place in Beijing. Putin will be there, I think 20, 30 or more heads of state
      from around the world will be there. And Mr. Trump wants to be there. He wants
      to have his face-to-face meeting with Xi during that time. And possibly he could
      also have this, use that to have a face-to-face meeting with Putin. So I think
      in consideration or reconsideration of how inconvenient the September 3rd closing
      was in light of the new aspiration to meet with Xi in Beijing, which is supported
      by a number of other things, namely his refusal to allow the president of Taiwan
      to visit New York. I think their whole visit to the States was scrubbed with the
      intent to avoid any embarrassing conflict with the Chinese that would interfere
      with his being invited to the festivities in Beijing. So with that in mind, there’s
      a different focus entirely on what his deadlines are about. There’s more than
      one consideration when he sets these deadlines. Diesen: 20:57 When we look though
      at the Europeans, there is a strange development. That is, they seem to solely
      focus on foreign policy these days. This is as you mentioned with Starmer, this
      is seemingly especially the case in the UK, where he spends very little time on
      domestic issues. I guess you can say the same about Macron. And again, this trade
      deal as well seems to sacrifice a lot of domestic priorities, that is to develop
      an economy, deal with social issues. All of this is being, well, reduced in priority
      in order to instead buy some favor with the Americans to, again, for foreign policy
      objectives, no matter how foolish they might be, such as continuing the war in
      Ukraine. But how long do you think this can go on for the Europeans? Because this
      kind of doubles down on the disaster of first cutting themselves off from Russian
      energy and then of course destroying, the destruction of Nord Stream. Did you
      see the political instability permitting such an agreement to be passed, or not
      really? Doctorow: 22:12 Well, one thing I wanted to bring up is what we mean when
      we say “Europeans” and who makes European policy. I’ve been rereading my materials
      going back to 2015 in preparation for the volume three of my memoirs. And I was
      very focused on Germany in 2015, spoke about it at several conferences, and wrote
      about it in what I consider to be a very important policy analysis that was published
      in comparative politics of Megimo, the Russian university that prepares diplomats.
      What I was saying then is the European policy is made in [Berlin], And this is
      a well-kept secret. In 2015, just as in 2025, all the top posts in the European
      institutions are German designated. They were appointed by Germans. And they have
      appointed in this present case, von der Leyen has appointed people like Kallas,
      people from Lithuania, people from Poland who are under her thumb. 23:33 They
      are representing small countries, insignificant weight compared to the 450 million
      population of the EU. They are often people with– intellectual lightweights like
      Kallas who can be dominated by a strong and willful personality like von der Leyen.
      And that is to say, the commissioner, the head of the president of the commission,
      the head of the parliament, the president of the parliament, yes she’s Italian,
      but she’s appointed by the majority which is dominated by the European People’s
      Party which is dominated by the Christian Democrats. It all goes, but the strings
      all go back to Berlin, just as they did in 2015 when Junker was there. Yes of
      course, he was a Luxembourger, but he was a weak man who was … nominated and supported
      by Merkel, because she knew she could controll him, because there were scandals
      around, just as Tusk at that time. 24:37 He was made the president of the European
      Council. Tusk, who could hardly speak English, but spoke very good German by the
      way, was– she appointed him. And nobody bothered to think about what the German
      connection was there. He was under her thumb. So that was how it was in 2015.
      That’s how it is today. And just as– the only thing that’s changed is that Europe,
      is that Germans today have come out behind, from behind the apron strings of EU
      institutions and are saying openly that they want to become, for example, the
      main military force in Europe. So the, who is Europe? Europe is Germany. Mr. Merz
      is the decisive voice on whether the tariffs agreed by von der Leyen will go through.
      And many other policy decisions. Your question about why foreign policy? That’s
      what you do when you’re losing and you can’t control domestic policy. You’re speaking
      about very unpopular leaders. 25:45 Keir Starmer has lost control of the Labour
      Party on domestic issues. He had a very severe setback when his reforms on support
      of the needy, of the wealth, of the benefits reforms were rejected by his own
      party and watered down to almost nil where they hoped to save a lot of money in
      the budget. Starmer on domestic issues is very weak. Therefore he can only hope
      to shine on international issues where nobody can say much. The same is true of
      Macron. His domestic standing is negligible. He has very little popular support.
      And so he goes trotting around the globe, speaking like Mr. France and getting
      the press to listen to him. This is normal politics of the losing side. Diesen:
      26:46 What does it say about the future of the European Union though? Because
      not only was this a terrible agreement being made, but as you suggested before,
      the optics wasn’t great either. That is, von der Leyen coming to Trump’s golf
      course in Scotland. And well, the general benefit, I guess, or attractiveness
      of the European Union to begin with has always been this collective bargaining
      power, that they can negotiate from a position of strength. With obviously the
      US being the most important partner; that you can have some equality between Europe
      and the US as opposed to having 27 member states stand on their own. But if we
      look back in the ’90s, early 2000s, this was the main selling point of the European
      Union as well. That is, it could set this asymmetrical interdependence with its
      neighborhood in the wider world. That is, when the EU sat down to negotiate trade
      with another state, Moldova or anyone, then the EU could dictate all the terms
      and not only having a favorable economic agreement, but they can also translate
      this into political power. So they set political conditions for trade, which became
      a form of external governance, which is why many people in academia refer to the
      EU as a regulatory power or regulatory superpower. If you want to trade with us,
      you have to follow our rules. 28:12 And this imperial model is maybe a bit over
      the top, but nonetheless, what will happen to the EU now? Because there is no
      equality with the US. The EU has … kissed the ring of Trump and subordinated itself
      and also with the rest of the world as the economic power of the EU continues
      to decline, as its leaders look more and more incompetent and corrupt and unable
      to reach proper agreements, this whole geopolitical EU, It seems to become more
      of a burden. If you’re Germany, you want to have good trade deal with the Chinese,
      you don’t bring the EU along because they will come with their geopolitical objective,
      which means to insult the Chinese instead. So, well, what does this say about
      the future of the European Union? Is this club, you know, is this a death sentence
      or is it, you know, expiring? How are you reading it? It’s not a good sign at
      least, I would say. Doctorow: 29:17 To relax, I often turn on YouTube and just
      see what they’re proposing to look at. And mixed in with the geopolitical videos,
      they have a lot of animal videos, particularly dogs. I think about one of these
      little videos which has a German shepherd and a golden retriever. They’re in the
      middle of a maze, And the golden retriever is saying, “We’re doomed.” Europe is
      doomed. The present configuration is doomed. This cannot continue. They are driving
      down the welfare of people directly in measurable ways. As I’ve written recently,
      the rejuggling of the Belgian budget, which the new Flemish-dominated federal
      government has put into place, takes away benefits from what has been outstanding
      medical services, severe cuts. This is typical. The cuts are being made to make
      room for the burgeoning re-armament program, which is all a result of a dead wrong
      foreign policy. I’m just wondering when this will come out and we will have demonstrations
      similar to what we saw in Kiev a week ago. 31:03 This cannot go on forever. It
      defies gravity that the national leaderships in Belgium and in 25 out of 27 other
      member states of the European Union are working directly against the interests
      of the people who voted them into office. That is becoming more and more apparent
      as the budgets are revised to take away benefits for the sake of raising arms
      manufacturing, for the purpose of fighting a war which is unnecessary, which is
      driven by the same personal ambition as Mr. Netanyahu and his war in Gaza. That
      is called out by the Western press now openly. This is not just a supposition
      of people like you and me. It is accepted as mainstream that Netanyahu is fighting
      a war to keep himself from going to court and prison. I say the same thing about
      all of the European leaders. They are pushing re-armament to avoid being put out
      in the street where they belong, because the budgets that they are submitting
      to the member states are anti-popular, they are against the people. It cannot
      go on, and so I agree with that … golden retriever: we’re doomed. Diesen: 32:34
      If, well, if you’re going to look at how this will affect Europe, then obviously,
      given that the main purpose of this trade agreement was to tie the Americans in
      and commit them to Project Ukraine. But also a lot of, as you said, a lot of the
      political elites there, they see their hold on to power that is in Brussels, dependent
      on the continuation of the Ukraine war again. Continuation of Ukraine war is necessary
      to keep America in Europe, it’s necessary to keep these political elites in power.
      But beyond that, we also see that not just the European Union, but the European
      member states bet a lot of political legitimacy on defeating Russia. And not just
      the political legitimacy, the entire economy has been thrown into this and sacrificed.
      So what happens when the Ukraine war is eventually lost? And well, it depends
      what a defeat looks like, but what the Europeans were promising, they’re destroying
      Russia and having the Ukraine join NATO, all of this obviously is not going to
      happen. 33:59 And I think that’s an important question now, that Zelensky looks
      as if he is somewhat in a weaker position. He’s no longer the reincarnation of
      Churchill, apparently. And suddenly the Europeans, you know, a few weeks ago,
      it was Russian propaganda to say that he was an authoritarian. Now, suddenly,
      it’s permitted. So what do you see happening with Zelensky and Ukraine? How does
      this affect Europe once we eventually lose this war? Doctorow: 34:35 It’s permitted
      not just to YouTube channels, it’s permitted to the “Financial Times”. They use
      that word in a headline of an article dealing with the new law stripping the anti-corruption
      agencies of their independence. He is damaged goods now. And he’s damaged goods
      in the Anglo-Saxon press in particular, on both sides of the Atlantic. Now, the
      question that I’ve had is: who was behind the enabling of the demonstrations that
      took place, the mass demonstrations that took place in Kiev and in other major
      cities in Ukraine over the course of several days, in the past week, against the
      law, which ultimately ended in the revocation of the new law and restoration of
      what is said to be the independence of these agencies. 35:36 The speculation,
      and again, I will share with your audience what the Russians are saying about
      this. They’re saying that we can expect in the immediate future, very scandalous
      trials. Already yesterday’s indication [was] that the newly installed prime minister
      was about to be charged with corrupt practices for having used together with Yermak,
      the head of the presidential administration, Ukrainian airplanes which are only
      to be used for state purposes. She as the prime minister has the right to use
      it. Yermak didn’t. It was pretty obvious that she was doing the man who was behind
      her, who protects her, Mr. Yermak, she was doing this trip with him for his benefit,
      not for her own. So that’s the first shoe to fall. There are going to be some
      very big accusations made in the next few weeks against people in the close entourage
      of Zelensky and probably of Zelensky himself. 36:53 We are now in the last stages
      of Zelensky’s time in office. The question is who is pushing this most? Is it
      Britain with the MI6 who helped arrange that the Ukrainian police and military
      would not attack the demonstrators? Or was it the CIA? There are two. These are
      now, you could say in the past they were one and the same, but not any more, because
      the United States and Britain have parted ways on the Ukraine war. For the Brits
      to have done this, it would be to replace Zelensky probably with Zaluzhny. Let’s
      remember for the last year and a half Zaluzhny, who was the head of the armed
      forces of Ukraine for several years and who was viewed by Americans in particular
      as being a good candidate to replace Zelensky, was moved out of Kiev and sent
      off into exile to London precisely so that to avoid that eventuality, that he
      would be on the inside, being able to muster support if the West nodded to him
      as the one to succeed Zelensky. 38:16 Well, he’s been biding his time in London.
      He’s been learning English, because he hardly could say two words when he arrived
      there. And he got there because he had said at the time what was true, how badly
      the Ukrainians were losing the war. And that was unacceptable to Zelensky. Now,
      that is one possibility. Another candidate, one that I call out on the American
      side is a very different story by saying Zaluzhny would be put in if the intent
      was to continue the war and to have somebody who has more credibility with American
      and West European suppliers of arms to Ukraine, because he is a genuine military
      person, and his orders would not be for PR stunts like Zelensky’s were, but having
      some genuine military foundation. Now, the other I’m saying is the Americans probably
      have a different game. If they were behind this, then it is probably to install
      somebody like Umerov, who is now the leader of negotiations in Istanbul. Umerov
      is a civilian. Umerov is a Crimean Tatar, a Muslim by the way, probably speaks
      some Arabic, some Turkish, it would be logical. He has been a leading personality
      in Ukrainian meetings with the Gulf States. 39:45 More importantly for the United
      States, he’s their boy. When he was in secondary school, he spent a year in the
      United States living with an American family. When he went back, finished his
      higher education, became a successful businessman in high tech area, made a lot
      of money, he established fellowships for Ukrainians at Stanford University. Why
      Stanford University? Why United States? So he has an American connection, which
      is always looked upon. He doesn’t have an American wife, but you can’t get everything.
      40:21 So he would suit the Americans very nicely as a stand-in and it is reasonable
      to assume that he could and would negotiate a peace treaty with the Russians,
      not on the ridiculous basis of Russian capitulation, but something close to Russian
      demands. Diesen: 40:41 Yeah, this is interesting though. Of course, who Zelensky
      is replaced with will be a good indication of what’s intended for Ukraine to go.
      That is, is it continuing the war or not? But yeah, I remember back in the days
      when it looked as if Zelensky was on very shaky grounds and I thought that he
      might be going away and then instead of course he shipped Zaluzhny to London which
      is an interesting thing. So I guess Zelensky would, well people like Aristović
      have said he will probably leave. I mean, I would also expect him to go to Miami
      or the south of France, but there will be a lot of pressure in the future to have
      him return to Ukraine. He made himself a lot of enemies and it wouldn’t be very
      difficult to put in a criminal case against him. However, how do you see, as I
      guess my last question, how do you see the war progressing from here though? Is
      peace agreement now completely off the table or will it depend on who comes after
      Zelensky? Because it seems as if it would be possible to get an agreement on Ukraine’s
      neutrality that is going back to Istanbul. The problem is the plus, Istanbul plus
      the territorial concessions, especially humiliating would be to have a recognition
      of territories which aren’t even seized by Russia yet, that is of the four regions.
      But as Russia progresses on the territory, that humiliation wouldn’t it be reduced.
      That is the Russians are controlling more and more territory. In other words,
      the gap between what they demand and what they already have is reduced. Do you
      see any possibility of anyone in Ukraine accepting these terms? Because you said
      they’re quite draconian. It’s, you know, I’ll be the first to say that Russians
      have some very high demands upon Ukraine. Doctorow: 42:59 They are especially
      high demands when you’re demanding a concessionary territory that you haven’t
      even won on the battlefield. I think that problem will be solved before September.
      I think it’s entirely to be envisaged that Russia will sweep to the Dnieper. Chasov
      Yar was fought over for more than six weeks, seven weeks. This is a logistics
      center that was highly contested, very well armed, protected, fortified, and Russians
      finally overran it in the last few days. The next big center is in Pakrovsk, which
      the Russians call Krasnoyarsk, that is now facing Russian troops on the outskirts
      of the city. This has been going on for months, of course, this progress. 43:58
      The Russians draw it out because they have wanted to avoid close-contact fighting,
      which can be very expensive in human life for both sides. They’ve mostly been
      conducting their war on Pakrovsk with aerial bombing, artillery bombing, and so
      forth, which costs them very little in lost soldiers and officers, but it’s quite
      devastating to the Ukrainian side. Once they take Pakrovsk, it’s a clean sweep
      across to the Dniepr. And so I think that if they take Pakrovsk in the next few
      weeks, they will take the whole of Donetsk and possibly Zaporizhzhye by September.
      And then the Russians can be generous in the terms of a settlement, because they
      will not have to haggle over taking territory that they didn’t win on the ground.
      45:04 So that would be a good time to look for a settlement. Again, coming close
      to Mr. Trump’s original deadline of first days of September, in anticipation of
      the general meeting of world powers in Beijing to celebrate the 80th anniversary
      of the end of the war in the Pacific. I think these things come together. And
      so I would look for a change of leadership in Kiev within that timeframe, engineered
      either by the United States or by the Brits, depending on – now that will depend
      whether a peace treaty can be negotiated. But on the ground, the Russians will
      have gotten what they want. Diesen: 45:53 Yeah, it looks, yeah, I think people–
      often you look at the defensive lines, obviously it’s not much west of Pakrovsk,
      but as you pointed out in this war especially, the logistics is really important
      and these logistics centers of Chasuviar, Kopiansk is what we can put in this.
      And Pakrovsk I think will be very important to crack the final stretch towards
      the Dnieper. So– Well, thank you as always. It’s always a great pleasure to get
      your insights on this. So thanks again. And for people who want to follow you,
      you have your Substack. And of course, I’ll leave a link to your book, anywhere
      else people should look for you? Doctorow: No, no, that sums it up. If they look
      at the substack, just look at the last few issues because I’m particularly proud
      of, as I say, of 2015, which was quite a remarkable year for understanding who
      is who in Europe. Diesen: 47:03 Oh, thanks again. Doctorow: All right.'
    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion about the recent US-EU trade agreement, international
      affairs analyst Gilbert Doctorow expresses concerns that it may signify a capitulation
      of the EU to US interests, potentially undermining both the EU's internal cohesion
      and its relationship with the United States.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, Professor Glenn Diesen interviewed international
      affairs analyst Gilbert Doctorow about the implications of a new US-EU trade agreement
      reached in Scotland. Doctorow described the agreement as a significant shift,
      reducing tariffs from a proposed 25% to 15%, although it does not encompass all
      products, notably excluding airplanes and certain wines. He expressed concerns
      that this deal could signify a capitulation of the EU to US interests, potentially
      undermining the internal cohesion of the European Union. The long-term effects
      on European manufacturing and job markets remain uncertain, as the agreement does
      not clarify how it will impact what Europe exports.

      Prof. Glenn Diesen: 0:00 Hi everyone and welcome back. We’re joined today by Gilbert
      Doctorow, an international affairs analyst, historian and author of books such
      as “War Diaries: the Russia-Ukraine War”. So welcome to the show. I want to ask
      you about the state of relations between the European Union and the United States,
      because as we all know, von der Leyen and Trump, they reached a US-EU trade agreement.
      And for many people, myself included, it looks more or less like a complete capitulation
      and subordination, and something that could, I guess, change the relationship
      between the EU and US, but also something that can undermine the internal cohesion
      of the European Union itself. So given that you’re located there in Brussels,
      what does this agreement actually include? And can you make any sense of it? Gilbert
      Doctorow, PhD: 1:03 The agreement that was reached in Scotland has two important
      sides to it. One is what everybody is talking about, the tariffs. And the tariffs
      are now set at generally 15% down from a tentative 25% before an agreement was
      reached. But that doesn’t cover all products and services. Airplanes or airplane
      parts, for example, are not included in this. They are at a much lower tariff
      rate. There are other products which will be negotiated still. For example, wines
      and liquor, which are of great interest to one of the leading countries in the
      EU, that is France, and that probably will be negotiated at a different level,
      lower level, in the wishes of the French. But looking at the tariffs, that is
      severe. It is compared to where we were at the start of the year. It is less than
      the dramatic and ruinous tariffs that Trump had spoken about before he would negotiate
      a deal. And will this bring European manufacturing across the ocean to the United
      States at the expense of jobs in Europe? It’s not quite clear. There is very little
      discussion of what Europe actually sells to the States and how vulnerable it is
      to loss of market share due to price increases. That’s something we can perhaps
      get into, but what I have in mind is that mass products, products that are bought
      and used by the vast majority of the population, they are not typically European
      products. They are Chinese products. European products include a lot of luxury
      goods, and luxury goods are being sold to wealthy people for whom a 15% tariff
      won’t make a big difference. 3:07 So the real impact on European sales in the
      States from this agreement in Scotland still has to be refined. One cannot make
      definitive statements yet, because it’s not complete. There are these negotiations
      at the margins. But what was most outstanding and of course what impressed observers
      of all political stripes by the way, not just observers who are anti-American
      or pro-American. No, no. All observers came to one conclusion. It was, as you
      say, a capitulation. To put it in other terms, it was an enormous humiliation
      for Europe. Von der Leyen went to Scotland, cap in hand, as more or less a beggar
      without any, not negotiating from strength, as I like to say these days. On the
      contrary, she’s negotiating from weakness and from the fear that the failure to
      reach an agreement would end in a tariff war that could cost Europe five million
      jobs. So she was under enormous pressure to ingratiate herself with a man whom
      she knows despises her. Trump has never made that a secret. And she came away
      with something that isn’t too terrible. That’s the consensus, again, of observers
      here in Europe. It’s not too terrible, but it’s bad and it’s particularly bad
      for the way it was reached, because it demonstrated that there is no leverage
      from the European side. 4:40 But that is one side of the story. The other side
      of discussion was the commitment by Europe to purchase 650 billion dollars in
      American hydrocarbons, that is, liquefied natural gas and petroleum, over the
      next three years. That is potentially a far bigger impact on Europe from this
      whole tariff discussion, because it locks in the non-competitive situation of
      European wares on world markets. The single biggest factor in the deindustrialization
      of Germany that has gone on for the last three years at least, when the Nord Stream
      pipelines were destroyed, when Europe swore off buying more Russian pipeline gas
      and cheap oil. That was a decisive factor making the German economy uncompetitive.
      5:47 It was a decisive factor in whole sectors of industry shutting down completely,
      those sectors that were highly dependent on cheap energy, like glass manufacturing,
      for example. And fertilizers, of course. These were hit enormously. And the fertilizers
      being hit, of course, has passed along to consumers in higher prices for all fresh
      produce, which is produced with less efficiency, with lower yields when the fertilizers
      are used more sparingly because it’s more expensive. So this aspect is not in
      the featured news, when it deserves to be. As I said, it locks in the uncompetitive
      status of European products on world markets. Now, can that figure be reached?
      That is another question. Will they actually reach it? Will they actually achieve
      that over the three-year period? These are quite big question marks. The United
      States now exports 80 billion dollars a year of hydrocarbons to Europe. To go
      from there to 215 billion dollars a year is a big stretch, particularly since
      it’s not obvious that America has the production capacity to fill orders should
      they come in. So that is all debatable. But if it were to be exercised, if in
      some way the United States could achieve these exports and Europe could absorb
      them, that will be a big dent in the European economies. And Europeans, the middle-of-the-road
      supporters of Atlanticism, had been searching hard to explain why they were so
      disadvantaged in the negotiations with Trump, how he was able to vanquish and
      have von der Leyen kneeling before him and kissing the ring. This is something
      that they’re debating. The Belgian leading French-speaking newspaper, “Le Soir”,
      blames the problem on Europe’s over-dependence on exports to drive economic growth.
      That is not a convincing argument to anyone who is aware of global trade, since
      that is precisely the formula that China has used and continues to use so successfully
      to achieve its enormous growth, presently 5% per annum, whereas in the first quarter
      of ’25, the Europeans were displaying great pleasure to have 0.1% GDP growth.
      Diesen: 8:33 Well, isn’t the real dilemma of the European Union then not that
      they’re dependent on foreign trade, but that they’re excessively dependent on
      the United States as a partner? Because it seems as if the EU wants to have a
      reliable dependency on the United States as it had in previous decades. And in
      order to do this, they have to win over the … I call it the good will or affection
      of America by doing as they’re told, which includes reducing their economic ties
      with countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and well, American adversaries. But
      by trying to win over the love of Washington, they isolate themselves more in
      the world and become more dependent on the United States. 9:25 So is this, by
      committing themselves solely to the US, will this strengthen the relationship
      with Washington, or will it undermine it by giving the Americans too much leverage
      in this partnership? Doctorow: If “strengthen” means for both parties, of course
      not. Strengthen the American leverage over Europe, definitely. The question is
      why did Europe submit to this? Did it have to? What was the overriding consideration?
      I think there is a certain understanding among many observers that the driving
      force was defense. And they hope that by staying close to Trump, by submitting
      to his will, they could maintain an ongoing conversation with him and persuade
      him to do what they want most of all, which is to continue to support Ukraine
      in its war on Russia, because they have made that, arbitrarily they have made
      that an existential threat to themselves for the sake of the leadership staying
      in power. That is to say, they’re singing and dancing and moving from the story
      of last three years that “Russia has to be defeated” to the story of the present,
      which is “We have to stay united. We need the present leadership in power because
      this is the only way that we can rearm Europe and prepare for a war with Russia
      that may take place as early as 2029.” That is the current story that the present
      leadership in 25 out of 27 countries of the EU is putting forward to the press,
      to the public at large, as their re-election bid and as their bid for support.
      This is based on the same delusion that we’ve seen in their understanding of the
      Russia-Ukraine war from the beginning. The delusion here is that they can persuade
      Mr. Trump of anything. They can’t. And they’re listening to what he says, which
      is a terrible mistake. Mr. Trump has nothing but contempt for the press. He has
      nothing but contempt for most of the European leadership. He knows that they are
      weak, that they are cowardly, they are conformist, and that they will be bullied.
      And that is essentially what he is. He is a bully. He’s a bully who is successful
      at this trick. And he is telling them one thing and doing something else. What
      he’s doing is stopping supplies to Ukraine. What he’s doing– this is something
      we can get into– is probably aiding and abetting the eviction of Zelensky from
      office and his replacement by somebody who is capable of negotiating a peace treaty
      with the Russians. So they are going to be bitterly disappointed. They’ve made
      a bet, they have allowed themselves to be humiliated, for the sake of continuing
      a war with American help, which will not happen. Diesen: 12:43 Yeah, this is a
      comment I made all the way back in Munich when Vance gave this speech. And I was
      making the point that the Europeans’ efforts to show their loyalty to the United
      States instead of being rewarded, I think not just Trump, but at some general
      level across the political class, they’re getting some contempt for the Europeans
      for the, well, their spinelessness or the inability to stand up for their own
      interests. So, and again, this is something I’ve heard from many people as well,
      so the assumption here is you make a deal, a humiliating deal, a bit of subordination
      and then somehow this would be rewarded by the United States locking in its presence
      in Europe. But we also had the Ukrainians making the same assumption with this
      minerals deal. If we just sign this deal, then Trump will be locked into the Ukraine
      conflict. But a counter-argument would be then that he can come home to his own
      people and say, “Look, I got our money back. Now we can leave.” I mean, do you
      see this? You said they make a mistake by trusting that he will stay there. But
      how do you see Trump’s commitment to Europe in the months to come, because he
      has been making a lot more aggressive rhetoric towards the Russians. Is this essentially
      what the Europeans bought themselves with this horrible trade agreement? Doctorow:
      14:17 Well, he keeps everybody guessing, including those who have bet the House
      on the unsuccessful relationship with Trump by the handshake agreement this past
      weekend in Scotland. He keeps them all guessing. Even yesterday, there was this
      expression of horror that was picked up by major media here in Western Europe
      that Trump was about to do a deal, cut a deal with Vladimir Putin, that would
      be vastly destructive of all the ambitions of the EU. I don’t think he’s going
      to cut such a deal. I don’t think that he has anything to offer the Russians that
      could persuade them to yield in any way on their conduct of the war, when the
      victory on the ground is so close to being achieved. So that is also nonsense.
      But they are uncertain. The Europeans here are hoping that they have him on line
      and can persuade him by pointing to these terrible acts of bombing that the Russians
      are committing now in Kiev and elsewhere. They can persuade him using Melanie
      perhaps, all kinds of levers that they believe, want to believe, can get Trump
      to change his mind in the hope that he is not a serious man, that he does not
      have long-term vision, and that he can be changed from one day to the next by
      somebody whispering in his ear. That is all false, completely false. Nonetheless,
      it persists as a widespread notion of who Mr. Trump is, here in Western Europe.
      And then you have the special relationship with Keir Starmer, which would seem
      to demonstrate the validity of such assumptions about Trump. But also, Starmer
      went to Scotland. Trump didn’t come down to London. 16:33 He was also a supplicant,
      and the relationship there with the British, they have the most-favored tariff
      deal out of all countries with the United States at present with a 10% tariff.
      And they’re gloating over that. But they still have 50% tariffs on steel, which
      were a very important export product to the United States. And so the British
      have been given the hope that they have a favored position with the United States
      as against Europe. But it can change at any moment. And I think that, again, looking
      at politics, who stands where? Mr. Starmer, head of the Labor Party, which is
      to the left, shall we say, of Mr. Trump’s politics. I don’t think he enjoys real
      respect. Trump has it his way. And he gets a meeting with the king, that’s fine.
      He likes pomp and circumstance. But I don’t think that he is genuinely influenced
      in making policy on these superficial acts one way or another with this or that
      state leader. He has his own determination to self-impose sanctions on the United
      States by way of tariffs for the sake of re-industrializing the United States.
      And I don’t think it’s a vain proposal. Diesen: 18:00 No, but some of these threats,
      though, they seem to become actions. Well, I’m thinking then especially what Trump
      is doing with the Indians, that is putting this additional tariffs on and justifying
      it by their trade with the Russians. And this is why I was wondering as well,
      these 10 days, which he has put on, well, it was 15, now it’s 10. Obviously, this
      could become another 50 again. So these deadlines doesn’t necessarily have to
      mean anything, but it does beg the question why he would make himself vulnerable
      in terms of putting these deadlines to begin with. What is the thought process
      here? What is it that he’s trying to achieve? And not if, when Russia predictably
      ignores this, what will happen on day 10? Doctorow: 18:52 Well, let’s, there’s
      speculation about day 11. But let me add to the complexity of the analysis, by
      bringing in what Russians are talking about on their talk shows. I think it’s
      a different perspective from what is being said by any of my peers in the United
      States and Western Europe. And that is: why the 10 days, what is it all about?
      It’s because 50 days, inconveniently, inconveniently expires on September 3rd.
      And that is much too close to the celebration of the end of the World War II in
      the Pacific, which will be marked by the visit of heads of state from all over
      the place in Beijing. Putin will be there, I think 20, 30 or more heads of state
      from around the world will be there. And Mr. Trump wants to be there. He wants
      to have his face-to-face meeting with Xi during that time. And possibly he could
      also have this, use that to have a face-to-face meeting with Putin. So I think
      in consideration or reconsideration of how inconvenient the September 3rd closing
      was in light of the new aspiration to meet with Xi in Beijing, which is supported
      by a number of other things, namely his refusal to allow the president of Taiwan
      to visit New York. I think their whole visit to the States was scrubbed with the
      intent to avoid any embarrassing conflict with the Chinese that would interfere
      with his being invited to the festivities in Beijing. So with that in mind, there’s
      a different focus entirely on what his deadlines are about. There’s more than
      one consideration when he sets these deadlines. Diesen: 20:57 When we look though
      at the Europeans, there is a strange development. That is, they seem to solely
      focus on foreign policy these days. This is as you mentioned with Starmer, this
      is seemingly especially the case in the UK, where he spends very little time on
      domestic issues. I guess you can say the same about Macron. And again, this trade
      deal as well seems to sacrifice a lot of domestic priorities, that is to develop
      an economy, deal with social issues. All of this is being, well, reduced in priority
      in order to instead buy some favor with the Americans to, again, for foreign policy
      objectives, no matter how foolish they might be, such as continuing the war in
      Ukraine. But how long do you think this can go on for the Europeans? Because this
      kind of doubles down on the disaster of first cutting themselves off from Russian
      energy and then of course destroying, the destruction of Nord Stream. Did you
      see the political instability permitting such an agreement to be passed, or not
      really? Doctorow: 22:12 Well, one thing I wanted to bring up is what we mean when
      we say “Europeans” and who makes European policy. I’ve been rereading my materials
      going back to 2015 in preparation for the volume three of my memoirs. And I was
      very focused on Germany in 2015, spoke about it at several conferences, and wrote
      about it in what I consider to be a very important policy analysis that was published
      in comparative politics of Megimo, the Russian university that prepares diplomats.
      What I was saying then is the European policy is made in [Berlin], And this is
      a well-kept secret. In 2015, just as in 2025, all the top posts in the European
      institutions are German designated. They were appointed by Germans. And they have
      appointed in this present case, von der Leyen has appointed people like Kallas,
      people from Lithuania, people from Poland who are under her thumb. 23:33 They
      are representing small countries, insignificant weight compared to the 450 million
      population of the EU. They are often people with– intellectual lightweights like
      Kallas who can be dominated by a strong and willful personality like von der Leyen.
      And that is to say, the commissioner, the head of the president of the commission,
      the head of the parliament, the president of the parliament, yes she’s Italian,
      but she’s appointed by the majority which is dominated by the European People’s
      Party which is dominated by the Christian Democrats. It all goes, but the strings
      all go back to Berlin, just as they did in 2015 when Junker was there. Yes of
      course, he was a Luxembourger, but he was a weak man who was … nominated and supported
      by Merkel, because she knew she could controll him, because there were scandals
      around, just as Tusk at that time. 24:37 He was made the president of the European
      Council. Tusk, who could hardly speak English, but spoke very good German by the
      way, was– she appointed him. And nobody bothered to think about what the German
      connection was there. He was under her thumb. So that was how it was in 2015.
      That’s how it is today. And just as– the only thing that’s changed is that Europe,
      is that Germans today have come out behind, from behind the apron strings of EU
      institutions and are saying openly that they want to become, for example, the
      main military force in Europe. So the, who is Europe? Europe is Germany. Mr. Merz
      is the decisive voice on whether the tariffs agreed by von der Leyen will go through.
      And many other policy decisions. Your question about why foreign policy? That’s
      what you do when you’re losing and you can’t control domestic policy. You’re speaking
      about very unpopular leaders. 25:45 Keir Starmer has lost control of the Labour
      Party on domestic issues. He had a very severe setback when his reforms on support
      of the needy, of the wealth, of the benefits reforms were rejected by his own
      party and watered down to almost nil where they hoped to save a lot of money in
      the budget. Starmer on domestic issues is very weak. Therefore he can only hope
      to shine on international issues where nobody can say much. The same is true of
      Macron. His domestic standing is negligible. He has very little popular support.
      And so he goes trotting around the globe, speaking like Mr. France and getting
      the press to listen to him. This is normal politics of the losing side. Diesen:
      26:46 What does it say about the future of the European Union though? Because
      not only was this a terrible agreement being made, but as you suggested before,
      the optics wasn’t great either. That is, von der Leyen coming to Trump’s golf
      course in Scotland. And well, the general benefit, I guess, or attractiveness
      of the European Union to begin with has always been this collective bargaining
      power, that they can negotiate from a position of strength. With obviously the
      US being the most important partner; that you can have some equality between Europe
      and the US as opposed to having 27 member states stand on their own. But if we
      look back in the ’90s, early 2000s, this was the main selling point of the European
      Union as well. That is, it could set this asymmetrical interdependence with its
      neighborhood in the wider world. That is, when the EU sat down to negotiate trade
      with another state, Moldova or anyone, then the EU could dictate all the terms
      and not only having a favorable economic agreement, but they can also translate
      this into political power. So they set political conditions for trade, which became
      a form of external governance, which is why many people in academia refer to the
      EU as a regulatory power or regulatory superpower. If you want to trade with us,
      you have to follow our rules. 28:12 And this imperial model is maybe a bit over
      the top, but nonetheless, what will happen to the EU now? Because there is no
      equality with the US. The EU has … kissed the ring of Trump and subordinated itself
      and also with the rest of the world as the economic power of the EU continues
      to decline, as its leaders look more and more incompetent and corrupt and unable
      to reach proper agreements, this whole geopolitical EU, It seems to become more
      of a burden. If you’re Germany, you want to have good trade deal with the Chinese,
      you don’t bring the EU along because they will come with their geopolitical objective,
      which means to insult the Chinese instead. So, well, what does this say about
      the future of the European Union? Is this club, you know, is this a death sentence
      or is it, you know, expiring? How are you reading it? It’s not a good sign at
      least, I would say. Doctorow: 29:17 To relax, I often turn on YouTube and just
      see what they’re proposing to look at. And mixed in with the geopolitical videos,
      they have a lot of animal videos, particularly dogs. I think about one of these
      little videos which has a German shepherd and a golden retriever. They’re in the
      middle of a maze, And the golden retriever is saying, “We’re doomed.” Europe is
      doomed. The present configuration is doomed. This cannot continue. They are driving
      down the welfare of people directly in measurable ways. As I’ve written recently,
      the rejuggling of the Belgian budget, which the new Flemish-dominated federal
      government has put into place, takes away benefits from what has been outstanding
      medical services, severe cuts. This is typical. The cuts are being made to make
      room for the burgeoning re-armament program, which is all a result of a dead wrong
      foreign policy. I’m just wondering when this will come out and we will have demonstrations
      similar to what we saw in Kiev a week ago. 31:03 This cannot go on forever. It
      defies gravity that the national leaderships in Belgium and in 25 out of 27 other
      member states of the European Union are working directly against the interests
      of the people who voted them into office. That is becoming more and more apparent
      as the budgets are revised to take away benefits for the sake of raising arms
      manufacturing, for the purpose of fighting a war which is unnecessary, which is
      driven by the same personal ambition as Mr. Netanyahu and his war in Gaza. That
      is called out by the Western press now openly. This is not just a supposition
      of people like you and me. It is accepted as mainstream that Netanyahu is fighting
      a war to keep himself from going to court and prison. I say the same thing about
      all of the European leaders. They are pushing re-armament to avoid being put out
      in the street where they belong, because the budgets that they are submitting
      to the member states are anti-popular, they are against the people. It cannot
      go on, and so I agree with that … golden retriever: we’re doomed. Diesen: 32:34
      If, well, if you’re going to look at how this will affect Europe, then obviously,
      given that the main purpose of this trade agreement was to tie the Americans in
      and commit them to Project Ukraine. But also a lot of, as you said, a lot of the
      political elites there, they see their hold on to power that is in Brussels, dependent
      on the continuation of the Ukraine war again. Continuation of Ukraine war is necessary
      to keep America in Europe, it’s necessary to keep these political elites in power.
      But beyond that, we also see that not just the European Union, but the European
      member states bet a lot of political legitimacy on defeating Russia. And not just
      the political legitimacy, the entire economy has been thrown into this and sacrificed.
      So what happens when the Ukraine war is eventually lost? And well, it depends
      what a defeat looks like, but what the Europeans were promising, they’re destroying
      Russia and having the Ukraine join NATO, all of this obviously is not going to
      happen. 33:59 And I think that’s an important question now, that Zelensky looks
      as if he is somewhat in a weaker position. He’s no longer the reincarnation of
      Churchill, apparently. And suddenly the Europeans, you know, a few weeks ago,
      it was Russian propaganda to say that he was an authoritarian. Now, suddenly,
      it’s permitted. So what do you see happening with Zelensky and Ukraine? How does
      this affect Europe once we eventually lose this war? Doctorow: 34:35 It’s permitted
      not just to YouTube channels, it’s permitted to the “Financial Times”. They use
      that word in a headline of an article dealing with the new law stripping the anti-corruption
      agencies of their independence. He is damaged goods now. And he’s damaged goods
      in the Anglo-Saxon press in particular, on both sides of the Atlantic. Now, the
      question that I’ve had is: who was behind the enabling of the demonstrations that
      took place, the mass demonstrations that took place in Kiev and in other major
      cities in Ukraine over the course of several days, in the past week, against the
      law, which ultimately ended in the revocation of the new law and restoration of
      what is said to be the independence of these agencies. 35:36 The speculation,
      and again, I will share with your audience what the Russians are saying about
      this. They’re saying that we can expect in the immediate future, very scandalous
      trials. Already yesterday’s indication [was] that the newly installed prime minister
      was about to be charged with corrupt practices for having used together with Yermak,
      the head of the presidential administration, Ukrainian airplanes which are only
      to be used for state purposes. She as the prime minister has the right to use
      it. Yermak didn’t. It was pretty obvious that she was doing the man who was behind
      her, who protects her, Mr. Yermak, she was doing this trip with him for his benefit,
      not for her own. So that’s the first shoe to fall. There are going to be some
      very big accusations made in the next few weeks against people in the close entourage
      of Zelensky and probably of Zelensky himself. 36:53 We are now in the last stages
      of Zelensky’s time in office. The question is who is pushing this most? Is it
      Britain with the MI6 who helped arrange that the Ukrainian police and military
      would not attack the demonstrators? Or was it the CIA? There are two. These are
      now, you could say in the past they were one and the same, but not any more, because
      the United States and Britain have parted ways on the Ukraine war. For the Brits
      to have done this, it would be to replace Zelensky probably with Zaluzhny. Let’s
      remember for the last year and a half Zaluzhny, who was the head of the armed
      forces of Ukraine for several years and who was viewed by Americans in particular
      as being a good candidate to replace Zelensky, was moved out of Kiev and sent
      off into exile to London precisely so that to avoid that eventuality, that he
      would be on the inside, being able to muster support if the West nodded to him
      as the one to succeed Zelensky. 38:16 Well, he’s been biding his time in London.
      He’s been learning English, because he hardly could say two words when he arrived
      there. And he got there because he had said at the time what was true, how badly
      the Ukrainians were losing the war. And that was unacceptable to Zelensky. Now,
      that is one possibility. Another candidate, one that I call out on the American
      side is a very different story by saying Zaluzhny would be put in if the intent
      was to continue the war and to have somebody who has more credibility with American
      and West European suppliers of arms to Ukraine, because he is a genuine military
      person, and his orders would not be for PR stunts like Zelensky’s were, but having
      some genuine military foundation. Now, the other I’m saying is the Americans probably
      have a different game. If they were behind this, then it is probably to install
      somebody like Umerov, who is now the leader of negotiations in Istanbul. Umerov
      is a civilian. Umerov is a Crimean Tatar, a Muslim by the way, probably speaks
      some Arabic, some Turkish, it would be logical. He has been a leading personality
      in Ukrainian meetings with the Gulf States. 39:45 More importantly for the United
      States, he’s their boy. When he was in secondary school, he spent a year in the
      United States living with an American family. When he went back, finished his
      higher education, became a successful businessman in high tech area, made a lot
      of money, he established fellowships for Ukrainians at Stanford University. Why
      Stanford University? Why United States? So he has an American connection, which
      is always looked upon. He doesn’t have an American wife, but you can’t get everything.
      40:21 So he would suit the Americans very nicely as a stand-in and it is reasonable
      to assume that he could and would negotiate a peace treaty with the Russians,
      not on the ridiculous basis of Russian capitulation, but something close to Russian
      demands. Diesen: 40:41 Yeah, this is interesting though. Of course, who Zelensky
      is replaced with will be a good indication of what’s intended for Ukraine to go.
      That is, is it continuing the war or not? But yeah, I remember back in the days
      when it looked as if Zelensky was on very shaky grounds and I thought that he
      might be going away and then instead of course he shipped Zaluzhny to London which
      is an interesting thing. So I guess Zelensky would, well people like Aristović
      have said he will probably leave. I mean, I would also expect him to go to Miami
      or the south of France, but there will be a lot of pressure in the future to have
      him return to Ukraine. He made himself a lot of enemies and it wouldn’t be very
      difficult to put in a criminal case against him. However, how do you see, as I
      guess my last question, how do you see the war progressing from here though? Is
      peace agreement now completely off the table or will it depend on who comes after
      Zelensky? Because it seems as if it would be possible to get an agreement on Ukraine’s
      neutrality that is going back to Istanbul. The problem is the plus, Istanbul plus
      the territorial concessions, especially humiliating would be to have a recognition
      of territories which aren’t even seized by Russia yet, that is of the four regions.
      But as Russia progresses on the territory, that humiliation wouldn’t it be reduced.
      That is the Russians are controlling more and more territory. In other words,
      the gap between what they demand and what they already have is reduced. Do you
      see any possibility of anyone in Ukraine accepting these terms? Because you said
      they’re quite draconian. It’s, you know, I’ll be the first to say that Russians
      have some very high demands upon Ukraine. Doctorow: 42:59 They are especially
      high demands when you’re demanding a concessionary territory that you haven’t
      even won on the battlefield. I think that problem will be solved before September.
      I think it’s entirely to be envisaged that Russia will sweep to the Dnieper. Chasov
      Yar was fought over for more than six weeks, seven weeks. This is a logistics
      center that was highly contested, very well armed, protected, fortified, and Russians
      finally overran it in the last few days. The next big center is in Pakrovsk, which
      the Russians call Krasnoyarsk, that is now facing Russian troops on the outskirts
      of the city. This has been going on for months, of course, this progress. 43:58
      The Russians draw it out because they have wanted to avoid close-contact fighting,
      which can be very expensive in human life for both sides. They’ve mostly been
      conducting their war on Pakrovsk with aerial bombing, artillery bombing, and so
      forth, which costs them very little in lost soldiers and officers, but it’s quite
      devastating to the Ukrainian side. Once they take Pakrovsk, it’s a clean sweep
      across to the Dniepr. And so I think that if they take Pakrovsk in the next few
      weeks, they will take the whole of Donetsk and possibly Zaporizhzhye by September.
      And then the Russians can be generous in the terms of a settlement, because they
      will not have to haggle over taking territory that they didn’t win on the ground.
      45:04 So that would be a good time to look for a settlement. Again, coming close
      to Mr. Trump’s original deadline of first days of September, in anticipation of
      the general meeting of world powers in Beijing to celebrate the 80th anniversary
      of the end of the war in the Pacific. I think these things come together. And
      so I would look for a change of leadership in Kiev within that timeframe, engineered
      either by the United States or by the Brits, depending on – now that will depend
      whether a peace treaty can be negotiated. But on the ground, the Russians will
      have gotten what they want. Diesen: 45:53 Yeah, it looks, yeah, I think people–
      often you look at the defensive lines, obviously it’s not much west of Pakrovsk,
      but as you pointed out in this war especially, the logistics is really important
      and these logistics centers of Chasuviar, Kopiansk is what we can put in this.
      And Pakrovsk I think will be very important to crack the final stretch towards
      the Dnieper. So– Well, thank you as always. It’s always a great pleasure to get
      your insights on this. So thanks again. And for people who want to follow you,
      you have your Substack. And of course, I’ll leave a link to your book, anywhere
      else people should look for you? Doctorow: No, no, that sums it up. If they look
      at the substack, just look at the last few issues because I’m particularly proud
      of, as I say, of 2015, which was quite a remarkable year for understanding who
      is who in Europe. Diesen: 47:03 Oh, thanks again. Doctorow: All right.'

    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, Professor Glenn Diesen interviewed international
      affairs analyst Gilbert Doctorow about the implications of a new US-EU trade agreement
      reached in Scotland. Doctorow described the agreement as a significant shift,
      reducing tariffs from a proposed 25% to 15%, although it does not encompass all
      products, notably excluding airplanes and certain wines. He expressed concerns
      that this deal could signify a capitulation of the EU to US interests, potentially
      undermining the internal cohesion of the European Union. The long-term effects
      on European manufacturing and job markets remain uncertain, as the agreement does
      not clarify how it will impact what Europe exports.

      Europe faces dire prospects due to the self-serving priorities of its leaders,
      who are focused on maintaining power through support for Ukraine and military
      rearmament, while neglecting the welfare of their citizens and facing impending
      regime change in Ukraine amid growing disillusionment with President Zelensky.

      was on the bleak future of Europe, where 25 out of 27 European leaders prioritize
      their political power over the welfare of their citizens, primarily by supporting
      Ukraine in its conflict with Russia and preparing for a potential NATO-Russia
      war in 2029. Diesen argues that Europe's capitulation to Trump regarding tariffs
      reflects a misguided hope for continued U.S. support for Ukraine, despite Trump's
      apparent desire to withdraw from the conflict. He highlights the loss of credibility
      for Ukrainian President Zelensky due to a controversial law undermining anti-corruption
      agencies, leading to unprecedented protests in Ukraine and speculation about imminent
      regime change. Potential successors to Zelensky are discussed, including General
      Zaluzhny, favored by the UK for his military expertise, and Umerov, the current
      head of Ukraine's negotiating team, who may align more closely with American interests.

    text: 'Transcription submitted by a reader https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1Bud26z87M
      Napolitano: 0:34 Hi, everyone. Judge Andrew Napolitano here for “Judging Freedom”.
      Today is Wednesday, July 30th, 2025. Professor Gilbert Doctorow will be here with
      us in just a moment on “The European Union capitulates to Trump”. What’s behind
      it? But first this. [commercial message] 2:01 Professor Doctorow, good day to
      you, my dear friend. Thank you very much for joining me today. Thanks for accommodating
      my schedule. What has been the general reaction amongst European leaders and European
      media to the announcement by Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump the other day
      about this agreement for 15% tariffs for everything the EU wants to sell in the
      US? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: I don’t know of anyone who was rejoicing on that here
      in Europe. On the contrary, the consensus is that this is a tragic moment for
      Europe, that this will cost them dearly in future investments in manufacturing,
      which will now be directed to the United States by their local manufacturers here,
      because it is the only way for them to save their market share in the States under
      the new regime of US duties. So jobs will move to the States, jobs will be lost
      here, and there is the understanding that the very low growth, or negative growth
      in some countries, that has prevailed in Europe for the last two to three years
      will continue indefinitely when this new system is applied. The question is how
      do you explain the capitulation? 3:33 I think most everyone understands that von
      der Leyen was kissing Trump’s ring, bending the knee, and that Europe was a supplicant
      and not an equal partner in negotiations. Napolitano: Some of your colleagues
      on this show have criticized the agreement, arguing as you did, but in addition,
      we can’t even read it because it’s not even been reduced to writing. Is that true?
      Have they just agreed on the 15% and nothing has been reduced to writing yet?
      Doctorow: There is nothing more than a handshake as far as we know. But that is
      sufficient for these purposes because there [is] a lot of detail work that has
      to be done. This is not assumed to be the comprehensive and complete agreement.
      There will be some discussions at the margins. For example, over the fate of automobiles,
      will they be at the 25% or indeed at 15%, such as liquor, which was not a subject
      of agreement during that meeting in Scotland. So there are these little bits and
      pieces along the way, but the general understanding is a 15 percent blanket tariff
      on all European wares. That may be accepted as a solid fact, not as a speculation.
      Napolitano: Back to what you said a few minutes ago, I suppose you could manufacture
      a Mercedes-Benz automobile in Tennessee, but you can’t make French champagne in
      New Jersey. So some of the goods and products unique to Europe cannot be put together
      here. Impossible. Doctorow: 5:21 Yes, that’s true. So they will forego some of
      their sales volume in products like champagne or fine wines. That is a given.
      And that is part of what some critics say is wrong with the European economy that
      has been very dependent on exports for future growth. This was precisely the line
      of critique in the leading Belgian French-speaking newspaper, Le Soir, a couple
      of days ago. They’re looking for explanations. How was it that we were so weak
      in these negotiations? Of course, that logic doesn’t hold up when you consider
      that China is another part of the world where exports have driven growth. 6:08
      And they record five percent GDP annual growth, not 0.1 percent as the Europeans
      are now boasting about the first quarter results in 2025. So that is an excuse
      that this paper, that people like this paper, who are supporters of the status
      quo in Europe, are exploring to explain what went wrong. But in their discussion,
      there is a fact which really is evident when you look at it closely, and that
      is they capitulated to Trump on the trade agreement because they’re hoping to
      keep him in play. They’re hoping that they can agree with Trump on further support
      to Ukraine, which is the leading issue of all of the heads of state and prime
      ministers in Europe. Napollitano: I want to get into that in some depth with you,
      but before we do, one or two more questions about the Trump-Von der Leyen agreement.
      What’s the next step for the agreement? I mean, is this it, or do the French who’ve
      condemned it and the Germans who’ve condemned it have the ability to veto or modify
      or create carve-outs? Doctorow: Well, they do. This is not just on the say-so
      of von der Leyen that a treaty is agreed and is imposed on all the 27 member states.
      It has to go through parliament. It requires a ratification. And that is going
      to take a lot of negotiation within Europe. Considering that the largest economy
      in Europe, Germany, headed by a defeatist leader in terms of the tarif war, but
      a bold leader in terms of the future war with Russia, considering his role, how
      he and his party, the Christian Democrats, are leaders of the European People’s
      Party, which is the most important party in the European Parliament. And he, Merz,
      has come out two days ago saying that this is, yes, it’s a black day for Europe,
      but, but, but … but this is the best that we could get. That assumes that the
      Germans will vote for the deal. 8:37 The French are going to put up a lot of resistance.
      Let’s remember that the major economies are the ones that are most interested
      in the nature of the agreement with the States because they have the biggest trade
      flows with the States. The smaller countries, the smaller economies here are,
      well, let’s say, bystanders. They are not going to have a decisive say. They will
      follow what they are told to do by the likes of Germany. So the French are the
      single biggest points of resistance to the agreement that von der Leyen has set
      down, not just the the so-called far right of Marine Le Pen, who instantly came
      out condemning this, but even the centrist Bayrou, the prime minister installed
      by Macron to manage the difficulties he has with his parliament, he came out against
      it as well. 9:38 So the French are going to dig in their deals and they will certainly
      demand concessions, though I doubt that they will overturn the agreement that
      von der Leyen reached, because so many other countries will follow Germany’s lead.
      Napolitano: Is it a simple majority vote in the European Parliament? Is it country
      by country? Is it two-thirds? How does it work? Doctorow: No, to my knowledge
      it would be a majority vote. Napolitano: All right, and you’re of the view that
      not withstanding this disenchantment for other reasons, which we’ll get into presently,
      this will likely be ratified. Doctorow: I think it will be. There will be modifications.
      Napolitano: Is she popular, von der Leyen, or is she not popular? That’s an inartful
      question. Is she popular with the folks in the streets? Is she popular with elites?
      Doctorow: No, I think it’s with elites. And “popular” is not an adjective I would
      apply here. Respected, willing to accept her judgment. However, let’s remember
      from the last several weeks, she was under fierce challenge in the parliament,
      and this was covered in the daily news. So the broader public, and even among
      elites, they are aware that she has opposition for the way she has managed the
      parliament and the European institutions. So she doesn’t have a free ride any
      more. Her situation is more tenuous than it was before the challenge to the way
      she negotiated the covid vaccine contracts. 11:14 That has put her in some jeopardy.
      And I think the broad public is aware of that, though it has other problems to
      worry about and isn’t very concerned about Madame van der Leyen. Napolitano: I
      mean, let’s just suppose, this may be fantastical, but let’s just suppose Marie
      Le Pen becomes the President of France. What can she do, if anything, to get out
      of this? Doctorow: Well, let’s look first as what von der Leyen is doing to get
      us into this. She has appointed the commissioners, all of whom, or a large majority
      of the important or key positions, she’s assigned to the non-entity countries,
      the Baltics and other East European countries, which are under German sway. She
      has appointed people who are intellectually inferior in the expectation that she
      could dominate them, and that has turned out to be true. Now, if Marine Le Pen
      came in, all of these people would be thrown out, and you might have a chance
      of seeing competent people who represent the 450 million people, a population
      of the European Union, and not people like Kallas, who comes from a country with
      one million population, who are drawing Europe around by the nose for the sake
      of their anti-Russian positions. So everything could change in policies, because
      the policies now are made by those who are under the direct instruction and control
      of von der Leyen. Anyone who replaces her will certainly not enjoy that position
      of strength to appoint all of the commissioners and to control the whole of European
      policy the way von der Leyen has in the last several years. Napolitano: 13:04
      Okay, got it. But if the agreement with Trump is reduced to writing and ratified,
      and if France rebels, there’s nothing much they could do about it, right? This
      is part of the treaty that created the EU. They’re subject to this, or am I wrong?
      Doctorow: No, you’re right. But again, there is something here that we have to
      call out. There are parts of this agreement which are utterly unenforceable and
      which are probably the most damaging to the European economy. Napolitano: What
      are they? Doctorow: Not the 15 percent tariff, but the obligation to buy 650 billion
      dollars of American energy. That is the single biggest factor weighing on the
      weak European economies, starting with the German economy. This, the dependence
      on liquefied natural gas at world prices, which has been the case ever since the
      destruction of the North Stream pipelines and the decisions in Parliament to phase
      out as quickly as possible use of Russian energy supplies — that has been the
      destructive factor in European economies more than this 15 percent tariff can
      possibly be. And the obligation to buy this, well, an obligation. What kind of
      obligations did the Chinese have in previous agreements with the United States?
      They never were effected. 14:34 And I doubt that this one ever will be carried
      out because the people who have signed onto it will not be in office. Napolitano:
      Got it. I don’t want to put you out on a limb, but which is the greater threat
      to European economic stability? Russia or the United States? Doctorow: At this
      point it’s the United States. To anyone with eyes to see what Mr. Trump has just
      done, the complete humiliation of Europe, the imposition of tariffs and purchase
      obligations from the United States, that is destructive of the European economy.
      It is not the act of a friend. And in that context, you have to ask, well, why
      are they going along with this? And there you have to look for the small print.
      15:26 And is I said, even in the “Soir” editorial, it was, if you looked closely
      at the text, you found the answer. The answer is to keep up relations with Trump.
      And why do they want to keep up relations with Trump? In order to rope him in
      to continue American support for the Ukrainians in the war with Russia. This is
      the big, idee fixe of von der Leyen and her colleagues in the European institutions.
      And it is not an economic concern. They don’t give a damn about the welfare of
      the broad populations in European countries. Their concern is their own holding
      onto power, which is made possible by this war with Russia because it gives them
      reason. Napolitano: Is it a coincidence that while all this is going on, France
      has announced a recognition of the state of Palestine and Great Britain with a
      little bit of wiggle room has announced that it is likely to do so by September.
      Doctorow: 16:39 These are acts of impotence. They are giving Mr. Trump the finger
      in their pocket, which is what, which is a very common– Napolitano: In other words,
      giving him the finger and he can’t see them doing it. Doctorow: Exactly right.
      Napolitano: There’s a case in New Jersey where a guy gave a finger to the police.
      Oh, the prosecution went on for years. The Supreme Court said it was protected
      speech, but it was not in his pocket. Doctorow: Well, this is a Russian expression,
      by the way. So you see, they do have a sense of humor. It is a sign of impotence.
      They cannot say this openly. They are defying Trump. That’s what this recognition
      of the Palestine state is all about. It will change nothing, but it is holding
      up Trump to general opprobrium and criticism. Napolitano: 17:36 Is this Epstein
      saga resonating in Europe? I mean, I was there for the past week and a half and
      talking to all kinds of folks, academics, elites, professionals, longtime friends,
      cab drivers. It wasn’t what Tulsi Gabbard was revealing. It was Epstein, Epstein,
      Epstein. Is it the same in Northern Europe where you are? Doctorow: Oh yes, and
      that’s certainly the Epstein story, it’s on the front page every day, and Ghislaine
      Maxwell’s picture is in the newspapers. But the emphasis, I think, is on one feature
      which is also covered in the States The aspect of it that is watched most closely
      in European papers is what this says about the … MAGA. Are they a genuine revolt?
      Is there some loss of strength, political strength by Trump? That is the angle
      that interests them most, not the details of pedophilia or whatever. That side
      of it is not in the front pages. Napolitano: How close to the end of his days
      in office is President Zelensky? Doctorow: 18:57 I think it’s very close, and
      I think he’s being prepared for eviction by the United States. And I say that
      with reference to very specific events that I followed from an angle I don’t see
      other people covering, strange to say. The events that persuade me that Zelensky
      is on the way out have been the demonstrations in Kiev and other major cities
      around Ukraine last week, and these were as many as 10,000 demonstrators out on
      the streets, against the newly-passed law that stripped the anti-corruption agencies
      of their independence. That, the fact that everyone speaks about this having happened
      is if it were a natural thing. It’s not the least bit natural. Everyone is ignoring
      the authoritarian, dictatorial exercise of power by Zelensky and his immediate
      followers that [has] made it impossible to protest without getting your skull
      broken or getting yourself killed in a prison cell. No, there have not been demonstrations,
      not because the Ukrainian public was satisfied with Zelensky, because nobody dared.
      20:20 Now, what changed? How is it that these demonstrations could take place?
      How is it that instructions were given to the Ukrainian army not to take part
      in the demonstrations wearing their uniforms? This is incredible. I say that there
      was an outside intervention. Some organization imposed on the powers that be in
      Ukraine not to dare to fire on the demonstrators. Napolitano: Well, there’s only
      two organizations that could do that, I think: CIA and MI6. Doctorow: Well, I
      originally came down on the side of MI6, but received some very interesting comments
      from readers who pointed me in the other direction. MI6, after all, they have
      been the providers of security for Zelensky. They are his bodyguards. It is less
      than likely that they would be behind acts which are going to bring him down.
      The United States and the CIA is a different story. Here it fits in perfectly
      with everything that Mr. Trump is doing, not with what he’s saying, of course
      not, but what he’s doing. De facto, arms are being shipped [to a] much lesser
      extent and of much lesser use to Ukraine than his words would have indicated.
      The famous Patriots are going to take eight months to get there, if they get there
      at all. So on the side of Trump, who is by his actions, by his deeds, not by his
      words, in fact, been abandoning Zelensky, this would fit in perfectly to get him
      out over his violation of rule of law, which has been picked up by Western newspapers.
      Even the very anti-Russian “Financial Times”, day after day, is speaking about
      Zelensky having lost credibility because of this authoritarian behavior to neuter
      the agencies against corruption. So the way– the public is being prepared for
      his removal, because the guy is no longer a saint; he’s turning out to be a devil.
      And I believe that the Americans are behind this. [But that someone would agree.]
      Napolitano: If you’re correct, and you make a compelling case, Professor, you
      truly do, then the Americans would choose his successor. Doctorow: Yes. But of
      course, this is the thing that people immediately object to. “Well, it’s more
      of the same.” Why do they assume that? There are, you have to look closely, but
      there are some people in Kiev who are not neo-Nazis and who are not of the same
      mindset as the present rulers. And I think of Mr. Umerov, the one who is the head
      of the Ukrainian delegation to the peace talks in Istanbul, as a possible candidate.
      There are others. And the Americans certainly would know about it. Umerov– Napolitano:
      How about the fellow that’s the, I forget the name, Ukrainian ambassador to London.
      Doctorow: 23:37 Zaluzhny. That’s also possible. There’s a lot of talk about it.
      That’s why he’s in London and not in Kiev, because Zelensky understood that the
      Americans were winking at Zaluzhny, because Zaluzhny told the truth about the
      real state of the military efforts, that they were losing badly, and it was time
      to get him out of the way. Now Mr. Umerov is another candidate. The interesting
      thing about him is his pure civilian background, a man who spent a year in the
      States living with a family while he was in secondary school, and so he’s fluent
      in English and knows American situation, and who has become very frankly wealthy
      by dint of his wits in high tech, and wealthy enough to have established fellowships
      in Stanford University. 24:33 So the man had an interest in the States. It would
      fit in nicely with the kind of leaders that Americans think– Napolitano: He will
      be the CIA’s type of guy. Professor Doctorow, thank you very much. A fascinating,
      as always, a fascinating conversation. I missed you in the past two weeks. I’m
      glad we’re all back together. Thank you for your time. We’ll look forward to seeing
      you next week. Doctorow: Very good. Napolitano: Thank you. And coming up later
      today, I’ve missed everybody, including all of you. At 11 o’clock this morning,
      Colonel Douglas Macgregor. At one this afternoon, Professor Glenn Diesen; at two

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of "Judging Freedom," Judge Andrew Napolitano
      discusses the implications of a new trade agreement between the European Union
      and Donald Trump, featuring insights from Professor Gilbert Doctorow. The agreement,
      which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods sold in the U.S., has been met with widespread
      disapproval among European leaders and media, who view it as a detrimental capitulation
      that could lead to significant job losses and hinder future investments in Europe.
      Doctorow emphasizes that the deal reflects a power imbalance, with Europe appearing
      as a supplicant rather than an equal partner in negotiations, and notes that the
      agreement has not yet been formally documented, existing only as a verbal commitment.

      Napolitano: 0:34 Hi, everyone. Judge Andrew Napolitano here for “Judging Freedom”.
      Today is Wednesday, July 30th, 2025. Professor Gilbert Doctorow will be here with
      us in just a moment on “The European Union capitulates to Trump”. What’s behind
      it? But first this. [commercial message] 2:01 Professor Doctorow, good day to
      you, my dear friend. Thank you very much for joining me today. Thanks for accommodating
      my schedule. What has been the general reaction amongst European leaders and European
      media to the announcement by Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump the other day
      about this agreement for 15% tariffs for everything the EU wants to sell in the
      US? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: I don’t know of anyone who was rejoicing on that here
      in Europe. On the contrary, the consensus is that this is a tragic moment for
      Europe, that this will cost them dearly in future investments in manufacturing,
      which will now be directed to the United States by their local manufacturers here,
      because it is the only way for them to save their market share in the States under
      the new regime of US duties. So jobs will move to the States, jobs will be lost
      here, and there is the understanding that the very low growth, or negative growth
      in some countries, that has prevailed in Europe for the last two to three years
      will continue indefinitely when this new system is applied. The question is how
      do you explain the capitulation? 3:33 I think most everyone understands that von
      der Leyen was kissing Trump’s ring, bending the knee, and that Europe was a supplicant
      and not an equal partner in negotiations. Napolitano: Some of your colleagues
      on this show have criticized the agreement, arguing as you did, but in addition,
      we can’t even read it because it’s not even been reduced to writing. Is that true?
      Have they just agreed on the 15% and nothing has been reduced to writing yet?
      Doctorow: There is nothing more than a handshake as far as we know. But that is
      sufficient for these purposes because there [is] a lot of detail work that has
      to be done. This is not assumed to be the comprehensive and complete agreement.
      There will be some discussions at the margins. For example, over the fate of automobiles,
      will they be at the 25% or indeed at 15%, such as liquor, which was not a subject
      of agreement during that meeting in Scotland. So there are these little bits and
      pieces along the way, but the general understanding is a 15 percent blanket tariff
      on all European wares. That may be accepted as a solid fact, not as a speculation.
      Napolitano: Back to what you said a few minutes ago, I suppose you could manufacture
      a Mercedes-Benz automobile in Tennessee, but you can’t make French champagne in
      New Jersey. So some of the goods and products unique to Europe cannot be put together
      here. Impossible. Doctorow: 5:21 Yes, that’s true. So they will forego some of
      their sales volume in products like champagne or fine wines. That is a given.
      And that is part of what some critics say is wrong with the European economy that
      has been very dependent on exports for future growth. This was precisely the line
      of critique in the leading Belgian French-speaking newspaper, Le Soir, a couple
      of days ago. They’re looking for explanations. How was it that we were so weak
      in these negotiations? Of course, that logic doesn’t hold up when you consider
      that China is another part of the world where exports have driven growth. 6:08
      And they record five percent GDP annual growth, not 0.1 percent as the Europeans
      are now boasting about the first quarter results in 2025. So that is an excuse
      that this paper, that people like this paper, who are supporters of the status
      quo in Europe, are exploring to explain what went wrong. But in their discussion,
      there is a fact which really is evident when you look at it closely, and that
      is they capitulated to Trump on the trade agreement because they’re hoping to
      keep him in play. They’re hoping that they can agree with Trump on further support
      to Ukraine, which is the leading issue of all of the heads of state and prime
      ministers in Europe. Napollitano: I want to get into that in some depth with you,
      but before we do, one or two more questions about the Trump-Von der Leyen agreement.
      What’s the next step for the agreement? I mean, is this it, or do the French who’ve
      condemned it and the Germans who’ve condemned it have the ability to veto or modify
      or create carve-outs? Doctorow: Well, they do. This is not just on the say-so
      of von der Leyen that a treaty is agreed and is imposed on all the 27 member states.
      It has to go through parliament. It requires a ratification. And that is going
      to take a lot of negotiation within Europe. Considering that the largest economy
      in Europe, Germany, headed by a defeatist leader in terms of the tarif war, but
      a bold leader in terms of the future war with Russia, considering his role, how
      he and his party, the Christian Democrats, are leaders of the European People’s
      Party, which is the most important party in the European Parliament. And he, Merz,
      has come out two days ago saying that this is, yes, it’s a black day for Europe,
      but, but, but … but this is the best that we could get. That assumes that the
      Germans will vote for the deal. 8:37 The French are going to put up a lot of resistance.
      Let’s remember that the major economies are the ones that are most interested
      in the nature of the agreement with the States because they have the biggest trade
      flows with the States. The smaller countries, the smaller economies here are,
      well, let’s say, bystanders. They are not going to have a decisive say. They will
      follow what they are told to do by the likes of Germany. So the French are the
      single biggest points of resistance to the agreement that von der Leyen has set
      down, not just the the so-called far right of Marine Le Pen, who instantly came
      out condemning this, but even the centrist Bayrou, the prime minister installed
      by Macron to manage the difficulties he has with his parliament, he came out against
      it as well. 9:38 So the French are going to dig in their deals and they will certainly
      demand concessions, though I doubt that they will overturn the agreement that
      von der Leyen reached, because so many other countries will follow Germany’s lead.
      Napolitano: Is it a simple majority vote in the European Parliament? Is it country
      by country? Is it two-thirds? How does it work? Doctorow: No, to my knowledge
      it would be a majority vote. Napolitano: All right, and you’re of the view that
      not withstanding this disenchantment for other reasons, which we’ll get into presently,
      this will likely be ratified. Doctorow: I think it will be. There will be modifications.
      Napolitano: Is she popular, von der Leyen, or is she not popular? That’s an inartful
      question. Is she popular with the folks in the streets? Is she popular with elites?
      Doctorow: No, I think it’s with elites. And “popular” is not an adjective I would
      apply here. Respected, willing to accept her judgment. However, let’s remember
      from the last several weeks, she was under fierce challenge in the parliament,
      and this was covered in the daily news. So the broader public, and even among
      elites, they are aware that she has opposition for the way she has managed the
      parliament and the European institutions. So she doesn’t have a free ride any
      more. Her situation is more tenuous than it was before the challenge to the way
      she negotiated the covid vaccine contracts. 11:14 That has put her in some jeopardy.
      And I think the broad public is aware of that, though it has other problems to
      worry about and isn’t very concerned about Madame van der Leyen. Napolitano: I
      mean, let’s just suppose, this may be fantastical, but let’s just suppose Marie
      Le Pen becomes the President of France. What can she do, if anything, to get out
      of this? Doctorow: Well, let’s look first as what von der Leyen is doing to get
      us into this. She has appointed the commissioners, all of whom, or a large majority
      of the important or key positions, she’s assigned to the non-entity countries,
      the Baltics and other East European countries, which are under German sway. She
      has appointed people who are intellectually inferior in the expectation that she
      could dominate them, and that has turned out to be true. Now, if Marine Le Pen
      came in, all of these people would be thrown out, and you might have a chance
      of seeing competent people who represent the 450 million people, a population
      of the European Union, and not people like Kallas, who comes from a country with
      one million population, who are drawing Europe around by the nose for the sake
      of their anti-Russian positions. So everything could change in policies, because
      the policies now are made by those who are under the direct instruction and control
      of von der Leyen. Anyone who replaces her will certainly not enjoy that position
      of strength to appoint all of the commissioners and to control the whole of European
      policy the way von der Leyen has in the last several years. Napolitano: 13:04
      Okay, got it. But if the agreement with Trump is reduced to writing and ratified,
      and if France rebels, there’s nothing much they could do about it, right? This
      is part of the treaty that created the EU. They’re subject to this, or am I wrong?
      Doctorow: No, you’re right. But again, there is something here that we have to
      call out. There are parts of this agreement which are utterly unenforceable and
      which are probably the most damaging to the European economy. Napolitano: What
      are they? Doctorow: Not the 15 percent tariff, but the obligation to buy 650 billion
      dollars of American energy. That is the single biggest factor weighing on the
      weak European economies, starting with the German economy. This, the dependence
      on liquefied natural gas at world prices, which has been the case ever since the
      destruction of the North Stream pipelines and the decisions in Parliament to phase
      out as quickly as possible use of Russian energy supplies — that has been the
      destructive factor in European economies more than this 15 percent tariff can
      possibly be. And the obligation to buy this, well, an obligation. What kind of
      obligations did the Chinese have in previous agreements with the United States?
      They never were effected. 14:34 And I doubt that this one ever will be carried
      out because the people who have signed onto it will not be in office. Napolitano:
      Got it. I don’t want to put you out on a limb, but which is the greater threat
      to European economic stability? Russia or the United States? Doctorow: At this
      point it’s the United States. To anyone with eyes to see what Mr. Trump has just
      done, the complete humiliation of Europe, the imposition of tariffs and purchase
      obligations from the United States, that is destructive of the European economy.
      It is not the act of a friend. And in that context, you have to ask, well, why
      are they going along with this? And there you have to look for the small print.
      15:26 And is I said, even in the “Soir” editorial, it was, if you looked closely
      at the text, you found the answer. The answer is to keep up relations with Trump.
      And why do they want to keep up relations with Trump? In order to rope him in
      to continue American support for the Ukrainians in the war with Russia. This is
      the big, idee fixe of von der Leyen and her colleagues in the European institutions.
      And it is not an economic concern. They don’t give a damn about the welfare of
      the broad populations in European countries. Their concern is their own holding
      onto power, which is made possible by this war with Russia because it gives them
      reason. Napolitano: Is it a coincidence that while all this is going on, France
      has announced a recognition of the state of Palestine and Great Britain with a
      little bit of wiggle room has announced that it is likely to do so by September.
      Doctorow: 16:39 These are acts of impotence. They are giving Mr. Trump the finger
      in their pocket, which is what, which is a very common– Napolitano: In other words,
      giving him the finger and he can’t see them doing it. Doctorow: Exactly right.
      Napolitano: There’s a case in New Jersey where a guy gave a finger to the police.
      Oh, the prosecution went on for years. The Supreme Court said it was protected
      speech, but it was not in his pocket. Doctorow: Well, this is a Russian expression,
      by the way. So you see, they do have a sense of humor. It is a sign of impotence.
      They cannot say this openly. They are defying Trump. That’s what this recognition
      of the Palestine state is all about. It will change nothing, but it is holding
      up Trump to general opprobrium and criticism. Napolitano: 17:36 Is this Epstein
      saga resonating in Europe? I mean, I was there for the past week and a half and
      talking to all kinds of folks, academics, elites, professionals, longtime friends,
      cab drivers. It wasn’t what Tulsi Gabbard was revealing. It was Epstein, Epstein,
      Epstein. Is it the same in Northern Europe where you are? Doctorow: Oh yes, and
      that’s certainly the Epstein story, it’s on the front page every day, and Ghislaine

      which is also covered in the States The aspect of it that is watched most closely

      that interests them most, not the details of pedophilia or whatever. That side
      of it is not in the front pages. Napolitano: How close to the end of his days

      to get him out of the way. Now Mr. Umerov is another candidate. The interesting
      thing about him is his pure civilian background, a man who spent a year in the
      States living with a family while he was in secondary school, and so he’s fluent
      in English and knows American situation, and who has become very frankly wealthy
      by dint of his wits in high tech, and wealthy enough to have established fellowships
      in Stanford University. 24:33 So the man had an interest in the States. It would
      fit in nicely with the kind of leaders that Americans think– Napolitano: He will
      be the CIA’s type of guy. Professor Doctorow, thank you very much. A fascinating,
      as always, a fascinating conversation. I missed you in the past two weeks. I’m
      glad we’re all back together. Thank you for your time. We’ll look forward to seeing
      you next week. Doctorow: Very good. Napolitano: Thank you. And coming up later
      today, I’ve missed everybody, including all of you. At 11 o’clock this morning,
      Colonel Douglas Macgregor. At one this afternoon, Professor Glenn Diesen; at two
      this afternoon, Max Blumenthal; at three this afternoon, Phil Giroldi. 25:12 Judge
      Napolitano for “Judging Freedom”.'
    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion on "Judging Freedom," Judge Andrew Napolitano
      and Professor Gilbert Doctorow analyze the negative European reaction to the recent
      agreement between Ursula von der Leyen and Donald Trump regarding 15% tariffs,
      viewing it as a detrimental development for Europe's manufacturing investments.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of "Judging Freedom," Judge Andrew Napolitano
      discusses the implications of a new trade agreement between the European Union
      and Donald Trump, featuring insights from Professor Gilbert Doctorow. The agreement,
      which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods sold in the U.S., has been met with widespread
      disapproval among European leaders and media, who view it as a detrimental capitulation
      that could lead to significant job losses and hinder future investments in Europe.
      Doctorow emphasizes that the deal reflects a power imbalance, with Europe appearing
      as a supplicant rather than an equal partner in negotiations, and notes that the
      agreement has not yet been formally documented, existing only as a verbal commitment.

    text: 'Transcript submitted by a reader RT: 0:00 And let’s now cross live to Gilbert
      Doctorow, a former visiting scholar at Harriman Institute, Columbia University.
      Welcome to the program, sir. On Tuesday, Zelensky and the Ukrainian parliament
      put an end to any independence the anti-corruption watchdog had, and today they’re
      restoring it by introducing a new bill in the Rada. Why such a quick turnaround,
      do you think? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: Well, because of the massive demonstrations.
      I would like to complement the report that you’ve given very ably on what Mr.
      Zelensky did, what he has just undone, how he received pressure. That’s all fine.
      But let’s go to the question of these massive demonstrations. The “New York Times”
      said in their first report on the demonstrations, this goes back to Wednesday,
      “Well, this is the first mass demonstration in Ukraine in three years of war.”
      Yes, very interesting. And why is it that there were demonstrations now? Nobody’s
      asked that question. Let’s deal with that. Does that mean that everybody was very
      happy in Ukraine with the government? Of course it doesn’t. It means that you’d
      get your skull fractured if you dared to step out and think of a demonstration.
      Going back to October 2014 and the elections of the [Rada] at that time, when
      the first elections that took place after the new regime was put in place by a
      coup d’etat, those elections were witnessed by foreign observers who reported
      extensively on the violence that was used against the opponents of the regime.
      That hasn’t changed. Now, what has changed is that nobody confronted the 10,000
      or more demonstrators that came out on the streets of Kiev, not to mention thousands
      more in all the other major cities of Ukraine. 2:01 Why did that happen? Let’s
      try to think. I would suggest we should think that someone, probably in the West,
      wants to change the regime. And that is the investigation path that I urge upon
      listeners to this, I would suggest that the usual actors like MI6 are behind it.
      Why did the Ukrainian army not fire into the crowd? They got orders not to. And
      I don’t believe that Mr. Zelensky gave those orders. So we are about to witness
      regime change in Ukraine. And the major media in the West are preparing, at least
      in the States, the American public for regime change and for the removal of Zelensky.
      RT: 2:49 And if we look at the reaction of the public, Ukrainians have not reacted
      in such a strong way to other controversial events, like when the country’s national
      resources were sold to the United States, for example. Why has this caused so
      much controversy now? Doctorow: Because now you weren’t going to get your head
      bashed in, that’s why. You weren’t going to get shot. This is the cardinal change
      that has to be brought out, what happened in this week. It is the first step of
      two or three steps to remove Zelensky and the whole gang of neo-Nazis who have
      the Ukrainian nation by the neck. It is not thinkable that the whole public was
      satisfied with the Zelensky regime and therefore didn’t demonstrate. No. They
      just used common sense, which was: you don’t want to risk your life. Now, it was
      clear the government had, the army had been given orders not to fire. 3:49 Moreover,
      the instruction that we understood again from major Western media is that the
      army was told not to come out in the streets in their uniforms to demonstrate
      against the law. My goodness, what a change. This is the first stage in the removal
      of the Zelensky government. RT: What about his image, Zelensky’s actions concerning
      NABU and the restoration of its autonomy? Do you think that will save the image
      or will it damage even more? Doctorow: Among whom? Among Ukrainians, I don’t think
      there is a particular love for Mr. Zelensky. The country is patriotic. Ukrainians
      share the same religious and political conservatism, shall we say, of Russians.
      They are going to fight to the end, but they’re not stupid. And if they did not
      demonstrate in any way against Mr. Zelensky, it was not for love of him and his
      peers and his colleagues. It was because they were afraid for their lives. That
      somehow miraculously has changed in the past week, and it deserves proper attention.
      5:07 I have said for some time this war will not end by a military capitulation.
      The idea that next week the Ukrainian army will raise a white flag is totally
      unrealistic, even though nearly all of my peers are suggesting that will happen.
      No, no, the Ukrainian government will collapse of its own weight and of its own
      unpopularity. And with some help from those Western sponsors who want to see it
      collapse. RT: And meanwhile, Zelensky keeps asking for money from the Western
      backers, let’s call them that, Western friends. And now he wants the EU to pay
      Ukrainian soldiers their salaries. Do you think Europe will agree? And where is
      it going to find the funds? Doctorow: 5:54 Well, I don’t think they’ll say no,
      but they just won’t do it. There aren’t funds available. And I don’t think there’s
      a great eagerness to provide them even if they were available. The standing of
      the Ukrainian government is very low. The notion that the Ukrainian army can defend
      its territory and that it, not to mention that it will gain back territory and
      defeat Russia, that is only maintained by complete fools. The Western mainstream
      media no longer holds that to be true. And that is the point. They are preparing,
      at least in the United States, where there’s far more political freedom for the
      press than there is in Europe, the press in the States is giving strong signs.
      Less than two weeks ago there was a feature article in the “New York Times” on
      the war crimes committed by the Ukrainian forces during their occupation of Kursk
      Oblast. This is unbelievable. 6:57 From the start of the war, Western media portrayed
      Ukraine as bunny rabbits, which were being assaulted, attacked by the big bad
      wolf. Well, you know who that is. That’s Russia. Now we find the “New York Times”,
      by reporters on the ground, were explaining in detail the war crimes that these
      bunny rabbits were committing on Russian soil. That is a sea change. RT 7:26 Well,
      the vibe definitely is changing, if we may call it that. Also this Friday, Russia
      reported destroying four Patriot systems. At the UN, the Russian representative
      said the more weapons the West delivers to Ukraine, the more will be destroyed.
      What are your thoughts on that? Doctorow: Well, I think it’s an absolute statement
      of fact. Among my peers, almost everyone is in agreement that any new weapons
      shipped to Ukraine will be destroyed very quickly, and in any case cannot help
      the Ukrainian cause. The list of weaponry, the Bradleys, the armored personnel
      carriers, the tanks — all of that which was in Biden’s list is useless in Ukraine
      today, because the war has changed. The most dynamic part of the war is drone
      warfare. And heavy mechanized equipment, like what was in the Biden list, hides
      in forests today, because it would be blasted to pieces if it comes out in the
      open field. 8:32 So the war has changed. The Biden list of equipment to be shipped
      to the Ukraine is utterly useless. And the Patriots, of which there’s been so
      much reporting — as you say, they’ve been destroyed by the Russians. They are
      vulnerable to Russia’s most advanced missiles and they will not save the Ukrainian
      army. RT: Gilbert Doctorow, former visiting scholar at Harriman Institute, Columbia
      University, thank you so much for this analysis. Doctorow: 9:10 My pleasure.'

    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, Gilbert Doctorow, a former scholar at
      Columbia University, analyzed the swift reversal of Ukrainian President Zelensky's
      decision to dismantle the anti-corruption watchdog, attributing it to massive
      public demonstrations across Ukraine. He noted that these protests, described
      by the "New York Times" as the first significant mass demonstrations in three
      years, indicate widespread dissatisfaction with the government, despite previous
      fears of violent repercussions for dissent. Doctorow suggested that the lack of
      government intervention against the demonstrators signals potential external influences,
      possibly from Western entities, aiming to instigate a regime change in Ukraine.

      satisfied with the Zelensky regime and therefore didn’t demonstrate. No. They
      just used common sense, which was: you don’t want to risk your life. Now, it was
      clear the government had, the army had been given orders not to fire. 3:49 Moreover,
      the instruction that we understood again from major Western media is that the
      army was told not to come out in the streets in their uniforms to demonstrate
      against the law. My goodness, what a change. This is the first stage in the removal
      of the Zelensky government. RT: What about his image, Zelensky’s actions concerning
      NABU and the restoration of its autonomy? Do you think that will save the image
      or will it damage even more? Doctorow: Among whom? Among Ukrainians, I don’t think
      there is a particular love for Mr. Zelensky. The country is patriotic. Ukrainians
      share the same religious and political conservatism, shall we say, of Russians.
      They are going to fight to the end, but they’re not stupid. And if they did not
      demonstrate in any way against Mr. Zelensky, it was not for love of him and his
      peers and his colleagues. It was because they were afraid for their lives. That
      somehow miraculously has changed in the past week, and it deserves proper attention.
      5:07 I have said for some time this war will not end by a military capitulation.
      The idea that next week the Ukrainian army will raise a white flag is totally
      unrealistic, even though nearly all of my peers are suggesting that will happen.
      No, no, the Ukrainian government will collapse of its own weight and of its own
      unpopularity. And with some help from those Western sponsors who want to see it
      collapse. RT: And meanwhile, Zelensky keeps asking for money from the Western
      backers, let’s call them that, Western friends. And now he wants the EU to pay
      Ukrainian soldiers their salaries. Do you think Europe will agree? And where is
      it going to find the funds? Doctorow: 5:54 Well, I don’t think they’ll say no,
      but they just won’t do it. There aren’t funds available. And I don’t think there’s
      a great eagerness to provide them even if they were available. The standing of
      the Ukrainian government is very low. The notion that the Ukrainian army can defend
      its territory and that it, not to mention that it will gain back territory and
      defeat Russia, that is only maintained by complete fools. The Western mainstream
      media no longer holds that to be true. And that is the point. They are preparing,
      at least in the United States, where there’s far more political freedom for the
      press than there is in Europe, the press in the States is giving strong signs.
      Less than two weeks ago there was a feature article in the “New York Times” on
      the war crimes committed by the Ukrainian forces during their occupation of Kursk
      Oblast. This is unbelievable. 6:57 From the start of the war, Western media portrayed
      Ukraine as bunny rabbits, which were being assaulted, attacked by the big bad
      wolf. Well, you know who that is. That’s Russia. Now we find the “New York Times”,
      by reporters on the ground, were explaining in detail the war crimes that these
      bunny rabbits were committing on Russian soil. That is a sea change. RT 7:26 Well,
      the vibe definitely is changing, if we may call it that. Also this Friday, Russia
      reported destroying four Patriot systems. At the UN, the Russian representative
      said the more weapons the West delivers to Ukraine, the more will be destroyed.
      What are your thoughts on that? Doctorow: Well, I think it’s an absolute statement
      of fact. Among my peers, almost everyone is in agreement that any new weapons
      shipped to Ukraine will be destroyed very quickly, and in any case cannot help
      the Ukrainian cause. The list of weaponry, the Bradleys, the armored personnel
      carriers, the tanks — all of that which was in Biden’s list is useless in Ukraine
      today, because the war has changed. The most dynamic part of the war is drone
      warfare. And heavy mechanized equipment, like what was in the Biden list, hides
      in forests today, because it would be blasted to pieces if it comes out in the
      open field. 8:32 So the war has changed. The Biden list of equipment to be shipped
      to the Ukraine is utterly useless. And the Patriots, of which there’s been so
      much reporting — as you say, they’ve been destroyed by the Russians. They are
      vulnerable to Russia’s most advanced missiles and they will not save the Ukrainian
      army. RT: Gilbert Doctorow, former visiting scholar at Harriman Institute, Columbia
      University, thank you so much for this analysis. Doctorow: 9:10 My pleasure.'

    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, Gilbert Doctorow, a former scholar at
      Columbia University, analyzed the swift reversal of Ukrainian President Zelensky's
      decision to dismantle the anti-corruption watchdog, attributing it to massive
      public demonstrations across Ukraine. He noted that these protests, described
      by the "New York Times" as the first significant mass demonstrations in three
      years, indicate widespread dissatisfaction with the government, despite previous
      fears of violent repercussions for dissent. Doctorow suggested that the lack of
      government intervention against the demonstrators signals potential external influences,
      possibly from Western entities, aiming to instigate a regime change in Ukraine.

    url: https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/07/22/transcript-of-iran-tv-interview-on-russian-iranian-naval-exercises/
    text: 'Transcript submitted by a reader PressTV: 0:18 … Spotlight. I’m Marzieh Hashemi.
      Thanks so much for being with us. Iran’s navy, Northern Fleet and Russian vessels
      are conducting maritime drills in the Caspian Sea. “Together for a safe and secure
      Caspian Sea” is the slogan that has been chosen for the drills. Now, according
      to Iran, the primary goal of the exercise is to reinforce maritime safety and
      security while fostering greater cooperation among naval forces of the Caspian
      Sea littoral countries. But what is the reason that these drills by neighboring
      countries are viewed with concern by some in the United States? Well, stay with
      us. We’re going to take a look at some footage and then I will be welcoming my
      guests. 2:15 I’d like to welcome my guests to the program. I’d like to welcome
      my first guest, George Szamuely, Senior Research Fellow, Global Policy Institute,
      London Metropolitan University, out of Budapest. And Gilbert Doctorow,independent
      international affairs analyst out of Brussels. Well, thank you so much. I’m going
      to start this off with Gilbert. Welcome to the program. Gilbert, what is your
      perspective about the significance of these three-day drills between Iran and
      Russia, along with other Caspian Sea littoral states? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: 2:57
      Well, for one thing, it is a reaffirmation that after the 12-day Israel-Iran war,
      Russia remains interested and pursuing a very close relationship with Iran in
      all domains, including defense. So that is a signal to the world at large that
      this cooperation is in full effect. At the same time, I, since you mentioned in
      passing that the United States might be one of those countries not pleased by
      the ongoing cooperation in the Caspian between Iran and Russia, it brings back
      to my mind what was going on 20 years ago when the United States was hoping to
      intervene in the Caspian Sea management by furthering the either pipeline or LNG
      shipments of Turkmenistan gas across the Caspian for the purpose of countering
      Russian gas dominance in Europe. 4:12 So it’s an old story as far as the United
      States is concerned, the United States trying to frustrate the Caspian littoral
      countries from managing the sea themselves. PressTV: Yeah, indeed. I mean, it’s
      interesting, because you just talked about the United States. I mean, looking
      at that, It’s quite interesting that Washington would have problems with neighboring
      countries having naval drills. When the United States goes to the other side of
      the world and have constant naval drills with so many different countries. I mean,
      let’s talk about that, the hypocrisy and the reason [for] such sensitivity about
      the Caspian Sea. Doctorow: 05:00 Yes, well the United States is a practitioner
      of hypocrisy in its foreign policy in almost any domain that you touch. So it
      is not surprising that it would behave in a hypocritical manner with respect to
      the cooperation by these two countries in an area where it would like to intervene
      and have a presence, but is systematically excluded by the Caspian Sea littoral
      countries. PressTV: Well Gilbert, from your perspective, from a strategic perspective,
      how important is the Caspian Sea? Doctorow: Well, the Caspian Sea is of course
      a major asset for both Iran and for Russia. Transport across the sea between the
      countries is foreseeable, although the predominant emphasis in cooperation now
      is on landlines by rail through the Caucuses. Nonetheless, it is a major asset
      in many respects, not just defense, but also economic, that the two countries
      share. And so it is an affirmation of their cooperation, as I say, that they are
      carrying out these present military exercises. PressTV: 6:23 Yeah, you just mentioned,
      not just from a military perspective, also from an economic one. Let’s look at
      that, because we know that both countries have been and are majorly sanctioned
      by the United States. Tell me about the possibility of actually enhancing the
      economies of both these countries via that route. Doctorow: Well, of course, sea
      transport is by nature cheaper than land transport, And it would be understandable
      that this would be one element in the increasing logistical cooperation between
      Iran and Russia. Although, as I say, the biggest investments that are foreseeable
      in the near future pertain to rail connections for the North-South corridor. 7:19
      But notwithstanding that, development of shipping across the Caspian Sea has to
      be in the target projects of both countries. There is fishing, of course the Caspian
      is a source of caviar and other valuable seafood products, But I think the logistical
      angle is probably economically the more important. PressTV: What about the overall
      deepening military and maritime cooperation between these two countries, especially
      now? Doctorow: The two countries are a major stabilizing factor in the region,
      but they don’t stand alone. One has to mention, of course, the quite profound
      cooperation between Iran and China and recently during the Israeli-Iran war, the
      statement of interest and support that came from Pakistan. 8:29 So we’re looking
      at cooperation between Russia and Iran in a broader context of countries in Asia,
      in the part of Eurasia, that have defense interests as well as economic interests
      and are defying the efforts of the United States to sanction both and to harm
      both countries economically. This, as I say, the broader context should be very
      reassuring to Iran, because it demonstrates that it is considered an equal player
      in the broader region and has countries that support its vital interests and are,
      have pledged themselves to ensure that Iran stays independent and sovereign despite
      all of the efforts of the United States. PressTV: 9:26 Right. Well, let’s talk
      about that, because one of the goals of the drills, according to Iran, is also
      to show that Iran and Russia and basically the littoral Caspian Sea states can
      control these waters themselves, can keep the Caspian Sea secure and can provide
      stability. And of course this is something that usually the United States does
      not want to see and usually try to say that they have to be involved in order
      for any area to be safe. The importance of this and the important role of these
      two countries in providing that type of safety and security in the Caspian Sea?
      Doctorow: This falls again into a broader context. Both Iran and Russia are member
      states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. And the primary plank, or the
      most significant unifying theme of the Shanghai Cooperation Agreement is precisely
      to provide security to protect these countries against terrorism, against violence,
      and against criminal gangs. So, in that respect, this particular operation that’s
      now starting between Russia and Iran falls directly in the line of security, anti-terror
      and anti-criminal gangs. It’s to provide safety in the sea and its littoral. PressTV:
      11:06 You mentioned the Shanghai Cooperation. Let’s talk about that side of things
      and possibly the expansion and having access to Central Asia and the Caucasus
      via, of course, that body of water. Doctorow: Yes, it is. There are a number of
      states that are bordering this sea. As I said, going back 20 years, the interest
      of Turkmenistan at that time, of course they’ve changed since, but at that time
      was to use the sea for purposes of transporting gas. The other states are equally
      interested in its being secure and in keeping out would-be troublemakers like
      the United States. PressTV: 12:00 Well we know that Iran and Russia earlier this
      year have signed a cooperation and a defense pact basically, which includes joint
      drills and tech sharing and coordination against common threats, but without a
      mutual-defense clause. I want to talk about both sides, the importance of what
      it includes and what it has excluded. Doctorow: Well, to my understanding, it
      was on the initiative of Iran that a mutual defense component was not included
      in the cooperation agreement. That was back in December. There was the hope still
      then that Iran would find an accommodation with the United States, with the incoming
      Trump administration, improbable as that seemed at the time. Nonetheless, there
      was the hope that they would find accommodation, the sanctions would be lifted,
      the Iranian economy could prosper in a more normal way. 13:10 That, as we know,
      did not happen. Mr. Trump has been very difficult, has placed impossible demands
      upon Iran in the negotiations. And so the bet on accommodation was not successful.
      Nonetheless, I think specialists in Russian affairs, like myself, placed too much
      stress on the defense component and underestimated, perhaps, Iran’s ability to
      defend itself very well, as it did during the 12-day war. So I’m happy to say
      that we were wrong, that Iran possibly was correct in not putting in a defense
      component at that time, and had the opportunity to demonstrate to Russia and to
      the world that it is very capable of defending itself with its thousands of highly
      sophisticated missiles that are well protected against aerial bombardment. PressTV:
      14:15 OK, you said it was perhaps OK at that time. Let’s talk now. Then Iran,
      as you said, has shown the world its ability to defend itself. So at this point
      in time, your thoughts from a strategic perspective, do you think that there should
      be a defense pact now? Do you think that it should be expanded, the cooperation
      between Russia and Iran? Doctorow: Well, again, in a broader context, given what
      China has done, China sending several of its important naval assets into the Persian
      Gulf in the last couple of days of the Iran-Israeli war to demonstrate to the
      United States that it was ready for war if it came to that. Since China has proven
      itself as a very reliable and powerful friend in time of need, I think that it
      would be appropriate now for Russia to step in and do the same thing. Russia would
      not be standing by itself; t would have China as a fellow defender or partner
      in the defense of Iran. And for that matter, it would, we know now the commitment
      of Pakistan to Iran’s survival as a sovereign state. 15:42 So in this group of
      nations interested in Iran’s continuing sovereignty and independence, an agreement
      with Russia would make a lot of sense. PressTV: And how much of it you would say
      that, as a matter of fact, it’s the policies coming out of Washington that actually
      increases the possibility of these countries working even closer together as Russia
      is being heavily sanctioned, Iran is being heavily sanctioned and China as you
      brought up also under threat, from military threats to, of course, the tariffs.
      I mean, your thoughts basically, from a strategic perspective, would you think
      that these countries, whether we’re talking about China, Russia or Iran, would
      basically say that sticking together at this point in time is the best way forward
      in basically conquering or trying to deal with the global bully? Doctorow: Well,
      I think that it is very timely that the countries should stand together. We see
      now in the approaching summit of the EU-China that von der Leyen is coming with
      a message to President Xi that he should break his support, should turn his back
      on the support for Russia. And we see Xi saying that that cannot happen because
      he understands perfectly that China is next on the U.S. destruction list. So in
      these circumstances, a very open confrontation and frank language, I think that
      it is appropriate for the countries that are under attack from the United States
      not to be bashful any more about defending their interests and readiness for war
      if it comes to that. In the same context, the growing visible rapprochement and
      mutual support between Russia and North Korea is a template for what can and should
      be done in the case of Russia-Iranian relations. PressTV: 18:07 Your thoughts
      about the overall message that Iran and Russia want to send to the West with these
      drills? Doctorow: The message is that Mr. Trump has overplayed his hand. And that
      is to the detriment of US and Western interests. And it can only be corrected
      by a return to reason and realism, the acknowledgment that Iran was capable of
      destroying, utterly destroying Israel, and did not do it, that they accepted Mr.
      Trump’s request for a ceasefire not because Iran needed it, but because Israel
      needed it. That should be made more visible, so that the world community, the
      readers of the “Financial Times” and the “New York Times” would understand properly
      how that war ended and why Iran is a strong country that deserves full respect
      and not the treatment or the kind of bullying that Trump, through Witkoff, was
      trying to exercise in the failed negotiations. PressTV: 19:29 And what do you
      think it will take to get to that point. On the one hand, yes, Iran definitely
      showed its strength. On the other hand, we have seen the jargon still coming out
      of these western capitals, and the lack of condemnation continues against the
      Israeli regime and the American regime. So how do we get there, what you said?
      Doctorow: 19:53 For the United States to correct its positions on Gaza, that is
      impossible at this particular moment because of Mr. Trump’s dependence on support
      from the majority in Congress that are pro-Israeli, pro-Zionist, and unreasonable
      about the genocide and Israel’s violation of international law. So from the United
      States, I don’t expect a change any time soon, but from Europe, it is entirely
      thinkable. And I would look in that direction for a support in the case of Gaza
      to end this genocide at once. Today is the National Day in Belgium, and the King,
      Philippe, made a speech to the nation. And one of the two foreign policy issues
      that he addressed was precisely Gaza and his call for the demand of the UN Secretary
      General for an immediate ceasefire to be respected. So this is coming from Belgium.
      He didn’t yet name Israel as the aggressor, as the perpetrator of genocide, but
      it’s coming close to that. So I think Europe is at the moment, a more hopeful
      talking partner on the issue of the Middle East that is certainly foremost for
      Iran at this moment. That is a tragedy in the neighborhood that Israel is perpetrating.
      PressTV: 21:39 And on that note, I appreciate your being with me, my sole guest
      tonight on this “Spotlight”, Gilbert Doctorow, independent international affairs

      Russia, along with other Caspian Sea littoral states? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: 2:57
      Well, for one thing, it is a reaffirmation that after the 12-day Israel-Iran war,
      Russia remains interested and pursuing a very close relationship with Iran in
      all domains, including defense. So that is a signal to the world at large that
      this cooperation is in full effect. At the same time, I, since you mentioned in
      passing that the United States might be one of those countries not pleased by
      the ongoing cooperation in the Caspian between Iran and Russia, it brings back
      to my mind what was going on 20 years ago when the United States was hoping to
      intervene in the Caspian Sea management by furthering the either pipeline or LNG
      shipments of Turkmenistan gas across the Caspian for the purpose of countering
      Russian gas dominance in Europe. 4:12 So it’s an old story as far as the United
      States is concerned, the United States trying to frustrate the Caspian littoral
      countries from managing the sea themselves. PressTV: Yeah, indeed. I mean, it’s
      interesting, because you just talked about the United States. I mean, looking
      at that, It’s quite interesting that Washington would have problems with neighboring
      countries having naval drills. When the United States goes to the other side of
      the world and have constant naval drills with so many different countries. I mean,
      let’s talk about that, the hypocrisy and the reason [for] such sensitivity about
      the Caspian Sea. Doctorow: 05:00 Yes, well the United States is a practitioner
      of hypocrisy in its foreign policy in almost any domain that you touch. So it
      is not surprising that it would behave in a hypocritical manner with respect to
      the cooperation by these two countries in an area where it would like to intervene
      and have a presence, but is systematically excluded by the Caspian Sea littoral
      countries. PressTV: Well Gilbert, from your perspective, from a strategic perspective,
      how important is the Caspian Sea? Doctorow: Well, the Caspian Sea is of course
      a major asset for both Iran and for Russia. Transport across the sea between the
      countries is foreseeable, although the predominant emphasis in cooperation now
      is on landlines by rail through the Caucuses. Nonetheless, it is a major asset
      in many respects, not just defense, but also economic, that the two countries
      share. And so it is an affirmation of their cooperation, as I say, that they are
      carrying out these present military exercises. PressTV: 6:23 Yeah, you just mentioned,
      not just from a military perspective, also from an economic one. Let’s look at
      that, because we know that both countries have been and are majorly sanctioned
      by the United States. Tell me about the possibility of actually enhancing the
      economies of both these countries via that route. Doctorow: Well, of course, sea
      transport is by nature cheaper than land transport, And it would be understandable
      that this would be one element in the increasing logistical cooperation between
      Iran and Russia. Although, as I say, the biggest investments that are foreseeable
      in the near future pertain to rail connections for the North-South corridor. 7:19
      But notwithstanding that, development of shipping across the Caspian Sea has to
      be in the target projects of both countries. There is fishing, of course the Caspian
      is a source of caviar and other valuable seafood products, But I think the logistical
      angle is probably economically the more important. PressTV: What about the overall
      deepening military and maritime cooperation between these two countries, especially
      now? Doctorow: The two countries are a major stabilizing factor in the region,
      but they don’t stand alone. One has to mention, of course, the quite profound
      cooperation between Iran and China and recently during the Israeli-Iran war, the
      statement of interest and support that came from Pakistan. 8:29 So we’re looking
      at cooperation between Russia and Iran in a broader context of countries in Asia,
      in the part of Eurasia, that have defense interests as well as economic interests
      and are defying the efforts of the United States to sanction both and to harm
      both countries economically. This, as I say, the broader context should be very
      reassuring to Iran, because it demonstrates that it is considered an equal player
      in the broader region and has countries that support its vital interests and are,
      have pledged themselves to ensure that Iran stays independent and sovereign despite
      all of the efforts of the United States. PressTV: 9:26 Right. Well, let’s talk
      about that, because one of the goals of the drills, according to Iran, is also
      to show that Iran and Russia and basically the littoral Caspian Sea states can
      control these waters themselves, can keep the Caspian Sea secure and can provide
      stability. And of course this is something that usually the United States does
      not want to see and usually try to say that they have to be involved in order
      for any area to be safe. The importance of this and the important role of these
      two countries in providing that type of safety and security in the Caspian Sea?
      Doctorow: This falls again into a broader context. Both Iran and Russia are member
      states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. And the primary plank, or the
      most significant unifying theme of the Shanghai Cooperation Agreement is precisely
      to provide security to protect these countries against terrorism, against violence,
      and against criminal gangs. So, in that respect, this particular operation that’s
      now starting between Russia and Iran falls directly in the line of security, anti-terror
      and anti-criminal gangs. It’s to provide safety in the sea and its littoral. PressTV:
      11:06 You mentioned the Shanghai Cooperation. Let’s talk about that side of things
      and possibly the expansion and having access to Central Asia and the Caucasus
      via, of course, that body of water. Doctorow: Yes, it is. There are a number of
      states that are bordering this sea. As I said, going back 20 years, the interest
      of Turkmenistan at that time, of course they’ve changed since, but at that time
      was to use the sea for purposes of transporting gas. The other states are equally
      interested in its being secure and in keeping out would-be troublemakers like
      the United States. PressTV: 12:00 Well we know that Iran and Russia earlier this
      year have signed a cooperation and a defense pact basically, which includes joint
      drills and tech sharing and coordination against common threats, but without a
      mutual-defense clause. I want to talk about both sides, the importance of what
      it includes and what it has excluded. Doctorow: Well, to my understanding, it
      was on the initiative of Iran that a mutual defense component was not included
      in the cooperation agreement. That was back in December. There was the hope still
      then that Iran would find an accommodation with the United States, with the incoming
      Trump administration, improbable as that seemed at the time. Nonetheless, there
      was the hope that they would find accommodation, the sanctions would be lifted,
      the Iranian economy could prosper in a more normal way. 13:10 That, as we know,
      did not happen. Mr. Trump has been very difficult, has placed impossible demands
      upon Iran in the negotiations. And so the bet on accommodation was not successful.
      Nonetheless, I think specialists in Russian affairs, like myself, placed too much
      stress on the defense component and underestimated, perhaps, Iran’s ability to
      defend itself very well, as it did during the 12-day war. So I’m happy to say
      that we were wrong, that Iran possibly was correct in not putting in a defense
      component at that time, and had the opportunity to demonstrate to Russia and to
      the world that it is very capable of defending itself with its thousands of highly
      sophisticated missiles that are well protected against aerial bombardment. PressTV:
      14:15 OK, you said it was perhaps OK at that time. Let’s talk now. Then Iran,
      as you said, has shown the world its ability to defend itself. So at this point
      in time, your thoughts from a strategic perspective, do you think that there should
      be a defense pact now? Do you think that it should be expanded, the cooperation
      between Russia and Iran? Doctorow: Well, again, in a broader context, given what
      China has done, China sending several of its important naval assets into the Persian
      Gulf in the last couple of days of the Iran-Israeli war to demonstrate to the
      United States that it was ready for war if it came to that. Since China has proven
      itself as a very reliable and powerful friend in time of need, I think that it
      would be appropriate now for Russia to step in and do the same thing. Russia would
      not be standing by itself; t would have China as a fellow defender or partner
      in the defense of Iran. And for that matter, it would, we know now the commitment
      of Pakistan to Iran’s survival as a sovereign state. 15:42 So in this group of
      nations interested in Iran’s continuing sovereignty and independence, an agreement
      with Russia would make a lot of sense. PressTV: And how much of it you would say
      that, as a matter of fact, it’s the policies coming out of Washington that actually
      increases the possibility of these countries working even closer together as Russia
      is being heavily sanctioned, Iran is being heavily sanctioned and China as you
      brought up also under threat, from military threats to, of course, the tariffs.
      I mean, your thoughts basically, from a strategic perspective, would you think
      that these countries, whether we’re talking about China, Russia or Iran, would
      basically say that sticking together at this point in time is the best way forward
      in basically conquering or trying to deal with the global bully? Doctorow: Well,
      I think that it is very timely that the countries should stand together. We see
      now in the approaching summit of the EU-China that von der Leyen is coming with
      a message to President Xi that he should break his support, should turn his back
      on the support for Russia. And we see Xi saying that that cannot happen because
      he understands perfectly that China is next on the U.S. destruction list. So in
      these circumstances, a very open confrontation and frank language, I think that
      it is appropriate for the countries that are under attack from the United States
      not to be bashful any more about defending their interests and readiness for war
      if it comes to that. In the same context, the growing visible rapprochement and
      mutual support between Russia and North Korea is a template for what can and should
      be done in the case of Russia-Iranian relations. PressTV: 18:07 Your thoughts
      about the overall message that Iran and Russia want to send to the West with these
      drills? Doctorow: The message is that Mr. Trump has overplayed his hand. And that
      is to the detriment of US and Western interests. And it can only be corrected
      by a return to reason and realism, the acknowledgment that Iran was capable of
      destroying, utterly destroying Israel, and did not do it, that they accepted Mr.
      Trump’s request for a ceasefire not because Iran needed it, but because Israel
      needed it. That should be made more visible, so that the world community, the
      readers of the “Financial Times” and the “New York Times” would understand properly
      how that war ended and why Iran is a strong country that deserves full respect
      and not the treatment or the kind of bullying that Trump, through Witkoff, was
      trying to exercise in the failed negotiations. PressTV: 19:29 And what do you
      think it will take to get to that point. On the one hand, yes, Iran definitely
      showed its strength. On the other hand, we have seen the jargon still coming out
      of these western capitals, and the lack of condemnation continues against the
      Israeli regime and the American regime. So how do we get there, what you said?
      Doctorow: 19:53 For the United States to correct its positions on Gaza, that is
      impossible at this particular moment because of Mr. Trump’s dependence on support
      from the majority in Congress that are pro-Israeli, pro-Zionist, and unreasonable
      about the genocide and Israel’s violation of international law. So from the United
      States, I don’t expect a change any time soon, but from Europe, it is entirely
      thinkable. And I would look in that direction for a support in the case of Gaza
      to end this genocide at once. Today is the National Day in Belgium, and the King,
      Philippe, made a speech to the nation. And one of the two foreign policy issues
      that he addressed was precisely Gaza and his call for the demand of the UN Secretary
      General for an immediate ceasefire to be respected. So this is coming from Belgium.
      He didn’t yet name Israel as the aggressor, as the perpetrator of genocide, but
      it’s coming close to that. So I think Europe is at the moment, a more hopeful
      talking partner on the issue of the Middle East that is certainly foremost for
      Iran at this moment. That is a tragedy in the neighborhood that Israel is perpetrating.
      PressTV: 21:39 And on that note, I appreciate your being with me, my sole guest
      tonight on this “Spotlight”, Gilbert Doctorow, independent international affairs
      analyst out of Brussels. And unfortunately our other guests could not join us,
      but we thank you viewers for being with us on another “Spotlight”. I’m Marzieh
      Hashemi. Hope to see you right here next time. Goodbye.'
    one_sentence_summary: Iran's navy and Russian vessels are conducting maritime drills
      in the Caspian Sea aimed at enhancing maritime safety and cooperation among littoral
      countries, which has raised concerns in the United States.
    paragraph_summary: Iran's navy, in collaboration with Russia and other Caspian Sea
      littoral states, is conducting maritime drills titled "Together for a safe and
      secure Caspian Sea," aimed at enhancing maritime safety and fostering cooperation
      among these nations. The exercises have raised concerns in the United States,
      particularly in light of the recent Israel-Iran conflict, as they signify a deepening
      defense relationship between Iran and Russia. Analysts suggest that this cooperation
      serves as a reminder of past U.S. interests in the region, particularly regarding
      energy resources and geopolitical influence, which may be challenged by the strengthening
      ties among these neighboring countries.

    text: 'Transcript submitted by a reader https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09TIrNrAZIA
      Prof. Glenn Diesen: 0:00 Hi everyone and welcome. We are joined again by Gilbert
      Doctorow, historian, international affairs analyst, and also author of many books
      such as the “War Diaries – the Russia-Ukraine War”, [for] which I will add a link
      in the description. So yeah, welcome back to the program. Gilbert Doctorow, PhD:
      Yeah, very good to speak to you again. Diesen: So one of the more recent news
      is that Trump says he’s very angry with Putin. He says they have a nice conversation,
      but then in the evening he goes on bombing Ukraine. And as always, it’s some uncertainty
      in terms of the difference between the noise and the action. Either he’s seeking
      to manage opposition at home and in Europe, or he’s lacking in strategic focus
      and being, you know, swinging a bit back and forth. It’s, I haven’t been able
      to solve this riddle, if I can be honest. It’s, it’s very, it seems like very
      erratic behavior often. 1:11 So I was wondering if you can, well, try to share
      your perspective and shed some light on what you think is happening here, because
      it doesn’t seem to make much sense, even his argument or even the way he’s going
      back and forth. Doctorow: Well, this is one instance of very important international
      news where the leading, or the best, most widely seen experts on independent media,
      on various YouTube channels, are agreed more or less on the facts, and are completely
      in disagreement over the interpretation. We won’t have a clear indication of what
      the interpretation is, until we know what the content of his arm shipments to
      Ukraine [is]. So far we only know about Patriots. There is speculation that’s
      partly encouraged by his reported discussion with Zelensky over long-range missiles.
      Can he reach Moscow, can he reach Petersburg? 2:38 And of course, this fired up
      a lot of speculation about Trump’s possibly giving this important offensive weaponry
      to Ukraine. We don’t know anything though. That is all– I consider what he’s doing
      is a continuation of what we’ve seen in the past several months on various international
      developments. This is political theater. And he is playing it for all it’s worth.
      He gets in front of the television cameras daily. He’s on international news.
      There’s only one person making the news these days, and his name is Donald Trump.
      So in that sense, the narcissist Trump can be very happy. 3:19 But is there anything
      more to it than that? Is he, as one extreme interpretation, a hazard, that is
      by Scott Ritter, is he an idiot? Are the people around him all idiots? Is the
      Congress populated by idiots? Well, I personally find that a very poor start for
      serious analysis of most anything, to assume that your opponents or the leading
      figures of the day are idiots. I prefer to consider what is behind what seemed
      to be strange or ineffectual actions. Can it be something else going on? One person
      who has taken that approach, who has a lot of respect in alternative media, and
      not only, is Colonel Douglas Macgregor, who was saying that Trump adopted the
      least-bad solution to the pressure he’s been receiving from Congress and from
      Europe to respond to Putin’s very aggressive and very destructive new attacks,
      aerial attacks on Ukraine. So that was a kind of middle position. I take a position
      that goes a little bit further than Colonel Macgregor on the political side. 4:45
      And that is that Trump knew very well what he was doing. He was saying what he
      said about arms deliveries, about new sanctions and secondary tariffs on Russia,
      precisely to silence his critics, to give satisfaction to the most, the loudest-talking
      member of the Republican group in Congress, in the Senate, Lindsey Graham. Graham
      could take pride that the bill that he is steering through the Senate now has
      the support of Trump, who on his own initiative has stated to the public that
      he will be adopting the key point here of secondary tariffs at a hundred percent.
      Well, that’s one thing, silence the critics. I can tell you that my recent appearances
      on various video programs has been picked up by the Russians. And they pick up
      precisely this point from my message, which to my mind is the least important
      part of my message, that he was silencing his critics. No, for me the most important
      thing is the 50 days. The fact that he has given President Putin 50 days is indicative
      that he has little or no intention of continuing the war, of making Biden’s war
      his own war, but instead is giving Mr. Putin time to finish up the job, in the
      same way that he instructed Netanyahu early in his presidency to get on with it,
      do whatever dastardly things you have to do in Gaza, but let’s be done with it
      and move on. That’s what he was saying to my way of thinking, to Vladimir Putin.
      5:41 But none of us will know what really has happened. Has he joined the new
      cons? Has he made common cause with them? Or is he duping them, as I believe,
      with these words about sanctions and arms shootings, and intends to go for his
      detente? The proof will be what is in that package of weapons being shipped. Diesen:
      7:07 Yeah, the 50 days. I was thinking a bit about this as well. It could be a
      delaying tactic in order to not have to pick a side or make any big decisions
      because again, he wants to normalize relations with the Russians, but he doesn’t
      want to alienate too many in his own camp. It could also, as you said, allow the
      Russians to finish off what they’re doing. Well it could also be an effort to
      negotiate, to put some pressures, a deadline. So it can be interpreted in many
      ways. But this is something that confused the Europeans a bit as well. Why do
      we have to wait 50 days for these sanctions? And his response was simply, well,
      50 days isn’t that much. Maybe it comes earlier. But I’m often inclined to lean
      in the direction that there is incompetence or as you said, the stupidity, but
      on the other hand, he does from, yeah, from the past decades, he’s always talked
      about the importance of strategic ambiguity when you negotiate. And he does like
      to think of himself as a negotiator. So if you, if you’re … playing with [a] too-open
      hand, it’s very difficult to … get the deals you want. So again, this is something
      his own administration says as well. “We won’t let anyone know exactly what we’re
      thinking or what we’re doing.” This is what he was always criticizing Biden for
      as well. 8:45 So if it works or not, putting that aside, nonetheless, I think
      we can conclusively say that this is something he believes in, this strategic
      ambiguity. So I do see the argument there, that ambiguity allows him to get some
      room for maneuver to do other things. And the pressure, as you said, has been
      mounting, given that the Russian strikes last night on Kharkov are becoming much
      more brutal in nature, that is both the quantity and the targeting. So one can
      see why there will have to be some reaction. But I guess your argument though,
      is that his response to this is to talk big, but it’s somewhat muted because it
      all depends, I guess, on the weapons he’s sending. 9:41 And I’m not sure if I’m
      understanding this correctly, but to what extent are the Americans sending weapons,
      or to what extent are they actually selling them? Because it seems as if he’s
      selling weapons to the Europeans, and the Europeans can give it to Ukraine, and
      somehow this has to happen under the umbrella of NATO for some reason? Doctorow:
      10:03 That’s a distinction without a difference. The question that I had in my
      mind is: is he just going to ship more of the same, meaning more tanks, more Bradleys,
      more artillery shells, so much as they have them, which certainly must have been
      in the pipeline. Let’s come back to this question, is this Biden’s war or Trump’s
      war? What he said about the ship was authorized under Biden. This is not new appropriations
      from Congress. So in that sense, I think it is not proper to speak about these
      shipments making it Trump’s war. Now, if indeed, it is materiel that was authorized
      by Biden, then it is no cause for worry, because there’s nothing that will threaten
      the Russians, or will change or will escalate the war. However, if new items are
      being put in, and particularly offensive weapons, long-range missiles, like ATACMS,
      which were never shipped, if they are now in the mix, then it’s a very different
      readout of what Trump is doing. And he would be going beyond the irresponsibility
      button to a new level that takes us to World War III. 11:28 The Russians have
      made it plain by their latest revised nuclear doctrine that if they are hit by
      such weapons– this was either, it was originally discussed with respect to ATACMS
      and with respect to Taurus– if they are hit with this, they can respond with nuclear
      arms. And I find it incredible that Trump’s team would not take this into account
      and would authorize ATACMS or something that could reach far into Russia. So I
      believe that we’re on the plane of empty rhetoric, shipping things which everyone
      knows will be of no use to the Ukrainians, because the tanks and the Bradleys
      will just be hidden in the forest since if they put them in the open space, they’ll
      be destroyed at once. Just as the Russians are not using their superiority in
      tanks on the ground. They are also hiding them in the forest and shooting out
      from under cover. And they’re using the tanks just as can, more precise can, with
      maybe 8-10 kilometer range. 12:44 The war has changed. And I don’t see my peers
      taking that into account properly. What we are witnessing now is massive air attack,
      not just that came into the head of Putin or his general staff. “Well, let’s try
      this.” No, it’s precisely because what they were doing up to this point has reached
      the point, the stage where it’s no longer productive. The Russians, to advance
      deep into Ukraine now, would have to take enormous losses because of the drone,
      the omnipresent Ukrainian drones on the battlefield. Therefore, they have gone
      to aerial bombardment. Now, once you’re in aerial bombardment and missile strikes,
      it’s only a half step to using those Oreshniks and getting the damn thing over
      with. If they take out, if they decapitate Kiev, which is entirely within their
      possibilities, then a lot of lives will be saved at all sides. 13:42 Now, this
      comes within the 50 days. It’s entirely possible to finish off Ukraine within
      50 days if they decapitate the country with the missiles they have ready. My question
      is, is Mr. Putin going to rise to that challenge? I don’t know. Nobody knows.
      And so we may be stuck with still stalling and stalling. As regards aerial attack,
      it doesn’t have a time limitation the way ground assalts do. Because of seasonality,
      there is a negligible factor in the devastation that is being brought. So if Putin
      responds both to the challenge, finish it up, and to the opportunity, now that
      he’s not going to be escalating, he’s already in the next stage of an aerial rather
      than ground war, we may see the end of this. 14:41 And I think that Trump could
      find this very satisfactory. Then the United States and Russia can put their heads
      together and say, “Well, what are we going to do to put Ukraine back together
      again?” Along the lines of Russia’s desirata of what they want as their end game.
      And Europe would be sidelined unless they invite them in on the same conditions.
      But let’s be constructive. Let’s talk about an investment fund. Let’s talk about
      a neutral Ukraine. And we’re talking about a rump Ukraine. That could be the basis
      for moving on to detente. It’s all there. Am I right, am I wrong? We will know
      in a few weeks, depending on the content of the military package. 15:24 Yeah,
      that’s what I thought. Now I saw the weapons would be important because, well,
      if the, well, there’s some flaws in the, in the whole optimism, at least we see
      now in Europe. Because well, the Europeans, do they have the money? And do the
      Americans have the weapons to sell them? And do the Ukrainians have the human
      resources to operate them? I was wondering if you see it likely in terms of the
      Tomahawks being sent because this is something that you suggested that would trigger
      great concern among the Russians. Indeed, having Tomahawks and other missiles
      in Ukraine was one of the reasons for the invasion to begin with. But how worried
      should they be though? Because usually they have to be launched from, you know,
      warships or strategic bombers. To … what extent– I guess would make sense. Again,
      I’m never sure if this is a lack of [logic], flawed logic or if it’s a strategic
      ambiguity, but what kind of weapons would be crossing the line? Doctorow: 16:40
      Well, ATACMS to begin with. No one was talking about Tomahawks in the past. They
      were speaking about these precisely ground-launched missiles using the already
      existing HIMARS launchers. The United States shipped a lot of HIMARS, and the
      launchers arre there. And the same launchers can be used on the ground to launch
      the ATACMS. And that’s why there was great concern in Russia, because they are–
      the limitation on the Storm Shadow and the SCALP from France and also Taurus is
      that they are air-launched. And you have to have planes that are adapted to those
      particular missiles, and you have to have planes and pilots, and you have to have
      airfields, which the Russians have done a pretty good job of savaging. So if they
      were, as you say, the Tomahawks, the version exists, it can be ground launched,
      it’s quite exotic. 17:40 If these were to be supplied, then we’re heading into
      the unknown. I can’t imagine that Trump could agree to that, because it would
      be a level of escalation that takes us just to the brink of nuclear war. Diesen:
      So what can we expect then from the Russians in the next 50 days? You used the
      word “decapitating” strike. Do you think they can try to go in for finishing off
      Ukraine? Because again, we’ve spoken in the past about the danger of underestimating
      the resilience of Ukraine. That is, they do keep fighting on. I thought things
      would have begun to collapse militarily as well as politically a long time ago,
      but here they are. They’re still putting up a pretty good fight. But given the
      huge intensity now, increasing intensity from the Russian side, in attacking targets
      across Ukraine, do you think they are going for, if not knocking out the military,
      then going for the political leadership or something to put an end to this war?
      Because in the war of attrition, you do exhaust the adversary, but the Ukrainians
      appear quite exhausted now. At least an attempt by the Russians to go for this
      over the next 50 days. Or if this is as you suggest, Trump’s purpose might be
      to give the Russians 50 days to get this done with, whatever they want to do and
      then end the war. Is this what they might spend their 50 days on? Doctorow: There’s
      one issue here that has to be addressed, and that is the nature of Mr. Putin.
      Not just that he’s very cautious, but that he approaches everything from a lawyer’s
      perspective, being a trained lawyer. And that has its up side and its down side.
      In the given case, I cannot see him giving orders for a decapitating strike under
      the terms of the Special Military Operation. That would be illegal, as he would
      determine it. 19:50 However, Mr. Zelensky should be careful about what he wishes
      for. If he receives any offensive weapons, which he then uses and strikes within
      the Russian Federation at what they consider to be strategic assets, then Mr.
      Putin would declare war. That would be considered an act of war. He declares war,
      and then it can decapitate Ukraine, in the context, only in the context of a declared
      war, from the perspective of Mr. Putin’s mentality. So there’s the qualification
      on how the 50 days could be used. I don’t think that Donald Trump is aware of
      that feature in Putin’s behavior. Certainly Mr. Trump himself doesn’t care a whit
      for law, what’s written even in the constitution. So it could not occur to him
      that Mr. Putin would. And that is exactly the case. There has to be a declaration
      of war for the Ukrainians to receive their decapitating strike. Diesen: 21:00
      I also want to get your opinion on an item in the news, which was that Trump had
      allegedly asked Zelensky if he’s able to strike Moscow or St. Petersburg, so Putin
      would feel the pain. And then later on he was asked, I think it was on the tarmac,
      the same question. And he said, “Oh, no, no, I don’t want him to Moscow.” Do you
      have any thoughts around this back and forth? Doctorow: He was feeding the jackals.
      And the jackals picked it up. They picked up this piece of rotting flesh very
      nicely. By here I mean the BBC. They have gone into overdrive on how Mr. Trump
      is fed up with Putin. He’s now aligned with the haws in Congress and and so forth.
      I don’t believe that for a minute. But again, this is my my best guess. It is
      not founded on anything concrete, because we just discussed what the missing pieces
      to the puzzle are, which will decide whether the puzzle is being assembled, the
      jigsaw puzzle is being assembled properly or wrongly. 22:11 The discussion was
      piquant, he knew it would attract the press. It did, of course; as I say it’s
      all over the BBC today. That’s just what they wanted to hear, that is giving Zelensky
      hopes that he can strike Moscow and St. Petersburg. Diesen: But the, yeah, you
      referred to the, give them hope to the, to the Europeans and the hawks within
      the United States as well as Zelensky. But if Trump wanted to end this war and
      he knows that Russia considers this to be an existential threat and it won’t move
      much on its key demands — wouldn’t Trump need to mount more pressure on the Ukrainians
      and Europeans as opposed to, I guess, throwing them some red meat and, well, making
      them feel more comfortable with this leadership and the possibility of continuing
      this war instead? Doctorow: 23:11 Again, we’re in the realm of political theater.
      And I don’t believe the seriousness of what he has tossed out to the press. As
      I’ve said, he despises the press and he’ll say anything, that he thinks will make
      them look like fools. Diesen: And, I guess the last back and forth I noticed of
      Trump was the arms deliveries. It was reported that, I think it was Pete Hegseth
      that halted arms deliveries to Ukraine. Again, with the engagement with the media,
      he was first asked, well, he was, he first stated that he wasn’t sure who had
      halted the arms deliveries. And when he was asked, “Don’t you know what’s happening
      in your own administration?” He said, “Well, I will be the first one to know.
      Indeed, I would have ordered it.” Except, you know, he didn’t. So how do you make
      sense of this? Doctorow: 24:13 Well, there isn’t any sense to make of it. He’s
      contradicting himself. And again, it is another expression of his contempt for
      the press. He’ll say anything to them. He doesn’t take them seriously, with good
      reason. He is treated very badly by Fox News, by CNN, he’s treated with contempt
      by them and he returns the coin. So I wouldn’t follow this too closely. Don’t
      look for logic in what he says with a microphone in front of him. I follow what
      his feet are doing and particularly I place emphasis on 50 days, which undermines
      everything else. As you said, he could impose these sanctions tomorrow. He didn’t
      do that. And so I don’t believe he ever will. Diesen: 25:11 Okay, so if you put
      the American side of this war aside to conclude him more or less pursuing strategic
      ambiguity. We won’t really know yet if he’s appeasing the hawks, the neocons,
      or if he’s joined them, but we should know based on the weapons which are delivered.
      Again, the Tomahawks or any long range missiles. This is kind of the red lines.
      But if we shift over to the Europeans, what is the strategy of Europe? Are they
      hoping that any of these weapons would turn the tide or, or is it just to pull
      America further into this, to make it a long war? What is– it’s very hard to read
      the Europeans, and here one gets the impression sometimes that there’s no one
      behind the wheel. Doctorow: 26:07 Oh, there are people behind the wheel, but I
      think they’re driving a different vehicle, and they’re concerned with a different
      road. The road that interests them is power and retaining it. They have put themselves
      in very fragile position by backing to the hilt a losing cause. And for them now
      to move the discussion from Ukraine to our own defense and to building our military
      industry and to how we deal with filling out the numbers of our men and women
      at arms — that changes the discussion completely. And it’s all about their retaining
      power. Because if there is this big threat from the East, then the logic is we
      are the leaders, like as Ursula von der Leyen was saying, trying to defend herself
      against charges of fraud and abuse of power over vaccines. And how does she defend
      herself? Well, “We are now facing a very important threat from Russia, and we
      need strong leadership”, meaning herself. That’s what it’s all about, is keeping
      their hands on power at all costs, whether it serves the national interest or
      not. 27:30 National interest, not to mention Ukraine’s interest, don’t count.
      The spoils of power, what it’s all about. And here in Europe, in most of Europe,
      with exceptions, France is an exception because the way it structures its governments
      differently. But most of the European countries have coalition governments. And
      the whole game of a coalition government is dividing the spoils of power. So that
      is the center of attention of everybody at the top in Europe today. Not Ukraine,
      not Mr. Trump, not tariffs, but keeping power. Diesen: 28:12 So the initial or
      the main argument for the past three-plus years– in terms of boycotting all diplomacy,
      rejecting negotiations and instead just pumping weapons into the war– the argument
      was, “Well, we need to put the Ukrainians in a better position. We’ll negotiate
      later once the Ukrainians can negotiate from a position of strength.” Does anyone
      actually believe this in Europe now? I mean, your position there in Brussels,
      because it does seem as if it’s becoming harder to deny that the war is shifting
      more and more in the favor of Russia. That is the Ukrainians having more and more
      problems building up. The Russians keep strengthening in the rear. 29:07 And also,
      again, in a war of attrition, you should look at the ratio of casualties. But
      the West, we tend to focus excessively on the territorial shifts. But even this
      is starting to intensify. We see now the semi-encirclement of Pokrovsk, which
      would be a strategic disaster, opening up the road all the way to the Dnieper
      and of course, Constanivka, which would then begin to seal off the entire Donetsk
      region. So there’s a desperation in there, isn’t there? I mean, so what exactly
      do they hope to achieve here? Doctorow: 29:51 Let’s divide up the West, because
      the United States is running on its own course. And in the question of how the
      war is proceeding, the United States is much more open than Western Europe journalism.
      A little bit seeps in here, in the press, but it’s really in “New York Times”
      and the British press. I think the “Financial Times” also has articles which run
      completely counter to the editorial position of newspaper. Journalists are reporting
      what’s going on. “New York Times”, they are every few days speaking about Ukrainian
      retreats or losses and the Russian advances. No question about it. They’re preparing
      the public for Ukrainian defeat. 30:38 The most important indication of that was
      what appeared on Monday in the “New York Times”. They had a front-page article
      on the crimes that the Ukrainians committed during their occupation of Kursk oblost.
      This was immediately denounced by Kiev as dissemination of vile propaganda. The
      “New York Times”, for the first time in the whole war, had an article devoted
      strictly to the war crimes that the Ukrainians are committing. Now that tells
      you they’re preparing the public for the Ukrainian defeat and they will find many
      reasons why they should have lost the war. I say the game is moving on, the competition
      now is not about the fate of Ukraine. It’s about the future of the present-day
      leaders in Europe, who have committed so much of their personal prestige and political
      power to winning a war that they’re losing. And so they’re diverting attention
      to, well 2029, how we have to be prepared for Russian invasion and so forth. They’re
      changing the subject, because they lost this subject. Diesen: 31:54 Well, the
      use of the media to exercise narrative control and prepare the public for a defeat
      in Ukraine — I was thinking the same when I saw the gradual shift in the media
      coverage in the United States. And of course, this “New York Times” article was
      quite important as well. The fact that you had an American journalist from the
      “New York Times”, I think she was already, well, the journalist was accompanying
      Ahmad through Kursk. I mean, the fact that this was being done and the conclusion
      on the coverage was the Ukrainian war crimes. This is something unthinkable two,
      three years ago, when the Ukrainians could do no wrong and every person even with
      a SWAT sticker had to be, the first instinct was always to whitewash it. But in
      Europe though, I do not see this at all, especially in, well, I’m located in Scandinavia,
      and here the war propaganda is just going full steam ahead, hardly any changes.
      And indeed to suggest that Ukraine can’t win the war is denounced as Russian propaganda,
      trying to reduce public support for what we call “helping Ukraine”, which is pushing
      a war which the Ukrainians themselves want an end to. 33:21 But of all the Europeans,
      for many people, well, if you would have said this four years ago, that Germany
      would position themselves as the main country to essentially take over the fight
      against Russia now that America is pulling back — this would have been very much
      unthinkable a few years ago, but here we are. How are you reading the German position?
      Because it’s not simply Merz; this is something deeper in German society, isn’t
      it? Doctorow: 33:53 It covers the whole political spectrum. I believe this started
      with the Alternative fur Deutschland, when they were the first to speak up, well
      this goes back five years or more, the first to speak up and say, “Hey, we are
      not responsible for the sins of our grandparents. We are new people, we are new
      people, and we have to look after our sovereignty.” That was Avdei. And it’s covered
      now the whole spectrum of German political life, where they do not take responsibility
      for the crimes that Germany committed across Europe, not just in the destruction
      of Jewry. They believe that they are morally clean, and they follow European values,
      and they can get up on a soft box and preach to, well, particularly the Russians,
      who are the _recidivists_ and who have to be properly punished for their violation
      of European values. So there is the real threat that this is across the whole
      German spectrum. They willfully are forgetting who they are. And they have changed
      the role. They openly changed the role. 35:17 The role changed under the German
      leadership going back 10 years. Merkel was responsible for changing the role,
      but she did not want to name Germany. Germany did not have a foreign policy, according
      to Merkel. The foreign policy was made in Brussels, very convenient. And who made
      it in Brussels? Germans, since they dominated the parliament and the commission.
      So de facto, Germany was the dominant force in European diplomacy and in world
      policy. But this was not acknowledged by the German leadership in Berlin. They
      hid behind the apron of Brussels. Now they’re coming out from behind the apron
      and saying, “Yes, we are going to be Europe’s dominant defender.” As if this is
      natural. It’s not natural. It was– the world for this was prepared by the gradual
      collapse of France and its authority. Not just the economic weakness of France,
      which was established decades ago compared to Germany, but its political weakness,
      a succession of disastrous presidents. And Mr. Macron is the latest uncrowned
      king under the French constitution, who defies the French political circles by
      holding onto power when he has maybe a 20 percent approval rating. The French
      are politically weak. The Germans have used that to move out in front, to muscle
      the French aside. Mr. Macron is making a desperate effort, his announcement on
      Bastille Day, that they are, “Oh, we are also raising our military budgets and
      to be big defenders.” 37:14 And as soon as the Germans start talking about possibly
      getting nuclear weapons, well, that is the absolute end of any French claims to
      being Europe’s defenders. They could hide behind the fact that they and the Brits
      were the only European countries with nuclear arms. If the Germans now aspire
      to do that too, then the moment of truth has arrived, and everything that the
      Germans aspired to in World War II, they now will be realizing, which is something
      that should give us pause. Diesen: 37:46 Well, the German shift or return to militarism,
      it appears to have, well, it’s not exactly that reason. That is, yes, throughout
      the Cold War, they had this very cautious idea that, you know, learned from history,
      they’re not going to engage in wars any more. But after the Cold War, in 1999,
      the attack on Yugoslavia, that is to wrestle away Kosovo, you saw the logic in
      the German argument shifting. So in the past, their history of genocide was a
      reason for why they had to be more constrained. And suddenly over Kosovo, the
      argument was, well, because of our history with genocide, we have a special responsibility
      to prevent it other places. So instead of their genocidal history being a reason
      for constraint, it was now a reason for taking action. And you see similar rhetoric
      in Gaza, that is, as if they owed the Jewish population a debt, which is very
      fair enough after the Holocaust, but this is translated into unconditional support
      for Israel in effectively making the Palestinians pay for the crimes of the Germans
      by supporting the genocide there. 39:05 And also during the Kursk operation, when
      you had German generals appearing on TV, you know, with smiles on their face,
      being excited as they were speaking about how this was humiliating for the Russians.
      This was an important part of World War II and almost like a redo of World War
      II, as they saw German tanks roll into Russia. It’s very unsettling. But besides
      how the Russians are looking at this, how would the Europeans react? I mean, you
      mentioned the French. Certainly the French do not want to be pushed aside. They
      kind of had a division of labor. The Germans were the economic force, the French
      were the military and that kind of creates some balance of power within the European
      Union. Now that you know Germany is going to acquire weapons of mass destruction
      and nuclear weapons, how comfortable are really the Europeans with this? I think
      it was Thatcher already in her time, [who] warned that the German unification
      could bring about the Fourth Reich. I mean, it’s not to argue that we overcome
      this historical concern. It would be an exaggeration, wouldn’t it? Doctorow: 40:21
      Well, it wasn’t just a Thatcher. Miserand also, he said, “I’ve been liking Germany
      so much, we want to see two of them.” That concern about Germany existed. And
      as to Germany’s coming out, so to speak, over Kosovo, actually that was, I think,
      precipitated by American action. The whole crisis in the Yugoslav Civil War, was,
      had a defining moment, and that was the attacks on Sarajevo, the marketplace,
      I think this was 1996, correct me, and Germany could not bring itself to re-enter
      Yugoslavia, again, considering the history of Germany’s devastating wars on Yugoslavia
      during World War II, or attacks and destruction in Yugoslavia in World War II.
      The Americans moved in, the Americans took charge, and then that relieved the
      Germans to do what comes naturally. And to go back to bossing people around in
      these fringe parts of Europe. 41:46 So America had its own role in relieving Germany
      of its constraints and its hesitation, by bringing it into a coalition of NATO
      that were doing what Germany was afraid to do, because that had been a dividing
      line before World War I. What was– Serbia triggered World War I, and Germany did
      not want to get into that region again. Well, it is, and it is in a lot of other
      places where it shouldn’t be. And I have now in mind Mr. Merz’s very proud establishment
      of the German presence in the Baltics to “protect the Eastern flank”. So the way
      NATO had protected Germany during the First Cold War. The German position, is
      there a militarism? I don’t know. I put my finger to the wind. I don’t think so.
      There is, again, opportunism for the sake of political power in the hands of Mr.
      Merz and the people around him. 42:57 I’m not sure that that is founded on a militaristic
      feeling or enthusiasm in the German nation. I rather doubt it. Whether this develops,
      we’ll see. Diesen: 43:12 Yeah, I think the Bosnian market attack must have been
      in ’94 because [Dayton] came in ’95 and then Bosnia was finished. But I was wondering
      though, the one thing that the Russians are looking at when they look towards
      Germany is the Taurus missiles. As we know, Mertz used to advocate for them. Now
      there seems to be some discussions that will let Ukraine build something similar
      to the Taurus missile, which the whole thing seems to be dubious as if they’re
      looking for a cover to supply the missiles. Did you think that some version of
      the Taurus missile will be supplied or already has been supplied? And if so, what
      do you expect the Russian response to be? Because my impression is that of all
      the European countries, a lot of the resentment now is directed towards Germany.
      And given that they’re competing with the British for animosity, it’s kind of
      impressive how the Germans have moved up the ranks in terms of being seen as an
      adversary, if not an enemy then of Russia? 44:23 [We’ll have] the number one enemy
      of Russia. When Mr. Soloviyov on his famous, on his well-known programs directly
      calls Mr. Merz a Nazi several times. And not as a joke, but as a dead serious
      accusation, I take that as being a word coming from the Kremlin, certainly Mr.
      Medvedev would make similar statements. So they have earned the position of Russia’s
      enemy number one. As to the Taurus, I think that Mr. Putin would be in a very
      tough spot if the Taurus is actually used by the Ukrainians, because that is openly
      crossing his most important red line, that he has discussed in interviews with
      Pavel Zarubinuk, that had then been shown repeatedly on Russian television and
      in the West, saying that these weapons cannot properly be controlled by the Ukrainians
      themselves and implicate as co-belligerents those who have supplied the weapons
      like Taurus to Ukraine. 45:34 The same is true, of course, of ATACMS. Even if
      the Ukrainians are properly instructed on how, what button to push or when, the
      coding of the path, flight path, the decisions on targeting are all taken by,
      and the information necessary from satellite intelligence is coming from the United
      States. And so for Putin to accept this, I think he might as well just give up
      and stop the war and be overthrown, because that’s what it would mean. It’s incredible.
      It’s impossible that he could hold on to power if he did not follow through on
      his threats to the United States, to Germany for attacks coming via these long-range
      missiles. And by the way, I firmly believe that some Taurus are already in Kiev,
      going back several months. Whenever the announcement is made that “in [not long],
      a month or two, we will ship”, it means they already are there. Diesen: 46:47
      So, well, by the way, I agree with that assessment. I also think this would be
      the final straw that it would make it impossible for Russia not to attack. People
      keep saying, oh, why would they risk this? But, well, certainly Germany is willing
      to risk the war. So it would be too high cost, I think, for the Russians to do
      nothing. But what exactly could they do? They would be, you know, you have different
      targets, which would indicate different levels of escalation. Rather than attacking
      German military bases, wouldn’t it make, do you see it as more likely to attack
      German, I guess, industrial facilities where these weapons are actually being
      made? Or what do you see as, well, again, we can’t get into President Putin’s
      head, but what do you see as likely or possible targets for the Russians to retaliate
      against Germany. Doctorow: 47:51 I think we have to try to get into his head in
      one respect, and I continue the point I made earlier. The man has a legalistic
      frame of mind. I think we got a hint how this will play out in a recent statement
      by Lavrov that if these Taurus are implemented, if their use is authorized from
      Ukraine and attacks on Russia, then Russia will break all the relations with Germany.
      Now, what does that mean? That’s what you do when you’re declaring war. So essentially,
      again, I don’t believe that Putin will attack anybody without a declaration of
      war. And I think that that’s what would happen. He would declare a war on Germany
      and then he would strike. 48:44 And what he strikes, a military base or these
      production sites, is a secondary consideration. I don’t think this has been properly
      factored into the recommendations that Karaganov made two years ago. He was not
      looking at Putin’s way of thinking. “Yes, we have to do this, we take them seriously,
      our red lines have to be taken seriously, we have to use a tactical nuclear weapon
      somewhere in Western Europe, blah blah.” 49:14 But that is utterly out of character
      and out of the professional mindset of one Vladimir Putin. So I take very closely
      the words of Lavrov about breaking relations. Similarly, you’ll notice that when
      I think about Mr.– why the Russian stock market went up 4 percent after Trump
      made his announcement to the press in the White House together with Putin: because
      there was nothing about confiscating the frozen assets. That surely is what drove
      the money people in Moscow, because the concern is that for the relative small
      amount of frozen assets in the States, this would be a signal to Europe to attack
      the 250 billion euros in assets that are sitting in EuroClear here in Belgium.
      That didn’t happen because you confiscate assets in state of war. It’s another
      way of declaring war and would be interpreted that way by the Russians. Diesen:
      50:28 Well, Thank you for your time. I think, you know, this is a very important
      perspective, especially when you’re discussing an actor such as Donald Trump and
      well, his administration now acting deliberately with strategic ambiguity, then
      I guess we’re all vulnerable to our own biases. We might see what we want to see
      when he’s sending out all these very different signals. So I think what you brought
      up is, many people might have been missing some of these subtleties. So yeah,
      this is, yeah, gives me something to think about. So thank you so much for your
      time. Doctorow: 51:10 My pleasure. Bye bye.'
    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion between Prof. Glenn Diesen and historian Gilbert
      Doctorow, they explore the complexities and perceived erratic behavior of Trump's
      relationship with Putin, particularly in light of Trump's anger over Russia's
      actions in Ukraine despite their conversations.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, Professor Glenn Diesen and historian
      Gilbert Doctorow analyzed former President Trump's contradictory statements regarding
      Russia's actions in Ukraine, particularly his expressed anger towards Putin despite
      ongoing bombings in Ukraine. Doctorow noted that while experts in independent
      media agree on the facts surrounding the situation, they diverge significantly
      in their interpretations, particularly regarding the implications of Trump's potential
      military support for Ukraine, such as the delivery of Patriot missiles and discussions
      about long-range missiles. The uncertainty surrounding the specifics of U.S. arm
      shipments to Ukraine complicates the understanding of Trump's strategic intentions,
      leaving observers puzzled about his seemingly erratic behavior and its motivations.

      Prof. Glenn Diesen: 0:00 Hi everyone and welcome. We are joined again by Gilbert
      Doctorow, historian, international affairs analyst, and also author of many books
      such as the “War Diaries – the Russia-Ukraine War”, [for] which I will add a link
      in the description. So yeah, welcome back to the program. Gilbert Doctorow, PhD:
      Yeah, very good to speak to you again. Diesen: So one of the more recent news
      is that Trump says he’s very angry with Putin. He says they have a nice conversation,
      but then in the evening he goes on bombing Ukraine. And as always, it’s some uncertainty
      in terms of the difference between the noise and the action. Either he’s seeking
      to manage opposition at home and in Europe, or he’s lacking in strategic focus
      and being, you know, swinging a bit back and forth. It’s, I haven’t been able
      to solve this riddle, if I can be honest. It’s, it’s very, it seems like very
      erratic behavior often. 1:11 So I was wondering if you can, well, try to share
      your perspective and shed some light on what you think is happening here, because
      it doesn’t seem to make much sense, even his argument or even the way he’s going
      back and forth. Doctorow: Well, this is one instance of very important international
      news where the leading, or the best, most widely seen experts on independent media,
      on various YouTube channels, are agreed more or less on the facts, and are completely
      in disagreement over the interpretation. We won’t have a clear indication of what
      the interpretation is, until we know what the content of his arm shipments to
      Ukraine [is]. So far we only know about Patriots. There is speculation that’s
      partly encouraged by his reported discussion with Zelensky over long-range missiles.
      Can he reach Moscow, can he reach Petersburg? 2:38 And of course, this fired up
      a lot of speculation about Trump’s possibly giving this important offensive weaponry
      to Ukraine. We don’t know anything though. That is all– I consider what he’s doing
      is a continuation of what we’ve seen in the past several months on various international
      developments. This is political theater. And he is playing it for all it’s worth.
      He gets in front of the television cameras daily. He’s on international news.
      There’s only one person making the news these days, and his name is Donald Trump.
      So in that sense, the narcissist Trump can be very happy. 3:19 But is there anything
      more to it than that? Is he, as one extreme interpretation, a hazard, that is
      by Scott Ritter, is he an idiot? Are the people around him all idiots? Is the
      Congress populated by idiots? Well, I personally find that a very poor start for
      serious analysis of most anything, to assume that your opponents or the leading
      figures of the day are idiots. I prefer to consider what is behind what seemed
      to be strange or ineffectual actions. Can it be something else going on? One person
      who has taken that approach, who has a lot of respect in alternative media, and
      not only, is Colonel Douglas Macgregor, who was saying that Trump adopted the
      least-bad solution to the pressure he’s been receiving from Congress and from
      Europe to respond to Putin’s very aggressive and very destructive new attacks,
      aerial attacks on Ukraine. So that was a kind of middle position. I take a position
      that goes a little bit further than Colonel Macgregor on the political side. 4:45
      And that is that Trump knew very well what he was doing. He was saying what he
      said about arms deliveries, about new sanctions and secondary tariffs on Russia,
      precisely to silence his critics, to give satisfaction to the most, the loudest-talking
      member of the Republican group in Congress, in the Senate, Lindsey Graham. Graham
      could take pride that the bill that he is steering through the Senate now has
      the support of Trump, who on his own initiative has stated to the public that
      he will be adopting the key point here of secondary tariffs at a hundred percent.
      Well, that’s one thing, silence the critics. I can tell you that my recent appearances
      on various video programs has been picked up by the Russians. And they pick up
      precisely this point from my message, which to my mind is the least important
      part of my message, that he was silencing his critics. No, for me the most important
      thing is the 50 days. The fact that he has given President Putin 50 days is indicative
      that he has little or no intention of continuing the war, of making Biden’s war
      his own war, but instead is giving Mr. Putin time to finish up the job, in the
      same way that he instructed Netanyahu early in his presidency to get on with it,
      do whatever dastardly things you have to do in Gaza, but let’s be done with it
      and move on. That’s what he was saying to my way of thinking, to Vladimir Putin.
      5:41 But none of us will know what really has happened. Has he joined the new
      cons? Has he made common cause with them? Or is he duping them, as I believe,
      with these words about sanctions and arms shootings, and intends to go for his
      detente? The proof will be what is in that package of weapons being shipped. Diesen:
      7:07 Yeah, the 50 days. I was thinking a bit about this as well. It could be a
      delaying tactic in order to not have to pick a side or make any big decisions
      because again, he wants to normalize relations with the Russians, but he doesn’t
      want to alienate too many in his own camp. It could also, as you said, allow the
      Russians to finish off what they’re doing. Well it could also be an effort to
      negotiate, to put some pressures, a deadline. So it can be interpreted in many
      ways. But this is something that confused the Europeans a bit as well. Why do
      we have to wait 50 days for these sanctions? And his response was simply, well,
      50 days isn’t that much. Maybe it comes earlier. But I’m often inclined to lean
      in the direction that there is incompetence or as you said, the stupidity, but
      on the other hand, he does from, yeah, from the past decades, he’s always talked
      about the importance of strategic ambiguity when you negotiate. And he does like
      to think of himself as a negotiator. So if you, if you’re … playing with [a] too-open
      hand, it’s very difficult to … get the deals you want. So again, this is something
      his own administration says as well. “We won’t let anyone know exactly what we’re
      thinking or what we’re doing.” This is what he was always criticizing Biden for
      as well. 8:45 So if it works or not, putting that aside, nonetheless, I think
      we can conclusively say that this is something he believes in, this strategic
      ambiguity. So I do see the argument there, that ambiguity allows him to get some
      room for maneuver to do other things. And the pressure, as you said, has been
      mounting, given that the Russian strikes last night on Kharkov are becoming much
      more brutal in nature, that is both the quantity and the targeting. So one can
      see why there will have to be some reaction. But I guess your argument though,
      is that his response to this is to talk big, but it’s somewhat muted because it
      all depends, I guess, on the weapons he’s sending. 9:41 And I’m not sure if I’m
      understanding this correctly, but to what extent are the Americans sending weapons,
      or to what extent are they actually selling them? Because it seems as if he’s
      selling weapons to the Europeans, and the Europeans can give it to Ukraine, and
      somehow this has to happen under the umbrella of NATO for some reason? Doctorow:
      10:03 That’s a distinction without a difference. The question that I had in my
      mind is: is he just going to ship more of the same, meaning more tanks, more Bradleys,
      more artillery shells, so much as they have them, which certainly must have been
      in the pipeline. Let’s come back to this question, is this Biden’s war or Trump’s
      war? What he said about the ship was authorized under Biden. This is not new appropriations
      from Congress. So in that sense, I think it is not proper to speak about these
      shipments making it Trump’s war. Now, if indeed, it is materiel that was authorized
      by Biden, then it is no cause for worry, because there’s nothing that will threaten
      the Russians, or will change or will escalate the war. However, if new items are
      being put in, and particularly offensive weapons, long-range missiles, like ATACMS,
      which were never shipped, if they are now in the mix, then it’s a very different
      readout of what Trump is doing. And he would be going beyond the irresponsibility
      button to a new level that takes us to World War III. 11:28 The Russians have
      made it plain by their latest revised nuclear doctrine that if they are hit by
      such weapons– this was either, it was originally discussed with respect to ATACMS
      and with respect to Taurus– if they are hit with this, they can respond with nuclear
      arms. And I find it incredible that Trump’s team would not take this into account
      and would authorize ATACMS or something that could reach far into Russia. So I
      believe that we’re on the plane of empty rhetoric, shipping things which everyone
      knows will be of no use to the Ukrainians, because the tanks and the Bradleys
      will just be hidden in the forest since if they put them in the open space, they’ll
      be destroyed at once. Just as the Russians are not using their superiority in
      tanks on the ground. They are also hiding them in the forest and shooting out
      from under cover. And they’re using the tanks just as can, more precise can, with
      maybe 8-10 kilometer range. 12:44 The war has changed. And I don’t see my peers
      taking that into account properly. What we are witnessing now is massive air attack,
      not just that came into the head of Putin or his general staff. “Well, let’s try
      this.” No, it’s precisely because what they were doing up to this point has reached
      the point, the stage where it’s no longer productive. The Russians, to advance
      deep into Ukraine now, would have to take enormous losses because of the drone,
      the omnipresent Ukrainian drones on the battlefield. Therefore, they have gone
      to aerial bombardment. Now, once you’re in aerial bombardment and missile strikes,
      it’s only a half step to using those Oreshniks and getting the damn thing over
      with. If they take out, if they decapitate Kiev, which is entirely within their
      possibilities, then a lot of lives will be saved at all sides. 13:42 Now, this
      comes within the 50 days. It’s entirely possible to finish off Ukraine within
      50 days if they decapitate the country with the missiles they have ready. My question
      is, is Mr. Putin going to rise to that challenge? I don’t know. Nobody knows.
      And so we may be stuck with still stalling and stalling. As regards aerial attack,
      it doesn’t have a time limitation the way ground assalts do. Because of seasonality,
      there is a negligible factor in the devastation that is being brought. So if Putin
      responds both to the challenge, finish it up, and to the opportunity, now that
      he’s not going to be escalating, he’s already in the next stage of an aerial rather
      than ground war, we may see the end of this. 14:41 And I think that Trump could
      find this very satisfactory. Then the United States and Russia can put their heads
      together and say, “Well, what are we going to do to put Ukraine back together
      again?” Along the lines of Russia’s desirata of what they want as their end game.
      And Europe would be sidelined unless they invite them in on the same conditions.
      But let’s be constructive. Let’s talk about an investment fund. Let’s talk about
      a neutral Ukraine. And we’re talking about a rump Ukraine. That could be the basis
      for moving on to detente. It’s all there. Am I right, am I wrong? We will know
      in a few weeks, depending on the content of the military package. 15:24 Yeah,
      that’s what I thought. Now I saw the weapons would be important because, well,
      if the, well, there’s some flaws in the, in the whole optimism, at least we see
      now in Europe. Because well, the Europeans, do they have the money? And do the
      Americans have the weapons to sell them? And do the Ukrainians have the human
      resources to operate them? I was wondering if you see it likely in terms of the
      Tomahawks being sent because this is something that you suggested that would trigger
      great concern among the Russians. Indeed, having Tomahawks and other missiles
      in Ukraine was one of the reasons for the invasion to begin with. But how worried
      should they be though? Because usually they have to be launched from, you know,
      warships or strategic bombers. To … what extent– I guess would make sense. Again,
      I’m never sure if this is a lack of [logic], flawed logic or if it’s a strategic
      ambiguity, but what kind of weapons would be crossing the line? Doctorow: 16:40
      Well, ATACMS to begin with. No one was talking about Tomahawks in the past. They
      were speaking about these precisely ground-launched missiles using the already
      existing HIMARS launchers. The United States shipped a lot of HIMARS, and the
      launchers arre there. And the same launchers can be used on the ground to launch
      the ATACMS. And that’s why there was great concern in Russia, because they are–
      the limitation on the Storm Shadow and the SCALP from France and also Taurus is
      that they are air-launched. And you have to have planes that are adapted to those
      particular missiles, and you have to have planes and pilots, and you have to have
      airfields, which the Russians have done a pretty good job of savaging. So if they
      were, as you say, the Tomahawks, the version exists, it can be ground launched,
      it’s quite exotic. 17:40 If these were to be supplied, then we’re heading into
      the unknown. I can’t imagine that Trump could agree to that, because it would
      be a level of escalation that takes us just to the brink of nuclear war. Diesen:
      So what can we expect then from the Russians in the next 50 days? You used the
      word “decapitating” strike. Do you think they can try to go in for finishing off
      Ukraine? Because again, we’ve spoken in the past about the danger of underestimating
      the resilience of Ukraine. That is, they do keep fighting on. I thought things
      would have begun to collapse militarily as well as politically a long time ago,
      but here they are. They’re still putting up a pretty good fight. But given the
      huge intensity now, increasing intensity from the Russian side, in attacking targets
      across Ukraine, do you think they are going for, if not knocking out the military,
      then going for the political leadership or something to put an end to this war?
      Because in the war of attrition, you do exhaust the adversary, but the Ukrainians
      appear quite exhausted now. At least an attempt by the Russians to go for this
      over the next 50 days. Or if this is as you suggest, Trump’s purpose might be
      to give the Russians 50 days to get this done with, whatever they want to do and
      then end the war. Is this what they might spend their 50 days on? Doctorow: There’s
      one issue here that has to be addressed, and that is the nature of Mr. Putin.
      Not just that he’s very cautious, but that he approaches everything from a lawyer’s
      perspective, being a trained lawyer. And that has its up side and its down side.
      In the given case, I cannot see him giving orders for a decapitating strike under
      the terms of the Special Military Operation. That would be illegal, as he would
      determine it. 19:50 However, Mr. Zelensky should be careful about what he wishes
      for. If he receives any offensive weapons, which he then uses and strikes within
      the Russian Federation at what they consider to be strategic assets, then Mr.
      Putin would declare war. That would be considered an act of war. He declares war,
      and then it can decapitate Ukraine, in the context, only in the context of a declared
      war, from the perspective of Mr. Putin’s mentality. So there’s the qualification
      on how the 50 days could be used. I don’t think that Donald Trump is aware of
      that feature in Putin’s behavior. Certainly Mr. Trump himself doesn’t care a whit
      for law, what’s written even in the constitution. So it could not occur to him
      that Mr. Putin would. And that is exactly the case. There has to be a declaration
      of war for the Ukrainians to receive their decapitating strike. Diesen: 21:00
      I also want to get your opinion on an item in the news, which was that Trump had
      allegedly asked Zelensky if he’s able to strike Moscow or St. Petersburg, so Putin
      would feel the pain. And then later on he was asked, I think it was on the tarmac,
      the same question. And he said, “Oh, no, no, I don’t want him to Moscow.” Do you
      have any thoughts around this back and forth? Doctorow: He was feeding the jackals.
      And the jackals picked it up. They picked up this piece of rotting flesh very
      nicely. By here I mean the BBC. They have gone into overdrive on how Mr. Trump
      is fed up with Putin. He’s now aligned with the haws in Congress and and so forth.
      I don’t believe that for a minute. But again, this is my my best guess. It is
      not founded on anything concrete, because we just discussed what the missing pieces
      to the puzzle are, which will decide whether the puzzle is being assembled, the
      jigsaw puzzle is being assembled properly or wrongly. 22:11 The discussion was
      piquant, he knew it would attract the press. It did, of course; as I say it’s
      all over the BBC today. That’s just what they wanted to hear, that is giving Zelensky
      hopes that he can strike Moscow and St. Petersburg. Diesen: But the, yeah, you
      referred to the, give them hope to the, to the Europeans and the hawks within
      the United States as well as Zelensky. But if Trump wanted to end this war and
      he knows that Russia considers this to be an existential threat and it won’t move
      much on its key demands — wouldn’t Trump need to mount more pressure on the Ukrainians
      and Europeans as opposed to, I guess, throwing them some red meat and, well, making
      them feel more comfortable with this leadership and the possibility of continuing
      this war instead? Doctorow: 23:11 Again, we’re in the realm of political theater.
      And I don’t believe the seriousness of what he has tossed out to the press. As
      I’ve said, he despises the press and he’ll say anything, that he thinks will make
      them look like fools. Diesen: And, I guess the last back and forth I noticed of
      Trump was the arms deliveries. It was reported that, I think it was Pete Hegseth
      that halted arms deliveries to Ukraine. Again, with the engagement with the media,
      he was first asked, well, he was, he first stated that he wasn’t sure who had
      halted the arms deliveries. And when he was asked, “Don’t you know what’s happening
      in your own administration?” He said, “Well, I will be the first one to know.
      Indeed, I would have ordered it.” Except, you know, he didn’t. So how do you make
      sense of this? Doctorow: 24:13 Well, there isn’t any sense to make of it. He’s
      contradicting himself. And again, it is another expression of his contempt for
      the press. He’ll say anything to them. He doesn’t take them seriously, with good
      reason. He is treated very badly by Fox News, by CNN, he’s treated with contempt
      by them and he returns the coin. So I wouldn’t follow this too closely. Don’t
      look for logic in what he says with a microphone in front of him. I follow what
      his feet are doing and particularly I place emphasis on 50 days, which undermines
      everything else. As you said, he could impose these sanctions tomorrow. He didn’t
      do that. And so I don’t believe he ever will. Diesen: 25:11 Okay, so if you put
      the American side of this war aside to conclude him more or less pursuing strategic
      ambiguity. We won’t really know yet if he’s appeasing the hawks, the neocons,
      or if he’s joined them, but we should know based on the weapons which are delivered.
      Again, the Tomahawks or any long range missiles. This is kind of the red lines.
      But if we shift over to the Europeans, what is the strategy of Europe? Are they
      hoping that any of these weapons would turn the tide or, or is it just to pull
      America further into this, to make it a long war? What is– it’s very hard to read
      the Europeans, and here one gets the impression sometimes that there’s no one
      behind the wheel. Doctorow: 26:07 Oh, there are people behind the wheel, but I
      think they’re driving a different vehicle, and they’re concerned with a different
      road. The road that interests them is power and retaining it. They have put themselves
      in very fragile position by backing to the hilt a losing cause. And for them now
      to move the discussion from Ukraine to our own defense and to building our military
      industry and to how we deal with filling out the numbers of our men and women
      at arms — that changes the discussion completely. And it’s all about their retaining
      power. Because if there is this big threat from the East, then the logic is we
      are the leaders, like as Ursula von der Leyen was saying, trying to defend herself
      against charges of fraud and abuse of power over vaccines. And how does she defend
      herself? Well, “We are now facing a very important threat from Russia, and we
      need strong leadership”, meaning herself. That’s what it’s all about, is keeping
      their hands on power at all costs, whether it serves the national interest or
      not. 27:30 National interest, not to mention Ukraine’s interest, don’t count.
      The spoils of power, what it’s all about. And here in Europe, in most of Europe,
      with exceptions, France is an exception because the way it structures its governments
      differently. But most of the European countries have coalition governments. And
      the whole game of a coalition government is dividing the spoils of power. So that
      is the center of attention of everybody at the top in Europe today. Not Ukraine,
      not Mr. Trump, not tariffs, but keeping power. Diesen: 28:12 So the initial or
      the main argument for the past three-plus years– in terms of boycotting all diplomacy,
      rejecting negotiations and instead just pumping weapons into the war– the argument
      was, “Well, we need to put the Ukrainians in a better position. We’ll negotiate
      later once the Ukrainians can negotiate from a position of strength.” Does anyone
      actually believe this in Europe now? I mean, your position there in Brussels,
      because it does seem as if it’s becoming harder to deny that the war is shifting
      more and more in the favor of Russia. That is the Ukrainians having more and more
      problems building up. The Russians keep strengthening in the rear. 29:07 And also,
      again, in a war of attrition, you should look at the ratio of casualties. But
      the West, we tend to focus excessively on the territorial shifts. But even this
      is starting to intensify. We see now the semi-encirclement of Pokrovsk, which
      would be a strategic disaster, opening up the road all the way to the Dnieper
      and of course, Constanivka, which would then begin to seal off the entire Donetsk
      region. So there’s a desperation in there, isn’t there? I mean, so what exactly
      do they hope to achieve here? Doctorow: 29:51 Let’s divide up the West, because
      the United States is running on its own course. And in the question of how the
      war is proceeding, the United States is much more open than Western Europe journalism.
      A little bit seeps in here, in the press, but it’s really in “New York Times”
      and the British press. I think the “Financial Times” also has articles which run
      completely counter to the editorial position of newspaper. Journalists are reporting
      what’s going on. “New York Times”, they are every few days speaking about Ukrainian
      retreats or losses and the Russian advances. No question about it. They’re preparing
      the public for Ukrainian defeat. 30:38 The most important indication of that was
      what appeared on Monday in the “New York Times”. They had a front-page article
      on the crimes that the Ukrainians committed during their occupation of Kursk oblost.
      This was immediately denounced by Kiev as dissemination of vile propaganda. The
      “New York Times”, for the first time in the whole war, had an article devoted
      strictly to the war crimes that the Ukrainians are committing. Now that tells
      you they’re preparing the public for the Ukrainian defeat and they will find many
      reasons why they should have lost the war. I say the game is moving on, the competition
      now is not about the fate of Ukraine. It’s about the future of the present-day
      leaders in Europe, who have committed so much of their personal prestige and political
      power to winning a war that they’re losing. And so they’re diverting attention
      to, well 2029, how we have to be prepared for Russian invasion and so forth. They’re
      changing the subject, because they lost this subject. Diesen: 31:54 Well, the
      use of the media to exercise narrative control and prepare the public for a defeat
      in Ukraine — I was thinking the same when I saw the gradual shift in the media
      coverage in the United States. And of course, this “New York Times” article was
      quite important as well. The fact that you had an American journalist from the
      “New York Times”, I think she was already, well, the journalist was accompanying
      Ahmad through Kursk. I mean, the fact that this was being done and the conclusion
      on the coverage was the Ukrainian war crimes. This is something unthinkable two,
      three years ago, when the Ukrainians could do no wrong and every person even with
      a SWAT sticker had to be, the first instinct was always to whitewash it. But in
      Europe though, I do not see this at all, especially in, well, I’m located in Scandinavia,
      and here the war propaganda is just going full steam ahead, hardly any changes.
      And indeed to suggest that Ukraine can’t win the war is denounced as Russian propaganda,
      trying to reduce public support for what we call “helping Ukraine”, which is pushing
      a war which the Ukrainians themselves want an end to. 33:21 But of all the Europeans,
      for many people, well, if you would have said this four years ago, that Germany
      would position themselves as the main country to essentially take over the fight
      against Russia now that America is pulling back — this would have been very much
      unthinkable a few years ago, but here we are. How are you reading the German position?
      Because it’s not simply Merz; this is something deeper in German society, isn’t
      it? Doctorow: 33:53 It covers the whole political spectrum. I believe this started
      with the Alternative fur Deutschland, when they were the first to speak up, well
      this goes back five years or more, the first to speak up and say, “Hey, we are
      not responsible for the sins of our grandparents. We are new people, we are new
      people, and we have to look after our sovereignty.” That was Avdei. And it’s covered
      now the whole spectrum of German political life, where they do not take responsibility
      for the crimes that Germany committed across Europe, not just in the destruction
      of Jewry. They believe that they are morally clean, and they follow European values,
      and they can get up on a soft box and preach to, well, particularly the Russians,
      who are the _recidivists_ and who have to be properly punished for their violation
      of European values. So there is the real threat that this is across the whole
      German spectrum. They willfully are forgetting who they are. And they have changed
      the role. They openly changed the role. 35:17 The role changed under the German
      leadership going back 10 years. Merkel was responsible for changing the role,
      but she did not want to name Germany. Germany did not have a foreign policy, according
      to Merkel. The foreign policy was made in Brussels, very convenient. And who made
      it in Brussels? Germans, since they dominated the parliament and the commission.
      So de facto, Germany was the dominant force in European diplomacy and in world
      policy. But this was not acknowledged by the German leadership in Berlin. They
      hid behind the apron of Brussels. Now they’re coming out from behind the apron
      and saying, “Yes, we are going to be Europe’s dominant defender.” As if this is
      natural. It’s not natural. It was– the world for this was prepared by the gradual
      collapse of France and its authority. Not just the economic weakness of France,
      which was established decades ago compared to Germany, but its political weakness,
      a succession of disastrous presidents. And Mr. Macron is the latest uncrowned
      king under the French constitution, who defies the French political circles by
      holding onto power when he has maybe a 20 percent approval rating. The French
      are politically weak. The Germans have used that to move out in front, to muscle
      the French aside. Mr. Macron is making a desperate effort, his announcement on
      Bastille Day, that they are, “Oh, we are also raising our military budgets and
      to be big defenders.” 37:14 And as soon as the Germans start talking about possibly
      getting nuclear weapons, well, that is the absolute end of any French claims to
      being Europe’s defenders. They could hide behind the fact that they and the Brits
      were the only European countries with nuclear arms. If the Germans now aspire
      to do that too, then the moment of truth has arrived, and everything that the
      Germans aspired to in World War II, they now will be realizing, which is something
      that should give us pause. Diesen: 37:46 Well, the German shift or return to militarism,
      it appears to have, well, it’s not exactly that reason. That is, yes, throughout
      the Cold War, they had this very cautious idea that, you know, learned from history,
      they’re not going to engage in wars any more. But after the Cold War, in 1999,
      the attack on Yugoslavia, that is to wrestle away Kosovo, you saw the logic in
      the German argument shifting. So in the past, their history of genocide was a
      reason for why they had to be more constrained. And suddenly over Kosovo, the
      argument was, well, because of our history with genocide, we have a special responsibility
      to prevent it other places. So instead of their genocidal history being a reason
      for constraint, it was now a reason for taking action. And you see similar rhetoric
      in Gaza, that is, as if they owed the Jewish population a debt, which is very
      fair enough after the Holocaust, but this is translated into unconditional support
      for Israel in effectively making the Palestinians pay for the crimes of the Germans
      by supporting the genocide there. 39:05 And also during the Kursk operation, when
      you had German generals appearing on TV, you know, with smiles on their face,
      being excited as they were speaking about how this was humiliating for the Russians.
      This was an important part of World War II and almost like a redo of World War
      II, as they saw German tanks roll into Russia. It’s very unsettling. But besides
      how the Russians are looking at this, how would the Europeans react? I mean, you
      mentioned the French. Certainly the French do not want to be pushed aside. They
      kind of had a division of labor. The Germans were the economic force, the French
      were the military and that kind of creates some balance of power within the European
      Union. Now that you know Germany is going to acquire weapons of mass destruction
      and nuclear weapons, how comfortable are really the Europeans with this? I think
      it was Thatcher already in her time, [who] warned that the German unification
      could bring about the Fourth Reich. I mean, it’s not to argue that we overcome
      this historical concern. It would be an exaggeration, wouldn’t it? Doctorow: 40:21
      Well, it wasn’t just a Thatcher. Miserand also, he said, “I’ve been liking Germany
      so much, we want to see two of them.” That concern about Germany existed. And
      as to Germany’s coming out, so to speak, over Kosovo, actually that was, I think,
      precipitated by American action. The whole crisis in the Yugoslav Civil War, was,
      had a defining moment, and that was the attacks on Sarajevo, the marketplace,
      I think this was 1996, correct me, and Germany could not bring itself to re-enter
      Yugoslavia, again, considering the history of Germany’s devastating wars on Yugoslavia
      during World War II, or attacks and destruction in Yugoslavia in World War II.
      The Americans moved in, the Americans took charge, and then that relieved the
      Germans to do what comes naturally. And to go back to bossing people around in
      these fringe parts of Europe. 41:46 So America had its own role in relieving Germany
      of its constraints and its hesitation, by bringing it into a coalition of NATO
      that were doing what Germany was afraid to do, because that had been a dividing
      line before World War I. What was– Serbia triggered World War I, and Germany did
      not want to get into that region again. Well, it is, and it is in a lot of other
      places where it shouldn’t be. And I have now in mind Mr. Merz’s very proud establishment
      of the German presence in the Baltics to “protect the Eastern flank”. So the way
      NATO had protected Germany during the First Cold War. The German position, is
      there a militarism? I don’t know. I put my finger to the wind. I don’t think so.
      There is, again, opportunism for the sake of political power in the hands of Mr.
      Merz and the people around him. 42:57 I’m not sure that that is founded on a militaristic
      feeling or enthusiasm in the German nation. I rather doubt it. Whether this develops,
      we’ll see. Diesen: 43:12 Yeah, I think the Bosnian market attack must have been
      in ’94 because [Dayton] came in ’95 and then Bosnia was finished. But I was wondering
      though, the one thing that the Russians are looking at when they look towards
      Germany is the Taurus missiles. As we know, Mertz used to advocate for them. Now
      there seems to be some discussions that will let Ukraine build something similar
      to the Taurus missile, which the whole thing seems to be dubious as if they’re
      looking for a cover to supply the missiles. Did you think that some version of
      the Taurus missile will be supplied or already has been supplied? And if so, what
      do you expect the Russian response to be? Because my impression is that of all
      the European countries, a lot of the resentment now is directed towards Germany.
      And given that they’re competing with the British for animosity, it’s kind of
      impressive how the Germans have moved up the ranks in terms of being seen as an
      adversary, if not an enemy then of Russia? 44:23 [We’ll have] the number one enemy
      of Russia. When Mr. Soloviyov on his famous, on his well-known programs directly
      calls Mr. Merz a Nazi several times. And not as a joke, but as a dead serious
      accusation, I take that as being a word coming from the Kremlin, certainly Mr.
      Medvedev would make similar statements. So they have earned the position of Russia’s
      enemy number one. As to the Taurus, I think that Mr. Putin would be in a very
      tough spot if the Taurus is actually used by the Ukrainians, because that is openly
      crossing his most important red line, that he has discussed in interviews with
      Pavel Zarubinuk, that had then been shown repeatedly on Russian television and
      in the West, saying that these weapons cannot properly be controlled by the Ukrainians
      themselves and implicate as co-belligerents those who have supplied the weapons
      like Taurus to Ukraine. 45:34 The same is true, of course, of ATACMS. Even if
      the Ukrainians are properly instructed on how, what button to push or when, the
      coding of the path, flight path, the decisions on targeting are all taken by,
      and the information necessary from satellite intelligence is coming from the United
      States. And so for Putin to accept this, I think he might as well just give up
      and stop the war and be overthrown, because that’s what it would mean. It’s incredible.
      It’s impossible that he could hold on to power if he did not follow through on
      his threats to the United States, to Germany for attacks coming via these long-range
      missiles. And by the way, I firmly believe that some Taurus are already in Kiev,
      going back several months. Whenever the announcement is made that “in [not long],
      a month or two, we will ship”, it means they already are there. Diesen: 46:47
      So, well, by the way, I agree with that assessment. I also think this would be
      the final straw that it would make it impossible for Russia not to attack. People
      keep saying, oh, why would they risk this? But, well, certainly Germany is willing
      to risk the war. So it would be too high cost, I think, for the Russians to do
      nothing. But what exactly could they do? They would be, you know, you have different
      targets, which would indicate different levels of escalation. Rather than attacking
      German military bases, wouldn’t it make, do you see it as more likely to attack
      German, I guess, industrial facilities where these weapons are actually being
      made? Or what do you see as, well, again, we can’t get into President Putin’s
      head, but what do you see as likely or possible targets for the Russians to retaliate
      against Germany. Doctorow: 47:51 I think we have to try to get into his head in
      one respect, and I continue the point I made earlier. The man has a legalistic
      frame of mind. I think we got a hint how this will play out in a recent statement
      by Lavrov that if these Taurus are implemented, if their use is authorized from
      Ukraine and attacks on Russia, then Russia will break all the relations with Germany.
      Now, what does that mean? That’s what you do when you’re declaring war. So essentially,
      again, I don’t believe that Putin will attack anybody without a declaration of
      war. And I think that that’s what would happen. He would declare a war on Germany
      and then he would strike. 48:44 And what he strikes, a military base or these
      production sites, is a secondary consideration. I don’t think this has been properly
      factored into the recommendations that Karaganov made two years ago. He was not
      looking at Putin’s way of thinking. “Yes, we have to do this, we take them seriously,
      our red lines have to be taken seriously, we have to use a tactical nuclear weapon
      somewhere in Western Europe, blah blah.” 49:14 But that is utterly out of character
      and out of the professional mindset of one Vladimir Putin. So I take very closely
      the words of Lavrov about breaking relations. Similarly, you’ll notice that when
      I think about Mr.– why the Russian stock market went up 4 percent after Trump
      made his announcement to the press in the White House together with Putin: because
      there was nothing about confiscating the frozen assets. That surely is what drove
      the money people in Moscow, because the concern is that for the relative small
      amount of frozen assets in the States, this would be a signal to Europe to attack
      the 250 billion euros in assets that are sitting in EuroClear here in Belgium.
      That didn’t happen because you confiscate assets in state of war. It’s another
      way of declaring war and would be interpreted that way by the Russians. Diesen:
      50:28 Well, Thank you for your time. I think, you know, this is a very important
      perspective, especially when you’re discussing an actor such as Donald Trump and
      well, his administration now acting deliberately with strategic ambiguity, then
      I guess we’re all vulnerable to our own biases. We might see what we want to see
      when he’s sending out all these very different signals. So I think what you brought
      up is, many people might have been missing some of these subtleties. So yeah,
      this is, yeah, gives me something to think about. So thank you so much for your
      time. Doctorow: 51:10 My pleasure. Bye bye.'
    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion between Prof. Glenn Diesen and historian Gilbert
      Doctorow, they explore the complexities and perceived erratic behavior of Trump's
      relationship with Putin, particularly in light of Trump's anger over Russia's
      actions in Ukraine despite their conversations.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, Professor Glenn Diesen and historian
      Gilbert Doctorow analyzed former President Trump's contradictory statements regarding
      Russia's actions in Ukraine, particularly his expressed anger towards Putin despite
      ongoing bombings in Ukraine. Doctorow noted that while experts in independent
      media agree on the facts surrounding the situation, they diverge significantly
      in their interpretations, particularly regarding the implications of Trump's potential
      military support for Ukraine, such as the delivery of Patriot missiles and discussions
      about long-range missiles. The uncertainty surrounding the specifics of U.S. arm
      shipments to Ukraine complicates the understanding of Trump's strategic intentions,
      leaving observers puzzled about his seemingly erratic behavior and its motivations.

    url: https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/07/18/what-you-learn-about-the-impact-of-the-ukraine-war-from-your-belgian-doctor/
    text: 'This morning, I accompanied my wife on a visit to our generalist to get several
      prescriptions she needed renewed.  The doctor is of post-retirement age. He had
      plenty of time to chat and became very keen to advise me when I said I am considering
      recommending to our15 year old grandson that he apply his love for chemistry and
      biology by pursuing a career as a medical doctor. There is no numerus clausus
      in Belgium. The university studies are free and the degree is a good one. Our
      doctor warned me that here in Belgium practicing medicine is fast turning sour.
      The new Flemish run federal government of Prime Minister Bart De Wever that took
      office in January is raising its military hardware contributions to Ukraine, investing
      in new production of weapons at the Audi factory in downtown Brussels that closed
      a year ago in preparedness for the war with Russia that the Germans have penciled
      onto the European agenda. To pay for these war-related items, the De Wever government
      is cutting budgetary allocations to health and other social benefits. The doctors
      will see their consultation fees to patients cut by 20%. Hospitals and clinics
      are being ordered to retrench.  Said our doctor, you can already see the consequences
      in greatly lengthened waiting times for all kinds of services such as mammograms,
      now risen from a few days to 3 months; hip replacement surgery now risen from
      a few months to three years, and so on. There you have it: a crushing blow to
      what has been a magnificent medical establishment in Belgium, far better than
      in neighboring France and Germany, neither of which have recovered their luster
      from before Covid thanks to budgetary cuts in both countries to pay for you know
      what. Belgium probably was better situated because it had budgeted for defense
      at one of the lowest levels in the EU, at just 1.3% of GDP.  As that changes with
      the gradual ramp up first to 2% and then to 5%, we can expect social benefits
      in this country to go to hell. All of this is a kind of hidden cost of the war
      and of rearmament that may bring young doctors out on the street in strikes but
      will not prompt popular rebellion the way that introducing a military draft would.
      **** I use this occasion to share some information about Belgian politics that
      the Community is very unlikely to know but that reflects a bigger reality of politics
      within the Member States of the European Union, especially those where corruption
      festers under coalition governments. In such governments grabbing and holding
      ministerial portfolios is the primary concern of every politician, without respect
      to any semblance of policy coherence in the coalition as a whole. What can I possibly
      mean by corruption, you may ask? What is there worth stealing in little Belgium?
       An answer to these questions was set out in yesterday’s edition of the main French-speaking
      daily newspaper, Le Soir. It was in their article updating reports on the investigation
      into money laundering practiced for over a decade by a certain Didier Reynders,
      whose name you may recognize as the Justice Minister (first bit of irony in the
      case) in Ursula von der Leyen’s Commission from 2019 to 2024, when following Europe-wide
      elections in June of that year, the Commission had to be re-organized and Reynders
      was out of a job. In December 2024, Reyinders was out of a job and vulnerable
      to police-judicial investigation into crimes he is presumed to have committed
      not just during his tenure at the Commission but in the decade or more when he
      was a member of MR party led coalition governments in Belgium. For many years
      he had been Finance Minister (irony number two in this case) and then for a few
      years he was Minister of Foreign Affairs, for which he was the perfect candidate
      since he knew absolutely nothing about the subject. In Belgium, Reynders had served
      under a certain Charles Michel, his boss at the MR party, who was prime minister
      for several years before his government was brought down by the Flemish party
      that now openly runs the Belgian federal government.  Michel moved out of Belgium
      to become President of the European Council, the second EU executive body alongside
      the Commission that consists of the heads of state of the Member States. Reynders
      moved in tandem with Michel to become Justice Minister, as I said above. And so
      in early December 2024 we read a very lengthy account of the money laundering
      operations of this Reynders, who had deposited more than 800,000 euros in cash
      into long-duration deposit accounts at ING Bank Belgium. Cash!  Strictly verboten
      in large amounts.  Had ING followed the law, they would have asked him, as required,
      where the cash came from.  They didn’t till the case was going to court. The answer
      he gave in his court testimony was that the cash came from winnings in the state
      lottery. Probing by the courts turned up the fact that Reynders had for years
      been buying e-lottery tickets at a gas station not far from his house. He had
      bought the tickets with….cash and then transferred his legal winnings to his ING
      bank accounts. This is a classic model of money-laundering…performed by a Minister
      of Finance in tidy Belgium where no corruption cases are known about by those
      who compile the international registers of clean government. A couple of days
      ago, the same Le Soir carried an update to the Reynders investigation. It appears
      that Didier Reynders also told court investigators in December that he had gotten
      some of the cash by selling antiques from his private collection.  Now it was
      learned that a Brussels antiques dealer whom he had obviously named told the court
      that he had never bought or sold any antiques to Reynders. The plot thickens and
      it does not look like Reynders will clear his name.  They may be fitting him for
      his next suit in vertical stripes as we talk. ***** However, I would not worry
      too much about Didier Reynders spending much time in prison.  Belgium prefers
      the death sentence. Death by old age, I mean, not by hanging, drawing and quartering,
      gas or whatever other  means you can name. My argument makes reference to another
      political-criminal scandal that has been featured in the same Le Soir during the
      past couple of months, that of murder charges being weighed against Etienne Davignon,
      scion of high aristocracy, business magnate who received high appointments from
      one Belgian government after another.  “Stevie’ as he was known to his great many
      acquaintances, including in the Harvard Club of Belgium where he came forward
      as a sponsor of wonderful events like visits to the last functioning coal mine
      in the country before its shutdown that I enjoyed at the time – is wanted for
      participating in the murder of Patrice Lamumba, the freedom fighter turned president
      of the liberated Belgian Congo. To be sure, Stevie was only one of several conspirators
      assumed to have been responsible for the liquidation of Lamumba.  However, the
      others have conveniently died before they could be brought to court.  Stevie has
      had the misfortune to live to the ripe age of 92, that is long enough for the
      slow-turning millstones of Belgian justice to have milled and released  a twenty-year-old
      file against him and proceeded to court hearings.  With some luck, Stevie, too,

    url: https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/07/18/what-you-learn-about-the-impact-of-the-ukraine-war-from-your-belgian-doctor/
    text: 'This morning, I accompanied my wife on a visit to our generalist to get several
      prescriptions she needed renewed.  The doctor is of post-retirement age. He had
      plenty of time to chat and became very keen to advise me when I said I am considering
      recommending to our15 year old grandson that he apply his love for chemistry and
      biology by pursuing a career as a medical doctor. There is no numerus clausus
      in Belgium. The university studies are free and the degree is a good one. Our
      doctor warned me that here in Belgium practicing medicine is fast turning sour.
      The new Flemish run federal government of Prime Minister Bart De Wever that took
      office in January is raising its military hardware contributions to Ukraine, investing
      in new production of weapons at the Audi factory in downtown Brussels that closed
      a year ago in preparedness for the war with Russia that the Germans have penciled
      onto the European agenda. To pay for these war-related items, the De Wever government
      is cutting budgetary allocations to health and other social benefits. The doctors
      will see their consultation fees to patients cut by 20%. Hospitals and clinics
      are being ordered to retrench.  Said our doctor, you can already see the consequences
      in greatly lengthened waiting times for all kinds of services such as mammograms,
      now risen from a few days to 3 months; hip replacement surgery now risen from
      a few months to three years, and so on. There you have it: a crushing blow to
      what has been a magnificent medical establishment in Belgium, far better than
      in neighboring France and Germany, neither of which have recovered their luster
      from before Covid thanks to budgetary cuts in both countries to pay for you know
      what. Belgium probably was better situated because it had budgeted for defense
      at one of the lowest levels in the EU, at just 1.3% of GDP.  As that changes with
      the gradual ramp up first to 2% and then to 5%, we can expect social benefits
      in this country to go to hell. All of this is a kind of hidden cost of the war
      and of rearmament that may bring young doctors out on the street in strikes but
      will not prompt popular rebellion the way that introducing a military draft would.
      **** I use this occasion to share some information about Belgian politics that
      the Community is very unlikely to know but that reflects a bigger reality of politics
      within the Member States of the European Union, especially those where corruption
      festers under coalition governments. In such governments grabbing and holding
      ministerial portfolios is the primary concern of every politician, without respect
      to any semblance of policy coherence in the coalition as a whole. What can I possibly
      mean by corruption, you may ask? What is there worth stealing in little Belgium?
       An answer to these questions was set out in yesterday’s edition of the main French-speaking
      daily newspaper, Le Soir. It was in their article updating reports on the investigation
      into money laundering practiced for over a decade by a certain Didier Reynders,
      whose name you may recognize as the Justice Minister (first bit of irony in the
      case) in Ursula von der Leyen’s Commission from 2019 to 2024, when following Europe-wide
      elections in June of that year, the Commission had to be re-organized and Reynders
      was out of a job. In December 2024, Reyinders was out of a job and vulnerable
      to police-judicial investigation into crimes he is presumed to have committed
      not just during his tenure at the Commission but in the decade or more when he
      was a member of MR party led coalition governments in Belgium. For many years
      he had been Finance Minister (irony number two in this case) and then for a few
      years he was Minister of Foreign Affairs, for which he was the perfect candidate
      since he knew absolutely nothing about the subject. In Belgium, Reynders had served

      to his countrymen on this national holiday of Bastille Day . https://odysee.com/@RT:fd/Doctorow-July-14-2025:3
      As I say here, Macron has never seen a microphone that he did not want to grab
      and use. His message today has to be put in the context of French-German rivalry. 
      Traditionally within the French-German tandem that ran the European Economic Community
      until 1991 and the European Union today there was a division of labor, with the
      French taking the international stage of diplomacy and military (nuclear) might
      while the Germans busied themselves with manufacturing and exporting goods. However,
      the succession of weak and incompetent French presidents these last 15 years installed
      with CIA assistance caused France to lose its feathers as a leader of Europe.
      Germany has stepped up, putting aside its reservations to be too visible given
      its Third Reich past.  The sins of the grandfathers are no longer considered in
      Germany to be an obstacle to taking the reins of power in Europe and that is just
      what Chancellor Merz has pledged to do by his massive appropriations to the German
      military industry.  Now Macron is trying to remind Europe and the world that Franch
      also counts with respect to military capability. Regrettably the French Constitution
      makes its presidents kings in all but name for 5-year terms. They cannot be thrown
      out onto the street where they belong when they lose all credibility and have
      popularity ratings of 20% or less like Macron.
    one_sentence_summary: In an eight-minute interview on Bastille Day, President Macron
      delivers a patriotic message highlighting France's diminished leadership role
      in Europe due to recent weak presidencies, while emphasizing the historical context
      of French-German rivalry and Germany's increased visibility in international affairs.
    paragraph_summary: In an eight-minute interview on Bastille Day, President Macron

      under Chancellor Merz, reasserts its military presence in Europe, Macron seeks
      to remind both Europe and the world of France's capabilities. However, the French
      political system, which grants presidents substantial power for five-year terms,
      limits accountability, leaving Macron in a position of diminished credibility
      despite low popularity ratings.

      doubt that many members of the Community are aware of the existence of this Belgrade-based
      operation of RT. Allow me then to share my experience with them as interviewee
      a week ago. The 28-minute chat covered a lot of ground.  It opened with examination
      of the rancorous deterioration of relations between Moscow and Baku, with particular
      attention to which outsiders may be aggravating the situation for their own purposes.
      Here I speak of the French as possible meddlers, given their interests in creating
      difficulties for the Russians in the Caucasus by stirring EU ambitions among the
      Armenian leadership and the concurrent patching up of relations between Armenia
      and Azerbaijan at the expense of Russian interests in the region.  However, on
      reconsideration, looking at Paris’s strained relations with Azerbaijan’s closest
      ally, Turkey, it seems less likely that the French have a role in Russia’s problems
      with Azerbaijan today.  Indeed, it is more likely that Turkey itself is pouring
      oil on the fires of discord, since it serves their own purposes to reduce Russia’s
      presence in the Caucasus and raise their own. We moved on to other key issues
      of the day, in particular the Russia-Ukraine war and the new aggressiveness of
      Moscow in staging massive aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities. From there we moved
      to the questions surrounding European rearmament and the NATO summit’s decision
      to raise the military budgets of all Member States to 5% of GDP by 2035. We also
      talked a good deal about Trump’s efforts to extricate the USA from the Ukraine
      war to better free its hands to pursue policies in the Middle East and against
      China. Best wishes to the Serbian speakers among you.

    text: 'Glenn Diesen:  Wars Bring Together Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan & North
      Korea The first third of today’s discussion was directed at the title subject,
      namely the growing consolidation of what is a military alliance in all but name
      between these five Asian powers. The principal source for what I said was last
      night’s Vladimir Solovyov talk show which featured top level Russian academic
      Orientalists. I stress that the Solovyov shows are ‘hit or miss’ in terms of value,
      with a goodly number of wasted evenings and then the occasional highly valuable
      event such as last night. We were told that China is now shipping a lot of military
      hardware to Iran in return for the large quantities of oil it receives from Iran.
      The hardware includes fighter jets, latest generation air defense installations
      and a lot more. Moreover, China’s readiness to fight, if necessary, to ensure
      that Iran is not defeated by Israel, by the United States, was demonstrated by
      its sending a naval task force to the Gulf in the final days of the Iran-Israeli
      war – set to attack the U.S. navy if necessary. Surely this signal was not missed
      by Washington. In the words of the panelists last night, Pakistan is ready to
      send to Iran any and all military supplies that it requires.  Considering that
      Pakistan is a long-established nuclear power, I suggest that delivery of nuclear
      bombs to Iran should not be excluded if Iran comes under existential threat. From
      this angle, the total focus of attention by the United States and other Western
      powers on the levels of enrichment of uranium going on in Iran is foolishness. 
      Why build when at any moment you can buy? The other interesting appraisal of the
      aforementioned ‘axis’ pertains to North Korea, which is said to be seen in its
      neighborhood as very powerful, far more than you would imagine if The New York
      Times was your only source of information. Indeed, there is reason to think that
      South Korea is recalibrating its defense posture given that fact and the equivocal
      nature of the security guaranties it enjoys from Donald Trump’s USA. Otherwise,
      my discussion with Professor Diesen also turned on the question of Russia’s new,
      massive aerial bombardments on Ukraine. More than 728 drones and numerous missiles
      were fired at Ukrainian cities a day ago and that number is rising daily, while
      in addition there is now large-scale use of glide bombs by the Russians to destroy
      Ukrainian fortified positions.  The Russians are now attacking heavily the Western
      Ukraine, meaning Lvov and the area between Lvov and the Polish border where incoming
      shipments of arms from the West are stored for transshipment east to the front.
      The threat is being felt by the Poles, so that their president Duda yesterday
      said Poland is considering stopping the use of their airport in the southeastern
      corner of their country as the hub for Western arms shipments to Ukraine. What
      is the meaning of the new Russian aggressiveness?  I believe it is a clear signal
      to German chancellor Merz to watch out because Russia is ready for war and will
      defend its red lines with overwhelming military force.  Why Merz?  Because as
      we heard from Vladimir Solovyov last night, ‘he is a Nazi.”  That appears to be
      the new Kremlin line: Germany has replaced the United States as Russia’s enemy
      number one and Nazism is back in power in Berlin. ©Gilbert Doctorow, 2025'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the emerging military alliance among
      Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, highlighting China's military
      support to Iran in exchange for oil and its commitment to defend Iran against
      potential threats from Israel and the United States.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion led by Glenn Diesen, the growing military
      alliance among Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea was highlighted,
      emphasizing their increasing collaboration in the face of Western opposition.
      Key insights from a Vladimir Solovyov talk show revealed that China is supplying
      Iran with significant military hardware, including fighter jets and advanced air
      defense systems, in exchange for oil, and has demonstrated its willingness to
      protect Iran against threats from Israel and the U.S. Additionally, Pakistan is
      prepared to support Iran militarily, potentially including the transfer of nuclear
      capabilities if Iran faces an existential threat. The discussion also noted North
      Korea's perceived strength in its region, suggesting that South Korea may be adjusting
      its defense strategies in response. Overall, the article underscores the potential
      implications of this alliance for global security dynamics, particularly regarding
      Western policies towards Iran and North Korea.

    text: '‘Judging Freedom’: Understanding the Russian Way of War Today’s discussion
      with Judge Andrew Napolitano had two central issues. The first is captured by
      the title given to the interview above. The second concerns the vote of no confidence
      proceedings now going on in the European Parliament which, if successful, would
      remove Ursula von der Leyen from office. As I stated here the Russians have seriously
      intensified their ongoing aerial attacks on Ukraine, with latest figures of more
      than 700 drones and missiles fired at Ukrainian cities each day and the expectation
      that this will rise to 1,000 per day shortly. Moreover, they are using more than
      1,000 heavy guided bombs each day as well, creating enormous destruction of Ukrainian
      fortified positions. Meanwhile, the Russian ground forces are capturing more and
      more settlements in the Donetsk oblast, as well as in the Ukrainian oblasts of
      Kharkiv and Zaporozhie. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to assume that Ukrainian
      resistance will crumble in the immediate future. The best proof of the resilience
      and deadly skills of the Ukrainian army was the killing of Russia’s most decorated
      warrior, Lt General Gudkov on the front lines in the past week.  Gudkov is the
      officer whom we all saw on Judging Freedom a few months ago when Vladimir Putin
      spoke to sailors and officers inside a Russian submarine and announced Gudkov’s
      promotion to senior officer of all Russian marines. Just days ago, Putin was giving
      Gudkov’s widow an unprecedented second medal of Hero of the Russian Federation.
      The state funeral for Gudkov was covered on national television. The point is
      that Gudkov died from an artillery counter-strike by Ukrainians near the Russian
      guns which initiated the long-range duel. The Ukrainians clearly had the equipment,
      the trained personnel and the will to respond effectively to Russian attack. Otherwise,
      latest news from Ukraine indicates that they are now deploying optic fiber controlled
      drones similar to what the Russians introduced and are using so effectively for
      several months now. These state of the art attack weapons are impervious to electronic
      warfare jamming or to distortion of gps signals for guidance. And so I insist
      once again that the Ukraine war will end because of the political collapse of
      Kiev, not due to the collapse of the front lines as such. The second issue, namely
      the censure proceedings against von der Leyen is fascinating to follow and thanks
      to relevant videos now posted on the internet the Community can come to its own
      conclusions. My point is that the ‘omerta,’ the silence about the abuses of power
      in the European Institutions imposed and enforced by Commission President Ursula
      von der Leyen has now been broken and we all are witnesses to the rottenness in
      the organs governing the 450 million citizens of the EU Member States. Video of
      the full 49-minute discussion on the website of the European Parliament: The most
      dramatic single contribution to the debate, by Fabrice Leggeri, MEP from Marine

      attacks and Russian ground forces capturing more territories in Donetsk and other
      regions, the resilience of the Ukrainian military remains evident, highlighted
      by their successful counter-strike that killed Lt. General Gudkov, a prominent
      Russian commander. This incident underscores Ukraine's capability and determination
      to resist, as they also adapt by deploying advanced drone technology. Additionally,
      the conversation touched on the political landscape in Europe, particularly the
      vote of no confidence against Ursula von der Leyen in the European Parliament.

      WION: 0:01 Trump and Zelenskyy, they met last week. They seemed to have a good
      meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit. And then what happens? The US president
      goes back home, and within days you hear that the US has halted key weapons supplies
      to Ukraine, a move that has shocked Kiev, to say the least, and left Ukraine in
      dire need as the Russian forces continue their advance into Ukraine. The White
      House said that this decision follows a routine capability review of its military
      needs. Now, if it’s a routine review, then why wasn’t it accounted for before,
      or informed to Kiev in advance? If it’s a routine review, then why is there no
      specific timeline for the resumption of military aid to Ukraine? A lot of questions
      here. I’m Shivan Chanana and to discuss this further with me on “Game Plan” is
      Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, international affairs analyst, author and historian. Doctor,
      always a pleasure speaking with you. The last time US halted military aid to Ukraine
      was after that Trump-Zelensky Oval Office fallout. This time there was no fallout.
      There was a cordial meeting, and yet the same has happened. What happened suddenly?
      Doctorow: 1:04 It’s truly difficult to give definitive answers to this very legitimate
      question you’re posing, because so much is going on that is behind closed doors.
      Perhaps we will know in 50 years, but I think we will not be around in 50 years.
      At least I won’t. And we have to make a decision today on the conduct of the war,
      the conduct of foreign policy by Donald Trump. The point that has to be made first
      is that Trump is operating in a hostile political environment. Hostile domestically,
      Congress is not with him on a rapprochement with Russia. Congress is hostile to
      Russia. Europe wants the war to continue. For Europe, the Ukrainian war presents
      Russia as the bogeyman, as the hostile enemy, and justifies further funding of
      NATO and justifies the very existence of the European Union, which has become
      a war project instead of a peace project under von der Leyen. 2:07 Now, specifically,
      what do I have in mind? Let us recall that when Biden pushed through his massive
      aid, military aid, to Kiev, that would be in the period following his departure
      from office, there were remarks that this would be Trump-proof. But we didn’t
      know exactly what that meant, and we don’t know today exactly what it meant. But
      there’s reason to believe that this worked against Trump’s initial wish to stop
      arms deliveries from the day after he took office. 2:45 We will remember that,
      you mentioned the halt that was recent. There was a halt from the first days that
      he came into office. And then it was reversed, and he continued supplies. And
      many of my peers in what we call the independent media or alternative media in
      the United States and in Europe have been saying, “Ah, Trump, how can Trump present
      himself as a peacemaker when he’s continuing to supply arms to Ukraine?” I would
      maintain here, for the sake of argument, that he was continuing the arms deliveries
      because his legal team could not find a way to get around the obstacles that were
      presented in the Biden orders. 3:29 They finally did that, and now we’ve seen
      the result. The timing is a separate issue, which, of course, you are interested
      in, I will respond to “Why now?” But it took some time for the Trump legal team
      to work its way through the American legislation and find means to stop the supply.
      And do note, they have not stopped it categorically. They stopped it temporarily.
      That is part of the ruse, that is part of the trick that the Trump team is using
      now to frustrate the restrictions on its options that were put in the Biden law.
      WION: 4:10 Doctor, Now as for reports these paused shipments, they include items
      which are vital to Ukraine’s air defense and frontline operations, both of which
      are key arteries to their defenses against Russian aggression at this point. Is
      this arm-twisting Kiev into peace talks? And as you mentioned and briefly, you
      know, why is it happening as of now? And there is no date to when this will resume,
      so is it an open-ended military halt? Doctorow: 4:42 It’s an open-ended military
      halt which is not called that. It’s called a “suspension”. And that certainly
      is a legal trick that is relevant in relations with Congress and the courts in
      the United States. We have to pay attention to that. Now, you mentioned defensive.
      But this halt is on both defensive and offensive weapons. The defensive side are
      the interceptors, Patriots, and other equipment which the United States has provided
      to Ukraine, but much of which it withdrew at the outset of the 12-day Israeli-Iran
      war to take to the Middle East to safeguard American bases in the Gulf states.
      5:28 So not only is the United States not supplying further Patriots as requested,
      or should we say demanded by Zelensky in his last meeting with Trump here in The
      Hague, but it has reduced what little they had before the Iran-Israeli war. That’s
      the defensive side. On the offensive side, they have cut back on deliveries of
      precision missiles. This we can assume takes in the various short- to medium-range
      missiles which the United States supplied earlier. And we may assume it has cut
      back on artillery shells, which are of vital importance to Ukrainians on the front
      lines. 6:20 So this is very important. And to whom is this a signal? Well, yes,
      of course to Kiev, but I’d say also a signal to the European Union and NATO that
      the United States is withdrawing from this war. WION: That’s a very strong signal
      if that’s exactly how the European Union also perceives it, it is going to be
      a message with a thousand words. At this point also, Doctor … Russia has declared
      that they have taken over Luhansk. Luhansk has fallen to the Russian government
      at this point. That’s what they’re claiming. And in the midst of this, to halt
      military aid to Ukraine, is it just really bad timing for Ukraine or strategic
      timing for the U.S.? And after, Luhansk, is Sumy next? Doctorow: Well, let’s take
      a look at the Luhansk story, Luhansk, Lugansk, which is the Ukrainian or Russian
      pronunciation of these oblasts. There are two oblasts that constitute the core
      of Russia’s move into what was once Ukraine. This is Donbas. There is Donetsk
      and Lugansk. From the very beginning, Russia’s occupation or possession of Lugansk
      was relatively high. Seventy-five, 80 percent, perhaps, was held by Russian forces
      or Russian-friendly forces, because after all It was the local militias that held
      the territory, not the Russian army, when this war started. And in Donetsk it
      was less than 50 percent. Maybe 40 percent was held by Russia-friendly forces.
      The reasons are clear. There was very heavy fortification, building defensive
      concrete bunkers from which the Ukrainians could send their artillery shells or
      missiles into Donetsk. 8:15 That was very difficult to overcome. And even after
      two and a half years of war, it was still marginal, with a town that settlements
      10, 15 kilometers away from Donetsk city, which is the capital of the province
      or region of the same name, were held by Ukrainians from which they were daily
      firing artillery shells into residential neighborhoods. Now, in Lugansk, the advance
      was slow, from a very high level to begin with. And this conquest of all of it
      is three percent. Let’s be clear about that. It was the final three percent of
      the Lugansk oblast that was taken in the last several days by Russian forces.
      9:03 Donetsk, where are they now? The Russians are not staging a massive assault.
      They are go slow, pushing here, pushing there, wherever they detect a weak spot,
      because the Ukrainians really are undermanned to hold a 1,200-kilometer-long front
      with equal force and strength. So the Russians have been feeling for weak points
      and striking there, but making progress every day. And their interest is, first
      of all, to remove from the field the Ukrainian soldiers, by killing them or wounding
      them so they’re taken away, to reduce the size of the Ukrainian defenses. 9:47
      That has been their primary objective. Taking territory is a result of the first.
      They have been making progress, and they are concentrating their efforts on a
      couple of … one could call them, logistics hubs, which supply the Ukrainian front
      lines. First and foremost is the city of Pakrovsk. Pakrovsk is the Ukrainian name.
      The Russians know the same town as Krasnoyarsk. So you hear both terms in daily
      news, depending on what the source was, Russian or Ukrainian. The Russians are
      not storming the city. That type of behavior, which was typical in the first year
      of the war, is no longer practiced because it’s very expensive in loss of life
      on the offensive side, on the attacking side. But they are destroying it systematically
      by bombardment, artillery, and drones. 10:39 They will capture Pakrovsk, which
      will greatly weaken the Ukrainian forces along the line, because that’s where
      their supplies have been coming from and food. Then further afield, a little bit
      away from Pakrovsk, there are the towns of Kramatorsk and Slaviansk. These were
      the towns of great importance, iconic importance, in the start of the DAPAC in
      2014, when these two oblasts rebelled against the newly installed regime in Kiev
      following a coup d’état. This is in February 2014. These two towns, or particularly
      Slaviansk, was held by a very small militia force against a much larger Ukrainian
      army force. 11:31 And to take it to something that will resonate with American
      viewers was kind of Alamo of Ukraine. Alamo was a last stand, a last, known in
      American history for patriotic self-sacrifice. And that’s what was going on in
      Slaviansk for 85 days in 2014. And so to be retaken by Russian forces is significant,
      because from there it’s a clear plain straight to the Dnieper River. And that
      is the east-west divide 50-50 between West Ukraine, which is where the ultra-nationalists
      come from, and the East Ukraine, which was always heavily populated, majority
      populated by Russian speakers. WION: 12:19 Understood. Thanks so much Dr. Gilbert
      for encapsulating all that information. You’ve really taken the trajectory right
      from 2014, Crimea to now and what Russia may plan to do next. But as of what Trump
      has done or what the US is doing with Ukraine, that is anyone’s guess at this
      point. There’s a lot happening behind closed doors, which one will need to wait
      and watch. Perhaps sometime from now, the truth is going to come out. As of now,
      one knows for sure that there is a lot of backdoor negotiation which is going
      on, results of which we are seeing in these headlines. Kiev is left scratching
      their head, they are trying to figure out what to do next when US has halted their
      military aid and Russia is definitely advancing. With a friend like the US and
      a foe like Russia, what kind of options does Ukraine have? 13:04 We will be, you
      know, tracking all these developments closely right here on “Game Plan”. That
      was Gilbert Doctorow joining me on the show. Thank you so much, Doctor.'
    one_sentence_summary: Following a seemingly positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy
      at the NATO summit, the U.S. unexpectedly halted key military aid to Ukraine,
      leaving the country in a precarious situation as Russian forces advance, raising
      questions about the timing and communication of this decision.
    paragraph_summary: During a recent NATO summit, U.S. President Donald Trump and
      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a positive meeting, but shortly after,
      the U.S. announced a halt to key military aid to Ukraine, leaving the country
      in a precarious situation as Russian forces advance. This decision, attributed
      to a routine review of military needs, raised questions about its timing and communication
      with Ukraine, especially since there was no prior indication of such a change.
      Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, an international affairs analyst, discussed the complexities
      behind this decision, noting that Trump faces a challenging political landscape
      domestically, with Congress opposing any rapprochement with Russia, while Europe
      benefits from the ongoing conflict by framing Russia as a threat that justifies
      NATO funding.

      Lt. Col. Daniel Davis: 0:00 If you didn’t know any better, you would think from
      watching the headlines that the war between Russia and Ukraine has kind of devolved
      into a budget battle. Who’s going to spend the most money? Who’s bringing in the
      most contractors? Who’s got the most deals to make, et cetera. But as we’re going
      to see, there is that going on, but there is still a war going on and there is
      still progress on the ground. There are still people dying that are not impressed
      one way or the other with whose deal somebody’s making or what they’re trying
      to accomplish on the on the spreadsheet. But as we know, of course, war does require
      finances. And if you don’t have that, then you don’t have a war. We’re going to
      see how that tails in as well. And to try and help us unpack some of this, we
      have for the first time on the Daniel Davis Deep Dive, Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, a
      historian and international affairs analyst and author of the book, “War Diaries,
      Part One, Russia-Ukraine War 2022 to 2023.” First of all, Professor, welcome to
      the show. Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: Well, very kind of you to invite me. Davis: 0:58
      Listen, I wonder just because this is the first time you’ve been on our show.
      I know a lot of our audience is familiar with your work in a number of other different
      venues, but I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about this book that you’ve
      written here and especially because it’s called Part One. What did you learn during
      the publication of this book and where are you going next? Doctorow: Well, as
      I say in the Foreword to it, I thought this would be a thin volume. But then the
      war started. Russia had such a commanding presence and was threatening Kiev from
      day one of their invasion, but it looked like this could be over rather quickly.
      And I don’t think I was the only one who assumed that. As it’s turned out, we
      were all mistaken. The war has progressed in surges, various stages of escalation
      that were not to be anticipated. The risk-taking of the Biden administration was
      in no way clear as a possibility or a likelihood when the war began. And the Russian
      way of war was by no means understood in the West, and even today is not clearly
      understood, since the expectation is the only way you can fight a war is the American
      way, which is shock and awe. And that didn’t happen. 2:11 The fact is, the American
      wars have been on territory without any personal presence, that is, without an
      American presence there before the troops moved in, without an interest in the
      people as such and in the value of human life in the territories we entered —
      in the Middle East, I’m speaking about now. In the Russian case with Ukraine,
      they are, these are two nations or peoples that have lived together and intermingled
      for 500 years or more. And the Russian interest was initially not to cause too
      much damage and too much loss of life in the anticipation that these are neighbors
      and we’ll have to live with them in the future. Moreover, they are, those neighbors
      are the brother-in-law, sister-in-law, mother-father of many people living all
      over what was the Soviet Union and today is the Russian Federation. For these
      reasons, the Russians conducted the war in a rather, in a very different way from
      what people in the West expected. It was misinterpreted in the West as signs of
      Russian weakness. Davis: Let me ask you, on that topic, I’m just wondering what
      you may have discovered through the reading of your book, what the US actually
      anticipated ahead of time, because Biden famously said, you know, “Our intelligence
      says they’re getting ready to go, they’ve made a decision”, all this kind of stuff.
      We moved out a lot of our diplomatic personnel, left Kiev, and even offered a
      ride to Zelensky to get out, and he, of course, had a pretty famous quip to that.
      But what did the US expect to happen in that initial onslaught? Doctorow: 3:53
      I think it was just what I just said a moment ago: this would be over in a very
      short time. Then there was a misinterpretation which comes into the nature of
      propaganda, and say false information or disinformation as to what went wrong
      and why the Russians didn’t just move into Kiev as going down the rose garden.
      Here, the errors are not just in Western expectations, but also in Russian expectations.
      The Russians had a conflict, a military conflict with the Ukrainians in 2014 in
      the spring following the installation of the radical nationalist government in
      Kiev with assistance from the United States, the Russians had a military conflict.
      In the Crimea, we know there was a standoff, a standoff that ended in complete
      Russian victory, because the Ukrainian forces in the Crimea, which were roughly
      the same number, 20,000, on the peninsula for each of the sides, just gave up.
      The Russians said, :You have a choice. You raise the white flag. You can go home
      in Ukraine, or you can come and join us.” 5:01 And indeed, some of the Ukrainian
      forces joined the Russians, and others just went home. There weren’t many gunshots.
      And the Russians were spoiled about that. They expected that indeed the Ukrainian
      army would– seeing the vast forces arrayed against them what, 50, 60 miles away
      from their capital on the Belarus side of the border– that they would again retreat
      and that the people, the local people would come out in the familiar Slavic fashion
      with salt and bread to greet the Russian liberators. That didn’t happen at all.
      Eight years of work by the American and British intelligence agencies, by the
      Pentagon, had changed completely the psychology of the Ukrainian army. And it
      was now a formidable fighting force. Moreover, it was, and this was not foreseeable,
      it was largely under the control of those same radicals who were behind the Maidan
      storming and installation of a new government by force. These people, the Azov
      Battalion and other radical nationalists had been integrated into the normal Ukrainian
      armed forces, with the result that the notion of raising a white flag didn’t exist
      any more. The Russians’ intelligence, it’s quite surprising, their intelligence
      was very faulty. They did not anticipate that they would have a stiff fight. What
      happened when those tanks approached Kiev? Were they really, suffered enormous
      defeats as Western reports went because of the use of the shoulder-held anti-tank
      weapons supplied by the United States? We don’t know. I don’t know for certain.
      I’m not a military expert, as you mentioned correctly at the outset, but there
      are a lot of open questions that no one has answered satisfactorily about these
      first months of the war. 7:27 The Russian story is that they were preparing the
      way for negotiations. Indeed, the negotiations started very soon after the Russian
      invasion. The Russians invaded about 23rd of February, 24th of February. The negotiations
      started several weeks later. These were first in Belarus and then moved to Istanbul.
      And by the end of April, we know that there was a lengthy document agreed by negotiating
      parties on both sides, for– Davis: Actually, I want to ask you a specific question
      on this time frame. I’m really grateful that you’ve studied a lot of this because
      I remember very distinctly, I want to say it was the first or second week of March,
      I think it was the second week of March, that Zelensky was quoted as saying, “Well,
      I guess I can consider maybe going to an independent, unaligned situation, i.e.
      no more NATO.” And so he was openly thinking about that, because that’s one of
      the things that the Russians had said was one of their primary objectives, was
      to prevent NATO from coming into Ukraine. And then that was leading into the Istanbul
      arguments or discussions then something a lot happened. I wonder if you have any
      insight as to what happened with Zelenski that made him say that publicly and
      then radically changed on the backside Doctorow: 8:43 Well, I wouldn’t take anything
      Zelenski said then or any time since as being … the God’s truth. Davis: Fair enough.
      Doctorow; The man … is a politician This type of little white lies or even big
      lies are the small change of politics. Now, you asked what is new in the book
      or value to the book, and I want to state this is not a comprehensive history
      of the Ukraine War. The fact that it’s 772 pages does not mean that I was writing
      a history. I was writing diaries. By that I mean my journalism is a personal variety,
      that is what I see, very often what I see around me, what I take part in. And
      in this case, the contribution that is particularly interesting, I think, to readers
      are the visits I made to Russia during, from the start of the war, at a time when
      there were almost no Western journalists in Russia, first because they had left
      during the whole period of CoViD, and then because when it was possible to come
      back and visas were again being issued, the war started. And many Western media
      withheld their journalists, so took their journalists out of Russia, like the
      “Financial Times”, took them to Riga where they stay to this day because they
      were threatened by, or they felt threatened by Russia’s legislation against spreading
      false information about their armed forces, for which you could face a criminal
      penalty. And reporting with a Western slant could run the risk of that. So there
      were very few, almost no journalists there. There were very few people who were
      receiving visas of any kind. I happened to have what is called a humanitarian
      visa, since my wife is Russian. 10:38 And that was one of the few exceptions which
      enabled you to get a visa and stay, and come to Russia. And I used that, and I
      recorded in this book what I saw around me. The book is not about the front. The
      book is about the rear. It’s about how Russians fared during the war. And that
      is, what they suffered or didn’t suffer in terms of the “sanctions from hell”
      that the United States imposed, and Europe followed up with several months delay.
      And my reports are that initially, yes, there was a little bit of shock, but very
      quickly Russia adapted. The financial crisis was averted because they had been
      taken out of script in the banking system, and things got very normal. In fact,
      with the change of suppliers, I’m speaking now about food products, tropical fruits
      and so forth, the Russian supermarkets were very well stocked. And these are the
      things I report, not just the supermarkets, but the change over commodities in
      stores and so forth, and life in general, and the feeling of people, people on
      the ground, not just elites, but people on the ground: how are they reacting?
      And I record here the surge in patriotism when it took place. 12:01 I just, I’d
      like to say, coming back to the question you posed, what happened at the start
      and the change and what was going on during the negotiations in March, April between
      the Russians and the Ukrainians, between Putin’s team and Zelensky’s team. One
      thing that came out and surprised me when I went through my material, is that
      I had almost no notes on those negotiations. Now, particularly after Mr. Putin,
      I think it was November, December, stood up in front of journalists and waved
      this 100-, 200-page document that had been initialed by the heads of both negotiating
      teams and just needed to have one final signature by the two presidents. After
      he waved that, and after we know the whole story about Starmer, sorry, about Johnson’s,
      about Boris Johnson’s visit, which is said to have been the clincher to take Mr.
      Zelenski out of any thoughts of accommodating Russians on their war demands and
      to proceed with the war in the belief that he would get full support, military
      and financial, from the West. 13:18 Well, that is something that doesn’t ring
      true any more when I look at my notes. And I hope readers will find this and appreciate
      what it means. The reason why it comes up, and I’ll try to explain it now, is
      that neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians were very happy about that almost-signed
      peace treaty. They neither. So they were– Russian patriots think that Putin was
      giving away much too much because the territorial side of it was negligible for
      the Russians. And for the Ukrainians, their patriots would find it objectionable
      because of the new Trump conditions. Davis: Well yeah, and then now then that’s–
      not a whole lot has changed over that. And the fact, I think that the two camps
      have almost widened their views where we are now, which is going to have an impact
      on where this war is going to go here. And I want to get into, you know, kind
      of the current situation here. And with NATO, there’s an interesting statement
      made by Tammy Bruce yesterday at the State Department, which I’d like your view
      on. Bruce: 14:30 What we do know is what apparently bothers Russia is the fact
      that NATO is going to be strongly returning to its original roots of being a deterrent.
      And that is what NATO’s job has been the … advancement of their commitment to
      defense is remarkable and not only it’s– we of course support NATO completely
      and their role is imperative for a safe and stable Europe, and that’s the point:
      being a deterrent. This kind of defense spending helps them achieve that, and
      of course it is something that would not have happened without President Trump’s
      encouragement and demand. And so we’re excited about that. Davis: 15:07 So, you
      know, for the longest time, going all the way back to 2023, Trump had been talking
      about how he was going to end the war in a day. And then after he got elected,
      he said he was going to have it done even before he took office, etc. And then,
      well, that crashed into reality. And then he said something about 100 days and
      then it was, all right, we’re days away from walking. Of course, none of that
      ever happened. And now that it’s like he’s not even hardly talking about the end
      of the war at all. Now we’re going into, “Well, let’s just kind of expand NATO
      here.” But one of the things she said in there that really got my attention was
      she said, “We want to return to NATO’s role of being a defensive alliance and
      setting up for deterrence.” And I’m like, okay, if you’re returning to that, what
      was it? Because that’s the only thing it’s ever supposed to have been. How do
      you interpret that? Doctorow: 15:54 Well, her statement indicates that there are
      various flowers blooming in this garden. And I’m not sure who the gardener is
      any more. Let’s assume that it’s Donald Trump. I think she’s not clued in. My
      own reading of what happened at the Hague summit is that Donald Trump got what
      he wanted. He got this written, signed commitment by all of the NATO countries,
      so we’ll put Spain on the side as an exception, but all of the other 26 NATO,
      sorry, it’s more than 26, [about] 30 NATO countries, that they are raising their
      budgeting for military purposes to on the hard side, three percent. And if you
      want to throw in the soft side, the one and a half percent on top of that, that
      is allowed to be allocated for infrastructure development of roads and bridges,
      supposedly, which are said to have a military value. In any case, if they would
      rate go from, let’s take Belgium, it’s 1.3 percent. That’s all that Belgium has
      as a military budget today in terms of GDP. To take that to two percent, they
      will do it this year by the kind of financial fraud that represents the one and
      a half percent I just mentioned a minute ago. 17:14 And they can’t go further
      in 2026. There’s no wiggle room. There is no possibility of raising taxes, which
      are also already the highest in the Europe, if not in the world, and there is
      no possibility of taking out loans because the country is over-indebted. So they
      signed to something which they cannot deliver. They signed to it because they
      expect Mr.– I didn’t see any landmarks in that commitment to achieve this or that
      at a given date before 2035. That’s to say, the target is well after Mr. Trump
      leaves office, and the expectation that his successor will … be more lenient and
      stand step back from that. There is no intention in Europe to fulfill those commitments,
      which they cannot do. 18:09 On Mr. Trump’s side, that’s fine. He has no problem
      with that. They don’t fulfill it, and his Article 5 commitment doesn’t exist any
      more. Moreover, it gives him the possibility of cutting back on America’s contributions
      to NATO without anybody [having] a right to complain. Davis: Right. Doctorow:
      They don’t they don’t fulfill their end of the bargain, and we can’t– Davis: I
      agree. Yeah, we’ll see how that ends up playing out. You know, one … of the other
      I guess participants if you want to look at it that way, in this whole issue of
      NATO saying we’re going to go up to 5% GDP on our defense spending, et cetera,
      was the Russian side, because they had a lot of things to say in the aftermath
      of that about how we’re going to bankrupt ourselves and all this kind of stuff.
      And you have said that you actually find that to be a mistake on the part of Sergey
      Lavrov and other Russian speakers. Why is that? Doctorow: 19:11 Well, there’s
      a general tendency among the backers– most of the American political establishment,
      to think that people who disagree with the American policies that Biden was following
      are all stooges of the Kremlin. And that is not just a malign characterization
      of everyone, but it misses the point that those of us who try hard to be honest,
      and I put myself in that category, have no hesitation to say when the Russians
      are doing something stupid. And I characterized the remarks that Sergey Lavrov
      made as very poorly advised. I’ll give a very good reason. During our elections,
      particularly the last presidential election, Putin was very careful not to tip
      his hand as to which side he supported for the obvious reason that that person
      would be denounced as a friend of Putin. 20:17 Somehow that lesson has been forgotten
      when Lavrov opened his mouth and started giving advice to Europe about what they
      should do about their military budgets. That is downright stupid, because we don’t
      need that help. There are even in the “New York Times”, in its front page, at
      least in the European edition, which I read two days ago, they had an opinion
      article, invited a guest author, which said plainly that it is risky, or they
      said the word he used was delusory, for Europe to think that it can re-industrialize
      and free itself from dependence on the United States by heavy investment in European
      weapons industry. That is in the “New York Times” on the front page. So nobody
      needed a helping hand from Mr. Lavrov or from Mr. Putin, because Lavrov, again,
      this is another fallacy that many of my peers make from my perspective, to think
      that Lavrov is an independent personality, political factor. He isn’t. Mr. Lavrov
      is a very skillful implementer of whatever his boss tells him to do. He was a
      strong nationalist when Putin was his boss. He became a very weak, flabby spokesman
      for Russia when the namby-pamby Medvedev was the president, and now he’s pretty
      much back in form under Putin, and it was actually– a lead for this information
      war offensive of this past weekend came from Putin himself. So I don’t blame Lavrov
      solely, but he should have been more cautious. To say that this would be a catastrophic
      loss for Europe, for NATO, was not very wise. Davis: 22:22 Well and then let’s
      see you brought up Vladimir Putin because one of the things that he did say, which
      might fall into a different category, maybe something that was pretty straightforward
      and honest, is that he still says, despite what the West claims constantly that
      he’s not willing to have a negotiated settlement, he has been saying he’s very
      much willing to have a negotiated settlement, but he said in this recent comment
      here in June, there’s an other alternative side. Putin: 22:50 [English voice over]
      It all started with the fact that we were lied to, that we were deceived, that
      we were swindled about the NATO enlargement to the east, because the entire world
      is aware that Russia received promises that “not an inch eastward. NATO is not
      going to enlarge to the east.” Then one wave of enlargement, the second wave of
      enlargement. And we keep saying that security of one country or of a group of
      countries cannot be insured at the expense of any other states. And there are
      documents signed to this tune. And then they kept expanding and we were told,
      “Well, you should not be concerned, you should not be afraid, it’s not a threat
      to you.” 23:33 And when we said that we do believe it’s a threat to us, then they
      did not say anything in response. They just told us to go far away with our opinions.
      No one wanted to listen to our opinions, but we know better what is a threat to
      us. It’s our right to define what’s a threat to us, and how big the threat is
      from one side or from the other side. But no one was listening to us and they
      kept on acting like that. Isn’t that an aggressive behavior? Because that’s exactly
      what aggressive behavior means. And the West doesn’t want to notice this. Davis:
      24:11 See, now that’s in a lot of, you know, Tammy Bruce, which we just showed
      you, talking about what all of NATO agreed to is this increase in defense spending,
      this increase in military capacity. And Russia seems to be saying– and you tell
      me if you agree with this or not– that look, this whole NATO coming into Ukraine
      is one of the reasons we attacked in February 2022 in the first place. And so
      if you’re talking going up now, there’s gonna be a commensurate reaction to it.
      How do you see that? Doctorow: 24:39 Well, yeah, of course. The expectation of
      Russia is an eventual Ukrainian capitulation, which will be enshrined in a document
      signed by whoever is a successor, a head of state in Ukraine after Mr. Zelensky
      is pushed aside or suffers some … misfortune. But that is not the issue. That
      is something in passing. This war is not about Ukraine. This war is about the
      relationship with NATO, as was perfectly clear when the Russians presented NATO
      and the United States with their demands that it withdraw its presence, its establishment
      from all of the new member states after 1997. The new, those countries as came
      in the successive waves of NATO expansion. 25:36 This is the primary issue, and
      it is the one which Putin had in mind when he spoke about the causes of war, we
      have to resolve the initial causes of war. Davis: And so what does that tell you
      that, you know, this is heading? If we’re, if Russia is saying, you know, that
      NATO is not something we’re going to be passive to. NATO is saying, and we’re
      going to keep going anyway, where’s this war going to end up going? Doctorow:
      26:08 Well, I think the Russians can play a waiting game very nicely. I’m fairly
      confident or certain that Mr. Putin, despite the rhetoric you’ve heard, and certainly
      despite the rhetoric of Mr. Lavrov, is confident that NATO will not be able to
      achieve this. They also achieve the increased military spending. And not just
      that, They are following very closely political developments in Germany. In Germany
      Mr. Merz is the lead personality. He’s grabbed the microphone away from Emmanuel
      Macron who otherwise wants to run out in front of whatever the marching band is
      and take control. Mr. Merz, or Chancellor Metz, has that role now. And it is improbable,
      I think, from Russian analysis, that he will stay in power for long if he proceeds
      with not just the trillion euros in investment in German military production and
      increasing the armed forces, but if he looks for the manning, which is critical.
      We know from the remarks of his defense minister, Pistorius, that the attempts,
      recent attempts to induce young Germans to enroll in the armed forces have been
      another failure. They’re going to give this a bit more time, and if it doesn’t
      produce results then they will seek to introduce a draft. And there you have the
      end of the German government, because the German government, coalition government,
      has a very narrow majority in their parliament, the Bundestag, 17 votes. It’s
      dependent on support from its junior partner, the Socialists, the SPD. And the
      SPD is split down– is split, not down the middle, no, it’s true. There are more
      socialists who back their fellow socialist Pistorius in proposing a draft, but
      there is a substantial minority, as I’m repeating the words of the “Financial
      Times”. They call it a substantial minority within the SPD who oppose this, oppose
      rearmament and particularly oppose the imposition of a draft. They vote against
      it and Mr Merz is history. I don’t believe he will be a candidate for a further
      election, because he’s widely hated in Germany. Davis: 28:52 Well, you talked
      about Macron, and now trying to take the mic and, or is it Merz coming in here.
      The other guy who’s vying for that microphone is Keir Starmer and he seems to
      be focused a lot on continuing to give more British money. Starmer: 29:08 I told
      President Zelenskyy at Downing Street on Monday that we will harden our resolve.
      We struck an agreement together to share battlefield technology, accelerating
      our support for Ukraine’s defence, while boosting British security and British
      jobs. We committed to providing hundreds more air defence missiles, paid for not
      by the British taxpayer but with money from Russia’s frozen assets. And together
      with Europe, Canada and our Indo-Pacific partners, we announced that we will deliver
      40 billion euros of military aid to Ukraine this year, matching last year’s pledge
      in full. There is a path to a just and lasting peace, but it will only come through
      flipping the pressure onto Putin. 29:58 His position is weaker than he claims,
      So I urged all our partners, including the US, to step up the pressure now with
      more sanctions and more military support to bring Russia to the table to agree
      an unconditional ceasefire leading to serious negotiations. Davis: Now how long
      do you suppose that the UK can keep going down this path? I mean he talked about
      how much they gave last year, they’re going to give a same amount of this year.
      You talked about the difficulties politically with the Merz inside the German
      government. Do you see any commensurate issues with the British government? Doctorow:
      30:36 I don’t have to see them. They’re on the BBC and British newspapers today.
      After his finance minister, Reeves, failed in her attempt to introduce a substantial
      reform in the budget to their assistance to the less well-off part of the population.
      This was a disastrous failure in parliament. She broke out into tears. That’s
      probably the first time any of these alligator lady British politicians has actually
      broken into tears in parliament. There was speculation first that she wouldn’t
      last, that she would resign. Now the speculation is that Starmer isn’t going to
      last. Because he belatedly came out to the press that he supports her fully. And
      I think he just condemned himself to loss of power by saying that. 31:38 Again,
      the Russians every evening have, or starting at like five o’clock their time to
      seven o’clock their time. They have this program, 60 Minutes, which is a commentary
      and discussion program, which has a very big section, like a third of it, is long
      video clips and long excerpts from major press, United States, UK, Germany, France,
      and they show all this. So Mr. Putin is perfectly apprised, as is the Russian
      establishment, foreign policy establishment, of these deep fissures. They’re also
      aware of the development today that, with respect to Ukraine and NATO, that the
      Poles have joined Fico of Slovakia and Orban of Hungary in taking a position against
      Ukraine joining NATO. 32:45 And of course, they’re against Ukraine joining the
      EU because it is a big threat to their agricultural economy, since Ukraine has
      vastly cheaper production costs in things like poultry and in oils, vegetable
      oils and in grains, than Poland or France or any other European member state has.
      So the fractures are there, and they’re not the whim of one personality or another.
      They’re based on real contradictions between the interests of the Ukrainians and
      the interests of member states of the European Union. So the Russians can afford
      to take their time. I don’t see that– this is my answer to your your overriding
      question of how the Russians will respond to this … NATO resolution to raise their
      finances and become an effective deterrent, as this government, US government
      spokeswoman said. And I don’t think they expect any of this to happen. Davis:
      33:56 Well, where … does that, where does that tell you that this is going to
      end up going then, because you have the NATO leaders across the board talking,
      in my view, just almost fiction that the things that can never come to pass, “just
      and lasting peace”, as Starmer says almost routinely, you know, “we’re going to
      help Ukraine for as long as it takes” some of these others and all the things
      that several these other leaders say, like Emmanuel Macron, etc. But they can’t
      happen on the battlefield, and so Russia seems to be very patient. And I wonder
      if you could in the last bit of time we have here kind of talk about the different
      approach that the Western world has as opposed to the approach that the Russian
      world has. You mentioned at the outset that we think that war has to be shock
      and awe. Russians have a different viewpoint. Where do you see after now three
      and a half years of war, where’s this going next? Doctorow: 34:46 They had a different
      viewpoint. I wouldn’t say they personally are shock and awe, but they become much
      more destructive. Destructive of civil infrastructure and less careful about avoiding
      civilian casualties. The Russians in the last two, three weeks have staged ever
      more impressive, ever bigger aerial attacks on major Ukrainian cities, and they’ve
      moved into an area that they were very cautious not to touch, lest they raise
      severe criticism in the West. They have now attacked Ukraine west of Lvov, that’s
      to say between Lvov and the Polish border, which is a staging ground for all ground-delivered
      military material coming from the United States and Western Europe. 35:43 They’ve
      now attacked west of Lvov. So there are attacks on all major cities, daily attacks
      by precision missile strikes that are set off by their Black Sea fleet. Remember
      the Black Sea fleet, which the Brits and everyone else said has been has been
      taken out of the war by these by these wonderful naval drones which the Brits
      supplied? Well forget that. Those ships, wherever exactly they are in the Black
      Sea, they are a major launching site for these precision missile attacks on the
      Ukrainian cities. They are taking out refineries, they’re taking out all stockpiles
      of parts for drones that they can identify, they are very, very damaging daily.
      35:40 And so the Russians have taken off the gloves. They’re being very tough.
      And the part of that is a result of the benefits they are enjoying from the distraction
      of all Western media and American attention of the Iran-Israeli war. From page
      one, “Russian aggression”, in quotation marks, in Ukraine, has moved to page 25,
      shall we say, figuratively speaking, in our newspapers. Nobody’s too excited about
      it. They’re very excited– now, at the same time, the latest issues of the “New
      York Times”, the “Financial Times”, are admitting openly that the Russians are
      succeeding and are pushing back the Ukrainians. So they’re preparing the broad
      public for a Ukrainian collapse. And Mr. Trump’s cutoff of supplies of Patriots
      and other air defense missiles, his cutoff of 155-millimeter artillery shells
      and … the offensive missiles that … the United States have been supplying to Ukraine
      — all of this puts the Ukrainians in a very tough spot. I don’t see capitulation
      coming tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but by the end of the summer, it could
      well be. Davis: 38:10 Yeah, and that is so ironic if just not anguishing, because
      if the end is going to come at the end of the summer, then it should come today
      instead of letting another some number of thousands more people pointlessly die
      just to drag it out. But that’s where we are. I don’t see anybody that’s going
      to change that anytime soon. But we’re going to continue to watch this and see
      what happens and we’ll just call balls and strikes as they happen. So thank you
      for coming on today and just remind people of your book there, “War Diaries, Volume
      1: The Russia-Ukraine War, 2022 – 2023”. You can find that on Amazon, see right
      there. Thank you very much and we appreciate you coming on. Doctorow: Well, my
      pleasure. I hope that there will be a final Volume 2. I don’t want to think about
      a Volume 3. Davis: 38:54 Right. Yes, yes. Let’s let that be the final one. I agree
      completely. Thank you very much. And we will see you guys next time on the Daniel
      Davis Deep Dive.'
    one_sentence_summary: Lt. Col. Daniel Davis discusses the ongoing war between Russia
      and Ukraine, emphasizing that while financial aspects and contracts are highlighted
      in the media, the conflict continues to result in significant human loss and requires
      funding to sustain military efforts.
    paragraph_summary: In a discussion featuring Lt. Col. Daniel Davis and historian
      Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, the complexities of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war are explored,
      highlighting the juxtaposition of financial aspects and the harsh realities of
      conflict. While media narratives often focus on budget battles and military contracts,
      the conversation emphasizes that the war continues to claim lives and evolve on
      the ground, despite the financial machinations surrounding it. Doctorow, author
      of "War Diaries, Part One, Russia-Ukraine War 2022 to 2023," reflects on the unexpected
      longevity and intensity of the conflict, which initially seemed poised for a swift
      resolution but has instead progressed through various phases, challenging early
      assumptions about its duration and outcome.

    text: Lt Col Daniel Davis has a distinctive pool of expert guests and audience and
      it was a great pleasure to be invited to speak today to what is largely a new
      audience for me. Davis’s particular interest was how the Russians will react to
      the possibility of a revival of NATO strength following the resolution adopted
      at the Hague summit calling for much higher spending on military needs by the
      European Member States, reaching 5% of GDP by 2035. I was given the opportunity
      to go beyond affirming the unlikelihood of any of the spending commitments ever
      being realized and to consider one by one, how long the biggest loudmouths in
      Europe favoring war preparations with Russia will last in power. Merz will fall
      if he pursues imposition of a military draft, which is the only way to retore
      the Bundeswehr to where it was before the ‘peace dividend’ of the 1990s cut the
      German army to shreds.  Starmer today looks very shaky after the reform bill cutting
      social benefits put together by his Chancellor of the Exchequer Reeves was defeated
      in the House. Meanwhile, today’s news from Poland indicates that they have joined
      Hungary and Slovakia in openly opposing Ukraine’s entry into NATO, and probably
      also in opposing Ukraine’s entry into the EU. These and other elements of this
      discussion may well be of interest to the Community.
    one_sentence_summary: Lt Col Daniel Davis discussed the potential Russian response
      to NATO's proposed military spending increase at the Hague summit, while also
      analyzing the political viability of European leaders advocating for military
      preparations against Russia.
    paragraph_summary: Lt Col Daniel Davis recently spoke to a new audience about the
      potential Russian response to NATO's renewed military spending commitments, particularly
      following the Hague summit's resolution for European Member States to increase
      defense budgets to 5% of GDP by 2035. He expressed skepticism about the feasibility
      of these spending goals and analyzed the political futures of European leaders
      advocating for military preparations against Russia, suggesting that figures like
      Merz in Germany could face backlash if they push for a military draft to rebuild
      the Bundeswehr. Additionally, he noted the precarious position of UK leader Starmer
      after a failed social benefits reform and highlighted Poland's alignment with
      Hungary and Slovakia in opposing Ukraine's NATO and EU membership, indicating
      a complex and evolving geopolitical landscape.

    text: 'Transcript submitted by a reader https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnusdxbXzp0
      Napolitano: 0:30 Hi everyone, Judge Andrew Napolitano here for “Judging Freedom”.
      Today is Wednesday, July 2nd, 2025. Professor Gilbert Doctorow will be here with
      us in just a moment on Russia’s information war against NATO and other relevant
      topics. But first this. [commercial message] 1:58 Professor Doctorow, welcome
      here, my dear friend. What is your understanding of the current status of the
      special military operation in Ukraine or at least the Kremlin’s view of the current
      status of the special military operation in Ukraine? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: Well,
      the Russians announced yesterday with great pride that they had completely liberated
      Lugansk oblast, which was one of the two regions formerly of Ukraine that we call
      the Donbas. There was, about three percent was left under Ukrainian occupation
      xxxxxxx as they were viewed from Russia. But that was cleaned up. And now the
      whole of Lugansk is theirs. They were also making substantial progress in Donetsk.
      They are going after men more than going after territory. They want to deprive
      Ukraine of an effective military and do that at minimum cost to themselves. And
      so they’re proceeding not so much in a showy way by territory that they seize,
      although they are adding several square kilometers every day or two, but they
      are doing it in a way that the losses of personnel by Ukraine are again well over
      a thousand a day. Napolitano: Wow. Doctorow: In the Donbass, they continue to
      advance and to bomb and destroy the major logistical hubs that still are under
      Ukrainian control in Donetsk. And that is, first of all, Pakrovsk, as the Ukrainians
      know it, or Krasnoyarsk, as it’s called in Russian. So they show you every day
      this town, or that town, well, settlement would be a better title, that they are
      taking control of in the Donbas. The Russian flag goes up, or even a regional
      flag representing the military unit that was responsible for this particular action.
      For example, it could be the Baikal, troops from Baikal, and they would raise
      a Baikal flag over this or that hamlet. 4:21 But let’s be clear about it. The
      Ukrainians are moving back, but their lines are not collapsing. And I wouldn’t
      want to read into this, into the progress that the Russians are making, the suggestion
      that Ukraine is on the point of collapse. Nonetheless, everyone knows well that
      the Trump administration has curtailed, if not stopped, shipment of many valuable
      military assets to Ukraine. I think, first of all, those Patriots are not going
      to Ukraine. That’s clear as day. And other anti-aircraft. Napolitano: Let me just
      stop you for a second, because consistent with what you’ve said, Larry Johnson
      says, Ukraine will not be getting the Patriot missiles as you said. The thing
      they need the most, I know you’re not a military person, neither am I, but we
      can use our sense of reason. The 155 millimeter artillery shells, because the
      American supply of those is dangerously low. GMLRS rockets, I’m not sure what
      that is, and Stinger Hellfire missiles. All of a sudden, the Spigot has been partially
      closed. Please continue. Doctorow: 5:37 Yes, well, the Spigot has been closed,
      and that sends a message to the Ukrainian military that they have to be particularly
      parsimonious with their forces and avoid direct confrontation with the Russians
      where possible, because they simply don’t have the supplies of weaponry, offensive
      and defensive, that they would like and that they need. So their situation is
      dire, but not desperate, not hopeless, and not urgent in the sense that tomorrow,
      or the week after, the capitulation. It won’t be. Nonetheless, the Russians are
      feeling good about the way the war is going. And Mr. Putin has probably picked
      up a little bit more support among wavering Russian patriots who would like to
      see action faster. Napolitano: 6:35 Is there pressure on President Putin from
      his right, to get more aggressive? I’ll just throw a name out there. I don’t know
      if he says these things for PR reasons or because he’s actually saying this to
      his colleague. A former president Medvedev, for example, has from time to time
      pounds the table. Is that pressure still on President Putin? Or if it is, does
      it go in one ear and out the other? Doctorow: Well, as regards Medvedev, he’s
      well under control by President Putin, and he is the attack dog that Mr. Putin
      has set up. He’s not attacking Putin. He’s taking the initiative to put the West
      on notice about Russia’s plans for continuing the war. So I wouldn’t look at Medvedev
      as a force against Putin, not at all. He’s an instrument of Putin. But there are
      people, of course. There are, well, even this political scientist, Karaganov,
      who a year and a half ago was calling for a military strike in Germany using the
      Oreshnik, using even a tactical nuclear weapon to demonstrate that the Russians
      are serious, and to take their red lines with all due seriousness. So that pressure
      exists, but I don’t believe that Mr. Putin is responding to it or is forced to
      change his tactics, and not to mention strategy, as a result of this, since the
      armed forces have good news to put up on the television screen every day. Napolitano:
      8:22 Right. Right, right. What is the current attitude of Russia toward NATO?
      Taking into account, of course, the rather extraordinary telephone conversation
      that President Putin had with French President Macron yesterday for two hours,
      the first time they spoke in three years. Doctorow: Well, this is really two questions.
      And I don’t, I want to be sure that I get a handle on both of them. Napolitano:
      Sure, sure. Address it as you see fit, please. Doctorow: Both of them are very
      important. I think that the general public and the Western media are interpreting
      the call by Macron to Putin in the wrong way. We have very little information
      coming from anyone other than Mr. Putin as to what they talked about. He said
      they talked about, that he delivered to Mr. Macron Russia’s view of how this war
      will end. And we all know that; I won’t repeat the points, that they have to go
      back to the original source of the problem, resolve that, and not just have a
      ceasefire. So Mr. Putin used the opportunity to tell Macron directly what he otherwise
      would know indirectly from the Russian memorandum delivered to the Ukrainians
      at their last Istanbul meeting. 9:40 However, that is misleading. My understanding
      of the reason for the call is rather different. Macron reached out to Putin to
      involve the Russians in reinstating the old agreements with Iran over its enrichment
      program, the one that Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of. He– Russia was
      a party to that, and so it’s impossible for the European Union to proceed and
      try to reinsert itself into the peace process with Iran, since they’ve been totally
      sideline by the United States. If they reinsert themselves, they have to bring
      in Putin. Let’s just remember that until relatively recently, when Viktor Orban
      went to speak with Putin, he was denounced by the EU for breaking ranks with the
      rest of the EU member states over the isolation of Russia. And here we have Mr.
      Macron, as if he’s doing this on his own, spontaneously, he’s a nice guy, he’s
      just changed his view. No, He did this as the emissary of the EU on behalf of
      Kallas and von der Leyen, who want to get Russia back, to help them get back into
      the Iran negotiate. Napolitano: 11:01 Do you think he called up his buddies Keir
      Starmer and Friedrich Merz and said, “I’m about to talk to Vladimir. What do you
      want me to say to him?” Or do you think he did it on his own, with just the EU
      leadership backing? Doctorow: I think it’s the latter. Well, that’s sufficient.
      That’s entirely sufficient. He is running for the microphone and to be at the
      head of the band at any opportunity he has. And so when, say, Kallas or von der
      Leyen tapped him and said, “Look, we need somebody to reach out to Putin”, he
      would have been overjoyed. And I don’t think he would look for the consent from
      Merz who is answering– Napolitano: It’s odd that they had their conversation yesterday,
      or maybe there’s a connection here. You can analyze it for us please. French missiles
      were used to kill Russian civilians just two days ago. Could that have been the
      impetus for the Macron phone call? Doctorow: 12:05 I think it would have pushed
      things along, yes, because Macron would be aware that Russian animus towards France
      had just gone up a few levels in light of that. This missile was originally identified,
      I think, by Western sources as having been a Storm shadow. Technically speaking–
      Napolitano: If it were, that would make it British, right? Doctorow: No. Well,
      if you call it Storm Shadow, it was British. If you call it, I think, SCALP, I
      forget what the French call it, it’s the same missile. Napolitano: Okay, but I
      mean, the Western sources thought the missile that killed the Russian civilians
      came from Starmer. In fact, it came from Macron. Am I correct? Doctorow: You’re
      exactly correct. Now this is not my assumption, it’s not some contacts I had with
      Russian military, nothing of the sort. I’m repeating what was on Russian television
      yesterday. And whether that is true or not is almost irrelevant. If the Russians
      are saying there was a French missile, then for all practical purposes in diplomatic
      relations, it was a French missile. Napolitano: 13:05 Wow. … What is going on
      between Russia and Azerbaijan as we speak? And how potentially inflammatory is
      this? Doctorow: It is inflammatory, but it has interest, I think, for the audience
      of this program for several reasons. I think the most prominent reason is that–
      I’ve said in the past, Russia is not a cuddly rabbit. Russia is what it is, which
      is a major power, and major powers sometimes behave badly. And in the case of
      the relations with Azerbaijan, Moscow behaved very badly. This problem, and it
      is a big problem right now, but it is more in symbolic ways. The Azerbaijanis
      are giving every day some new signal to Moscow, “Boy, we don’t like what you’re
      doing, and we don’t like you.” And they say that openly. There are accusations
      against the Kremlin directly in Azerbaijani media. And where did this start? By
      a very shabby response from the Kremlin to the downing of a passenger airplane,
      Azerbaijani airplane, about six months ago, as it was flying in the south of Russia
      and in an area which was under attack by Ukrainian drones at the time. This is–
      I’m giving you the Russian side of the story– that it was mistakenly downed, although
      they didn’t even admit that, it was mistakenly shot down because Russia was responding
      to the drones that were in the air in that area coming in from Ukraine. 14:50
      Well, whether, whatever truth there is in that, there was a mistake, la la, the
      most important thing was what the Russians didn’t do after this catastrophe which
      took many lives. They did not apologize to Azerbaijan. They did not offer to pay
      compensation for the plane, or more importantly, to the passengers on that plane.
      This was shocking. In international behavior, this was terrible. And to this day,
      the Kremlin has not said, “We are sorry; we made a mistake.” And in Baku, they’re
      furious. They have to be– in February when this occurred. Shortly afterwards,
      they closed Russia’s cultural center in Baku, Russia House. This last few days,
      they’ve shut down all Russian language courses in their secondaries, in their
      school system. These are clear messages. They’ve also arrested the editors of
      Sputnik, this Russian news agency in Baku, about which Moscow is now howling to
      the skies. The whole problem began with Moscow; and from the perspective of Azerbaijan,
      they were behaving like bullies and like imperialists. And I mention this to highlight
      this point. Let’s not get carried away and believe that every, that Russia is
      always an innocent, No, Russia is a state power, and state powers behave badly
      from time to time, and they have to be told that. Now as to how serious it is,
      I believe that there is foreign intervention here to exacerbate the situation.
      Napolitano: 16:36 When you say that, you mean MI6, CIA, or Mossad. Doctorow: None
      of the above: French. I believe the French are somehow involved. Look, the French
      are very active in the Caucasus region. They are the ones behind the rebellion,
      call it, of the prime minister of Armenia against relations with Moscow, this
      Nikol Pashinyan, who is making a bid to join the EU, who has been absent from
      major meetings of former Soviet– Napolitano: Gee, I wonder if this was discussed
      between presidents Macron and Putin yesterday. Doctorow: It could be, but of course
      none of this would come out to the public. But as I said, the French are mixed
      up in the Caucuses, and look at the map, Azerbaijan is right there. So it is not
      inconceivable that the French could have been active in exacerbating the issues.
      Napolitano: 17:36 Let’s go to Iran if we could, before we conclude. What is your
      view, Professor Doctorow, about why Donald Trump dropped those 30,000 pound bombs?
      Was it a regime change? Was it just to get Netanyahu off his back? Was it a serious
      attempt to set back the nuclear program? Or was it a pinprick, a big pinprick,
      designed not to kill human beings but to bring them to the negotiating table?
      Doctorow: I think it was all of the above. The question really for any analyst
      is to weight those various factors, but they’re all present. I think that– well,
      there’s one that you didn’t mention, which I jumped on first when I was trying
      to make sense out of his action, and that is to prevent Netanyahu from using nuclear
      weapons against these Iranian positions. Because absent American assistance, that
      is the only thing that would be in the Israeli arsenal that could have a chance
      of doing the job. So I think to prevent the Israelis from doing something horrific
      and to take the ball away from Netanyahu and to eliminate either de facto really
      or in words the Iranian nuclear program and put an end to this whole crisis in
      the Middle East around the nuclear program that has been a 30 year and idee fixe
      of Netanyahu and his associates. Napolitano: 19:17 How was it that Mossad, which
      claims to be the most effective intelligence service on the planet, so grossly
      underestimated the power and ferocity and destructive capability of Iran’s retaliation?
      Didn’t they warn Netanyahu accurately of what would happen? Doctorow: I think
      they didn’t. There are a number of mistakes made by Israeli intelligence, which
      were suffering a real case of hubris after their delight in decapitating the neighboring,
      I would say, cat’s paws of Iran in Lebanon with their gadgets that exploded in
      the hands of Hezbollah leaders. They certainly were delighted with having set
      the plan, this goes back several years, was waiting to spring the plan on Iran
      to decapitate its top generals in their forces and the leading scientists in their
      nuclear program. They had their eyes perfectly focused on minutiae, and they were
      suffering from near-sightedness. They didn’t focus their eyes on the big picture.
      They should have known about the 40,000 missiles. They should have known about
      the hidden launchers underground, which the Israeli air force could not decimate.
      And my assumption is that they gave Netanyahu inadequate information, which is
      for an intelligence agency, the most damning thing you can say. Napolitano: Right,
      right. I suppose the only thing worse is what the American intelligence agency
      does, telling the president what they think he wants to hear, whether it’s connected
      to the facts or not. Professor Doctorow, thank you very much. Thanks for your
      time as always. And again, Thank you for all those notes and insights that you
      periodically send. I read every word of them and appreciate all the thoughtfulness
      behind it. I guess they don’t celebrate the 4th of July in Europe. They certainly
      don’t celebrate it in England. I know you’re not in England, but have a nice weekend.
      It’s a big holiday weekend here, and we’ll look forward to seeing you next week.
      Doctorow: Well, we will celebrate. We’ll cool off. I mean, it’s been 95 degrees
      in Brussels. Tomorrow it drops to 70. Napolitano: Oh, nice to hear. All the best
      to you, Professor. Thank you. Doctorow: Thanks, bye-bye. Napolitano: 22:03 Sure.
      And coming up later today at 2 o’clock this afternoon, Aaron Mate; at 3 o’clock,
      Phil Giraldi; at 4 o’clock, we’ll find him, Max Blumenthal. Judge Napolitano for

      interviews Professor Gilbert Doctorow about the ongoing situation in Ukraine,
      focusing on Russia's military operations. Doctorow reports that Russia has successfully
      liberated the Lugansk region and is making significant advances in Donetsk, prioritizing
      the depletion of Ukrainian military personnel over territorial gains. He notes
      that while Russia is gradually seizing territory, their strategy emphasizes minimizing
      their own losses while inflicting heavy casualties on Ukrainian forces, which
      reportedly exceed a thousand daily. Doctorow highlights the destruction of key
      logistical hubs in Donetsk as part of Russia's tactical approach to weaken Ukraine's
      military capabilities.

      This brief interview touches upon several of the developments in the unfolding

      week, when relations have really turned nasty. Ukraine Demands Consistent Support
      Against Russia | Russia Ukraine War | NewsX World This is another brief interview
      with the Indian broadcaster which followed back-to-back with the foregoing interview.
      Note that this evening’s Russian state television has very extensive reporting
      on the halt to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine and uses lengthy video clips
      and newspaper citations coming from U.S., French, British and German media as
      well as the public statements of Ukrainian officials.  In the commentary show
      ‘Sixty Minutes,’ Trump’s decision to cut military aid to Ukraine is put at the
      door of Eldridge Colby, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, who is said to
      head Trump’s brain trust within the Pentagon. Colby, they say, sees no value in
      wasting further valuable equipment on Ukraine, and instead wants to direct all
      U.S. procurement and building of U.S. equipment reserves for an eventual conflict
      with China.

    text: Although the Information War that Moscow has advanced against the NATO decision
      to raise military budgets of Member States to 5% of GDP was indeed one of the
      topics in today’s chat with Judge Andrew Napolitano, we did not go into any depth
      because other subjects took precedence, including the fast deteriorating relations
      between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation and what that tells us about the
      occasional brutishness of Moscow; Emanuel Macron’s two hour phone conversation
      with Vladimir Putin yesterday; the killing and wounding of civilians in Donetsk
      City yesterday caused by a French-built Storm Shadow medium range missile fired
      by Ukrainian forces; an appreciation of the situation on the front lines in Donbas,
      where the Ukrainians are losing ground but remain in control of the discipline
      of their troops and continue fighting despite the cut-off of American military
      supplies; and why Mossad may not be the world’s greatest intel agency but a very
      near sighted bunch that is no better than peers in Washington or London. I regret
      that there was not sufficient time to go into what I consider to be a serious
      mistake by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and President Putin in describing the
      rise in military budgets as leading to a ‘catastrophic collapse’ of NATO. The
      mistake is that it is not for Moscow to say this to Western audiences. It is for
      Western journalists to say this on their own.  And they are doing that without
      any ‘help’ from the Kremlin. Today’s ‘New York Times’ has on the front page of
      its print edition in Europe an opinion piece by a guest writer who argues that
      it is a mistake for Europe to try to escape from ongoing deindustrialization by
      investing heavily in European military production. The author says that the hopes
      that such massive spending will free Europe from its dependence on the USA for
      its defense and will revitalize European economies are ‘delusory.’ On the other
      hand, when the Kremlin calls for the West to undo the plans for higher military
      budgets, saying this is self-destructive, it gives a bad name to all of those
      in the West who are saying precisely that on our own. We instantly become ‘stooges
      of Moscow.’

      but maintaining discipline despite a lack of American military supplies. Notably,
      the dialogue did not delve deeply into Russia's criticism of NATO's decision to
      increase military budgets to 5% of GDP, which the author believes should be articulated
      by Western journalists rather than Moscow. An opinion piece in the New York Times
      echoed this sentiment, arguing against Europe's heavy investment in military production

    text: 'Transcript submitted by a reader https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLwjoRuonU
      NewsX: 0:02 For our top story, we start in Europe, where Russia’s Foreign Minister
      Sergei Lavrov has warned that NATO’s push to increase defence spending could backfire.
      Speaking in Moscow, Lavrov says the move may lead to the catastrophic collapse
      of the alliance. He added that NATO should be guided by common sense rather than
      escalating spending. NATO leaders recently agreed to raise defence spending to
      five percent of GDP over the next decade, a target driven by US President Donald
      Trump’s demands for increased burden sharing. Meanwhile, Russia says it plans
      to cut military spending next year despite a current defense budget that makes
      up 6.3 percent of GDP, its highest since the Cold War. Lavrov’s comments came
      in response to Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikowski, who warned an arms
      race could trigger Putin’s fall. Russia continues to dismiss claims that it would
      attack a NATO member, but the tensions reflected deep divisions over security
      and spending priorities across Europe. 1:07 We’re now joined by Gilbert Doctorow,
      who is a Russian affairs expert, and he joins us live from Brussels. Gilbert,
      thank you for joining us on the program. Putin has reiterated his ambition for
      peace over and over again. However, if Russia does really want peace, why does
      it spend over six percent on GDP on its military, the highest since the Cold War,
      while telling NATO to use common sense and spend less? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD:
      1:35 Well I think during the Cold War, Russia, particularly at the end of the
      Cold War, Russia wasn’t at war with anyone. So it’s understandable that its military
      budget would have been lower than today. If a country is in the middle of a fierce
      war for its own existence, as Russia says it is today, it’s understandable they
      would spend a large amount of their GDP on a war. So that isn’t the issue. The
      promise to bring it down, well, that assumes, I suppose, that Russia will win
      the war with Ukraine in this time period, and so can afford to scale back its
      military budget. So long as the war is going on, as fiercely as it is today, I
      think it is improbable that any cut in the Russian budget would be realistic.
      NewsX: 2:25 It’s evident this hike in defence spending is because of fears of
      aggression. And how can Moscow dismiss these fears when much of the international
      community claims that Russia has invaded or intervened in countries like Georgia
      and also regions of Crimea and Ukraine all of which used to be in Moscow’s sphere.
      What are your thoughts on that, Gilbert? Doctorow: I think that the current Information
      War offensive by Russia– And I say that because Mr. Lavrov’s remarks are in sync
      with what President Putin was saying yesterday. And I can tell you that on major
      talk shows like Vladimir Solovyov’s talk show last night panelists were almost
      hysterical about the dangers being posed to Russia by the increased military spend
      projected for NATO. The Russians are engaging in an information war, you can call
      it propaganda, which is the old word we use for this sort of thing. 3:24 And that’s
      a mistake, because they are very poor at propaganda. They don’t do it very well,
      not nearly as well as the United States and the West does. So they’re talking
      themselves blue, but I don’t think they will have any real impact on what’s going
      on in Europe, which is faced with its own internal contradictions and really does
      not react to anything that Moscow says. The agreed-upon increase in spending in
      Europe, in NATO last week was an empty exercise as anybody who seriously looks
      at it knows. The European countries cannot raise their military budgets, and that
      includes Germany, where the government will fall if Mr. Merz proceeds with his
      ambitious plans to introduce a draft, which is what his defense minister was calling
      for a week ago. Therefore, the threat coming from Europe is by no means as real
      as the Russians are now pretending it is. And it would be better if they just
      shut up. NewsX: 4:30 Okay. Lavrov calls NATO’s collapse possibly catastrophic.
      One of the reasons why this conflict started was, of Ukraine, the possibility
      that it would join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Is this a threat, or
      does Moscow actively hope for NATO to fall apart? Doctorow: Well, of course it
      hopes that it will fall apart. There was a peculiar choice of words by Lavrov,
      “catastrophic”. Catastrophic for whom? Certainly not for the Russians. And it
      is a hyperbolic statement. It’s an exaggerated statement. In the worst-case scenario,
      NATO will not collapse catastrophically. It will downsize, it will break up into
      pieces that become part of the European Union’s defence. But the different forces
      and equipment that NATO now has will not disappear. They will be integrated or
      reintegrated in the European defense, in the worst-case scenario. So Mr. Lavrov’s
      choice of words was very peculiar. NewsX: 5:41 Yes indeed. He also claimed that
      Russia will cut its military spending down from the 6.3 percent it’s currently
      at. Why should anyone believe Russia’s claim while, [on] spending the next year,
      while still fighting this costly war in Ukraine? Doctorow: Well, as I said a moment
      ago, the hidden assumption of that statement that was made by President Putin
      and is repeated by his foreign Minister, the hidden assumption, is that the war
      will end because Russia will win, because Ukraine will capitulate. Now, that is
      the assumption. Nobody, he isn’t saying that. But if it is true, if that happens,
      then of course Russia will scale back its military expenditures. If it does not
      happen and the war goes on, then of course Russia will continue to spend it at
      its present level, if not even more. NewsX: 6:40 Gilbert Doctorow, thank you very
      much for joining us on the programme and for your insights.'
    one_sentence_summary: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has cautioned that
      NATO's decision to increase defense spending could lead to the alliance's collapse,

    paragraph_summary: In a recent statement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
      cautioned that NATO's decision to increase defense spending to five percent of
      GDP over the next decade could lead to the alliance's downfall, urging NATO to
      prioritize common sense over escalating military expenditures. This shift in NATO's
      spending, influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's demands for greater burden
      sharing, has raised concerns about an arms race, as highlighted by Polish Foreign
      Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. Despite Russia's current military budget being the
      highest since the Cold War at 6.3 percent of GDP, Lavrov asserted that Russia
      plans to reduce military spending next year, while maintaining that it poses no
      threat to NATO members. Russian affairs expert Gilbert Doctorow explained that
      Russia's high military spending is a response to its ongoing conflict, suggesting
      that such expenditures are justified in the context of national survival.
