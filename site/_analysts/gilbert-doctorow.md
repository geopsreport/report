summary: |
  As the Russia-Ukraine conflict grinds on with no sign of a diplomatic breakthrough, the international response continues to evolve, marked by new economic and military measures. The latest developments reveal intensifying Western pressure on Moscow, shifting European defense postures, and ongoing debates about the effectiveness and intent of U.S. policy.
  
  The most recent episode of Andrew Napolitano’s ‘Judging Freedom’ highlighted divergent interpretations of former President Donald Trump’s newly announced punitive measures against Russia. **Scott Ritter** sharply criticized Trump’s plan for 100% secondary tariffs on Russia and increased arms shipments to Ukraine, dismissing them as “ineffective” and symptomatic of “the incompetence of U.S. leadership.” By contrast, **Colonel Douglas Macgregor** argued that Trump’s approach represents the “least harmful” option available, given mounting Congressional and establishment pressure for a tougher stance. The timing of these tariffs appears calculated to coincide with a major Russian offensive, suggesting, as **Gilbert Doctorow** notes, a complex interplay between U.S. domestic politics and the evolving military situation in Ukraine.
  
  Meanwhile, France is seeking to reassert its military relevance in Europe. In a Bastille Day interview, President Emmanuel Macron vowed to double France’s military spending by 2027, positioning the move as a response to Germany’s growing assertiveness under Chancellor Merz. **Doctorow** observes that Macron’s rhetoric aims to restore France’s leadership role, but his low popularity and the French political system’s lack of accountability may undermine his credibility. The announcement comes as NATO pushes for all members to increase defense budgets to 5% of GDP by 2035, a target that remains controversial and, according to previous analysis, may be difficult for many European states to achieve.
  
  These developments underscore a broader trend: the West is doubling down on economic and military pressure against Russia, even as doubts persist about the effectiveness of such measures. The consensus among analysts is that Trump’s tariffs and arms shipments are unlikely to force a Russian retreat or a negotiated settlement in Ukraine. Instead, they may serve primarily to satisfy domestic political demands in the U.S. and maintain unity among Western allies.
  
  Looking ahead, it is quite likely that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will remain stalemated, with both sides escalating their efforts but neither able to secure a decisive advantage in the near term. The Western push for higher defense spending is expected to continue, but its practical impact will depend on political will and economic realities across Europe. I guarantee that, barring a major shift in U.S. or Russian policy, the current pattern of attrition and incremental escalation will persist through the coming months.

    text: 'One of the advantages of Andrew Napolitano’s channel ‘Judging Freedom’ is
      that he invites panelists who may agree on the facts relating to some major international
      development but can offer quite divergent interpretations of the statesmen making
      that news. So it has been with respect to Donald Trump’s announcement yesterday
      that he is prepared to punish Vladimir Putin for disappointing his expectation
      that a peace with Ukraine would be concluded two months ago. In his interview
      with the Judge, Scott Ritter said that the measures that Trump had announced are
      doomed to fail – both imposition of 100% secondary tariffs against Russia and
      those countries trading with Russia and renewed, expanded arms shipments to Ukraine
      via NATO’s European Member States. The Patriot anti-missile system will not be
      able to cope with Russia’s massive ongoing air strikes across Ukraine. This factual
      part of Ritter’s assessment is accepted by a great many analysts in independent
      media, myself included. But then there was Ritter’s explanation of why these ineffectual
      punishments were announced by Trump: because the President, the key members of
      his administration and the whole of Congress are just “idiots.’ Another panelist
      on ‘Judging Freedom’ yesterday, Colonel Douglas Macgregor, described Trump’s announced
      plans as the least bad measures he could introduce in response to demands from
      his critics inside Congress and in the broader political establishment for action
      to turn back the Russian offensive and buy time for the Kiev regime. I am aligned
      with Macgregor in looking for logic in Trump’s actions, though I go several steps
      further than Macgregor has done. To be specific, I stress the timeline for imposition
      of the 100% secondary tariffs.  Fifty days! That just happens to cover what remains
      of summer 2025 while a major Russian offensive is underway. And, like so many
      of Trump’s deadlines we may assume that it will be extended if necessary. In the
      meantime, Trump has bought off the most dangerous critic within his own party,
      Senator Lindsey Graham, who is obliged to say that his pressure for sanctions
      on Russia has paid off even if he may be disgruntled that it is not going into
      effect tomorrow.  Moreover, critics of Trump within Europe also are left speechless,
      now that officially Washington is resuming arms shipments to Ukraine and is cooperating
      on their plans to supply advanced weapons systems to Kiev including the Patriot
      from their own arsenals while scheduling replacements produced for them in the
      USA against payment. My read-out is that in effect Trump is saying to Vladimir
      Putin: ‘just get on with it. Finish up this war in the coming 50 days and we will
      be friends!”  This is, I suggest, a repetition of what Trump told Netanyahu about
      his Gaza war on Hamas: “Do what you like but be fast about it!” If Vladimir Putin
      can summon the decisiveness that so far he has not shown in this war, and proceed
      to bomb the hell out of Ukraine, up to and including a decapitation strike on
      the Zelensky neo-Nazi gang in Kiev using those wonderful Oreshnik hypersonic missiles
      that Russia boasts, then the European continent will enjoy peace once again and
      the hysteria over rearmament led by Germany can be reined in. It bears mention
      that the moneyed classes in Moscow were very satisfied with Trump’s ‘surprise’
      message. The BBC yesterday reported that the Moscow stock exchange rose 4% on
      the news. Since Macgregor reports from information provided to him by friends
      in Washington that the latest behind closed doors talks between U.S. and Russian
      officials remain cordial, we may assume that Trump remains on track to pursue
      détente with Russia and hopes that the Kremlin will do what has to be done expeditiously
      and effectively. These carrots may just have more sway with Vladimir Putin than
      the sticks that Trump identified publicly yesterday. ©Gilbert Doctorow, 2025'

      to his countrymen on this national holiday of Bastille Day . https://odysee.com/@RT:fd/Doctorow-July-14-2025:3
      As I say here, Macron has never seen a microphone that he did not want to grab
      and use. His message today has to be put in the context of French-German rivalry. 
      Traditionally within the French-German tandem that ran the European Economic Community
      until 1991 and the European Union today there was a division of labor, with the
      French taking the international stage of diplomacy and military (nuclear) might
      while the Germans busied themselves with manufacturing and exporting goods. However,
      the succession of weak and incompetent French presidents these last 15 years installed
      with CIA assistance caused France to lose its feathers as a leader of Europe.
      Germany has stepped up, putting aside its reservations to be too visible given
      its Third Reich past.  The sins of the grandfathers are no longer considered in
      Germany to be an obstacle to taking the reins of power in Europe and that is just
      what Chancellor Merz has pledged to do by his massive appropriations to the German
      military industry.  Now Macron is trying to remind Europe and the world that Franch
      also counts with respect to military capability. Regrettably the French Constitution
      makes its presidents kings in all but name for 5-year terms. They cannot be thrown
      out onto the street where they belong when they lose all credibility and have
      popularity ratings of 20% or less like Macron.

      to remind both Europe and the world of France's capabilities. However, the French
      political system, which grants presidents substantial power for five-year terms,
      limits accountability, leaving Macron in a position of diminished credibility

      doubt that many members of the Community are aware of the existence of this Belgrade-based
      operation of RT. Allow me then to share my experience with them as interviewee
      a week ago. The 28-minute chat covered a lot of ground.  It opened with examination
      of the rancorous deterioration of relations between Moscow and Baku, with particular
      attention to which outsiders may be aggravating the situation for their own purposes.
      Here I speak of the French as possible meddlers, given their interests in creating
      difficulties for the Russians in the Caucasus by stirring EU ambitions among the
      Armenian leadership and the concurrent patching up of relations between Armenia
      and Azerbaijan at the expense of Russian interests in the region.  However, on
      reconsideration, looking at Paris’s strained relations with Azerbaijan’s closest
      ally, Turkey, it seems less likely that the French have a role in Russia’s problems
      with Azerbaijan today.  Indeed, it is more likely that Turkey itself is pouring
      oil on the fires of discord, since it serves their own purposes to reduce Russia’s
      presence in the Caucasus and raise their own. We moved on to other key issues
      of the day, in particular the Russia-Ukraine war and the new aggressiveness of
      Moscow in staging massive aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities. From there we moved
      to the questions surrounding European rearmament and the NATO summit’s decision
      to raise the military budgets of all Member States to 5% of GDP by 2035. We also
      talked a good deal about Trump’s efforts to extricate the USA from the Ukraine
      war to better free its hands to pursue policies in the Middle East and against
      China. Best wishes to the Serbian speakers among you.

    text: 'Glenn Diesen:  Wars Bring Together Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan & North
      Korea The first third of today’s discussion was directed at the title subject,
      namely the growing consolidation of what is a military alliance in all but name
      between these five Asian powers. The principal source for what I said was last
      night’s Vladimir Solovyov talk show which featured top level Russian academic
      Orientalists. I stress that the Solovyov shows are ‘hit or miss’ in terms of value,
      with a goodly number of wasted evenings and then the occasional highly valuable
      event such as last night. We were told that China is now shipping a lot of military
      hardware to Iran in return for the large quantities of oil it receives from Iran.
      The hardware includes fighter jets, latest generation air defense installations
      and a lot more. Moreover, China’s readiness to fight, if necessary, to ensure
      that Iran is not defeated by Israel, by the United States, was demonstrated by
      its sending a naval task force to the Gulf in the final days of the Iran-Israeli
      war – set to attack the U.S. navy if necessary. Surely this signal was not missed
      by Washington. In the words of the panelists last night, Pakistan is ready to
      send to Iran any and all military supplies that it requires.  Considering that
      Pakistan is a long-established nuclear power, I suggest that delivery of nuclear
      bombs to Iran should not be excluded if Iran comes under existential threat. From
      this angle, the total focus of attention by the United States and other Western
      powers on the levels of enrichment of uranium going on in Iran is foolishness. 
      Why build when at any moment you can buy? The other interesting appraisal of the
      aforementioned ‘axis’ pertains to North Korea, which is said to be seen in its
      neighborhood as very powerful, far more than you would imagine if The New York
      Times was your only source of information. Indeed, there is reason to think that
      South Korea is recalibrating its defense posture given that fact and the equivocal
      nature of the security guaranties it enjoys from Donald Trump’s USA. Otherwise,
      my discussion with Professor Diesen also turned on the question of Russia’s new,
      massive aerial bombardments on Ukraine. More than 728 drones and numerous missiles
      were fired at Ukrainian cities a day ago and that number is rising daily, while
      in addition there is now large-scale use of glide bombs by the Russians to destroy
      Ukrainian fortified positions.  The Russians are now attacking heavily the Western
      Ukraine, meaning Lvov and the area between Lvov and the Polish border where incoming
      shipments of arms from the West are stored for transshipment east to the front.
      The threat is being felt by the Poles, so that their president Duda yesterday
      said Poland is considering stopping the use of their airport in the southeastern
      corner of their country as the hub for Western arms shipments to Ukraine. What
      is the meaning of the new Russian aggressiveness?  I believe it is a clear signal
      to German chancellor Merz to watch out because Russia is ready for war and will
      defend its red lines with overwhelming military force.  Why Merz?  Because as
      we heard from Vladimir Solovyov last night, ‘he is a Nazi.”  That appears to be
      the new Kremlin line: Germany has replaced the United States as Russia’s enemy
      number one and Nazism is back in power in Berlin. ©Gilbert Doctorow, 2025'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the emerging military alliance among
      Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, highlighting China's military
      support to Iran in exchange for oil and its commitment to defend Iran against
      potential threats from Israel and the United States.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion led by Glenn Diesen, the growing military
      alliance among Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea was highlighted,
      emphasizing their increasing collaboration in the face of Western opposition.
      Key insights from a Vladimir Solovyov talk show revealed that China is supplying
      Iran with significant military hardware, including fighter jets and advanced air
      defense systems, in exchange for oil, and has demonstrated its willingness to
      protect Iran against threats from Israel and the U.S. Additionally, Pakistan is
      prepared to support Iran militarily, potentially including the transfer of nuclear
      capabilities if Iran faces an existential threat. The discussion also noted North
      Korea's perceived strength in its region, suggesting that South Korea may be adjusting
      its defense strategies in response. Overall, the article underscores the potential
      implications of this alliance for global security dynamics, particularly regarding
      Western policies towards Iran and North Korea.

    text: '‘Judging Freedom’: Understanding the Russian Way of War Today’s discussion
      with Judge Andrew Napolitano had two central issues. The first is captured by
      the title given to the interview above. The second concerns the vote of no confidence
      proceedings now going on in the European Parliament which, if successful, would
      remove Ursula von der Leyen from office. As I stated here the Russians have seriously
      intensified their ongoing aerial attacks on Ukraine, with latest figures of more
      than 700 drones and missiles fired at Ukrainian cities each day and the expectation
      that this will rise to 1,000 per day shortly. Moreover, they are using more than
      1,000 heavy guided bombs each day as well, creating enormous destruction of Ukrainian
      fortified positions. Meanwhile, the Russian ground forces are capturing more and
      more settlements in the Donetsk oblast, as well as in the Ukrainian oblasts of
      Kharkiv and Zaporozhie. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to assume that Ukrainian
      resistance will crumble in the immediate future. The best proof of the resilience
      and deadly skills of the Ukrainian army was the killing of Russia’s most decorated
      warrior, Lt General Gudkov on the front lines in the past week.  Gudkov is the
      officer whom we all saw on Judging Freedom a few months ago when Vladimir Putin
      spoke to sailors and officers inside a Russian submarine and announced Gudkov’s
      promotion to senior officer of all Russian marines. Just days ago, Putin was giving
      Gudkov’s widow an unprecedented second medal of Hero of the Russian Federation.
      The state funeral for Gudkov was covered on national television. The point is
      that Gudkov died from an artillery counter-strike by Ukrainians near the Russian
      guns which initiated the long-range duel. The Ukrainians clearly had the equipment,
      the trained personnel and the will to respond effectively to Russian attack. Otherwise,
      latest news from Ukraine indicates that they are now deploying optic fiber controlled
      drones similar to what the Russians introduced and are using so effectively for
      several months now. These state of the art attack weapons are impervious to electronic
      warfare jamming or to distortion of gps signals for guidance. And so I insist
      once again that the Ukraine war will end because of the political collapse of
      Kiev, not due to the collapse of the front lines as such. The second issue, namely
      the censure proceedings against von der Leyen is fascinating to follow and thanks
      to relevant videos now posted on the internet the Community can come to its own
      conclusions. My point is that the ‘omerta,’ the silence about the abuses of power
      in the European Institutions imposed and enforced by Commission President Ursula
      von der Leyen has now been broken and we all are witnesses to the rottenness in
      the organs governing the 450 million citizens of the EU Member States. Video of
      the full 49-minute discussion on the website of the European Parliament: The most
      dramatic single contribution to the debate, by Fabrice Leggeri, MEP from Marine
      Le Pen’s party which Judge Napolitano showed in our interview: The vote on the
      motion of censure of von der Leyen comes tomorrow, 10 July. ©Gilbert Doctorow,

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the intensification of Russian aerial
      attacks on Ukraine, with over 700 drones and missiles launched daily, alongside
      ground advances in various regions, while also touching on the potential removal
      of Ursula von der Leyen from her position in the European Parliament.

      over 700 drones and missiles launched daily, expected to rise to 1,000, alongside
      the use of heavy guided bombs causing significant destruction. Despite these escalated
      attacks and Russian ground forces capturing more territories in Donetsk and other
      regions, the resilience of the Ukrainian military remains evident, highlighted
      by their successful counter-strike that killed Lt. General Gudkov, a prominent
      Russian commander. This incident underscores Ukraine's capability and determination
      to resist, as they also adapt by deploying advanced drone technology. Additionally,
      the conversation touched on the political landscape in Europe, particularly the
      vote of no confidence against Ursula von der Leyen in the European Parliament.

      WION: 0:01 Trump and Zelenskyy, they met last week. They seemed to have a good
      meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit. And then what happens? The US president
      goes back home, and within days you hear that the US has halted key weapons supplies
      to Ukraine, a move that has shocked Kiev, to say the least, and left Ukraine in
      dire need as the Russian forces continue their advance into Ukraine. The White
      House said that this decision follows a routine capability review of its military
      needs. Now, if it’s a routine review, then why wasn’t it accounted for before,
      or informed to Kiev in advance? If it’s a routine review, then why is there no
      specific timeline for the resumption of military aid to Ukraine? A lot of questions
      here. I’m Shivan Chanana and to discuss this further with me on “Game Plan” is
      Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, international affairs analyst, author and historian. Doctor,
      always a pleasure speaking with you. The last time US halted military aid to Ukraine
      was after that Trump-Zelensky Oval Office fallout. This time there was no fallout.
      There was a cordial meeting, and yet the same has happened. What happened suddenly?
      Doctorow: 1:04 It’s truly difficult to give definitive answers to this very legitimate
      question you’re posing, because so much is going on that is behind closed doors.
      Perhaps we will know in 50 years, but I think we will not be around in 50 years.
      At least I won’t. And we have to make a decision today on the conduct of the war,
      the conduct of foreign policy by Donald Trump. The point that has to be made first
      is that Trump is operating in a hostile political environment. Hostile domestically,
      Congress is not with him on a rapprochement with Russia. Congress is hostile to
      Russia. Europe wants the war to continue. For Europe, the Ukrainian war presents
      Russia as the bogeyman, as the hostile enemy, and justifies further funding of
      NATO and justifies the very existence of the European Union, which has become
      a war project instead of a peace project under von der Leyen. 2:07 Now, specifically,
      what do I have in mind? Let us recall that when Biden pushed through his massive
      aid, military aid, to Kiev, that would be in the period following his departure
      from office, there were remarks that this would be Trump-proof. But we didn’t
      know exactly what that meant, and we don’t know today exactly what it meant. But
      there’s reason to believe that this worked against Trump’s initial wish to stop
      arms deliveries from the day after he took office. 2:45 We will remember that,
      you mentioned the halt that was recent. There was a halt from the first days that
      he came into office. And then it was reversed, and he continued supplies. And
      many of my peers in what we call the independent media or alternative media in
      the United States and in Europe have been saying, “Ah, Trump, how can Trump present
      himself as a peacemaker when he’s continuing to supply arms to Ukraine?” I would
      maintain here, for the sake of argument, that he was continuing the arms deliveries
      because his legal team could not find a way to get around the obstacles that were
      presented in the Biden orders. 3:29 They finally did that, and now we’ve seen
      the result. The timing is a separate issue, which, of course, you are interested
      in, I will respond to “Why now?” But it took some time for the Trump legal team
      to work its way through the American legislation and find means to stop the supply.
      And do note, they have not stopped it categorically. They stopped it temporarily.
      That is part of the ruse, that is part of the trick that the Trump team is using
      now to frustrate the restrictions on its options that were put in the Biden law.
      WION: 4:10 Doctor, Now as for reports these paused shipments, they include items
      which are vital to Ukraine’s air defense and frontline operations, both of which
      are key arteries to their defenses against Russian aggression at this point. Is
      this arm-twisting Kiev into peace talks? And as you mentioned and briefly, you
      know, why is it happening as of now? And there is no date to when this will resume,
      so is it an open-ended military halt? Doctorow: 4:42 It’s an open-ended military
      halt which is not called that. It’s called a “suspension”. And that certainly
      is a legal trick that is relevant in relations with Congress and the courts in
      the United States. We have to pay attention to that. Now, you mentioned defensive.
      But this halt is on both defensive and offensive weapons. The defensive side are
      the interceptors, Patriots, and other equipment which the United States has provided
      to Ukraine, but much of which it withdrew at the outset of the 12-day Israeli-Iran
      war to take to the Middle East to safeguard American bases in the Gulf states.
      5:28 So not only is the United States not supplying further Patriots as requested,
      or should we say demanded by Zelensky in his last meeting with Trump here in The
      Hague, but it has reduced what little they had before the Iran-Israeli war. That’s
      the defensive side. On the offensive side, they have cut back on deliveries of
      precision missiles. This we can assume takes in the various short- to medium-range
      missiles which the United States supplied earlier. And we may assume it has cut
      back on artillery shells, which are of vital importance to Ukrainians on the front
      lines. 6:20 So this is very important. And to whom is this a signal? Well, yes,
      of course to Kiev, but I’d say also a signal to the European Union and NATO that
      the United States is withdrawing from this war. WION: That’s a very strong signal
      if that’s exactly how the European Union also perceives it, it is going to be
      a message with a thousand words. At this point also, Doctor … Russia has declared
      that they have taken over Luhansk. Luhansk has fallen to the Russian government
      at this point. That’s what they’re claiming. And in the midst of this, to halt
      military aid to Ukraine, is it just really bad timing for Ukraine or strategic
      timing for the U.S.? And after, Luhansk, is Sumy next? Doctorow: Well, let’s take
      a look at the Luhansk story, Luhansk, Lugansk, which is the Ukrainian or Russian
      pronunciation of these oblasts. There are two oblasts that constitute the core
      of Russia’s move into what was once Ukraine. This is Donbas. There is Donetsk
      and Lugansk. From the very beginning, Russia’s occupation or possession of Lugansk
      was relatively high. Seventy-five, 80 percent, perhaps, was held by Russian forces
      or Russian-friendly forces, because after all It was the local militias that held
      the territory, not the Russian army, when this war started. And in Donetsk it
      was less than 50 percent. Maybe 40 percent was held by Russia-friendly forces.
      The reasons are clear. There was very heavy fortification, building defensive
      concrete bunkers from which the Ukrainians could send their artillery shells or
      missiles into Donetsk. 8:15 That was very difficult to overcome. And even after
      two and a half years of war, it was still marginal, with a town that settlements
      10, 15 kilometers away from Donetsk city, which is the capital of the province
      or region of the same name, were held by Ukrainians from which they were daily
      firing artillery shells into residential neighborhoods. Now, in Lugansk, the advance
      was slow, from a very high level to begin with. And this conquest of all of it
      is three percent. Let’s be clear about that. It was the final three percent of
      the Lugansk oblast that was taken in the last several days by Russian forces.
      9:03 Donetsk, where are they now? The Russians are not staging a massive assault.
      They are go slow, pushing here, pushing there, wherever they detect a weak spot,
      because the Ukrainians really are undermanned to hold a 1,200-kilometer-long front
      with equal force and strength. So the Russians have been feeling for weak points
      and striking there, but making progress every day. And their interest is, first
      of all, to remove from the field the Ukrainian soldiers, by killing them or wounding
      them so they’re taken away, to reduce the size of the Ukrainian defenses. 9:47
      That has been their primary objective. Taking territory is a result of the first.
      They have been making progress, and they are concentrating their efforts on a
      couple of … one could call them, logistics hubs, which supply the Ukrainian front
      lines. First and foremost is the city of Pakrovsk. Pakrovsk is the Ukrainian name.
      The Russians know the same town as Krasnoyarsk. So you hear both terms in daily
      news, depending on what the source was, Russian or Ukrainian. The Russians are
      not storming the city. That type of behavior, which was typical in the first year
      of the war, is no longer practiced because it’s very expensive in loss of life
      on the offensive side, on the attacking side. But they are destroying it systematically
      by bombardment, artillery, and drones. 10:39 They will capture Pakrovsk, which
      will greatly weaken the Ukrainian forces along the line, because that’s where
      their supplies have been coming from and food. Then further afield, a little bit
      away from Pakrovsk, there are the towns of Kramatorsk and Slaviansk. These were
      the towns of great importance, iconic importance, in the start of the DAPAC in
      2014, when these two oblasts rebelled against the newly installed regime in Kiev
      following a coup d’état. This is in February 2014. These two towns, or particularly
      Slaviansk, was held by a very small militia force against a much larger Ukrainian
      army force. 11:31 And to take it to something that will resonate with American
      viewers was kind of Alamo of Ukraine. Alamo was a last stand, a last, known in
      American history for patriotic self-sacrifice. And that’s what was going on in
      Slaviansk for 85 days in 2014. And so to be retaken by Russian forces is significant,
      because from there it’s a clear plain straight to the Dnieper River. And that
      is the east-west divide 50-50 between West Ukraine, which is where the ultra-nationalists
      come from, and the East Ukraine, which was always heavily populated, majority
      populated by Russian speakers. WION: 12:19 Understood. Thanks so much Dr. Gilbert
      for encapsulating all that information. You’ve really taken the trajectory right
      from 2014, Crimea to now and what Russia may plan to do next. But as of what Trump
      has done or what the US is doing with Ukraine, that is anyone’s guess at this
      point. There’s a lot happening behind closed doors, which one will need to wait
      and watch. Perhaps sometime from now, the truth is going to come out. As of now,
      one knows for sure that there is a lot of backdoor negotiation which is going
      on, results of which we are seeing in these headlines. Kiev is left scratching
      their head, they are trying to figure out what to do next when US has halted their
      military aid and Russia is definitely advancing. With a friend like the US and
      a foe like Russia, what kind of options does Ukraine have? 13:04 We will be, you
      know, tracking all these developments closely right here on “Game Plan”. That
      was Gilbert Doctorow joining me on the show. Thank you so much, Doctor.'
    one_sentence_summary: Following a seemingly positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy
      at the NATO summit, the U.S. unexpectedly halted key military aid to Ukraine,
      leaving the country in a precarious situation as Russian forces advance, raising
      questions about the timing and communication of this decision.
    paragraph_summary: During a recent NATO summit, U.S. President Donald Trump and
      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had a positive meeting, but shortly after,
      the U.S. announced a halt to key military aid to Ukraine, leaving the country
      in a precarious situation as Russian forces advance. This decision, attributed
      to a routine review of military needs, raised questions about its timing and communication
      with Ukraine, especially since there was no prior indication of such a change.
      Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, an international affairs analyst, discussed the complexities
      behind this decision, noting that Trump faces a challenging political landscape
      domestically, with Congress opposing any rapprochement with Russia, while Europe
      benefits from the ongoing conflict by framing Russia as a threat that justifies
      NATO funding.

      Lt. Col. Daniel Davis: 0:00 If you didn’t know any better, you would think from
      watching the headlines that the war between Russia and Ukraine has kind of devolved
      into a budget battle. Who’s going to spend the most money? Who’s bringing in the
      most contractors? Who’s got the most deals to make, et cetera. But as we’re going
      to see, there is that going on, but there is still a war going on and there is
      still progress on the ground. There are still people dying that are not impressed
      one way or the other with whose deal somebody’s making or what they’re trying
      to accomplish on the on the spreadsheet. But as we know, of course, war does require
      finances. And if you don’t have that, then you don’t have a war. We’re going to
      see how that tails in as well. And to try and help us unpack some of this, we
      have for the first time on the Daniel Davis Deep Dive, Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, a
      historian and international affairs analyst and author of the book, “War Diaries,
      Part One, Russia-Ukraine War 2022 to 2023.” First of all, Professor, welcome to
      the show. Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: Well, very kind of you to invite me. Davis: 0:58
      Listen, I wonder just because this is the first time you’ve been on our show.
      I know a lot of our audience is familiar with your work in a number of other different
      venues, but I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about this book that you’ve
      written here and especially because it’s called Part One. What did you learn during
      the publication of this book and where are you going next? Doctorow: Well, as
      I say in the Foreword to it, I thought this would be a thin volume. But then the
      war started. Russia had such a commanding presence and was threatening Kiev from
      day one of their invasion, but it looked like this could be over rather quickly.
      And I don’t think I was the only one who assumed that. As it’s turned out, we
      were all mistaken. The war has progressed in surges, various stages of escalation
      that were not to be anticipated. The risk-taking of the Biden administration was
      in no way clear as a possibility or a likelihood when the war began. And the Russian
      way of war was by no means understood in the West, and even today is not clearly
      understood, since the expectation is the only way you can fight a war is the American
      way, which is shock and awe. And that didn’t happen. 2:11 The fact is, the American
      wars have been on territory without any personal presence, that is, without an
      American presence there before the troops moved in, without an interest in the
      people as such and in the value of human life in the territories we entered —
      in the Middle East, I’m speaking about now. In the Russian case with Ukraine,
      they are, these are two nations or peoples that have lived together and intermingled
      for 500 years or more. And the Russian interest was initially not to cause too
      much damage and too much loss of life in the anticipation that these are neighbors
      and we’ll have to live with them in the future. Moreover, they are, those neighbors
      are the brother-in-law, sister-in-law, mother-father of many people living all
      over what was the Soviet Union and today is the Russian Federation. For these
      reasons, the Russians conducted the war in a rather, in a very different way from
      what people in the West expected. It was misinterpreted in the West as signs of
      Russian weakness. Davis: Let me ask you, on that topic, I’m just wondering what
      you may have discovered through the reading of your book, what the US actually
      anticipated ahead of time, because Biden famously said, you know, “Our intelligence
      says they’re getting ready to go, they’ve made a decision”, all this kind of stuff.
      We moved out a lot of our diplomatic personnel, left Kiev, and even offered a
      ride to Zelensky to get out, and he, of course, had a pretty famous quip to that.
      But what did the US expect to happen in that initial onslaught? Doctorow: 3:53
      I think it was just what I just said a moment ago: this would be over in a very
      short time. Then there was a misinterpretation which comes into the nature of
      propaganda, and say false information or disinformation as to what went wrong
      and why the Russians didn’t just move into Kiev as going down the rose garden.
      Here, the errors are not just in Western expectations, but also in Russian expectations.
      The Russians had a conflict, a military conflict with the Ukrainians in 2014 in
      the spring following the installation of the radical nationalist government in
      Kiev with assistance from the United States, the Russians had a military conflict.
      In the Crimea, we know there was a standoff, a standoff that ended in complete
      Russian victory, because the Ukrainian forces in the Crimea, which were roughly
      the same number, 20,000, on the peninsula for each of the sides, just gave up.
      The Russians said, :You have a choice. You raise the white flag. You can go home
      in Ukraine, or you can come and join us.” 5:01 And indeed, some of the Ukrainian
      forces joined the Russians, and others just went home. There weren’t many gunshots.
      And the Russians were spoiled about that. They expected that indeed the Ukrainian
      army would– seeing the vast forces arrayed against them what, 50, 60 miles away
      from their capital on the Belarus side of the border– that they would again retreat
      and that the people, the local people would come out in the familiar Slavic fashion
      with salt and bread to greet the Russian liberators. That didn’t happen at all.
      Eight years of work by the American and British intelligence agencies, by the
      Pentagon, had changed completely the psychology of the Ukrainian army. And it
      was now a formidable fighting force. Moreover, it was, and this was not foreseeable,
      it was largely under the control of those same radicals who were behind the Maidan
      storming and installation of a new government by force. These people, the Azov
      Battalion and other radical nationalists had been integrated into the normal Ukrainian
      armed forces, with the result that the notion of raising a white flag didn’t exist
      any more. The Russians’ intelligence, it’s quite surprising, their intelligence
      was very faulty. They did not anticipate that they would have a stiff fight. What
      happened when those tanks approached Kiev? Were they really, suffered enormous
      defeats as Western reports went because of the use of the shoulder-held anti-tank
      weapons supplied by the United States? We don’t know. I don’t know for certain.
      I’m not a military expert, as you mentioned correctly at the outset, but there
      are a lot of open questions that no one has answered satisfactorily about these
      first months of the war. 7:27 The Russian story is that they were preparing the
      way for negotiations. Indeed, the negotiations started very soon after the Russian
      invasion. The Russians invaded about 23rd of February, 24th of February. The negotiations
      started several weeks later. These were first in Belarus and then moved to Istanbul.
      And by the end of April, we know that there was a lengthy document agreed by negotiating
      parties on both sides, for– Davis: Actually, I want to ask you a specific question
      on this time frame. I’m really grateful that you’ve studied a lot of this because
      I remember very distinctly, I want to say it was the first or second week of March,
      I think it was the second week of March, that Zelensky was quoted as saying, “Well,
      I guess I can consider maybe going to an independent, unaligned situation, i.e.
      no more NATO.” And so he was openly thinking about that, because that’s one of
      the things that the Russians had said was one of their primary objectives, was
      to prevent NATO from coming into Ukraine. And then that was leading into the Istanbul
      arguments or discussions then something a lot happened. I wonder if you have any
      insight as to what happened with Zelenski that made him say that publicly and
      then radically changed on the backside Doctorow: 8:43 Well, I wouldn’t take anything
      Zelenski said then or any time since as being … the God’s truth. Davis: Fair enough.
      Doctorow; The man … is a politician This type of little white lies or even big
      lies are the small change of politics. Now, you asked what is new in the book
      or value to the book, and I want to state this is not a comprehensive history
      of the Ukraine War. The fact that it’s 772 pages does not mean that I was writing
      a history. I was writing diaries. By that I mean my journalism is a personal variety,
      that is what I see, very often what I see around me, what I take part in. And
      in this case, the contribution that is particularly interesting, I think, to readers
      are the visits I made to Russia during, from the start of the war, at a time when
      there were almost no Western journalists in Russia, first because they had left
      during the whole period of CoViD, and then because when it was possible to come
      back and visas were again being issued, the war started. And many Western media
      withheld their journalists, so took their journalists out of Russia, like the
      “Financial Times”, took them to Riga where they stay to this day because they
      were threatened by, or they felt threatened by Russia’s legislation against spreading
      false information about their armed forces, for which you could face a criminal
      penalty. And reporting with a Western slant could run the risk of that. So there
      were very few, almost no journalists there. There were very few people who were
      receiving visas of any kind. I happened to have what is called a humanitarian
      visa, since my wife is Russian. 10:38 And that was one of the few exceptions which
      enabled you to get a visa and stay, and come to Russia. And I used that, and I
      recorded in this book what I saw around me. The book is not about the front. The
      book is about the rear. It’s about how Russians fared during the war. And that
      is, what they suffered or didn’t suffer in terms of the “sanctions from hell”
      that the United States imposed, and Europe followed up with several months delay.
      And my reports are that initially, yes, there was a little bit of shock, but very
      quickly Russia adapted. The financial crisis was averted because they had been
      taken out of script in the banking system, and things got very normal. In fact,
      with the change of suppliers, I’m speaking now about food products, tropical fruits
      and so forth, the Russian supermarkets were very well stocked. And these are the
      things I report, not just the supermarkets, but the change over commodities in
      stores and so forth, and life in general, and the feeling of people, people on
      the ground, not just elites, but people on the ground: how are they reacting?
      And I record here the surge in patriotism when it took place. 12:01 I just, I’d
      like to say, coming back to the question you posed, what happened at the start
      and the change and what was going on during the negotiations in March, April between
      the Russians and the Ukrainians, between Putin’s team and Zelensky’s team. One
      thing that came out and surprised me when I went through my material, is that
      I had almost no notes on those negotiations. Now, particularly after Mr. Putin,
      I think it was November, December, stood up in front of journalists and waved
      this 100-, 200-page document that had been initialed by the heads of both negotiating
      teams and just needed to have one final signature by the two presidents. After
      he waved that, and after we know the whole story about Starmer, sorry, about Johnson’s,
      about Boris Johnson’s visit, which is said to have been the clincher to take Mr.
      Zelenski out of any thoughts of accommodating Russians on their war demands and
      to proceed with the war in the belief that he would get full support, military
      and financial, from the West. 13:18 Well, that is something that doesn’t ring
      true any more when I look at my notes. And I hope readers will find this and appreciate
      what it means. The reason why it comes up, and I’ll try to explain it now, is
      that neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians were very happy about that almost-signed
      peace treaty. They neither. So they were– Russian patriots think that Putin was
      giving away much too much because the territorial side of it was negligible for
      the Russians. And for the Ukrainians, their patriots would find it objectionable
      because of the new Trump conditions. Davis: Well yeah, and then now then that’s–
      not a whole lot has changed over that. And the fact, I think that the two camps
      have almost widened their views where we are now, which is going to have an impact
      on where this war is going to go here. And I want to get into, you know, kind
      of the current situation here. And with NATO, there’s an interesting statement
      made by Tammy Bruce yesterday at the State Department, which I’d like your view
      on. Bruce: 14:30 What we do know is what apparently bothers Russia is the fact
      that NATO is going to be strongly returning to its original roots of being a deterrent.
      And that is what NATO’s job has been the … advancement of their commitment to
      defense is remarkable and not only it’s– we of course support NATO completely
      and their role is imperative for a safe and stable Europe, and that’s the point:
      being a deterrent. This kind of defense spending helps them achieve that, and
      of course it is something that would not have happened without President Trump’s
      encouragement and demand. And so we’re excited about that. Davis: 15:07 So, you
      know, for the longest time, going all the way back to 2023, Trump had been talking
      about how he was going to end the war in a day. And then after he got elected,
      he said he was going to have it done even before he took office, etc. And then,
      well, that crashed into reality. And then he said something about 100 days and
      then it was, all right, we’re days away from walking. Of course, none of that
      ever happened. And now that it’s like he’s not even hardly talking about the end
      of the war at all. Now we’re going into, “Well, let’s just kind of expand NATO
      here.” But one of the things she said in there that really got my attention was
      she said, “We want to return to NATO’s role of being a defensive alliance and
      setting up for deterrence.” And I’m like, okay, if you’re returning to that, what
      was it? Because that’s the only thing it’s ever supposed to have been. How do
      you interpret that? Doctorow: 15:54 Well, her statement indicates that there are
      various flowers blooming in this garden. And I’m not sure who the gardener is
      any more. Let’s assume that it’s Donald Trump. I think she’s not clued in. My
      own reading of what happened at the Hague summit is that Donald Trump got what
      he wanted. He got this written, signed commitment by all of the NATO countries,
      so we’ll put Spain on the side as an exception, but all of the other 26 NATO,
      sorry, it’s more than 26, [about] 30 NATO countries, that they are raising their
      budgeting for military purposes to on the hard side, three percent. And if you
      want to throw in the soft side, the one and a half percent on top of that, that
      is allowed to be allocated for infrastructure development of roads and bridges,
      supposedly, which are said to have a military value. In any case, if they would
      rate go from, let’s take Belgium, it’s 1.3 percent. That’s all that Belgium has
      as a military budget today in terms of GDP. To take that to two percent, they
      will do it this year by the kind of financial fraud that represents the one and
      a half percent I just mentioned a minute ago. 17:14 And they can’t go further
      in 2026. There’s no wiggle room. There is no possibility of raising taxes, which
      are also already the highest in the Europe, if not in the world, and there is
      no possibility of taking out loans because the country is over-indebted. So they
      signed to something which they cannot deliver. They signed to it because they
      expect Mr.– I didn’t see any landmarks in that commitment to achieve this or that
      at a given date before 2035. That’s to say, the target is well after Mr. Trump
      leaves office, and the expectation that his successor will … be more lenient and
      stand step back from that. There is no intention in Europe to fulfill those commitments,
      which they cannot do. 18:09 On Mr. Trump’s side, that’s fine. He has no problem
      with that. They don’t fulfill it, and his Article 5 commitment doesn’t exist any
      more. Moreover, it gives him the possibility of cutting back on America’s contributions
      to NATO without anybody [having] a right to complain. Davis: Right. Doctorow:
      They don’t they don’t fulfill their end of the bargain, and we can’t– Davis: I
      agree. Yeah, we’ll see how that ends up playing out. You know, one … of the other
      I guess participants if you want to look at it that way, in this whole issue of
      NATO saying we’re going to go up to 5% GDP on our defense spending, et cetera,
      was the Russian side, because they had a lot of things to say in the aftermath
      of that about how we’re going to bankrupt ourselves and all this kind of stuff.
      And you have said that you actually find that to be a mistake on the part of Sergey
      Lavrov and other Russian speakers. Why is that? Doctorow: 19:11 Well, there’s
      a general tendency among the backers– most of the American political establishment,
      to think that people who disagree with the American policies that Biden was following
      are all stooges of the Kremlin. And that is not just a malign characterization
      of everyone, but it misses the point that those of us who try hard to be honest,
      and I put myself in that category, have no hesitation to say when the Russians
      are doing something stupid. And I characterized the remarks that Sergey Lavrov
      made as very poorly advised. I’ll give a very good reason. During our elections,
      particularly the last presidential election, Putin was very careful not to tip
      his hand as to which side he supported for the obvious reason that that person
      would be denounced as a friend of Putin. 20:17 Somehow that lesson has been forgotten
      when Lavrov opened his mouth and started giving advice to Europe about what they
      should do about their military budgets. That is downright stupid, because we don’t
      need that help. There are even in the “New York Times”, in its front page, at
      least in the European edition, which I read two days ago, they had an opinion
      article, invited a guest author, which said plainly that it is risky, or they
      said the word he used was delusory, for Europe to think that it can re-industrialize
      and free itself from dependence on the United States by heavy investment in European
      weapons industry. That is in the “New York Times” on the front page. So nobody
      needed a helping hand from Mr. Lavrov or from Mr. Putin, because Lavrov, again,
      this is another fallacy that many of my peers make from my perspective, to think
      that Lavrov is an independent personality, political factor. He isn’t. Mr. Lavrov
      is a very skillful implementer of whatever his boss tells him to do. He was a
      strong nationalist when Putin was his boss. He became a very weak, flabby spokesman
      for Russia when the namby-pamby Medvedev was the president, and now he’s pretty
      much back in form under Putin, and it was actually– a lead for this information
      war offensive of this past weekend came from Putin himself. So I don’t blame Lavrov
      solely, but he should have been more cautious. To say that this would be a catastrophic
      loss for Europe, for NATO, was not very wise. Davis: 22:22 Well and then let’s
      see you brought up Vladimir Putin because one of the things that he did say, which
      might fall into a different category, maybe something that was pretty straightforward
      and honest, is that he still says, despite what the West claims constantly that
      he’s not willing to have a negotiated settlement, he has been saying he’s very
      much willing to have a negotiated settlement, but he said in this recent comment
      here in June, there’s an other alternative side. Putin: 22:50 [English voice over]
      It all started with the fact that we were lied to, that we were deceived, that
      we were swindled about the NATO enlargement to the east, because the entire world
      is aware that Russia received promises that “not an inch eastward. NATO is not
      going to enlarge to the east.” Then one wave of enlargement, the second wave of
      enlargement. And we keep saying that security of one country or of a group of
      countries cannot be insured at the expense of any other states. And there are
      documents signed to this tune. And then they kept expanding and we were told,
      “Well, you should not be concerned, you should not be afraid, it’s not a threat
      to you.” 23:33 And when we said that we do believe it’s a threat to us, then they
      did not say anything in response. They just told us to go far away with our opinions.
      No one wanted to listen to our opinions, but we know better what is a threat to
      us. It’s our right to define what’s a threat to us, and how big the threat is
      from one side or from the other side. But no one was listening to us and they
      kept on acting like that. Isn’t that an aggressive behavior? Because that’s exactly
      what aggressive behavior means. And the West doesn’t want to notice this. Davis:
      24:11 See, now that’s in a lot of, you know, Tammy Bruce, which we just showed
      you, talking about what all of NATO agreed to is this increase in defense spending,
      this increase in military capacity. And Russia seems to be saying– and you tell
      me if you agree with this or not– that look, this whole NATO coming into Ukraine
      is one of the reasons we attacked in February 2022 in the first place. And so
      if you’re talking going up now, there’s gonna be a commensurate reaction to it.
      How do you see that? Doctorow: 24:39 Well, yeah, of course. The expectation of
      Russia is an eventual Ukrainian capitulation, which will be enshrined in a document
      signed by whoever is a successor, a head of state in Ukraine after Mr. Zelensky
      is pushed aside or suffers some … misfortune. But that is not the issue. That
      is something in passing. This war is not about Ukraine. This war is about the
      relationship with NATO, as was perfectly clear when the Russians presented NATO
      and the United States with their demands that it withdraw its presence, its establishment
      from all of the new member states after 1997. The new, those countries as came
      in the successive waves of NATO expansion. 25:36 This is the primary issue, and
      it is the one which Putin had in mind when he spoke about the causes of war, we
      have to resolve the initial causes of war. Davis: And so what does that tell you
      that, you know, this is heading? If we’re, if Russia is saying, you know, that
      NATO is not something we’re going to be passive to. NATO is saying, and we’re
      going to keep going anyway, where’s this war going to end up going? Doctorow:
      26:08 Well, I think the Russians can play a waiting game very nicely. I’m fairly
      confident or certain that Mr. Putin, despite the rhetoric you’ve heard, and certainly
      despite the rhetoric of Mr. Lavrov, is confident that NATO will not be able to
      achieve this. They also achieve the increased military spending. And not just
      that, They are following very closely political developments in Germany. In Germany
      Mr. Merz is the lead personality. He’s grabbed the microphone away from Emmanuel
      Macron who otherwise wants to run out in front of whatever the marching band is
      and take control. Mr. Merz, or Chancellor Metz, has that role now. And it is improbable,
      I think, from Russian analysis, that he will stay in power for long if he proceeds
      with not just the trillion euros in investment in German military production and
      increasing the armed forces, but if he looks for the manning, which is critical.
      We know from the remarks of his defense minister, Pistorius, that the attempts,
      recent attempts to induce young Germans to enroll in the armed forces have been
      another failure. They’re going to give this a bit more time, and if it doesn’t
      produce results then they will seek to introduce a draft. And there you have the
      end of the German government, because the German government, coalition government,
      has a very narrow majority in their parliament, the Bundestag, 17 votes. It’s
      dependent on support from its junior partner, the Socialists, the SPD. And the
      SPD is split down– is split, not down the middle, no, it’s true. There are more
      socialists who back their fellow socialist Pistorius in proposing a draft, but
      there is a substantial minority, as I’m repeating the words of the “Financial
      Times”. They call it a substantial minority within the SPD who oppose this, oppose
      rearmament and particularly oppose the imposition of a draft. They vote against
      it and Mr Merz is history. I don’t believe he will be a candidate for a further
      election, because he’s widely hated in Germany. Davis: 28:52 Well, you talked
      about Macron, and now trying to take the mic and, or is it Merz coming in here.
      The other guy who’s vying for that microphone is Keir Starmer and he seems to
      be focused a lot on continuing to give more British money. Starmer: 29:08 I told
      President Zelenskyy at Downing Street on Monday that we will harden our resolve.
      We struck an agreement together to share battlefield technology, accelerating
      our support for Ukraine’s defence, while boosting British security and British
      jobs. We committed to providing hundreds more air defence missiles, paid for not
      by the British taxpayer but with money from Russia’s frozen assets. And together
      with Europe, Canada and our Indo-Pacific partners, we announced that we will deliver
      40 billion euros of military aid to Ukraine this year, matching last year’s pledge
      in full. There is a path to a just and lasting peace, but it will only come through
      flipping the pressure onto Putin. 29:58 His position is weaker than he claims,
      So I urged all our partners, including the US, to step up the pressure now with
      more sanctions and more military support to bring Russia to the table to agree
      an unconditional ceasefire leading to serious negotiations. Davis: Now how long
      do you suppose that the UK can keep going down this path? I mean he talked about
      how much they gave last year, they’re going to give a same amount of this year.
      You talked about the difficulties politically with the Merz inside the German
      government. Do you see any commensurate issues with the British government? Doctorow:
      30:36 I don’t have to see them. They’re on the BBC and British newspapers today.
      After his finance minister, Reeves, failed in her attempt to introduce a substantial
      reform in the budget to their assistance to the less well-off part of the population.
      This was a disastrous failure in parliament. She broke out into tears. That’s
      probably the first time any of these alligator lady British politicians has actually
      broken into tears in parliament. There was speculation first that she wouldn’t
      last, that she would resign. Now the speculation is that Starmer isn’t going to
      last. Because he belatedly came out to the press that he supports her fully. And
      I think he just condemned himself to loss of power by saying that. 31:38 Again,
      the Russians every evening have, or starting at like five o’clock their time to
      seven o’clock their time. They have this program, 60 Minutes, which is a commentary
      and discussion program, which has a very big section, like a third of it, is long
      video clips and long excerpts from major press, United States, UK, Germany, France,
      and they show all this. So Mr. Putin is perfectly apprised, as is the Russian
      establishment, foreign policy establishment, of these deep fissures. They’re also
      aware of the development today that, with respect to Ukraine and NATO, that the
      Poles have joined Fico of Slovakia and Orban of Hungary in taking a position against
      Ukraine joining NATO. 32:45 And of course, they’re against Ukraine joining the
      EU because it is a big threat to their agricultural economy, since Ukraine has
      vastly cheaper production costs in things like poultry and in oils, vegetable
      oils and in grains, than Poland or France or any other European member state has.
      So the fractures are there, and they’re not the whim of one personality or another.
      They’re based on real contradictions between the interests of the Ukrainians and
      the interests of member states of the European Union. So the Russians can afford
      to take their time. I don’t see that– this is my answer to your your overriding
      question of how the Russians will respond to this … NATO resolution to raise their
      finances and become an effective deterrent, as this government, US government
      spokeswoman said. And I don’t think they expect any of this to happen. Davis:
      33:56 Well, where … does that, where does that tell you that this is going to
      end up going then, because you have the NATO leaders across the board talking,
      in my view, just almost fiction that the things that can never come to pass, “just
      and lasting peace”, as Starmer says almost routinely, you know, “we’re going to
      help Ukraine for as long as it takes” some of these others and all the things
      that several these other leaders say, like Emmanuel Macron, etc. But they can’t
      happen on the battlefield, and so Russia seems to be very patient. And I wonder
      if you could in the last bit of time we have here kind of talk about the different
      approach that the Western world has as opposed to the approach that the Russian
      world has. You mentioned at the outset that we think that war has to be shock
      and awe. Russians have a different viewpoint. Where do you see after now three
      and a half years of war, where’s this going next? Doctorow: 34:46 They had a different
      viewpoint. I wouldn’t say they personally are shock and awe, but they become much
      more destructive. Destructive of civil infrastructure and less careful about avoiding
      civilian casualties. The Russians in the last two, three weeks have staged ever
      more impressive, ever bigger aerial attacks on major Ukrainian cities, and they’ve
      moved into an area that they were very cautious not to touch, lest they raise
      severe criticism in the West. They have now attacked Ukraine west of Lvov, that’s
      to say between Lvov and the Polish border, which is a staging ground for all ground-delivered
      military material coming from the United States and Western Europe. 35:43 They’ve
      now attacked west of Lvov. So there are attacks on all major cities, daily attacks
      by precision missile strikes that are set off by their Black Sea fleet. Remember
      the Black Sea fleet, which the Brits and everyone else said has been has been
      taken out of the war by these by these wonderful naval drones which the Brits
      supplied? Well forget that. Those ships, wherever exactly they are in the Black
      Sea, they are a major launching site for these precision missile attacks on the
      Ukrainian cities. They are taking out refineries, they’re taking out all stockpiles
      of parts for drones that they can identify, they are very, very damaging daily.
      35:40 And so the Russians have taken off the gloves. They’re being very tough.
      And the part of that is a result of the benefits they are enjoying from the distraction
      of all Western media and American attention of the Iran-Israeli war. From page
      one, “Russian aggression”, in quotation marks, in Ukraine, has moved to page 25,
      shall we say, figuratively speaking, in our newspapers. Nobody’s too excited about
      it. They’re very excited– now, at the same time, the latest issues of the “New
      York Times”, the “Financial Times”, are admitting openly that the Russians are
      succeeding and are pushing back the Ukrainians. So they’re preparing the broad
      public for a Ukrainian collapse. And Mr. Trump’s cutoff of supplies of Patriots
      and other air defense missiles, his cutoff of 155-millimeter artillery shells
      and … the offensive missiles that … the United States have been supplying to Ukraine
      — all of this puts the Ukrainians in a very tough spot. I don’t see capitulation
      coming tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but by the end of the summer, it could
      well be. Davis: 38:10 Yeah, and that is so ironic if just not anguishing, because
      if the end is going to come at the end of the summer, then it should come today
      instead of letting another some number of thousands more people pointlessly die
      just to drag it out. But that’s where we are. I don’t see anybody that’s going
      to change that anytime soon. But we’re going to continue to watch this and see
      what happens and we’ll just call balls and strikes as they happen. So thank you
      for coming on today and just remind people of your book there, “War Diaries, Volume
      1: The Russia-Ukraine War, 2022 – 2023”. You can find that on Amazon, see right
      there. Thank you very much and we appreciate you coming on. Doctorow: Well, my
      pleasure. I hope that there will be a final Volume 2. I don’t want to think about
      a Volume 3. Davis: 38:54 Right. Yes, yes. Let’s let that be the final one. I agree
      completely. Thank you very much. And we will see you guys next time on the Daniel
      Davis Deep Dive.'
    one_sentence_summary: Lt. Col. Daniel Davis discusses the ongoing war between Russia
      and Ukraine, emphasizing that while financial aspects and contracts are highlighted
      in the media, the conflict continues to result in significant human loss and requires
      funding to sustain military efforts.
    paragraph_summary: In a discussion featuring Lt. Col. Daniel Davis and historian
      Dr. Gilbert Doctorow, the complexities of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war are explored,
      highlighting the juxtaposition of financial aspects and the harsh realities of
      conflict. While media narratives often focus on budget battles and military contracts,
      the conversation emphasizes that the war continues to claim lives and evolve on
      the ground, despite the financial machinations surrounding it. Doctorow, author
      of "War Diaries, Part One, Russia-Ukraine War 2022 to 2023," reflects on the unexpected
      longevity and intensity of the conflict, which initially seemed poised for a swift
      resolution but has instead progressed through various phases, challenging early
      assumptions about its duration and outcome.

    text: Lt Col Daniel Davis has a distinctive pool of expert guests and audience and
      it was a great pleasure to be invited to speak today to what is largely a new
      audience for me. Davis’s particular interest was how the Russians will react to
      the possibility of a revival of NATO strength following the resolution adopted
      at the Hague summit calling for much higher spending on military needs by the
      European Member States, reaching 5% of GDP by 2035. I was given the opportunity
      to go beyond affirming the unlikelihood of any of the spending commitments ever
      being realized and to consider one by one, how long the biggest loudmouths in
      Europe favoring war preparations with Russia will last in power. Merz will fall
      if he pursues imposition of a military draft, which is the only way to retore
      the Bundeswehr to where it was before the ‘peace dividend’ of the 1990s cut the
      German army to shreds.  Starmer today looks very shaky after the reform bill cutting
      social benefits put together by his Chancellor of the Exchequer Reeves was defeated
      in the House. Meanwhile, today’s news from Poland indicates that they have joined
      Hungary and Slovakia in openly opposing Ukraine’s entry into NATO, and probably
      also in opposing Ukraine’s entry into the EU. These and other elements of this
      discussion may well be of interest to the Community.

      potential Russian response to NATO's renewed military spending commitments, particularly
      following the Hague summit's resolution for European Member States to increase
      defense budgets to 5% of GDP by 2035. He expressed skepticism about the feasibility
      of these spending goals and analyzed the political futures of European leaders
      advocating for military preparations against Russia, suggesting that figures like
      Merz in Germany could face backlash if they push for a military draft to rebuild
      the Bundeswehr. Additionally, he noted the precarious position of UK leader Starmer
      after a failed social benefits reform and highlighted Poland's alignment with
      Hungary and Slovakia in opposing Ukraine's NATO and EU membership, indicating
      a complex and evolving geopolitical landscape.

      Napolitano: 0:30 Hi everyone, Judge Andrew Napolitano here for “Judging Freedom”.
      Today is Wednesday, July 2nd, 2025. Professor Gilbert Doctorow will be here with
      us in just a moment on Russia’s information war against NATO and other relevant
      topics. But first this. [commercial message] 1:58 Professor Doctorow, welcome
      here, my dear friend. What is your understanding of the current status of the
      special military operation in Ukraine or at least the Kremlin’s view of the current
      status of the special military operation in Ukraine? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD: Well,
      the Russians announced yesterday with great pride that they had completely liberated
      Lugansk oblast, which was one of the two regions formerly of Ukraine that we call
      the Donbas. There was, about three percent was left under Ukrainian occupation
      xxxxxxx as they were viewed from Russia. But that was cleaned up. And now the
      whole of Lugansk is theirs. They were also making substantial progress in Donetsk.
      They are going after men more than going after territory. They want to deprive
      Ukraine of an effective military and do that at minimum cost to themselves. And
      so they’re proceeding not so much in a showy way by territory that they seize,
      although they are adding several square kilometers every day or two, but they
      are doing it in a way that the losses of personnel by Ukraine are again well over
      a thousand a day. Napolitano: Wow. Doctorow: In the Donbass, they continue to
      advance and to bomb and destroy the major logistical hubs that still are under
      Ukrainian control in Donetsk. And that is, first of all, Pakrovsk, as the Ukrainians
      know it, or Krasnoyarsk, as it’s called in Russian. So they show you every day
      this town, or that town, well, settlement would be a better title, that they are
      taking control of in the Donbas. The Russian flag goes up, or even a regional
      flag representing the military unit that was responsible for this particular action.
      For example, it could be the Baikal, troops from Baikal, and they would raise
      a Baikal flag over this or that hamlet. 4:21 But let’s be clear about it. The
      Ukrainians are moving back, but their lines are not collapsing. And I wouldn’t
      want to read into this, into the progress that the Russians are making, the suggestion
      that Ukraine is on the point of collapse. Nonetheless, everyone knows well that
      the Trump administration has curtailed, if not stopped, shipment of many valuable
      military assets to Ukraine. I think, first of all, those Patriots are not going
      to Ukraine. That’s clear as day. And other anti-aircraft. Napolitano: Let me just
      stop you for a second, because consistent with what you’ve said, Larry Johnson
      says, Ukraine will not be getting the Patriot missiles as you said. The thing
      they need the most, I know you’re not a military person, neither am I, but we
      can use our sense of reason. The 155 millimeter artillery shells, because the
      American supply of those is dangerously low. GMLRS rockets, I’m not sure what
      that is, and Stinger Hellfire missiles. All of a sudden, the Spigot has been partially
      closed. Please continue. Doctorow: 5:37 Yes, well, the Spigot has been closed,
      and that sends a message to the Ukrainian military that they have to be particularly
      parsimonious with their forces and avoid direct confrontation with the Russians
      where possible, because they simply don’t have the supplies of weaponry, offensive
      and defensive, that they would like and that they need. So their situation is
      dire, but not desperate, not hopeless, and not urgent in the sense that tomorrow,
      or the week after, the capitulation. It won’t be. Nonetheless, the Russians are
      feeling good about the way the war is going. And Mr. Putin has probably picked
      up a little bit more support among wavering Russian patriots who would like to
      see action faster. Napolitano: 6:35 Is there pressure on President Putin from
      his right, to get more aggressive? I’ll just throw a name out there. I don’t know
      if he says these things for PR reasons or because he’s actually saying this to
      his colleague. A former president Medvedev, for example, has from time to time
      pounds the table. Is that pressure still on President Putin? Or if it is, does
      it go in one ear and out the other? Doctorow: Well, as regards Medvedev, he’s
      well under control by President Putin, and he is the attack dog that Mr. Putin
      has set up. He’s not attacking Putin. He’s taking the initiative to put the West
      on notice about Russia’s plans for continuing the war. So I wouldn’t look at Medvedev
      as a force against Putin, not at all. He’s an instrument of Putin. But there are
      people, of course. There are, well, even this political scientist, Karaganov,
      who a year and a half ago was calling for a military strike in Germany using the
      Oreshnik, using even a tactical nuclear weapon to demonstrate that the Russians
      are serious, and to take their red lines with all due seriousness. So that pressure
      exists, but I don’t believe that Mr. Putin is responding to it or is forced to
      change his tactics, and not to mention strategy, as a result of this, since the
      armed forces have good news to put up on the television screen every day. Napolitano:
      8:22 Right. Right, right. What is the current attitude of Russia toward NATO?
      Taking into account, of course, the rather extraordinary telephone conversation
      that President Putin had with French President Macron yesterday for two hours,
      the first time they spoke in three years. Doctorow: Well, this is really two questions.
      And I don’t, I want to be sure that I get a handle on both of them. Napolitano:
      Sure, sure. Address it as you see fit, please. Doctorow: Both of them are very
      important. I think that the general public and the Western media are interpreting
      the call by Macron to Putin in the wrong way. We have very little information
      coming from anyone other than Mr. Putin as to what they talked about. He said
      they talked about, that he delivered to Mr. Macron Russia’s view of how this war
      will end. And we all know that; I won’t repeat the points, that they have to go
      back to the original source of the problem, resolve that, and not just have a
      ceasefire. So Mr. Putin used the opportunity to tell Macron directly what he otherwise
      would know indirectly from the Russian memorandum delivered to the Ukrainians
      at their last Istanbul meeting. 9:40 However, that is misleading. My understanding
      of the reason for the call is rather different. Macron reached out to Putin to
      involve the Russians in reinstating the old agreements with Iran over its enrichment
      program, the one that Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of. He– Russia was
      a party to that, and so it’s impossible for the European Union to proceed and
      try to reinsert itself into the peace process with Iran, since they’ve been totally
      sideline by the United States. If they reinsert themselves, they have to bring
      in Putin. Let’s just remember that until relatively recently, when Viktor Orban
      went to speak with Putin, he was denounced by the EU for breaking ranks with the
      rest of the EU member states over the isolation of Russia. And here we have Mr.
      Macron, as if he’s doing this on his own, spontaneously, he’s a nice guy, he’s
      just changed his view. No, He did this as the emissary of the EU on behalf of
      Kallas and von der Leyen, who want to get Russia back, to help them get back into
      the Iran negotiate. Napolitano: 11:01 Do you think he called up his buddies Keir
      Starmer and Friedrich Merz and said, “I’m about to talk to Vladimir. What do you
      want me to say to him?” Or do you think he did it on his own, with just the EU
      leadership backing? Doctorow: I think it’s the latter. Well, that’s sufficient.
      That’s entirely sufficient. He is running for the microphone and to be at the
      head of the band at any opportunity he has. And so when, say, Kallas or von der
      Leyen tapped him and said, “Look, we need somebody to reach out to Putin”, he
      would have been overjoyed. And I don’t think he would look for the consent from
      Merz who is answering– Napolitano: It’s odd that they had their conversation yesterday,
      or maybe there’s a connection here. You can analyze it for us please. French missiles
      were used to kill Russian civilians just two days ago. Could that have been the
      impetus for the Macron phone call? Doctorow: 12:05 I think it would have pushed
      things along, yes, because Macron would be aware that Russian animus towards France
      had just gone up a few levels in light of that. This missile was originally identified,
      I think, by Western sources as having been a Storm shadow. Technically speaking–
      Napolitano: If it were, that would make it British, right? Doctorow: No. Well,
      if you call it Storm Shadow, it was British. If you call it, I think, SCALP, I
      forget what the French call it, it’s the same missile. Napolitano: Okay, but I
      mean, the Western sources thought the missile that killed the Russian civilians
      came from Starmer. In fact, it came from Macron. Am I correct? Doctorow: You’re
      exactly correct. Now this is not my assumption, it’s not some contacts I had with
      Russian military, nothing of the sort. I’m repeating what was on Russian television
      yesterday. And whether that is true or not is almost irrelevant. If the Russians
      are saying there was a French missile, then for all practical purposes in diplomatic
      relations, it was a French missile. Napolitano: 13:05 Wow. … What is going on
      between Russia and Azerbaijan as we speak? And how potentially inflammatory is
      this? Doctorow: It is inflammatory, but it has interest, I think, for the audience
      of this program for several reasons. I think the most prominent reason is that–
      I’ve said in the past, Russia is not a cuddly rabbit. Russia is what it is, which
      is a major power, and major powers sometimes behave badly. And in the case of
      the relations with Azerbaijan, Moscow behaved very badly. This problem, and it
      is a big problem right now, but it is more in symbolic ways. The Azerbaijanis
      are giving every day some new signal to Moscow, “Boy, we don’t like what you’re
      doing, and we don’t like you.” And they say that openly. There are accusations
      against the Kremlin directly in Azerbaijani media. And where did this start? By
      a very shabby response from the Kremlin to the downing of a passenger airplane,
      Azerbaijani airplane, about six months ago, as it was flying in the south of Russia
      and in an area which was under attack by Ukrainian drones at the time. This is–
      I’m giving you the Russian side of the story– that it was mistakenly downed, although
      they didn’t even admit that, it was mistakenly shot down because Russia was responding
      to the drones that were in the air in that area coming in from Ukraine. 14:50
      Well, whether, whatever truth there is in that, there was a mistake, la la, the
      most important thing was what the Russians didn’t do after this catastrophe which
      took many lives. They did not apologize to Azerbaijan. They did not offer to pay
      compensation for the plane, or more importantly, to the passengers on that plane.
      This was shocking. In international behavior, this was terrible. And to this day,
      the Kremlin has not said, “We are sorry; we made a mistake.” And in Baku, they’re
      furious. They have to be– in February when this occurred. Shortly afterwards,
      they closed Russia’s cultural center in Baku, Russia House. This last few days,
      they’ve shut down all Russian language courses in their secondaries, in their
      school system. These are clear messages. They’ve also arrested the editors of
      Sputnik, this Russian news agency in Baku, about which Moscow is now howling to
      the skies. The whole problem began with Moscow; and from the perspective of Azerbaijan,
      they were behaving like bullies and like imperialists. And I mention this to highlight
      this point. Let’s not get carried away and believe that every, that Russia is
      always an innocent, No, Russia is a state power, and state powers behave badly
      from time to time, and they have to be told that. Now as to how serious it is,
      I believe that there is foreign intervention here to exacerbate the situation.
      Napolitano: 16:36 When you say that, you mean MI6, CIA, or Mossad. Doctorow: None
      of the above: French. I believe the French are somehow involved. Look, the French
      are very active in the Caucasus region. They are the ones behind the rebellion,
      call it, of the prime minister of Armenia against relations with Moscow, this
      Nikol Pashinyan, who is making a bid to join the EU, who has been absent from
      major meetings of former Soviet– Napolitano: Gee, I wonder if this was discussed
      between presidents Macron and Putin yesterday. Doctorow: It could be, but of course
      none of this would come out to the public. But as I said, the French are mixed
      up in the Caucuses, and look at the map, Azerbaijan is right there. So it is not
      inconceivable that the French could have been active in exacerbating the issues.
      Napolitano: 17:36 Let’s go to Iran if we could, before we conclude. What is your
      view, Professor Doctorow, about why Donald Trump dropped those 30,000 pound bombs?
      Was it a regime change? Was it just to get Netanyahu off his back? Was it a serious
      attempt to set back the nuclear program? Or was it a pinprick, a big pinprick,
      designed not to kill human beings but to bring them to the negotiating table?
      Doctorow: I think it was all of the above. The question really for any analyst
      is to weight those various factors, but they’re all present. I think that– well,
      there’s one that you didn’t mention, which I jumped on first when I was trying
      to make sense out of his action, and that is to prevent Netanyahu from using nuclear
      weapons against these Iranian positions. Because absent American assistance, that
      is the only thing that would be in the Israeli arsenal that could have a chance
      of doing the job. So I think to prevent the Israelis from doing something horrific
      and to take the ball away from Netanyahu and to eliminate either de facto really
      or in words the Iranian nuclear program and put an end to this whole crisis in
      the Middle East around the nuclear program that has been a 30 year and idee fixe
      of Netanyahu and his associates. Napolitano: 19:17 How was it that Mossad, which
      claims to be the most effective intelligence service on the planet, so grossly
      underestimated the power and ferocity and destructive capability of Iran’s retaliation?
      Didn’t they warn Netanyahu accurately of what would happen? Doctorow: I think
      they didn’t. There are a number of mistakes made by Israeli intelligence, which
      were suffering a real case of hubris after their delight in decapitating the neighboring,
      I would say, cat’s paws of Iran in Lebanon with their gadgets that exploded in
      the hands of Hezbollah leaders. They certainly were delighted with having set
      the plan, this goes back several years, was waiting to spring the plan on Iran
      to decapitate its top generals in their forces and the leading scientists in their
      nuclear program. They had their eyes perfectly focused on minutiae, and they were
      suffering from near-sightedness. They didn’t focus their eyes on the big picture.
      They should have known about the 40,000 missiles. They should have known about
      the hidden launchers underground, which the Israeli air force could not decimate.
      And my assumption is that they gave Netanyahu inadequate information, which is
      for an intelligence agency, the most damning thing you can say. Napolitano: Right,
      right. I suppose the only thing worse is what the American intelligence agency
      does, telling the president what they think he wants to hear, whether it’s connected
      to the facts or not. Professor Doctorow, thank you very much. Thanks for your
      time as always. And again, Thank you for all those notes and insights that you
      periodically send. I read every word of them and appreciate all the thoughtfulness
      behind it. I guess they don’t celebrate the 4th of July in Europe. They certainly
      don’t celebrate it in England. I know you’re not in England, but have a nice weekend.
      It’s a big holiday weekend here, and we’ll look forward to seeing you next week.
      Doctorow: Well, we will celebrate. We’ll cool off. I mean, it’s been 95 degrees
      in Brussels. Tomorrow it drops to 70. Napolitano: Oh, nice to hear. All the best
      to you, Professor. Thank you. Doctorow: Thanks, bye-bye. Napolitano: 22:03 Sure.
      And coming up later today at 2 o’clock this afternoon, Aaron Mate; at 3 o’clock,
      Phil Giraldi; at 4 o’clock, we’ll find him, Max Blumenthal. Judge Napolitano for

      the Lugansk region in Ukraine, highlighting the Kremlin's perspective on the ongoing
      military operation.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of "Judging Freedom," Judge Andrew Napolitano
      interviews Professor Gilbert Doctorow about the ongoing situation in Ukraine,
      focusing on Russia's military operations. Doctorow reports that Russia has successfully
      liberated the Lugansk region and is making significant advances in Donetsk, prioritizing
      the depletion of Ukrainian military personnel over territorial gains. He notes
      that while Russia is gradually seizing territory, their strategy emphasizes minimizing
      their own losses while inflicting heavy casualties on Ukrainian forces, which
      reportedly exceed a thousand daily. Doctorow highlights the destruction of key
      logistical hubs in Donetsk as part of Russia's tactical approach to weaken Ukraine's
      military capabilities.

      I consider it an honor to have been invited by them to deliver commentary on Russia-related
      events going back more than two years. During that time their programming has
      changed somewhat:  more daily coverage is handled strictly by their own journalist
      staff and outside experts are less frequent guests.  Nonetheless, when they do
      extend an invitation, as they did early this morning, it is to participate in
      a well-prepared discussion with one of their lead presenters. You will note that
      the presenter slipped in the word ‘aggression’ when speaking of the latest Russian
      advances on front lines in Ukraine.  This is understandable because Indian public
      opinion is fairly divided between the United States and Russian positions, and
      when inviting on air an analyst known to be critical of U.S. narratives like myself,
      the broadcaster balances this out by leaning a bit in the other direction. I recall
      a comment from a listener to one of my early interviews with WION: ‘he makes good

    text: Russia Denied Access To its detained Citizens In Azerbaijan | NewsX World
      This brief interview touches upon several of the developments in the unfolding
      confrontation between Baku and Moscow going back to the shoot down of an Azerbaijan
      passenger plane over Russia about 6 months ago and coming straight up to this
      week, when relations have really turned nasty. Ukraine Demands Consistent Support
      Against Russia | Russia Ukraine War | NewsX World This is another brief interview
      with the Indian broadcaster which followed back-to-back with the foregoing interview.
      Note that this evening’s Russian state television has very extensive reporting
      on the halt to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine and uses lengthy video clips
      and newspaper citations coming from U.S., French, British and German media as
      well as the public statements of Ukrainian officials.  In the commentary show
      ‘Sixty Minutes,’ Trump’s decision to cut military aid to Ukraine is put at the
      door of Eldridge Colby, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, who is said to
      head Trump’s brain trust within the Pentagon. Colby, they say, sees no value in
      wasting further valuable equipment on Ukraine, and instead wants to direct all
      U.S. procurement and building of U.S. equipment reserves for an eventual conflict
      with China.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses escalating tensions between Russia and
      Azerbaijan, particularly following the shootdown of an Azerbaijani passenger plane
      over Russia six months ago, which has led to Russia denying access to its detained
      citizens in Azerbaijan. Additionally, it highlights Ukraine's call for consistent
      support against Russia amid reports on Russian state television regarding a halt
      to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine. The commentary on the show 'Sixty Minutes'
      attributes the decision to cut military aid to Ukraine to Eldridge Colby, the
      Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, who advocates for reallocating U.S. military
      resources towards preparing for potential conflict with China instead.

  - title: '‘Judging Freedom’: Russia’s Info War vs NATO'

    text: Although the Information War that Moscow has advanced against the NATO decision
      to raise military budgets of Member States to 5% of GDP was indeed one of the
      topics in today’s chat with Judge Andrew Napolitano, we did not go into any depth
      because other subjects took precedence, including the fast deteriorating relations
      between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation and what that tells us about the
      occasional brutishness of Moscow; Emanuel Macron’s two hour phone conversation
      with Vladimir Putin yesterday; the killing and wounding of civilians in Donetsk
      City yesterday caused by a French-built Storm Shadow medium range missile fired
      by Ukrainian forces; an appreciation of the situation on the front lines in Donbas,
      where the Ukrainians are losing ground but remain in control of the discipline
      of their troops and continue fighting despite the cut-off of American military
      supplies; and why Mossad may not be the world’s greatest intel agency but a very
      near sighted bunch that is no better than peers in Washington or London. I regret
      that there was not sufficient time to go into what I consider to be a serious
      mistake by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and President Putin in describing the
      rise in military budgets as leading to a ‘catastrophic collapse’ of NATO. The
      mistake is that it is not for Moscow to say this to Western audiences. It is for
      Western journalists to say this on their own.  And they are doing that without
      any ‘help’ from the Kremlin. Today’s ‘New York Times’ has on the front page of
      its print edition in Europe an opinion piece by a guest writer who argues that
      it is a mistake for Europe to try to escape from ongoing deindustrialization by
      investing heavily in European military production. The author says that the hopes
      that such massive spending will free Europe from its dependence on the USA for
      its defense and will revitalize European economies are ‘delusory.’ On the other
      hand, when the Kremlin calls for the West to undo the plans for higher military
      budgets, saying this is self-destructive, it gives a bad name to all of those
      in the West who are saying precisely that on our own. We instantly become ‘stooges
      of Moscow.’
    one_sentence_summary: The discussion with Judge Andrew Napolitano touched on various
      geopolitical issues, including NATO's military budget increase, deteriorating
      Azerbaijan-Russia relations, Macron's conversation with Putin, civilian casualties
      in Donetsk from Ukrainian missile strikes, the situation in Donbas, and criticisms
      of Mossad's intelligence capabilities.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion with Judge Andrew Napolitano, various
      pressing geopolitical issues were addressed, including the strained relations
      between Azerbaijan and Russia, Emmanuel Macron's conversation with Vladimir Putin,
      and the impact of Ukrainian military actions on civilians in Donetsk City. The
      conversation touched on the situation in Donbas, where Ukrainian forces are struggling
      but maintaining discipline despite a lack of American military supplies. Notably,
      the dialogue did not delve deeply into Russia's criticism of NATO's decision to
      increase military budgets to 5% of GDP, which the author believes should be articulated
      by Western journalists rather than Moscow. An opinion piece in the New York Times
      echoed this sentiment, arguing against Europe's heavy investment in military production
      as a means to escape deindustrialization and reduce dependence on the U.S. for
      defense, labeling such hopes as misguided.

    text: 'Transcript submitted by a reader https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdLwjoRuonU
      NewsX: 0:02 For our top story, we start in Europe, where Russia’s Foreign Minister
      Sergei Lavrov has warned that NATO’s push to increase defence spending could backfire.
      Speaking in Moscow, Lavrov says the move may lead to the catastrophic collapse
      of the alliance. He added that NATO should be guided by common sense rather than
      escalating spending. NATO leaders recently agreed to raise defence spending to
      five percent of GDP over the next decade, a target driven by US President Donald
      Trump’s demands for increased burden sharing. Meanwhile, Russia says it plans
      to cut military spending next year despite a current defense budget that makes
      up 6.3 percent of GDP, its highest since the Cold War. Lavrov’s comments came
      in response to Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikowski, who warned an arms
      race could trigger Putin’s fall. Russia continues to dismiss claims that it would
      attack a NATO member, but the tensions reflected deep divisions over security
      and spending priorities across Europe. 1:07 We’re now joined by Gilbert Doctorow,
      who is a Russian affairs expert, and he joins us live from Brussels. Gilbert,
      thank you for joining us on the program. Putin has reiterated his ambition for
      peace over and over again. However, if Russia does really want peace, why does
      it spend over six percent on GDP on its military, the highest since the Cold War,
      while telling NATO to use common sense and spend less? Gilbert Doctorow, PhD:
      1:35 Well I think during the Cold War, Russia, particularly at the end of the
      Cold War, Russia wasn’t at war with anyone. So it’s understandable that its military
      budget would have been lower than today. If a country is in the middle of a fierce
      war for its own existence, as Russia says it is today, it’s understandable they
      would spend a large amount of their GDP on a war. So that isn’t the issue. The
      promise to bring it down, well, that assumes, I suppose, that Russia will win
      the war with Ukraine in this time period, and so can afford to scale back its
      military budget. So long as the war is going on, as fiercely as it is today, I
      think it is improbable that any cut in the Russian budget would be realistic.
      NewsX: 2:25 It’s evident this hike in defence spending is because of fears of
      aggression. And how can Moscow dismiss these fears when much of the international
      community claims that Russia has invaded or intervened in countries like Georgia
      and also regions of Crimea and Ukraine all of which used to be in Moscow’s sphere.
      What are your thoughts on that, Gilbert? Doctorow: I think that the current Information
      War offensive by Russia– And I say that because Mr. Lavrov’s remarks are in sync
      with what President Putin was saying yesterday. And I can tell you that on major
      talk shows like Vladimir Solovyov’s talk show last night panelists were almost
      hysterical about the dangers being posed to Russia by the increased military spend
      projected for NATO. The Russians are engaging in an information war, you can call
      it propaganda, which is the old word we use for this sort of thing. 3:24 And that’s
      a mistake, because they are very poor at propaganda. They don’t do it very well,
      not nearly as well as the United States and the West does. So they’re talking
      themselves blue, but I don’t think they will have any real impact on what’s going
      on in Europe, which is faced with its own internal contradictions and really does
      not react to anything that Moscow says. The agreed-upon increase in spending in
      Europe, in NATO last week was an empty exercise as anybody who seriously looks
      at it knows. The European countries cannot raise their military budgets, and that
      includes Germany, where the government will fall if Mr. Merz proceeds with his
      ambitious plans to introduce a draft, which is what his defense minister was calling
      for a week ago. Therefore, the threat coming from Europe is by no means as real
      as the Russians are now pretending it is. And it would be better if they just
      shut up. NewsX: 4:30 Okay. Lavrov calls NATO’s collapse possibly catastrophic.
      One of the reasons why this conflict started was, of Ukraine, the possibility
      that it would join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Is this a threat, or
      does Moscow actively hope for NATO to fall apart? Doctorow: Well, of course it
      hopes that it will fall apart. There was a peculiar choice of words by Lavrov,
      “catastrophic”. Catastrophic for whom? Certainly not for the Russians. And it
      is a hyperbolic statement. It’s an exaggerated statement. In the worst-case scenario,
      NATO will not collapse catastrophically. It will downsize, it will break up into
      pieces that become part of the European Union’s defence. But the different forces
      and equipment that NATO now has will not disappear. They will be integrated or
      reintegrated in the European defense, in the worst-case scenario. So Mr. Lavrov’s
      choice of words was very peculiar. NewsX: 5:41 Yes indeed. He also claimed that
      Russia will cut its military spending down from the 6.3 percent it’s currently
      at. Why should anyone believe Russia’s claim while, [on] spending the next year,
      while still fighting this costly war in Ukraine? Doctorow: Well, as I said a moment
      ago, the hidden assumption of that statement that was made by President Putin
      and is repeated by his foreign Minister, the hidden assumption, is that the war
      will end because Russia will win, because Ukraine will capitulate. Now, that is
      the assumption. Nobody, he isn’t saying that. But if it is true, if that happens,
      then of course Russia will scale back its military expenditures. If it does not
      happen and the war goes on, then of course Russia will continue to spend it at
      its present level, if not even more. NewsX: 6:40 Gilbert Doctorow, thank you very
      much for joining us on the programme and for your insights.'
    one_sentence_summary: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has cautioned that
      NATO's decision to increase defense spending could lead to the alliance's collapse,
      while Russia plans to reduce its military budget despite currently high defense
      expenditures.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent statement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
      cautioned that NATO's decision to increase defense spending to five percent of
      GDP over the next decade could lead to the alliance's downfall, urging NATO to
      prioritize common sense over escalating military expenditures. This shift in NATO's
      spending, influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's demands for greater burden
      sharing, has raised concerns about an arms race, as highlighted by Polish Foreign
      Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. Despite Russia's current military budget being the
      highest since the Cold War at 6.3 percent of GDP, Lavrov asserted that Russia
      plans to reduce military spending next year, while maintaining that it poses no
      threat to NATO members. Russian affairs expert Gilbert Doctorow explained that
      Russia's high military spending is a response to its ongoing conflict, suggesting
      that such expenditures are justified in the context of national survival.
