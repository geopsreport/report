summary: |
  The global geopolitical landscape continues to be shaped by the interplay between economic sovereignty, shifting alliances, and the persistence of rentier interests. As the U.S.-led order faces mounting challenges from emerging blocs and internal contradictions, analysts are highlighting both structural and immediate developments that could determine the trajectory of international relations in the coming months.
  
  **Economic Sovereignty and the Persistence of Rentierism**
  
  A central theme in recent analysis is the struggle for economic sovereignty, particularly among Global Majority nations. **Michael Hudson** emphasizes that while industrial capitalism historically sought to dismantle feudal rentier structures, the 20th and 21st centuries have seen a resurgence of land and resource rents benefiting private interests rather than national development. This dynamic, he argues, continues to hinder the competitiveness and autonomy of developing economies. Hudson notes, “Contemporary Global Majority countries continue to struggle against foreign debt and rent extraction by Western powers, necessitating reforms to reclaim their economic sovereignty through taxing land and resource rents, akin to the historical paths taken by industrialized nations.”
  
  **Dollar Hegemony and the Shift Toward Fair Trade**
  
  The debate over the future of the dollar-dominated global order has intensified. In a recent discussion with **Glenn Diesen**, Hudson asserts that the post-war economic framework is now “obsolete” and increasingly fails to serve U.S. interests. There is a growing consensus that the world is moving from a paradigm of “free trade” to one of “fair trade,” as countries seek to protect their economies from external shocks and exploitative arrangements. This is particularly relevant for the BRICS alliance, which is actively exploring alternatives to dollar hegemony and U.S.-imposed tariffs.
  
  **Middle East: Ceasefire Fragility and U.S. Influence**
  
  On the geopolitical front, the Middle East remains a flashpoint. The recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel is widely viewed as temporary. **Michael Hudson** predicts that hostilities are likely to resume, especially as U.S. involvement and electoral politics continue to drive instability. He states, “The recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel is temporary and that hostilities will resume, particularly influenced by U.S. involvement and upcoming elections.” This assessment is echoed by other analysts who see the region as a key battleground in the broader contest for global influence.
  
  **Trends and Predictions**
  
  Looking ahead, the majority of sources agree that the erosion of U.S. economic and strategic dominance is accelerating. There is high confidence that BRICS and other Global Majority nations will intensify efforts to reclaim economic sovereignty, likely through reforms targeting rentier structures and the development of alternative financial systems. The shift from free trade to fair trade is “quite likely” to define the next phase of global economic relations. In the Middle East, the fragile ceasefire is expected to break down, with renewed conflict “most definitely” on the horizon as external actors continue to shape local dynamics.
  
  In summary, the world is entering a period of heightened contestation over economic models and geopolitical alignments, with the outcomes dependent on both structural reforms and the resolution—or escalation—of regional conflicts.

  - title: A Precondition for Economic Sovereignty
    url: https://michael-hudson.com/2025/07/a-precondition-for-economic-sovereignty/
    text: 'An excerpt from Michael’s upcoming book on Medieval debt crusades. Industrial
      capitalism was revolutionary in its fight to free Europe’s economies and parliaments
      from the hereditary privileges and vested interests that survived from feudalism.
      To make their manufactures competitive in world markets, industrialists needed
      to end the land rent paid to Europe’s landed aristocracies, the economic rents
      extracted by trade monopolies, and interest paid to bankers who played no role
      in financing industry. These rentier incomes add to the economy’s price structure,
      raising the living wage and other business expenses, thus eating into profits.
      The 20 th century saw the classical aim of clearing away these economic rents
      rolled back in Europe, the United States, and other Western countries. However,
      today, land and natural-resource rents in private hands are still rising and even
      receiving special tax advantages. Basic infrastructure and other natural monopolies
      are being privatized by the financial sector — which is largely responsible for
      carving up and de-industrializing economies on behalf of its real estate and monopoly
      customers, who pay out most of their rental income as interest to bankers and
      bondholders. What has survived from the policies by which Europe’s industrial
      powers and the United States built up their own manufacturing is free trade. Britain
      implemented free trade after a 30-year fight on behalf of its industry against
      the landed aristocracy, aimed at ending the protectionist agricultural tariffs,
      the Corn Laws, which had been enacted in 1815 to prevent opening the home market
      to low-priced food imports, which would have reduced farming rents. After repealing
      these laws in 1846 to lower the cost of living, Britain offered free-trade agreements
      to countries seeking access to its market in exchange for these countries not
      protecting their industry against British exports. The aim was to deter less industrialized
      countries from working up their own raw materials. In such countries, Europe’s
      foreign investors sought to buy rent-yielding natural resources headed by mineral
      and land rights, and basic infrastructure headed by railroads and canals. This
      created a diametric contrast between rent-avoidance in the industrial nations
      and rent-seeking in their colonies and other host countries, while European bankers
      used debt leverage to gain fiscal control of former colonies who had won independence
      in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Under pressure to pay the foreign debts that
      were run up to finance their trade deficits, development attempts, and deepening
      debt dependency, debtor countries were obliged to relinquish fiscal control of
      their economies to bondholders, banks, and creditor-nation governments, which
      pressed them to privatize their basic infrastructure monopolies. The effect was
      to prevent them from using revenue from their natural endowments to develop a
      broad economic base for prosperous development. Just as Britain, France, and Germany
      aimed to free their economies from feudalism’s legacy of the vested interests
      with rent extraction privileges, most of today’s Global Majority countries need
      to free themselves from the rent and debt overhead inherited from European colonialism
      and creditor control. By the 1950s these countries were being called “less developed”
      or, even more patronizingly, “developing.” But the combination of foreign debt
      and free trade has blocked them from developing along the balanced public/private
      lines that Western Europe and the United States followed. The tax policy and other
      legislation of these countries has been shaped by U.S. and European pressure to
      observe international trade and investment rules that perpetuate geopolitical
      domination by Western bankers and rent-extracting investors to control their national
      patrimony. The euphemism “host economy” is appropriate for these countries, because
      the Western economic penetration of them resembles a biological parasite feeding
      off its host. Seeking to maintain this relationship, the U.S. and European governments
      are blocking attempts by these countries to follow the path that Europe’s industrial
      nations and the United States took for their own economies with their 19 th -century
      political and fiscal reforms that empowered their own takeoff. Without these countries
      adopting fiscal and political reforms aimed at developing their own sovereignty
      and prospects for growth on the basis of their own national patrimony of land,
      natural resources and basic infrastructure, the world economy will remain bifurcated
      between Western rentier nations and their Global Majority hosts and held subject
      to neoliberal orthodoxy. The success of China’s model poses a threat to the neoliberal
      order When U.S. political leaders single out China as an existential enemy of
      the West, it is not as a military threat but for offering a successful economic
      alternative to today’s U.S.-sponsored neoliberal world order. That order was supposed
      to represent the End of History, succeeding through its logic of free trade, government
      deregulation, and international investment free of capital controls, while detouring
      away from industrial capitalism’s anti- rentier policies. We can now see the absurdity
      in this self-satisfying evangelical view that had emerged just as Western economies
      were deindustrializing, as a result of the dynamics of their neoliberal finance
      capitalism. The vested financial and other rentier interests are rejecting not
      only China but the logic of industrial capitalism as described by its own 19 th
      -century classical economists. Western neoliberal observers have closed their
      eyes to recognizing the ways in which China’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics”
      has achieved its success by a logic similar to that of the industrial capitalism
      advocated by classical economists to minimize rentier income. Most late 19 th
      -century economic writers expected industrial capitalism to evolve into socialism
      of one form or another, as the role of public investment and regulation increased.
      Freeing economies and their governments from control by landowners and creditors
      was the common denominator of the social-democratic socialism of John Stuart Mill,
      the libertarian socialism of Henry George focusing on the land tax, and the cooperative
      mutual-aid socialism of Peter Kropotkin, as well as Marxism. Where China has gone
      further than earlier socialist mixed-economy reforms has been in keeping money
      and credit creation in the hands of government, along with basic infrastructure
      and natural resources. Fear that other governments might follow China’s lead has
      led U.S. and other Western finance-capitalist ideologues to view China as a threat
      by providing a model for economic reforms that are precisely the opposite of what
      the 20 th century’s pro- rentier , anti-government ideology fought against. The
      foreign debt overhead owed to U.S. and other Western creditors, and enabled by
      the 1945-2025 international geopolitical rules designed by U.S. diplomats at Bretton
      Woods in 1944, obliges the Global South and other countries to recover their economic
      sovereignty by freeing themselves from their foreign (mainly dollarized) banking
      and financial burden. These countries have the same land-rent problem that Europe’s
      industrial capitalism faced, but their land and resource rents are mainly owned
      by multinational companies and other foreign appropriators of their oil and mineral
      rights, forests, and latifundia plantations, who extract resource rents by emptying
      out the world’s oil and mineral resources and cutting down its forests. Taxing
      economic rent is a precondition for economic sovereignty A precondition for Global
      South countries to gain economic autonomy is to follow the advice of the classical
      economists and tax the largest sources of rental income – land rent, monopoly
      rent, and financial returns – instead of letting them be sent abroad. Taxing these
      rents would help stabilize their balance of payments, while providing their governments
      with revenue to finance their infrastructure needs and the related social spending
      needed to subsidize their economic modernization. That is how Britain, France,
      Germany and the United States established their own industrial, agricultural,
      and financial supremacy. This is not a radical socialist policy; it always has
      been a central element of industrial capitalist development. Recapturing a country’s
      land and natural-resource rents as its fiscal base would enable it to avoid taxing
      labor and industry. A country would not need to formally nationalize its land
      and natural resources outright; it simply needs to tax the economic rent over
      and above actual “earned profits,” to cite the principle of Adam Smith and his
      19 th -century successors that this rent is the natural tax base. But neoliberal
      ideology calls such taxation of rent, and the regulation of monopolies or other
      market phenomena, an intrusive interference into the “free market.” This defense
      of rentier income inverts the classical definition of a free market. The classical
      economists defined a free market as one free from economic rent, not as one free
      for the extraction of economic rent, let alone as freedom for creditor-nation
      governments to create a “rules-based order” to facilitate foreign rent extraction
      and stifle the development of financially and trade-dependent host countries.
      Debt remission is a precondition for economic sovereignty The fight by countries
      to free themselves from their foreign debt overhead is much harder than Europe’s
      19 th -century fight to end the privileges of its landed aristocracy (and less
      successfully, of its bankers), because it is international in scope, and is now
      confronted by a creditor-nation alliance to maintain the system of financial colonization
      created two centuries ago, as former colonies sought to finance their independence
      by borrowing from foreign bankers. Starting in the 1820s, newly independent countries
      like Haiti, Mexico, and other Latin America nations, as well as Greece, Tunisia,
      Egypt, and other former Ottoman colonies, won nominal political freedom from colonialist
      control. But to build up their own industry they had to take on foreign debt –
      on which they almost immediately defaulted, which enabled their creditors to establish
      monetary authorities in charge of their fiscal policy. The governments of these
      countries were turned into collection agents for international bankers by the
      late 19 th century. Financial dependency on bankers and bondholders replaced colonial
      dependency, obliging debtor countries to give fiscal priority to foreign creditors.
      World War II enabled many of these countries to accumulate substantial foreign
      monetary reserves as a result of supplying raw materials to the belligerents.
      But the post-war order designed by U.S. diplomats, based on free trade and free
      capital movements, drained these savings, and obliged the Global South and other
      countries to borrow to cover their trade deficits. The resulting foreign debts
      soon came to exceed the ability of these countries to pay – that is, to pay without
      surrendering to the destructive IMF demands for austerity that blocked the investment
      needed to raise their productivity and living standards. There was no way that
      they could meet their own development needs to invest in basic infrastructure
      and provide industrial and agricultural subsidies, public education, health care,
      and other basic social spending that is characterized by the leading industrial
      nations. This still remains the case. Their choice today, therefore, is between
      paying their foreign debts – at the cost of blocking their own development – or
      claiming that these debts are odious and insisting that they be written off. At
      issue is whether debtor countries will gain the sovereignty that is supposed to
      characterize an international economy of equals, free of foreign post-colonial
      control over their tax and trade policies, as well as their national patrimony.
      Their self-determination can only be achieved by joining together in a collective
      front. Donald Trump’s tariff aggression has catalyzed this process by drastically
      reducing the U.S. market for exports from debtor countries, preventing them from
      obtaining the dollars to pay their bonds and bank debts, so these won’t be paid
      in any event. The world is now busy de-dollarizing. The need to create an alternative
      to the U.S.-centered post-war order was expressed in 1955 at the Bandung Conference
      in Indonesia, and then later by the Non-Aligned Movement. But these countries
      lacked a critical mass of self-sufficiency among themselves to act together. Attempts
      to create a New International Economic Order in the 1960s faced the same problem.
      Countries were not industrially, agriculturally, or financially strong enough
      to “go it alone.” Today’s Western debt crisis, de-industrialization, and coercive
      weaponization of foreign trade and financial sanctions under the dollarized international
      financial system, capped by the “America First” tariff policy, have created an
      urgent need for countries to collectively seek economic sovereignty, to become
      independent from U.S. and European control of the international economy. The collective
      BRICS+, with Russia and China taking the lead, have just begun talking about making
      such an attempt. China’s success has made a global alternative attainable The
      great catalyst for countries to take control of their national development has
      been China. As indicated above, its industrial socialism has largely achieved
      the classical aim of industrial capitalism of minimizing rentier overhead, above
      all by publicly creating money to finance tangible growth. Keeping money and credit
      creation in government hands, via China’s state-owned banks, prevents financial
      and other rentier interests from taking over the economy and subjecting it to
      the financial overhead that has characterized Western economies. China’s successful
      alternative for allocating credit avoids making purely financial gains at the
      expense of tangible capital formation and living standards. That is why it is
      viewed as an existential threat to the current Western banking model. Western
      financial systems are overseen by central banks that have been made independent
      from the Treasury and government regulatory “interference.” Their role is to provide
      the commercial banking system’s liquidity as it creates interest-bearing debt,
      mainly for the purpose of making wealth financially by debt leveraging (asset-price
      inflation), not for productive capital formation. Capital gains – rising prices
      for housing and other real estate, stocks, and bonds – are much larger than GDP
      growth. They can be made easily and quickly by banks creating more credit to bid
      up prices for buyers of these assets. Instead of the financial system being industrialized,
      Western industrial corporations have become financialized, and that has occurred
      along lines that have deindustrialized the U.S. and European economies. Financialized
      wealth can be made without being part of the production process. Interest, late
      charges, other financial fees and capital gains are not a “product,” yet are counted
      as such in today’s GDP statistics. Carrying charges on the rising debt overhead
      are transfer payments to the finance sector, by labor and businesses, out of wages
      and profits earned by actual production. That shrinks the income available for
      spending on the products produced by labor and capital, leaving economies debt-ridden
      and deindustrialized. The strategy of creditor-rentier nations to prevent withdrawal
      from their global control The broadest strategy to block countries from avoiding
      the rentier burden has been to wage an ideological campaign from the educational
      system to mass media. The aim is to control the narrative in a way that depicts
      government as an oppressive Leviathan, an inherently bureaucratic autocracy. Western
      “democracy” is defined not so much politically as economically, as a free market
      whose resources are allocated by a banking and financial sector independent of
      regulatory oversight. Governments strong enough to limit financial and other rentier
      wealth in the public interest are demonized as autocracies or “planned economics”
      — as if shifting credit and resource allocation to the financial centers of Wall
      Street, London, Paris, and Japan does not result in an economy planned by the
      financial sector in its own interest, with the aim of creating monetary fortunes.
      Its aim is not to improve the overall economy and living standards. Global Majority
      officials and administrators who have studied economics at U.S. and European universities
      have been indoctrinated with a value-free (that is, rent-free) pro- rentier ideology
      to frame the way they think about how economies work. This narrative excludes
      consideration of how debt polarizes economies by growing exponentially at compound
      interest. Also excluded from mainstream economic logic is the classical contrast
      between productive and unproductive credit and investment, and the related distinction
      between earned income (wages and profits, the main components of value) and unearned
      income (economic rent). Beyond this ideological campaign, neoliberal diplomacy
      uses military force, regime change, and control of the main international bureaucracies
      associated with the United Nations, the IMF, and World Bank — and a more covert
      network of non-government organizations (NGOs) — to prevent countries from withdrawing
      from today’s pro- rentier fiscal rules and pro-creditor laws. The United States
      has taken the lead in using force and regime change against governments that would
      tax away or otherwise limit rent extraction. It should be noted that few early
      socialists (except anarchists) advocated violence in pursuit of their reforms.
      It has been the vested interests, unwilling to accept loss of the privileges that
      are the basis of their fortunes, who have not hesitated to use violence to defend
      their wealth and power against attempts at reform to check their privileges. To
      be sovereign, nations must create an alternative that enables them to be in charge
      of their own economic, monetary, and political development. But American diplomacy
      views any attempt to enact the necessary political and tax reforms and strong
      government regulatory authority as posing an existential threat to U.S. control
      over international finance and trade. This raises the question of whether it is
      possible to achieve reforms and a strong public economy without war. It is natural
      for countries to wonder whether they can achieve economic sovereignty without
      a revolution, such as the Soviet Union, China, and other countries that fought
      to end their domination by their foreign-supported landlords and creditors. The
      only way to protect economic sovereignty against military threats is to join an
      alliance for mutual support, since individual countries can be isolated in the
      way that Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran have been — or destroyed, like Libya. As Benjamin
      Franklin put matters, “If we don’t hang together, we will hang separately.” American
      writers characterize the attempt of other countries to join together to achieve
      economic sovereignty as a civilizational war. While this is indeed a civilizational
      contest, it is the United States and its allies that are waging aggression, against
      countries trying to withdraw from a system that has provided the United States
      and Europe with a huge inflow of economic rents and debt service from host countries
      subject to U.S.-backed diplomacy. How U.S.-centered financial colonialism replaced
      European colonial occupation After World War II, the era of settler-state colonialism
      gave way to financial colonialism, with the international economy dollarized under
      U.S. leadership. The Bretton Woods rules established by 1945 enabled multinational
      corporations to keep economic rents for land, natural resources and public infrastructure
      out of domestic fiscal reach. Governments were reduced to the role of acting as
      collection agents for foreign creditors and as protectors of foreign investors
      from democratic attempts to tax rentier wealth. The United States was able to
      weaponize world trade by monopolizing oil exports through U.S. and allied oil
      companies (the Seven Sisters), while U.S. and European agricultural protectionism
      and World Bank “aid” policy steered food-deficit countries to focus on tropical
      plantation crops instead of grain to feed themselves. President Bill Clinton’s
      1994 NAFTA free-trade agreement swamped Mexico’s market with low-priced U.S. farm
      exports (highly subsidized by strong government support). Mexican grain production
      plummeted, leaving it food-dependent. To block governments from taxing or even
      fining foreign investors to recover compensation for damages to their countries,
      today’s rentier powers have created Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) courts
      requiring governments to compensate foreign investors for increasing taxes or
      imposing regulations that reduce foreign-owned income. (I provide the details
      of this in Chapter 7 of my 2022 book The Destiny of Civilization .) This system
      blocks national sovereignty, including by preventing host countries from taxing
      the economic rent of their land and natural resources owned by foreigners. The
      effect is to make these resources part of the investor-nation economy, not their
      own. (The Saudi oil company Aramco, for instance, was not a corporately distinct
      corporate affiliate but a branch of Standard Oil of New York (ESSO). This legal
      nicety meant that its income and expenses were consolidated into the parent company’s
      U.S. balance sheet. That enabled it to receive a tax credit for the “depletion
      allowance” for oil, rendering the company effectively free of U.S. income tax,
      although it was Saudi oil that was being depleted.) Other nations permitted the
      United States to dictate the post-World War II order, with it promising generous
      aid to support free trade, peace, and post-colonial national sovereignty, as spelled
      out in the United Nations Charter. But the United States squandered its wealth
      on military spending abroad and financial wealth addiction at home. That has left
      America’s post-industrial power based mainly on its ability to harm other countries
      with chaos if they do not accept the U.S. “rules-based order” designed to extract
      tribute from them. The U.S. imposes protectionist tariffs and import quotas at
      will, and subsidizes agriculture and key technologies as potential global high-tech
      monopolies, while forbidding other countries from implementing such “socialist”
      or “autocratic” policies to become more competitive. The result is a double standard
      in which the U.S. “rules-based order” (its own rules) replaces adherence to international
      law. U.S. agricultural price support policy initiated under Franklin D. Roosevelt
      in the 1930s provides a good example of double standards. It made farming the
      most heavily subsidized and protected sector. It became the model for the European
      Economic Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced in 1962. However,
      U.S. diplomacy opposes the attempts of other countries, especially Global South
      countries, to impose their own protectionist subsidies and import quotas aimed
      at achieving self-sufficiency in basic food production — while U.S. “aid lending”
      and the World Bank have (as indicated above) supported the exportation of tropical
      plantation crops by Global South countries by lending for transportation and port
      development. U.S. policy has consistently opposed family-owned farming and land
      reform throughout Latin America and other Global South countries, often with violence.
      Moves toward a multipolar world order It is not surprising that, inasmuch as Russia
      has long been the United States’ main military adversary, it has taken the lead
      in protesting against the unipolar U.S. order. Advocating a multipolar alternative
      to the U.S. neoliberal order in June 2025, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
      described the post-colonial economic subjugation of the countries that achieved
      political independence from colonialist rule in the 19 th and 20 th centuries
      but which are now facing the next task needed to complete their liberation: Our
      African friends are paying more and more attention to the fact that their entire
      economies are still largely based on siphoning off natural resources from these
      countries. In fact, all value added is produced and pocketed by the former Western
      metropoles and other European Union and NATO members. … The West is using illegal
      unilateral sanctions, which increasingly become the harbinger of a military attack,
      as this has happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and is now happening in Iran,
      as well as the instruments of unfair competition, initiating tariff wars, seizing
      other countries’ sovereign assets and taking advantage of the role of their currencies
      and payment systems. The West itself has actually buried the globalization model,
      which it developed after the Cold War to promote its interests. Marco Rubio made
      the same point in the U.S. Senate hearings to confirm him as Donald Trump’s Secretary
      of State, explaining that the “postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is
      now a weapon being used against us.” Violating the rules of foreign trade and
      investment that the United States itself dictated in 1945, and yet another instance
      of Washington resorting to the “rules-based order” of its own rules, President
      Trump’s unilateral tariffs aimed both at shifting the New Cold War’s military
      costs onto other countries, which are expected to buy American arms and provide
      proxy armies, and at reviving the U.S.’s lost industrial power by forcing countries
      to relocate industries to the United States and to permit U.S. companies to extract
      monopoly rents by controlling the leading emerging technologies. The United States
      aims to impose monopoly rights and related rentier privileges uniquely favorable
      to itself on the entire world’s trade and investment. Trump’s “America First”
      diplomacy demands that other countries conduct their trade, payments and debt
      relationships in U.S. dollars, instead of their own currencies. The U.S. “rule
      of law” is one that permits unilateral U.S. demands to impose trade and financial
      sanctions dictating how and with whom foreign countries can trade and invest.
      They are threatened with economic chaos and confiscation of their dollar reserves
      if they do not boycott trade and investment relations with Russia, China, and
      other countries refusing to submit to U.S. control. The United States’ leverage
      to obtain these foreign concessions is no longer industrial leadership and financial
      strength, but its ability to cause chaos for other countries. Claiming to be the
      indispensable nation, the U.S.’s ability to disrupt trade is ending its former
      international monetary and diplomatic power. That power originally was based on
      U.S. holdings of the world’s largest monetary gold reserves in 1945, its status
      as the largest creditor nation and industrial economy, and, after 1971, its dollar
      hegemony, arising in large part as a result of its financial market being the
      safest for other nations to hold their official monetary reserves. The diplomatic
      inertia created by these former advantages no longer reflects the realities of
      2025. What U.S. officials do have is the ability to disrupt the world’s trade,
      supply chains, and financial arrangements, including the SWIFT system for international
      payments. The U.S. and European confiscation of $300 billion of Russia’s monetary
      deposits has darkened America’s reputation for financial safety, while its chronic
      trade and balance-of-payments deficits threaten to disrupt the international monetary
      system and free trade that made it the major beneficiary of the 1945-2025 world
      order. In keeping with the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference
      in other countries’ internal affairs that underlay the creation of the United
      Nations (the basic principle of international law grounded in the 1648 Peace of
      Westphalia), Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov described (in his speech cited above)
      the need “to establish foreign trade mechanisms [that] the West will be unable
      to control, such as transport corridors, alternative payment systems and supply
      chains.” As an example of how the United States had paralyzed the World Trade
      Organization, which it had created on the basis of free trade at a time when America
      was the world’s leading export power, he explained: When the Americans realized
      that the globalized system they had created – one built on fair competition, inviolable
      property rights, the presumption of innocence, and similar principles, and which
      had allowed them to dominate for decades – had also begun benefiting their rivals,
      primarily China, they took drastic action. As China started outplaying them on
      their own turf and by their own rules, Washington simply blocked the WTO’s Appellate
      Body. By artificially stripping it of a quorum, they rendered this key dispute
      settlement mechanism inactive – and it remains so to this day. The United States
      has been able to block foreign opposition to its nationalist policies by having
      veto power in the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank. Even without such power,
      U.S. diplomats have been able to block United Nations organizations from acting
      independently of U.S. wishes by refusing to appoint leaders or judges not primarily
      loyal to U.S. foreign policy. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), charged
      with keeping nuclear proliferation in check is the most recent notorious case
      in point. Iran published documents showing that the agency’s leader Rafael Grossi
      provided U.S. and Israeli intelligence with the names of Iranian scientists who
      were killed, and details of the Iranian nuclear refinement sites that were bombed.
      The U.S. veto has prevented the UN Security Council from condemning Israeli attacks
      on the Palestinian population. And when the International Criminal Court (ICC)
      brought charges against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for committing
      war crimes and crimes against humanity in a genocide against the Palestinians,
      U.S. officials imposed sanctions on the ICC and demanded the removal of the prosecutor.
      The world no longer is to be governed by international law, but by unilateral
      U.S. rules, subject to abrupt change depending on the vicissitudes of American
      economic or military power (or loss thereof). As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin
      described this new state of affairs in 2022, “Western countries have been saying
      for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations,” yet the
      “unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and unfree; it is false and hypocritical
      through and through.” The United States’ self-image depicts its long dominant
      world position as reflecting its democracy, free market, and equality of opportunity
      that has enabled its power elite, in their view, to acquire their status by being
      the economy’s most productive members, through their management and allocation
      of savings and credit. The reality is that the United States has become a rentier
      oligarchy, one that is increasingly hereditary. Its members’ fortunes are made
      mainly by acquiring rent-yielding assets (land, natural resources, and monopolies)
      on which they make capital gains, while paying most of their rent as interest
      to their bankers, who end up with much of these rents and have become the new
      oligarchy’s leading managerial class. Summary The real conflict over what kind
      of economic and political system the Global Majority will have is just gaining
      momentum. Global South countries and others have been driven so deeply into debt
      that they have been obliged to sell off their public infrastructure to pay its
      carrying charges. Recovering control of their natural resources and basic infrastructure
      requires the fiscal right to impose an economic-rent tax on their land, natural
      resources and monopolies, as well as the legal right to recover environmental
      cleanup costs caused by foreign oil and mining firms, and to implement financial
      cleanup costs ( i.e ., write offs and cancellation) of the foreign debt burden
      imposed by creditors who have not taken responsibility to ensure that their loans
      can be paid under existing conditions. U.S. evangelistic rhetoric describes the
      imminent political and economic fracture of the world economy as a “Clash of Civilizations”
      between democracies (i.e., countries that support U.S. policy) and autocracies
      (i.e., nations acting independently). It would be more accurate to describe this
      fracture as a fight by the United States and its European and other Western allies
      against civilization — assuming civilization entails, as it seems it must, the
      sovereign right of countries to enact their own laws and tax systems for the benefit
      of their own populations within an international system that has a common set
      of basic rules and values. What Western ideologues call democracy and free markets
      has turned out to be an aggressive rentier -financial imperialism. And what they
      call autocracy is a government strong enough to prevent economic polarization
      between a super-rich rentier class and an impoverished population at large, such
      as is occurring within the Western oligarchies themselves. Photo by itsiken on

      aimed to dismantle feudal economic structures by eliminating rentier incomes that
      hindered competitiveness, but notes that in the 20th century, efforts to address
      these issues have regressed, with rising land and resource rents still benefiting
      private interests.
    paragraph_summary: In an excerpt from Michael's forthcoming book on Medieval debt
      crusades, he discusses the transformative impact of industrial capitalism in liberating
      European economies from the remnants of feudalism, particularly the burdens of
      land rent, trade monopolies, and unproductive banking interests. He argues that
      these economic rents inflate prices, thereby diminishing profits and raising living
      costs. Despite the progress made in the 20th century to eliminate these rents,
      they continue to rise today, often benefiting from tax advantages while basic
      infrastructure is increasingly privatized by the financial sector. Michael highlights
      Britain's historical struggle against the landed aristocracy, culminating in the
      repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, which facilitated free trade and aimed to lower
      living costs while discouraging less industrialized nations from developing their
      own industries.

    text: 'An excerpt from Michael’s upcoming book on Medieval debt crusades. Industrial
      capitalism was revolutionary in its fight to free Europe’s economies and parliaments
      from the hereditary privileges and vested interests that survived from feudalism.
      To make their manufactures competitive in world markets, industrialists needed
      to end the land rent paid to Europe’s landed aristocracies, the economic rents
      extracted by trade monopolies, and interest paid to bankers who played no role
      in financing industry. These rentier incomes add to the economy’s price structure,
      raising the living wage and other business expenses, thus eating into profits.
      The 20 th century saw the classical aim of clearing away these economic rents
      rolled back in Europe, the United States, and other Western countries. However,
      today, land and natural-resource rents in private hands are still rising and even
      receiving special tax advantages. Basic infrastructure and other natural monopolies
      are being privatized by the financial sector — which is largely responsible for
      carving up and de-industrializing economies on behalf of its real estate and monopoly
      customers, who pay out most of their rental income as interest to bankers and
      bondholders. What has survived from the policies by which Europe’s industrial
      powers and the United States built up their own manufacturing is free trade. Britain
      implemented free trade after a 30-year fight on behalf of its industry against
      the landed aristocracy, aimed at ending the protectionist agricultural tariffs,
      the Corn Laws, which had been enacted in 1815 to prevent opening the home market
      to low-priced food imports, which would have reduced farming rents. After repealing
      these laws in 1846 to lower the cost of living, Britain offered free-trade agreements
      to countries seeking access to its market in exchange for these countries not
      protecting their industry against British exports. The aim was to deter less industrialized
      countries from working up their own raw materials. In such countries, Europe’s
      foreign investors sought to buy rent-yielding natural resources headed by mineral
      and land rights, and basic infrastructure headed by railroads and canals. This
      created a diametric contrast between rent-avoidance in the industrial nations
      and rent-seeking in their colonies and other host countries, while European bankers
      used debt leverage to gain fiscal control of former colonies who had won independence
      in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Under pressure to pay the foreign debts that
      were run up to finance their trade deficits, development attempts, and deepening
      debt dependency, debtor countries were obliged to relinquish fiscal control of
      their economies to bondholders, banks, and creditor-nation governments, which
      pressed them to privatize their basic infrastructure monopolies. The effect was
      to prevent them from using revenue from their natural endowments to develop a
      broad economic base for prosperous development. Just as Britain, France, and Germany
      aimed to free their economies from feudalism’s legacy of the vested interests
      with rent extraction privileges, most of today’s Global Majority countries need
      to free themselves from the rent and debt overhead inherited from European colonialism
      and creditor control. By the 1950s these countries were being called “less developed”
      or, even more patronizingly, “developing.” But the combination of foreign debt
      and free trade has blocked them from developing along the balanced public/private
      lines that Western Europe and the United States followed. The tax policy and other
      legislation of these countries has been shaped by U.S. and European pressure to
      observe international trade and investment rules that perpetuate geopolitical
      domination by Western bankers and rent-extracting investors to control their national
      patrimony. The euphemism “host economy” is appropriate for these countries, because
      the Western economic penetration of them resembles a biological parasite feeding
      off its host. Seeking to maintain this relationship, the U.S. and European governments
      are blocking attempts by these countries to follow the path that Europe’s industrial
      nations and the United States took for their own economies with their 19 th -century
      political and fiscal reforms that empowered their own takeoff. Without these countries
      adopting fiscal and political reforms aimed at developing their own sovereignty
      and prospects for growth on the basis of their own national patrimony of land,
      natural resources and basic infrastructure, the world economy will remain bifurcated
      between Western rentier nations and their Global Majority hosts and held subject
      to neoliberal orthodoxy. The success of China’s model poses a threat to the neoliberal
      order When U.S. political leaders single out China as an existential enemy of
      the West, it is not as a military threat but for offering a successful economic
      alternative to today’s U.S.-sponsored neoliberal world order. That order was supposed
      to represent the End of History, succeeding through its logic of free trade, government
      deregulation, and international investment free of capital controls, while detouring
      away from industrial capitalism’s anti- rentier policies. We can now see the absurdity
      in this self-satisfying evangelical view that had emerged just as Western economies
      were deindustrializing, as a result of the dynamics of their neoliberal finance
      capitalism. The vested financial and other rentier interests are rejecting not
      only China but the logic of industrial capitalism as described by its own 19 th
      -century classical economists. Western neoliberal observers have closed their
      eyes to recognizing the ways in which China’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics”
      has achieved its success by a logic similar to that of the industrial capitalism
      advocated by classical economists to minimize rentier income. Most late 19 th
      -century economic writers expected industrial capitalism to evolve into socialism
      of one form or another, as the role of public investment and regulation increased.
      Freeing economies and their governments from control by landowners and creditors
      was the common denominator of the social-democratic socialism of John Stuart Mill,
      the libertarian socialism of Henry George focusing on the land tax, and the cooperative
      mutual-aid socialism of Peter Kropotkin, as well as Marxism. Where China has gone
      further than earlier socialist mixed-economy reforms has been in keeping money
      and credit creation in the hands of government, along with basic infrastructure
      and natural resources. Fear that other governments might follow China’s lead has
      led U.S. and other Western finance-capitalist ideologues to view China as a threat
      by providing a model for economic reforms that are precisely the opposite of what
      the 20 th century’s pro- rentier , anti-government ideology fought against. The
      foreign debt overhead owed to U.S. and other Western creditors, and enabled by
      the 1945-2025 international geopolitical rules designed by U.S. diplomats at Bretton
      Woods in 1944, obliges the Global South and other countries to recover their economic
      sovereignty by freeing themselves from their foreign (mainly dollarized) banking
      and financial burden. These countries have the same land-rent problem that Europe’s
      industrial capitalism faced, but their land and resource rents are mainly owned
      by multinational companies and other foreign appropriators of their oil and mineral
      rights, forests, and latifundia plantations, who extract resource rents by emptying
      out the world’s oil and mineral resources and cutting down its forests. Taxing
      economic rent is a precondition for economic sovereignty A precondition for Global
      South countries to gain economic autonomy is to follow the advice of the classical
      economists and tax the largest sources of rental income – land rent, monopoly
      rent, and financial returns – instead of letting them be sent abroad. Taxing these
      rents would help stabilize their balance of payments, while providing their governments
      with revenue to finance their infrastructure needs and the related social spending
      needed to subsidize their economic modernization. That is how Britain, France,
      Germany and the United States established their own industrial, agricultural,
      and financial supremacy. This is not a radical socialist policy; it always has
      been a central element of industrial capitalist development. Recapturing a country’s
      land and natural-resource rents as its fiscal base would enable it to avoid taxing
      labor and industry. A country would not need to formally nationalize its land
      and natural resources outright; it simply needs to tax the economic rent over
      and above actual “earned profits,” to cite the principle of Adam Smith and his
      19 th -century successors that this rent is the natural tax base. But neoliberal
      ideology calls such taxation of rent, and the regulation of monopolies or other
      market phenomena, an intrusive interference into the “free market.” This defense
      of rentier income inverts the classical definition of a free market. The classical
      economists defined a free market as one free from economic rent, not as one free
      for the extraction of economic rent, let alone as freedom for creditor-nation
      governments to create a “rules-based order” to facilitate foreign rent extraction
      and stifle the development of financially and trade-dependent host countries.
      Debt remission is a precondition for economic sovereignty The fight by countries
      to free themselves from their foreign debt overhead is much harder than Europe’s
      19 th -century fight to end the privileges of its landed aristocracy (and less
      successfully, of its bankers), because it is international in scope, and is now
      confronted by a creditor-nation alliance to maintain the system of financial colonization
      created two centuries ago, as former colonies sought to finance their independence
      by borrowing from foreign bankers. Starting in the 1820s, newly independent countries
      like Haiti, Mexico, and other Latin America nations, as well as Greece, Tunisia,
      Egypt, and other former Ottoman colonies, won nominal political freedom from colonialist
      control. But to build up their own industry they had to take on foreign debt –
      on which they almost immediately defaulted, which enabled their creditors to establish
      monetary authorities in charge of their fiscal policy. The governments of these
      countries were turned into collection agents for international bankers by the
      late 19 th century. Financial dependency on bankers and bondholders replaced colonial
      dependency, obliging debtor countries to give fiscal priority to foreign creditors.
      World War II enabled many of these countries to accumulate substantial foreign
      monetary reserves as a result of supplying raw materials to the belligerents.
      But the post-war order designed by U.S. diplomats, based on free trade and free
      capital movements, drained these savings, and obliged the Global South and other
      countries to borrow to cover their trade deficits. The resulting foreign debts
      soon came to exceed the ability of these countries to pay – that is, to pay without
      surrendering to the destructive IMF demands for austerity that blocked the investment
      needed to raise their productivity and living standards. There was no way that
      they could meet their own development needs to invest in basic infrastructure
      and provide industrial and agricultural subsidies, public education, health care,
      and other basic social spending that is characterized by the leading industrial
      nations. This still remains the case. Their choice today, therefore, is between
      paying their foreign debts – at the cost of blocking their own development – or
      claiming that these debts are odious and insisting that they be written off. At
      issue is whether debtor countries will gain the sovereignty that is supposed to
      characterize an international economy of equals, free of foreign post-colonial
      control over their tax and trade policies, as well as their national patrimony.
      Their self-determination can only be achieved by joining together in a collective
      front. Donald Trump’s tariff aggression has catalyzed this process by drastically
      reducing the U.S. market for exports from debtor countries, preventing them from
      obtaining the dollars to pay their bonds and bank debts, so these won’t be paid
      in any event. The world is now busy de-dollarizing. The need to create an alternative
      to the U.S.-centered post-war order was expressed in 1955 at the Bandung Conference
      in Indonesia, and then later by the Non-Aligned Movement. But these countries
      lacked a critical mass of self-sufficiency among themselves to act together. Attempts
      to create a New International Economic Order in the 1960s faced the same problem.
      Countries were not industrially, agriculturally, or financially strong enough
      to “go it alone.” Today’s Western debt crisis, de-industrialization, and coercive
      weaponization of foreign trade and financial sanctions under the dollarized international
      financial system, capped by the “America First” tariff policy, have created an
      urgent need for countries to collectively seek economic sovereignty, to become
      independent from U.S. and European control of the international economy. The collective
      BRICS+, with Russia and China taking the lead, have just begun talking about making
      such an attempt. China’s success has made a global alternative attainable The
      great catalyst for countries to take control of their national development has
      been China. As indicated above, its industrial socialism has largely achieved
      the classical aim of industrial capitalism of minimizing rentier overhead, above
      all by publicly creating money to finance tangible growth. Keeping money and credit
      creation in government hands, via China’s state-owned banks, prevents financial
      and other rentier interests from taking over the economy and subjecting it to
      the financial overhead that has characterized Western economies. China’s successful
      alternative for allocating credit avoids making purely financial gains at the
      expense of tangible capital formation and living standards. That is why it is
      viewed as an existential threat to the current Western banking model. Western
      financial systems are overseen by central banks that have been made independent
      from the Treasury and government regulatory “interference.” Their role is to provide
      the commercial banking system’s liquidity as it creates interest-bearing debt,
      mainly for the purpose of making wealth financially by debt leveraging (asset-price
      inflation), not for productive capital formation. Capital gains – rising prices
      for housing and other real estate, stocks, and bonds – are much larger than GDP
      growth. They can be made easily and quickly by banks creating more credit to bid
      up prices for buyers of these assets. Instead of the financial system being industrialized,
      Western industrial corporations have become financialized, and that has occurred
      along lines that have deindustrialized the U.S. and European economies. Financialized
      wealth can be made without being part of the production process. Interest, late
      charges, other financial fees and capital gains are not a “product,” yet are counted
      as such in today’s GDP statistics. Carrying charges on the rising debt overhead
      are transfer payments to the finance sector, by labor and businesses, out of wages
      and profits earned by actual production. That shrinks the income available for
      spending on the products produced by labor and capital, leaving economies debt-ridden
      and deindustrialized. The strategy of creditor-rentier nations to prevent withdrawal
      from their global control The broadest strategy to block countries from avoiding
      the rentier burden has been to wage an ideological campaign from the educational
      system to mass media. The aim is to control the narrative in a way that depicts
      government as an oppressive Leviathan, an inherently bureaucratic autocracy. Western
      “democracy” is defined not so much politically as economically, as a free market
      whose resources are allocated by a banking and financial sector independent of
      regulatory oversight. Governments strong enough to limit financial and other rentier
      wealth in the public interest are demonized as autocracies or “planned economics”
      — as if shifting credit and resource allocation to the financial centers of Wall
      Street, London, Paris, and Japan does not result in an economy planned by the
      financial sector in its own interest, with the aim of creating monetary fortunes.
      Its aim is not to improve the overall economy and living standards. Global Majority
      officials and administrators who have studied economics at U.S. and European universities
      have been indoctrinated with a value-free (that is, rent-free) pro- rentier ideology
      to frame the way they think about how economies work. This narrative excludes
      consideration of how debt polarizes economies by growing exponentially at compound
      interest. Also excluded from mainstream economic logic is the classical contrast
      between productive and unproductive credit and investment, and the related distinction
      between earned income (wages and profits, the main components of value) and unearned
      income (economic rent). Beyond this ideological campaign, neoliberal diplomacy
      uses military force, regime change, and control of the main international bureaucracies
      associated with the United Nations, the IMF, and World Bank — and a more covert
      network of non-government organizations (NGOs) — to prevent countries from withdrawing
      from today’s pro- rentier fiscal rules and pro-creditor laws. The United States
      has taken the lead in using force and regime change against governments that would
      tax away or otherwise limit rent extraction. It should be noted that few early
      socialists (except anarchists) advocated violence in pursuit of their reforms.
      It has been the vested interests, unwilling to accept loss of the privileges that
      are the basis of their fortunes, who have not hesitated to use violence to defend
      their wealth and power against attempts at reform to check their privileges. To
      be sovereign, nations must create an alternative that enables them to be in charge
      of their own economic, monetary, and political development. But American diplomacy
      views any attempt to enact the necessary political and tax reforms and strong
      government regulatory authority as posing an existential threat to U.S. control
      over international finance and trade. This raises the question of whether it is
      possible to achieve reforms and a strong public economy without war. It is natural
      for countries to wonder whether they can achieve economic sovereignty without
      a revolution, such as the Soviet Union, China, and other countries that fought
      to end their domination by their foreign-supported landlords and creditors. The
      only way to protect economic sovereignty against military threats is to join an
      alliance for mutual support, since individual countries can be isolated in the
      way that Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran have been — or destroyed, like Libya. As Benjamin
      Franklin put matters, “If we don’t hang together, we will hang separately.” American
      writers characterize the attempt of other countries to join together to achieve
      economic sovereignty as a civilizational war. While this is indeed a civilizational
      contest, it is the United States and its allies that are waging aggression, against
      countries trying to withdraw from a system that has provided the United States
      and Europe with a huge inflow of economic rents and debt service from host countries
      subject to U.S.-backed diplomacy. How U.S.-centered financial colonialism replaced
      European colonial occupation After World War II, the era of settler-state colonialism
      gave way to financial colonialism, with the international economy dollarized under
      U.S. leadership. The Bretton Woods rules established by 1945 enabled multinational
      corporations to keep economic rents for land, natural resources and public infrastructure
      out of domestic fiscal reach. Governments were reduced to the role of acting as
      collection agents for foreign creditors and as protectors of foreign investors
      from democratic attempts to tax rentier wealth. The United States was able to
      weaponize world trade by monopolizing oil exports through U.S. and allied oil
      companies (the Seven Sisters), while U.S. and European agricultural protectionism
      and World Bank “aid” policy steered food-deficit countries to focus on tropical
      plantation crops instead of grain to feed themselves. President Bill Clinton’s
      1994 NAFTA free-trade agreement swamped Mexico’s market with low-priced U.S. farm
      exports (highly subsidized by strong government support). Mexican grain production
      plummeted, leaving it food-dependent. To block governments from taxing or even
      fining foreign investors to recover compensation for damages to their countries,
      today’s rentier powers have created Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) courts
      requiring governments to compensate foreign investors for increasing taxes or
      imposing regulations that reduce foreign-owned income. (I provide the details
      of this in Chapter 7 of my 2022 book The Destiny of Civilization .) This system
      blocks national sovereignty, including by preventing host countries from taxing
      the economic rent of their land and natural resources owned by foreigners. The
      effect is to make these resources part of the investor-nation economy, not their
      own. (The Saudi oil company Aramco, for instance, was not a corporately distinct
      corporate affiliate but a branch of Standard Oil of New York (ESSO). This legal
      nicety meant that its income and expenses were consolidated into the parent company’s
      U.S. balance sheet. That enabled it to receive a tax credit for the “depletion
      allowance” for oil, rendering the company effectively free of U.S. income tax,
      although it was Saudi oil that was being depleted.) Other nations permitted the
      United States to dictate the post-World War II order, with it promising generous
      aid to support free trade, peace, and post-colonial national sovereignty, as spelled
      out in the United Nations Charter. But the United States squandered its wealth
      on military spending abroad and financial wealth addiction at home. That has left
      America’s post-industrial power based mainly on its ability to harm other countries
      with chaos if they do not accept the U.S. “rules-based order” designed to extract
      tribute from them. The U.S. imposes protectionist tariffs and import quotas at
      will, and subsidizes agriculture and key technologies as potential global high-tech
      monopolies, while forbidding other countries from implementing such “socialist”
      or “autocratic” policies to become more competitive. The result is a double standard
      in which the U.S. “rules-based order” (its own rules) replaces adherence to international
      law. U.S. agricultural price support policy initiated under Franklin D. Roosevelt
      in the 1930s provides a good example of double standards. It made farming the
      most heavily subsidized and protected sector. It became the model for the European
      Economic Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced in 1962. However,
      U.S. diplomacy opposes the attempts of other countries, especially Global South
      countries, to impose their own protectionist subsidies and import quotas aimed
      at achieving self-sufficiency in basic food production — while U.S. “aid lending”
      and the World Bank have (as indicated above) supported the exportation of tropical
      plantation crops by Global South countries by lending for transportation and port
      development. U.S. policy has consistently opposed family-owned farming and land
      reform throughout Latin America and other Global South countries, often with violence.
      Moves toward a multipolar world order It is not surprising that, inasmuch as Russia
      has long been the United States’ main military adversary, it has taken the lead
      in protesting against the unipolar U.S. order. Advocating a multipolar alternative
      to the U.S. neoliberal order in June 2025, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
      described the post-colonial economic subjugation of the countries that achieved
      political independence from colonialist rule in the 19 th and 20 th centuries
      but which are now facing the next task needed to complete their liberation: Our
      African friends are paying more and more attention to the fact that their entire
      economies are still largely based on siphoning off natural resources from these
      countries. In fact, all value added is produced and pocketed by the former Western
      metropoles and other European Union and NATO members. … The West is using illegal
      unilateral sanctions, which increasingly become the harbinger of a military attack,
      as this has happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and is now happening in Iran,
      as well as the instruments of unfair competition, initiating tariff wars, seizing
      other countries’ sovereign assets and taking advantage of the role of their currencies
      and payment systems. The West itself has actually buried the globalization model,
      which it developed after the Cold War to promote its interests. Marco Rubio made
      the same point in the U.S. Senate hearings to confirm him as Donald Trump’s Secretary
      of State, explaining that the “postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is
      now a weapon being used against us.” Violating the rules of foreign trade and
      investment that the United States itself dictated in 1945, and yet another instance
      of Washington resorting to the “rules-based order” of its own rules, President
      Trump’s unilateral tariffs aimed both at shifting the New Cold War’s military
      costs onto other countries, which are expected to buy American arms and provide
      proxy armies, and at reviving the U.S.’s lost industrial power by forcing countries
      to relocate industries to the United States and to permit U.S. companies to extract
      monopoly rents by controlling the leading emerging technologies. The United States
      aims to impose monopoly rights and related rentier privileges uniquely favorable
      to itself on the entire world’s trade and investment. Trump’s “America First”
      diplomacy demands that other countries conduct their trade, payments and debt
      relationships in U.S. dollars, instead of their own currencies. The U.S. “rule
      of law” is one that permits unilateral U.S. demands to impose trade and financial
      sanctions dictating how and with whom foreign countries can trade and invest.
      They are threatened with economic chaos and confiscation of their dollar reserves
      if they do not boycott trade and investment relations with Russia, China, and
      other countries refusing to submit to U.S. control. The United States’ leverage
      to obtain these foreign concessions is no longer industrial leadership and financial
      strength, but its ability to cause chaos for other countries. Claiming to be the
      indispensable nation, the U.S.’s ability to disrupt trade is ending its former
      international monetary and diplomatic power. That power originally was based on
      U.S. holdings of the world’s largest monetary gold reserves in 1945, its status
      as the largest creditor nation and industrial economy, and, after 1971, its dollar
      hegemony, arising in large part as a result of its financial market being the
      safest for other nations to hold their official monetary reserves. The diplomatic
      inertia created by these former advantages no longer reflects the realities of
      2025. What U.S. officials do have is the ability to disrupt the world’s trade,
      supply chains, and financial arrangements, including the SWIFT system for international
      payments. The U.S. and European confiscation of $300 billion of Russia’s monetary
      deposits has darkened America’s reputation for financial safety, while its chronic
      trade and balance-of-payments deficits threaten to disrupt the international monetary
      system and free trade that made it the major beneficiary of the 1945-2025 world
      order. In keeping with the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference
      in other countries’ internal affairs that underlay the creation of the United
      Nations (the basic principle of international law grounded in the 1648 Peace of
      Westphalia), Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov described (in his speech cited above)
      the need “to establish foreign trade mechanisms [that] the West will be unable
      to control, such as transport corridors, alternative payment systems and supply
      chains.” As an example of how the United States had paralyzed the World Trade
      Organization, which it had created on the basis of free trade at a time when America
      was the world’s leading export power, he explained: When the Americans realized
      that the globalized system they had created – one built on fair competition, inviolable
      property rights, the presumption of innocence, and similar principles, and which
      had allowed them to dominate for decades – had also begun benefiting their rivals,
      primarily China, they took drastic action. As China started outplaying them on
      their own turf and by their own rules, Washington simply blocked the WTO’s Appellate
      Body. By artificially stripping it of a quorum, they rendered this key dispute
      settlement mechanism inactive – and it remains so to this day. The United States
      has been able to block foreign opposition to its nationalist policies by having
      veto power in the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank. Even without such power,
      U.S. diplomats have been able to block United Nations organizations from acting
      independently of U.S. wishes by refusing to appoint leaders or judges not primarily
      loyal to U.S. foreign policy. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), charged
      with keeping nuclear proliferation in check is the most recent notorious case
      in point. Iran published documents showing that the agency’s leader Rafael Grossi
      provided U.S. and Israeli intelligence with the names of Iranian scientists who
      were killed, and details of the Iranian nuclear refinement sites that were bombed.
      The U.S. veto has prevented the UN Security Council from condemning Israeli attacks
      on the Palestinian population. And when the International Criminal Court (ICC)
      brought charges against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for committing
      war crimes and crimes against humanity in a genocide against the Palestinians,
      U.S. officials imposed sanctions on the ICC and demanded the removal of the prosecutor.
      The world no longer is to be governed by international law, but by unilateral
      U.S. rules, subject to abrupt change depending on the vicissitudes of American
      economic or military power (or loss thereof). As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin
      described this new state of affairs in 2022, “Western countries have been saying
      for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations,” yet the
      “unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and unfree; it is false and hypocritical
      through and through.” The United States’ self-image depicts its long dominant
      world position as reflecting its democracy, free market, and equality of opportunity
      that has enabled its power elite, in their view, to acquire their status by being
      the economy’s most productive members, through their management and allocation
      of savings and credit. The reality is that the United States has become a rentier
      oligarchy, one that is increasingly hereditary. Its members’ fortunes are made
      mainly by acquiring rent-yielding assets (land, natural resources, and monopolies)
      on which they make capital gains, while paying most of their rent as interest
      to their bankers, who end up with much of these rents and have become the new
      oligarchy’s leading managerial class. Summary The real conflict over what kind
      of economic and political system the Global Majority will have is just gaining
      momentum. Global South countries and others have been driven so deeply into debt
      that they have been obliged to sell off their public infrastructure to pay its
      carrying charges. Recovering control of their natural resources and basic infrastructure
      requires the fiscal right to impose an economic-rent tax on their land, natural
      resources and monopolies, as well as the legal right to recover environmental
      cleanup costs caused by foreign oil and mining firms, and to implement financial
      cleanup costs ( i.e ., write offs and cancellation) of the foreign debt burden
      imposed by creditors who have not taken responsibility to ensure that their loans
      can be paid under existing conditions. U.S. evangelistic rhetoric describes the
      imminent political and economic fracture of the world economy as a “Clash of Civilizations”
      between democracies (i.e., countries that support U.S. policy) and autocracies
      (i.e., nations acting independently). It would be more accurate to describe this
      fracture as a fight by the United States and its European and other Western allies
      against civilization — assuming civilization entails, as it seems it must, the
      sovereign right of countries to enact their own laws and tax systems for the benefit
      of their own populations within an international system that has a common set
      of basic rules and values. What Western ideologues call democracy and free markets
      has turned out to be an aggressive rentier -financial imperialism. And what they
      call autocracy is a government strong enough to prevent economic polarization
      between a super-rich rentier class and an impoverished population at large, such
      as is occurring within the Western oligarchies themselves. Photo by itsiken on

    one_sentence_summary: Michael's upcoming book discusses how industrial capitalism
      aimed to dismantle feudal economic structures by eliminating rentier incomes that
      hindered competitiveness, but notes that in the 20th century, efforts to address
      these issues have regressed, with rising land and resource rents still benefiting
      private interests.
    paragraph_summary: In an excerpt from Michael's forthcoming book on Medieval debt
      crusades, he discusses the transformative impact of industrial capitalism in liberating
      European economies from the remnants of feudalism, particularly the burdens of
      land rent, trade monopolies, and unproductive banking interests. He argues that
      these economic rents inflate prices, thereby diminishing profits and raising living
      costs. Despite the progress made in the 20th century to eliminate these rents,
      they continue to rise today, often benefiting from tax advantages while basic
      infrastructure is increasingly privatized by the financial sector. Michael highlights
      Britain's historical struggle against the landed aristocracy, culminating in the
      repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, which facilitated free trade and aimed to lower
      living costs while discouraging less industrialized nations from developing their
      own industries.

    text: 'NIMA ALKHORSHID : Let me start with a clip from an interview that the New
      York Times did with Mandy Patinkin, about the situation with Israel and Netanyahu
      and right-wing parties. DAVID MARCHESE (CLIP 1) : Are you thinking or feeling
      any differently about what it means for you to be Jewish in this moment? MANDY
      PATINKIN (CLIP 1) : Yes, I am. I’ll let them go first. KATHRYN GRODY (CLIP 1)
      : I hate the way some people are using antisemitism as a claim for anybody that
      is critical about a certain policy. As far as I am concerned, compassion for every
      person in Gaza is very Jewish, and the fact that I abhor the policies of the leader
      of that country does not mean I’m a self-hating Jew or I’m antisemitic. DAVID
      MARCHESE (CLIP 1) : You mean Netanyahu when you say the “leader of that country?”
      KATHRYN GRODY (CLIP 1) : Yes. The politics of what he’s doing is the worst thing
      for Jewish people. It’s like lighting a candle for anybody that has any antisemitic
      feelings. It’s creating a generation of wounded and hurt kids who will understandably
      be very angry. I feel deeply troubled and horrified by what is happening in my
      name. MANDY PATINKIN (CLIP 1) : 10 or 15 years ago, I was in Philadelphia, getting
      ready to do a concert with my dear friend Patti LuPone. I go up to the hotel room
      and “The Princess Bride” was on, and just as I walked in the room was that final
      scene in the movie where Inigo is sitting by the window with the Man in Black,
      and the Man in Black asks Inigo, would he like to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts,
      and Inigo Montoya said these words: “I have been in the revenge business so long.
      Now that it’s over, I do not know what to do with the rest of my life.” And I
      ask Jews to consider what this man Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government
      is doing to the Jewish people all over the world. They are endangering not only
      the State of Israel, which I care deeply about and want to exist, but endangering
      the Jewish population all over the world. DAVID MARCHESE (CLIP 1) : And endangering
      the Jews by endangering those in Gaza. MANDY PATINKIN (CLIP 1) : To watch what
      is happening, for the Jewish people to allow this to happen to children and civilians
      of all ages in Gaza, for whatever reason, is unconscionable and unthinkable. And
      I ask you Jews, everywhere, all over the world, to spend some time alone and think,
      Is this acceptable and sustainable? How could it be done to you and your ancestors
      and you turn around and you do it to someone else? NIMA ALKHORSHID : I think that
      what’s going on is universal, with the case of Netanyahu. And I want to start
      with Michael’s take on what he said. MICHAEL HUDSON : About a month ago, Netanyahu
      said that the greatest enemies of Israel were the assimilationist Jews throughout
      the world. And he said, basically, that they are the critics of Israel. What Netanyahu
      was doing was backing the extreme right-wing Orthodox Jews who support him, against
      the old idea of cultural Zionism where Israel was depicted more or less as working
      on a kibbutz and being almost like a socialist economy instead of a racist genocidal
      economy. Regarding what Mandy Patinkin said, and it was a wonderful quote: in
      the recent New York City elections, as I think we’ve said, the largest group supporting
      Mamdani, the socialist candidate who was denouncing genocide, was the Jewish population.
      In other words, you have a reaction by the progressive Jewish population, in America
      and I think all over the world, who say “We’ve suffered enough from ethnic prejudice.
      We want to assimilate.” In the United States, you had Jewish representatives among
      the leaders of the support for the black movement in the 1960s, the 1970s. And
      this really is a decisive point. There’s no question [about what Mandy said].
      When Netanyahu and President Trump say “if you don’t support Israel, you’re an
      anti-Semite; if you don’t support genocide, you’re an anti-Semite; if you don’t
      believe it’s necessary to defend Israel by killing all the non-Israelis and exterminating
      them as a new Holocaust, you’re an anti-Semite”… Well, what are people to say?
      “Well, gee, I believe all these things. Does that make me an anti-Semite?” I think
      that’s what Mandy Patinkin was saying. Israeli behavior in the Near East is a
      crime against civilization. What they are doing breaks every international law,
      every element of what people think is a civilized society. Is it anti-Semitic
      to support civilization? This has created a split. President Trump says “we’re
      closing down Columbia University, because students at Columbia from the Israeli
      Defense Forces feel threatened by the fact that there are students saying genocide
      is bad.” These IDF students feel that if you say genocide is bad, you’re attacking
      Jews all over the world. The same statements are made by Merz in Germany, where
      any defense of the Palestinians in Gaza is banned. This is literally a dividing
      line. What side are you on, barbarism or civilization? And they’ve made it a Jewish
      issue. RICHARD WOLFF : Nationalism has been used for progressive purposes, and
      nationalism has been used for fascistic purposes and everything in between. Every
      time Mr. Trump does anything that he knows millions of Americans do not agree
      with, it is very important to label what he’s doing as American. And anybody who
      disagrees with him is literally un-American. For many decades, we had in the United
      States Congress an un-American activities committee whose job it was to ferret
      out people who disagreed with policies of the U.S. government and to declare them
      as enemies of the state, enemies of the culture, fundamentally “un-American” –
      then, at least partly on that basis, to imprison them, to deport them, and in
      the case of some of them, drive them to insanity and every other horror you can
      think of. That’s my first comment. Here’s my second. We have in the law the idea
      that if and only if you are immediately threatened with bodily harm, that you
      feel genuinely that your life is in danger, only then do you have anything remotely
      like the right to self-defense. Israeli bombing of citizens in Gaza who are not
      shooting at them, who have no means to shoot at them and have had no significant
      means for years, who are subject to mass slaughter – this cannot be justified
      by pointing out something that was done by a very small political group called
      Hamas two years ago. This violates, as Michael said, every basic notion of what
      is just, what is fair, what is allowable in the extreme case of feeling self-defense.
      What someone in October of 2023 did to a fellow citizen of yours is never, in
      any law that I know of that isn’t crazy, a justification for taking massive numbers
      of other people’s lives. During World War II, it was very frequent to denounce
      the Nazis when, having been attacked by some partisan group, they collected all
      of the adult citizens in a village and shot them. The notion was that we, the
      Germans, being put upon by some partisans, therefore have some right to mass slaughter
      of people who were not involved in that effort, who were not subjected to any
      legal procedure to link them. We are now celebrating people doing what not so
      long ago we decided was beyond the pale. I want to remind you: in the Nuremberg
      trials and their aftermath, the whole world sat in judgment for months, deliberating
      (in a way that the people they were judging never did), allowing witnesses, before
      it was decided that crimes had been committed – and there was specific reference
      to the mass killing of people who had not done anything. And those [criminals]
      were executed. The leaders e.g. Goering, Goebbels, the people they were able to
      catch, were executed by the West as a sign of the utter unacceptability of this
      behavior. And it is very close to what is going on in Israel. And I think for
      me, the worst of it is the use of nationalism. For an American audience, it is
      particularly important to understand how nationalism has been used as the cover
      for people with an agenda we ought to be horrified by and not allow them to use
      nationalism. And that’s really what this is. Mr. Netanyahu wants to equate the
      national notion he has of Israel with the obligation of every Jewish person around
      the world. That’s a ploy that is very common among nationalists. That’s how they
      recruit for and sustain their movements, by suggesting that you have to be like
      them if you’re going to wear the label – you know, French or Spanish or Jewish
      or anything else. We’ve gone through enough in the last 200 years. Two world wars
      with an awful lot of nationalism. Let me close with a story. When World War I
      broke out in 1914, the German parliament was roughly equally split, with the Socialist
      Party being by then the number two party in Germany controlling over 40% of the
      seats in the parliament. Kaiser Wilhelm (who was no longer Kaiser by the end of
      the war, but at the beginning of the war he was still Kaiser i.e. king of Germany),
      went on the radio and he said something that became very famous in German history.
      “Ich kenne keine Parteien mehr, ich kenne nur noch Deutsche.”  I do not recognize
      any parties anymore. I only recognize Germans. There it was. To mobilize the people
      to fight a world war (which Germany lost) he had to try to overcome what? The
      fact that the Socialist Party, at least on record, was against fighting a war
      and would have voted against funding it. To stop that, he had to make everybody
      into a loyal German. Let me remind everyone, not just outside of Israel, but a
      huge part of the Jewish population in Israel is against what is going on. They
      consider themselves Jews. That’s the part I’m talking about. They consider themselves
      Israelis, and they consider themselves patriotic Israelis. And in many ways, they
      are. But they are the sworn political enemies of Netanyahu and much, unfortunately
      not all, but much of what Netanyahu stands for- as you can see if you paid attention
      to Mr. Netanyahu’s failed efforts to transform the judiciary in Israel and his
      failed efforts to win a large part of the Jewish population. It is therefore doubly
      ironic that people who are critical of Mr. Netanyahu and of the war, have an easier
      time in Israel than they do in New York or Philadelphia or Los Angeles. And that’s
      because the anti-Semitic nonsense is a cover, not just for Mr. Netanyahu, but
      for Mr. Trump. The Republicans and Trump just voted to defund public radio and
      public television. That’s who they are. They don’t want public anything. They
      want everything to be handled either by the business community, that’s their first
      choice, or by the paid representatives, that’s the religious community. One or
      the other. They don’t want a government that is representative in any way of the
      mass of people. And they want to smash national public radio. They did it. They
      want to smash the universities that train people to think at least critically
      enough to be not amenable to MAGA mentality. The anti-Semitism is purely the thinnest
      of fig leaves covering a political agenda of the extreme right wing who see this
      moment as the first in a century and need to milk it for everything they can get
      before Mr. Trump is ushered out into the pantheon of horrible experiences right
      alongside of Joseph McCarthy. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Michael, before going to the next
      topic, do you want to add something? MICHAEL HUDSON : No, it’s just to point out
      that after all, it was the right-wing party in Israel that assassinated Prime
      Minister Rabin for trying to support peace. So, of course, they kill each other
      politically. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Michael, what has happened with the case of Ukraine?
      Europeans are trying to buy weapons. Donald Trump is bragging about selling more
      weapons to Europeans. These wealthy European countries are going to pay us [Americans]
      for the weapons. And we’re going to to benefit a lot from what’s going on in Ukraine.
      But they’re going to pay, they may send it to Ukraine. But when it comes to the
      economy of European countries, we know that France said they’re not going to pay
      for that. And it seems that mostly they’re going to put it on Germany. And I don’t
      know if the United Kingdom is willing to go in that direction. But considering
      the economy of Germany, how Merz can somehow convince the German people that they
      can pay for that? And nobody knows when they’re going to get these weapons, if
      they’re going to be used in Ukraine anytime soon, and the capability of the military-industrial
      complex of the United States to produce them as soon as possible. These are huge
      questions when it comes to the latest talks between Donald Trump and the NATO
      Secretary General Rutte. MICHAEL HUDSON : You’ve put in a nutshell just about
      everything that I would have said. The problem Trump is dealing with is America’s
      deindustrialization. How can you rebuild a trade surplus if you’ve deindustrialized?
      Well, as we discussed before, the only way to do this is to say, we’re not going
      to compete in automobiles or the usual industrial manufactured products. We’re
      going to deal with monopoly products that will enable us to charge much more for
      the exports than it actually costs to produce them. So we’re not only talking
      about normal profits for industry, which is unable to make a profit under Trump’s
      rules, but super profits which are monopoly rents. And arms, along with information
      technology, are one of the designated monopoly rent-yielding export markets. So
      Trump has said, we’re not going to give any more American arms directly to Ukraine.
      We’re going to say, Europe, it’s up to you to defend yourselves. You want to fight
      Ukraine and Russia? You want to carry the new Cold War costs in Western Europe
      to Russia? Be our guests, but you’ll buy your arms to fight Russia from us. You
      will pay full price, buy American arms, and then it’s up to you whether you want
      to use these directly to fight Russia or whether you want to donate them to Ukraine.
      But we’re not going to spend the American budget directly on supplying the Ukraine
      war anymore. That’s what he’s doing, and that’s a rational procedure. What you’re
      pointing out is what seems to be irrational at first sight. Why on earth would
      the Germans go along with it and change the rules of the European Union? There’s
      a rule against running a budget deficit of more than 3%, maybe more than 5%. We’re
      going to change these rules so that the European Union and Germany, its members,
      can spend much more, can create its own money to buy American arms to fight the
      war to attack Russia. It’s not a defensive war, it’s an attack war. How are we
      going to try to balance the budget? The increase in military spending is from
      the 2% under NATO that was set before Trump, to 5%. That’s an increase by 3% of
      GDP, but the entire economic growth of Europe is normally 3%. The entire economic
      growth each year is to go to providing military exports. And that can only be
      achieved by cutting back social spending, cutting back the subsidies on German
      residents to be able to pay for the gas and electricity to heat and power their
      homes now that they’ve stopped trade with Russia. The cutback in domestic spending,
      in addition to lower living standards, is going to lower GDP. So the increase
      in German spending on weapons, while the economy actually goes into negative GDP
      growth quarter after quarter, is going to be 10, 20, 30 times the GDP growth.
      The German economy is militarizing. Mr. Merz said, we’re going to make the Wehrmacht
      the power that it used to be. The power, obviously, under Adolf Hitler. No wonder
      President Putin and the rest of the world are saying, this is neo-Nazism. They
      don’t realize that World War II is over. They say, okay, let’s have a replay.
      Let’s do it all over again. That’s what it looks like. The German population,
      certainly according to all of the surveys, opposes Merz, opposes the Christian
      Democrats, opposes the war in Ukraine. It doesn’t matter. What the German people
      say doesn’t seem to have an effect on the German government or on the European
      Union, which has appointed the two super-hawks, Van der Leyen and the Estonian
      lady. I can’t believe that the point you’ve made will not split the European Union
      apart. RICHARD WOLFF : Let me approach it from a slightly different angle. Mr.
      Trump promised many times while he was campaigning that he could and would bring
      an end to the war in Ukraine. To this day, he refers to it as Biden’s war because
      he’s so eager not to be responsible. It’s a weak way of defending himself: here
      we are half a year since he’s been president and he’s not one iota closer to ending
      the war in Ukraine than he was when he took office. How do you fix, in the way
      American politics works, a screaming failure? Well, you pick on whatever aspect
      of it that you can find where you can do something to try to make it look like
      you’re doing what you’re supposed to. One of the reasons the Republican and right-wing
      and conservative parts of the United States were not happy with the Ukraine war
      was the point that Michael just made. Namely, it’s the old guns versus butter.
      It was costing a ton of money for the United States to support Ukraine financially,
      politically, and militarily. And that this was our money, tax money, and so that
      was part of the argument. So he can do something there. He can make the Europeans
      pay, so it isn’t we who pay. And he can get up and talk about “See? I got them
      to pay, we don’t pay” and hope that by talking about that, he can distract us
      from the fact that he didn’t promise to make them pay. He promised to bring the
      awful war to an end. Remember how many times he said to the consternation of the
      whole world that he wanted the war in Ukraine to end because, I quote him now,
      “people are dying over there”. And the whole world pointed out that more people
      are dying in Gaza than are dying in Ukraine. If dying is an issue, you’re not
      exactly consistent here. No, it made no difference. People are dying, and he’s
      going to bring it to an end. He’s not. And this week was the failure of failures.
      Every effort he tried: there will be no ceasefire until they do what Putin asked
      them to do. They [Russia] are not prepared to do that. So we don’t have a ceasefire.
      The war continues. What is he going to do? He promised to do what he cannot and
      will not do. How does he square that circle? By making an enormous issue about
      having the Europeans pay. And the Europeans, having not yet decided to make the
      break with the United States, mumble and bumble and fumble, and yes, we will.
      Whether they do or not, whether Mr. Merz can even stay in office – I should remind
      people, he didn’t win by a lot, this is no landslide or mandate-holder. This is
      a slim politician in a precarious situation. It’s very open how many dollars or
      euros will ever find their way into these programs. But for the sound bite, and
      to ease Mr. Trump’s political difficulties, Mr. Merz will go along because he
      wants Mr. Trump to help him in a variety of ways as well. This is an arrangement
      with lots of verbiage, lots of word salad to cover a temporary fix that solves
      absolutely nothing. MICHAEL HUDSON : Richard, I think we now know that Trump never
      intended the war to come to an end. He never said his aim was to increase the
      war, to upgrade it. What he meant when he said bring the fighting to an end is
      a ceasefire. And during that ceasefire, Europe and the United States was supposed
      to rearm Ukraine, as it did after the Minsk accords, to rearm and accelerate the
      fighting to help Ukraine fight against Russia all the more. And it was just a
      trick with words to say, I want to stop the fighting and end the war, when he
      really wanted to accelerate the war. I think the recent speeches of Foreign Secretary
      Lavrov and President Putin have acknowledged the fact that they now realize that
      all of this was just a trick by Trump to make them think that he wanted to end
      the war while actually pacifying them into stopping the fighting so that America
      could accelerate the war against them as a super hawk. And he’s gone beyond Biden’s
      war. He’s made it not only his war, but his war with an exclamation point. RICHARD
      WOLFF : I just want to acknowledge that that is possible. You know, the way diplomacy
      and the way the American government particularly works, all we ever do is guess.
      All you get from Michael and me are the best guesses we can make reading a ton
      of material and trying not to be too easily fooled. But so much information is
      withheld that it’s this endless politics of speculation. Look at all the stuff
      about Epstein. It’s the same thing. We don’t know tens of millions of pieces of
      information that might make it a bit easier to figure out what’s going on. We
      are denied that. And that’s very unhealthy and gives the people in charge a lot
      more freedom to fool around with us than we ought to allow if we took our commitment
      to democracy seriously. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Yeah Michael, the Epstein case that
      Donald Trump is somehow trying to dodge, but in the end, the MAGA movement is
      asking for more from Donald Trump. Why is he so hesitant when it comes to that
      case? MICHAEL HUDSON : Well, he’s more than hesitant. He’s disowned his own MAGA
      supporters. This was one of the big things that he had promised, especially to
      the QAnon conspiracy people. His supporters had said the U.S. government has been
      captured. It’s been captured not only by Trump Derangement Syndrome, but it’s
      been captured by the secrecy of the big state, not only in the JFK files that
      Trump had promised to release, but Trump had made a big case all along about the
      Epstein files. Again and again and again, he had mobilized his MAGA supporters
      by talking about the Epstein files. Why on earth would he make such a volte-face
      and all of a sudden call them the radical left, his own MAGA supporters on the
      radical right? It looks to me like he’s very frightened of something. I don’t
      think he’s frightened by the fact that Musk had accused that, well, Trump is in
      the Epstein files. A few days ago, there was testimony by a girl who was 14 years
      old at the time who described in 20 minutes the awful things that Trump did to
      her with Epstein. But I think there’s been enormous pressure brought on Trump
      to say something that is to try to misrepresent what the files were. I don’t think
      there was a file saying, here’s a file of people I blackmailed. He was doing it
      obviously for another party, and he didn’t need the file. What he had was exactly
      what Bondi, the attorney general, said she had on her desk. She said she had on
      her desk the pictures of all of these young girls. And she said, they’re really
      terrible pictures. To protect the girls, we don’t want to release these pictures.
      Well, you can always black out the pictures of the girls. The question is: who
      are the men with the girls? The men with the girls seem to include a lot of very
      powerful people who either are Donald Trump’s own donors or are powerful enough
      to bring pressure on him to make him so frightened of the thought of actually
      showing who the men were in these pictures that he’s caused a split among his
      own followers. There’s now a spreading distrust of him because of his denial that
      Epstein was involved in any kind of political context for all of this blackmail.
      Just simple blackmail. No, no, he liked young girls, but that was it. Nothing
      to see here. Nothing about Israel, nothing about the deep state, nothing about
      the CIA. The whole context for this is that politics in America for the last 50
      years is all about having blackmail files. In the 1960s, a number of groups said,
      Gee, Michael, you’re a very good speaker. Would you like to run for political
      office? And I asked some political insiders, what do you think of this suggestion?
      They said: Michael, don’t even try it. Nobody has anything on you. You’ve led
      a normal life. You’re happily married. You just do writing. They don’t have anything
      on you. Nobody can trust you because they don’t know what you’re going to say
      that may surprise them in a way that they don’t like. If you really want to run
      for office, you have to make sure they have enough on you, so that you can’t do
      anything to expose something they don’t want to expose. Well, just imagine President
      Clinton trying to run either for governor or more important for president. The
      Democratic Party had a meeting with them – I’m making up a fictional conversation
      – “Bill, you know, we want you to be president, but between you and Hillary, we
      don’t want to be surprised. We’re going to ask you to take a trip with Mr. Epstein.
      And the purpose of this trip is, we want you to get photographed. At least act
      as if you’re doing something that would be very embarrassing when it comes out.
      We’re not going to do anything with the photograph. We’re going to keep it in
      our files just in case you do something that we don’t like. In case you don’t
      support Alan Greenspan, and you don’t get rid of laws that Wall Street doesn’t
      want, etc etc.” Something like that. All of this back in the 60s and for many
      decades was only about U.S. politics. But now, with the Epstein affair, the individuals
      who were his main backers and funders and sponsors all seem to have had very strong
      connections to Israel, like Robert Maxwell himself. And so there’s a belief that
      what will be shown are not only individuals whose politics and statements have
      supported the right wing in America, the Democratic and Republican right-wing,
      but supported Israel too. That’s the whole suspicion of all of this. How else
      can you explain what’s happening and the pressure that obviously is being brought
      in on Trump? Who is bringing this pressure and why? That’s what his MAGA supporters
      are saying, and in fact, what the whole country is saying right now, judging from
      today’s newspapers. RICHARD WOLFF : If Mr. Trump has nothing to fear, as any junior
      prosecutor would say, and if he’s in charge, he can open up the files, and there
      it is, and he’s got nothing to worry about. He says he has nothing to worry about.
      Okay, then open the file! You’re the authority. And if you want to protect the
      young women that were abused, Michael is quite right: there are 50 different ways
      to do that. By the way, it might be that those women would like to have a chance
      to sue, to have a chance to reclaim a little bit of what was in effect taken from
      them by the experience, when they were young and needed money or whatever it is
      that brought them into that situation. He can do good by them, give them the option.
      If they wish to be anonymized, okay, then everything is cleansed up with them.
      But if he really wants there not to be the suspicion that he’s doing something
      stinky, well, he has the authority. It stops with him. He can order his attorney
      general or anybody else to open these files. And, I love the irony (I’m a bit
      of a Hegelian): There’s Mr. Big and Powerful. There he is working night and day
      to make us understand he rules the world. He can hit this country with a tariff.
      He can bomb over here. All the old dying empire’s efforts to keep its empire alive.
      And yet, when it comes to here, he has to deny himself his own power. He has to
      use his power and use it in a way that makes everyone think less of him, no matter
      what happens now, right? If Steve Bannon and all the others… Look at Mr. Johnson,
      the head of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives. He said he wanted
      the files released and literally minutes later voted against having them released.
      You know, this is the power turned in on itself and makes itself undone. It is
      the self-negation that Mr. Hegel talked to us about. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Michael,
      when it comes to the issue of competition between the United States and China,
      it seems that as time goes by, many people, even in the industry in the United
      States, who are not that much connected with the military-industrial complex or
      not that much gaining from endless wars, they’re somehow criticizing the way that
      the United States is dealing with Russia, with China, in terms of competition.
      Here is what the CEO of Ford Motors talked about. He was talking about the competition
      in the car industry between the United States and China. It’s somehow frightening,
      but here is what he said. JIM FARLEY (CLIP 2) : It’s the most humbling thing I’ve
      ever seen. 70% of all EVs in the world, electric vehicles, are made in China.
      They have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car.
      They have facial recognition. INTERVIEWER (CLIP 2) : Cell phone technology… is
      connected to their cell phones. JIM FARLEY (CLIP 2) : Yes, you get in, you don’t
      have to pair your phone. Automatically, your whole digital life is mirrored in
      the car. You have an AI companion, that you can talk to ChatGPT equivalent in
      China… all the automatic payment is already there. You can buy movie tickets.
      It has facial recognition, so it knows who’s in which seat and which media you
      like. INTERVIEWER (CLIP 2) : Why don’t Ford cars have that? Would you need to
      deal with Apple or Google? JIM FARLEY (CLIP 2) : Yeah, because Google and Apple
      decided not to go in the car business. And even beyond that, the cost, the quality
      of their vehicles is far superior to what I see in the West. I mean, we are in
      a global competition with China, and it’s not just EVs. And if we lose this, we
      do not have a future, Ford. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Go ahead, Michael. Your take on
      what’s going on with car production. MICHAEL HUDSON : For many decades now, it’s
      been not only the cost, it’s the design. The American car companies have made
      their recovery of profits basically on selling sports utility vehicles, the very
      large gas-guzzling cars. When Trump and his predecessors asked “why don’t you
      Japanese import more American cars?” The Japanese explained: Your cars are too
      big for our streets. They’re too big for our parking lots. They take up too much
      space. And they take up too much gas, and we have to import our gas. Our car buyers
      want to economize on their gas spending. They want to get a car that they can
      drive easily and park where they want. And they [the Japanese] like their own
      cars better because the Americans have not really aimed their design at what the
      world wants, but what they are advertising has been able to convince American
      buyers: if you want to be safe, buy a big sports utility vehicle with a high center
      of gravity that tends to tip over if you go fast around a curve, buy one of these…
      and also you’ll feel more powerful and it’s your identity. You can imagine what
      Trump’s threat of tariffs on Japan of 35%, maybe 50% even, (including cars) are
      going to do. Trump’s threat against Japan’s car exports and also those of South
      Korea are the largest attack on Japan since the Plaza Accords and the Louvre Accords
      that followed in the 1980s led to Japan’s lost decade of the 1990s. He’s trying
      to block Japanese and Korean exports to the United States, leaving Americans no
      choice but to buy [American] cars and, of course, no ability to buy the Chinese
      electric vehicles anymore, largely because of the American support of Musk’s company,
      made in America, employing American labor largely. Even so, here’s the problem
      with American car manufacturers. Trump has imposed tariffs on copper, steel, and
      aluminum. This is what cars are made out of. The car companies here have to pay
      much higher prices for copper and steel and aluminum – for the raw materials out
      of which cars are made – than foreign countries manufacturers have to pay. And
      American batteries are much more expensive than those that are designed to power
      the Chinese cars. So there’s no way in which American cars can compete either
      on price or in design. How on earth can this problem be cured without absolute
      control of foreign trade blocking Americans from buying these cars? And of course,
      given the role of automobiles in the American budget and the role of taking out
      an automobile loan to buy a car, paying a very high price given the high default
      rates on American automobile loans, is probably one of the major causes of the
      American price inflation that you have today. In sum, Trump’s moves against Japan
      are an attempt to protect an inefficient, uncompetitive automobile industry. Not
      to mention the Canadian and Mexican affiliates that are producing the parts that
      go into the cars are making. He’s tied the economic hands of car makers behind
      their backs. “We’re going to tax what you buy, the parts for your cars from Mexico
      and Canada, and we’re going to increase the cost of raw materials to make the
      cars. And we’re not going to let you buy the batteries to power them.” You can
      imagine how self-destructive this policy is, and I don’t see how it can last.
      RICHARD WOLFF : Yeah, let’s do a very quick economics of why it can’t last. When
      you protect the American economy from the Chinese, whether you use the electric
      vehicles or you use solar panels or you use advanced AI equipment and so on, it’s
      always the same story. You protect it here by excluding the Chinese. What does
      that mean? It means that where the Chinese have broken into the American market,
      it is because they produce either a better quality or offer a lower price or both.
      That’s it. There’s no magic. No one’s holding a gun to anybody’s head. That’s
      how and why, you know, the toaster you have at home is made in China and on and
      on and on. Because that’s a cheaper, better toaster than anybody else makes, which
      is why Walmart or Target or any of the others has it for sale. Now let’s follow
      the economics. If you exclude that, you make Americans buy poorer quality or pay
      a higher price. That’s not good. That’s bad for the consumer, but no one really
      cares about them except in words. Let’s turn next to American businesses, or for
      that matter, to any businesses operating here in America. They have to buy inputs,
      you know, raw materials, machines, parts, whatever it is. And where are they going
      to buy them from? They’re not going to get the good, cheap ones from abroad because
      the government of the United States has put a tariff. That’s the point of the
      tariff. So the American business will not be able to buy its raw material or its
      parts or its inputs. It will not be able to buy from China because we’re in this
      competition, which means it can’t get the cheapest or the best quality. But of
      course, the competitors of the United States located in Canada or Mexico or anywhere
      else in the world are able to go to China and are able to buy at the lower price
      the better quality. So over time, America is shooting itself in the foot competitively.
      It’s losing and not by the hand of anybody else, but by its own. It is following
      a policy that may be good for the posturing of Mr. Trump. “I’m bringing industry
      back.” No, you aren’t. The industries aren’t coming, and they’re not coming because
      of what I just said: namely, in the long run, it makes no sense to come back here
      because you’ll have to not be able to buy the cheapest input or the highest quality.
      Why would you move to a country which promises you competitive disadvantages?
      That’s why American companies went abroad in the first place because it was more
      profitable. You are giving them a reason not to come back. Why this is so difficult,
      I assume, is not because the idea is complex (it isn’t) but because of the noise
      from the Trump administration, sadly not contradicted by the vast majority of
      Democrats and their spokespersons. So it is allowed to give this man, Trump, the
      opportunity to posture as if he was doing good for the American economy. He isn’t.
      It may be bad in any case. I’m not blaming him for it. But what he’s doing is
      really nonsensical self-promotion and making the problem worse. MICHAEL HUDSON
      : Well, only one technical question, Richard. How can you shoot yourself in the
      foot if you first shot yourself in the brain? It doesn’t work that way. RICHARD
      WOLFF : I mean, it’s not, this is not complicated. There are things in economics
      that are complicated. This isn’t one of them. It’s really sad. It’s almost as
      if we had a person who was president who said, I’m going to solve our economic
      problems. I’m going to erect a six-foot-tall tower and I’m going to hang yellow
      streamers and I’m going to have an enormous amount of whipped cream put on top.
      And we would listen to such a person and we would all shake our heads. How demented,
      how sad for him to imagine that a real problem, the declining American economic
      system, could be managed by this fantasy. Well, I got to tell you, with all my
      fancy economic degrees, I’m looking at a program that’s ridiculous. MICHAEL HUDSON
      : I wonder how this will affect the negotiations between the United States and
      Europe right now. Because European companies also not only wanted to export cars
      to the United States, as did South Africa that has heavy tariffs, but Trump is
      pressing them to set up American production plants, as many German car companies
      have done. But if they set up an auto production plant in America, how can they
      make a profit given what we’ve just discussed about their increased costs? This
      action and the tariff policy by Trump is essentially splitting the American economy
      off from the rest of the world and isolating it, as we’ve discussed before. RICHARD
      WOLFF : Yeah. And if you look, Nima’s choice of that clip is very, very smart,
      right? To have the Ford family, which is really the family out of which the American
      car industry grew, right? Henry Ford, way back when, at the beginning of the 20th
      century, creates the assembly line and makes it possible to mass produce this
      odd thing, a self-driving automobile instead of a horse and a carriage. Here you
      have the latest generation, a young man who you would expect, if he were like
      Trump, would be beating the drum of nationalism, is answering an honest question
      by saying, you know, we don’t produce the best cars. We don’t have the best technology.
      We can’t compete. I mean, after you listen to him describe what the Chinese car
      on the average can do… I know enough about American cars. They can’t do those
      things. And they’re more expensive. And we are completely lost in the electric
      vehicle market. Wow. From the mouth of Mr. Ford. You know what that suggests to
      me as an observer? That the car industry in this country is finished. Cars, whatever
      their role in the world economy in the years ahead, are going to be made much
      better elsewhere. Maybe the image of the United States is that we’re so important,
      even though we are, let me remind everyone, four and a half percent of the world’s
      people live in the United States. Four and a half, we’re going to have an economy
      all by ourselves. You know what that means? We’re going to be the oddity that
      now you can see on television when a camera crew goes deep into the Amazonian
      jungle or deep somewhere else and discovers a community that has been living the
      same way for 5,000 years. We’re going to be one of those. The rest of the world
      is going to send tourists here. That’ll be our new economic boom, the tourism
      to look at, look at these ancient automobiles these people still have. You know,
      I’m not being facetious. That’s where we’re going with this policy. MICHAEL HUDSON
      : Well, so much for the materialist approach to foreign policy, thinking that
      nations are going to act in their own self-interest. RICHARD WOLFF : Well, you
      know, “what your self-interest is” has never been uniformly or universally agreed.
      The sentence, if you think about Hegel, takes you in all the different directions.
      The tragedy of Europe is somehow even more poignant for me than the American.
      To be transparent, I was born and lived all my life in the United States, but
      my parents were refugees. They came from Europe. And so I straddle in the sense
      that my parents are European and I’m an American and I have children and they’re
      American and all that. But Europe was once the center of the known world because
      it did the knowing and it was the center. And, you know, it carved up the whole
      world. I remember once studying the meetings in Berlin in 1884 where all the European
      countries had a big map of Africa and made lines with markers. You get this, I
      get that, having nothing to do with the billion people that lived in Africa at
      the time. Extraordinary, really extraordinary. It’s all gone. They can’t unify,
      so they don’t even have the power that a unified unit might have. So they don’t
      even have that. They’re pinched by the Chinese and Russians on one end, by the
      Americans on the other. Israel and Gaza stand out as the final desperate attempt
      to hold on to the colonial idea project. Look at the price being paid. The lesson
      to the world: if you ever wanted an example of why you should get rid of colonialism,
      it’s here. So the Europeans, they face nothing but defeat after defeat after defeat.
      And you know, they deny it and they pretend otherwise. You know, when the Queen
      of England dies and a new king [is enthroned], they actually act as if anybody
      cared, as if the world would be interested in the cortege that takes the Queen
      to her final resting place. This is a theater piece for ancient times, held on
      to by people who have nothing else. The catastrophe here is real. And I understand
      the danger. Societies traumatized by anything can behave in a horrible way. The
      German working class, as I’ve tried to write recently, was traumatized. It was
      led to believe in the 19th century that it was going to inherit the world, that
      the British Empire was fading, and Deutsche Reich, the German Empire, would replace
      it. And they were led to believe it. And German economic development in the 19th
      century was like America. Those were the two up-and-coming contenders to replace
      the British Empire. Then, in a very short time, the German working class was destroyed
      by being defeated in World War I. Four years, five years later, they had the worst
      inflation in modern history, wiped out their savings. And four years after that,
      the Great Depression of 1929 hit. In a short period, they were traumatized by
      three totally destructive events. No wonder they went for Adolf Hitler. That’s
      what happens if you are traumatized. Look what happened to people in Cambodia
      after the United States bombed them forever. They went to Pol Pot, and what was
      that? You traumatize a population. Too many defeats, too many declines, too much
      absence of any change, and you can get very bizarre activity. And part of the
      bizarreness of the Trump government is that. Photo by Pawel Czerwinski on Unsplash

    paragraph_summary: In a recent interview with the New York Times, Mandy Patinkin
      and Kathryn Grody expressed their concerns about the impact of Israeli Prime Minister
      Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on Jewish identity and global antisemitism. Grody
      criticized the misuse of antisemitism accusations against those who critique Israeli
      policies, asserting that compassion for Palestinians in Gaza aligns with Jewish
      values. Both artists conveyed their distress over the current political climate,
      suggesting that Netanyahu's actions not only threaten the State of Israel but
      also jeopardize the safety and perception of Jewish people worldwide. Patinkin
      invoked a poignant moment from "The Princess Bride" to emphasize the need for
      reflection among Jews regarding the implications of their leadership's decisions.

    text: 'NIMA ALKHORSHID : Let me start with a clip from an interview that the New
      York Times did with Mandy Patinkin, about the situation with Israel and Netanyahu
      and right-wing parties. DAVID MARCHESE (CLIP 1) : Are you thinking or feeling
      any differently about what it means for you to be Jewish in this moment? MANDY
      PATINKIN (CLIP 1) : Yes, I am. I’ll let them go first. KATHRYN GRODY (CLIP 1)
      : I hate the way some people are using antisemitism as a claim for anybody that
      is critical about a certain policy. As far as I am concerned, compassion for every
      person in Gaza is very Jewish, and the fact that I abhor the policies of the leader
      of that country does not mean I’m a self-hating Jew or I’m antisemitic. DAVID
      MARCHESE (CLIP 1) : You mean Netanyahu when you say the “leader of that country?”
      KATHRYN GRODY (CLIP 1) : Yes. The politics of what he’s doing is the worst thing
      for Jewish people. It’s like lighting a candle for anybody that has any antisemitic
      feelings. It’s creating a generation of wounded and hurt kids who will understandably
      be very angry. I feel deeply troubled and horrified by what is happening in my
      name. MANDY PATINKIN (CLIP 1) : 10 or 15 years ago, I was in Philadelphia, getting
      ready to do a concert with my dear friend Patti LuPone. I go up to the hotel room
      and “The Princess Bride” was on, and just as I walked in the room was that final
      scene in the movie where Inigo is sitting by the window with the Man in Black,
      and the Man in Black asks Inigo, would he like to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts,
      and Inigo Montoya said these words: “I have been in the revenge business so long.
      Now that it’s over, I do not know what to do with the rest of my life.” And I
      ask Jews to consider what this man Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government
      is doing to the Jewish people all over the world. They are endangering not only
      the State of Israel, which I care deeply about and want to exist, but endangering
      the Jewish population all over the world. DAVID MARCHESE (CLIP 1) : And endangering
      the Jews by endangering those in Gaza. MANDY PATINKIN (CLIP 1) : To watch what
      is happening, for the Jewish people to allow this to happen to children and civilians
      of all ages in Gaza, for whatever reason, is unconscionable and unthinkable. And
      I ask you Jews, everywhere, all over the world, to spend some time alone and think,
      Is this acceptable and sustainable? How could it be done to you and your ancestors
      and you turn around and you do it to someone else? NIMA ALKHORSHID : I think that
      what’s going on is universal, with the case of Netanyahu. And I want to start
      with Michael’s take on what he said. MICHAEL HUDSON : About a month ago, Netanyahu
      said that the greatest enemies of Israel were the assimilationist Jews throughout
      the world. And he said, basically, that they are the critics of Israel. What Netanyahu
      was doing was backing the extreme right-wing Orthodox Jews who support him, against
      the old idea of cultural Zionism where Israel was depicted more or less as working
      on a kibbutz and being almost like a socialist economy instead of a racist genocidal
      economy. Regarding what Mandy Patinkin said, and it was a wonderful quote: in
      the recent New York City elections, as I think we’ve said, the largest group supporting
      Mamdani, the socialist candidate who was denouncing genocide, was the Jewish population.
      In other words, you have a reaction by the progressive Jewish population, in America
      and I think all over the world, who say “We’ve suffered enough from ethnic prejudice.
      We want to assimilate.” In the United States, you had Jewish representatives among
      the leaders of the support for the black movement in the 1960s, the 1970s. And
      this really is a decisive point. There’s no question [about what Mandy said].
      When Netanyahu and President Trump say “if you don’t support Israel, you’re an
      anti-Semite; if you don’t support genocide, you’re an anti-Semite; if you don’t
      believe it’s necessary to defend Israel by killing all the non-Israelis and exterminating
      them as a new Holocaust, you’re an anti-Semite”… Well, what are people to say?
      “Well, gee, I believe all these things. Does that make me an anti-Semite?” I think
      that’s what Mandy Patinkin was saying. Israeli behavior in the Near East is a
      crime against civilization. What they are doing breaks every international law,
      every element of what people think is a civilized society. Is it anti-Semitic
      to support civilization? This has created a split. President Trump says “we’re
      closing down Columbia University, because students at Columbia from the Israeli
      Defense Forces feel threatened by the fact that there are students saying genocide
      is bad.” These IDF students feel that if you say genocide is bad, you’re attacking
      Jews all over the world. The same statements are made by Merz in Germany, where
      any defense of the Palestinians in Gaza is banned. This is literally a dividing
      line. What side are you on, barbarism or civilization? And they’ve made it a Jewish
      issue. RICHARD WOLFF : Nationalism has been used for progressive purposes, and
      nationalism has been used for fascistic purposes and everything in between. Every
      time Mr. Trump does anything that he knows millions of Americans do not agree
      with, it is very important to label what he’s doing as American. And anybody who
      disagrees with him is literally un-American. For many decades, we had in the United
      States Congress an un-American activities committee whose job it was to ferret
      out people who disagreed with policies of the U.S. government and to declare them
      as enemies of the state, enemies of the culture, fundamentally “un-American” –
      then, at least partly on that basis, to imprison them, to deport them, and in
      the case of some of them, drive them to insanity and every other horror you can
      think of. That’s my first comment. Here’s my second. We have in the law the idea
      that if and only if you are immediately threatened with bodily harm, that you
      feel genuinely that your life is in danger, only then do you have anything remotely
      like the right to self-defense. Israeli bombing of citizens in Gaza who are not
      shooting at them, who have no means to shoot at them and have had no significant
      means for years, who are subject to mass slaughter – this cannot be justified
      by pointing out something that was done by a very small political group called
      Hamas two years ago. This violates, as Michael said, every basic notion of what
      is just, what is fair, what is allowable in the extreme case of feeling self-defense.
      What someone in October of 2023 did to a fellow citizen of yours is never, in
      any law that I know of that isn’t crazy, a justification for taking massive numbers
      of other people’s lives. During World War II, it was very frequent to denounce
      the Nazis when, having been attacked by some partisan group, they collected all
      of the adult citizens in a village and shot them. The notion was that we, the
      Germans, being put upon by some partisans, therefore have some right to mass slaughter
      of people who were not involved in that effort, who were not subjected to any
      legal procedure to link them. We are now celebrating people doing what not so
      long ago we decided was beyond the pale. I want to remind you: in the Nuremberg
      trials and their aftermath, the whole world sat in judgment for months, deliberating
      (in a way that the people they were judging never did), allowing witnesses, before
      it was decided that crimes had been committed – and there was specific reference
      to the mass killing of people who had not done anything. And those [criminals]
      were executed. The leaders e.g. Goering, Goebbels, the people they were able to
      catch, were executed by the West as a sign of the utter unacceptability of this
      behavior. And it is very close to what is going on in Israel. And I think for
      me, the worst of it is the use of nationalism. For an American audience, it is
      particularly important to understand how nationalism has been used as the cover
      for people with an agenda we ought to be horrified by and not allow them to use
      nationalism. And that’s really what this is. Mr. Netanyahu wants to equate the
      national notion he has of Israel with the obligation of every Jewish person around
      the world. That’s a ploy that is very common among nationalists. That’s how they
      recruit for and sustain their movements, by suggesting that you have to be like
      them if you’re going to wear the label – you know, French or Spanish or Jewish
      or anything else. We’ve gone through enough in the last 200 years. Two world wars
      with an awful lot of nationalism. Let me close with a story. When World War I
      broke out in 1914, the German parliament was roughly equally split, with the Socialist
      Party being by then the number two party in Germany controlling over 40% of the
      seats in the parliament. Kaiser Wilhelm (who was no longer Kaiser by the end of
      the war, but at the beginning of the war he was still Kaiser i.e. king of Germany),
      went on the radio and he said something that became very famous in German history.
      “Ich kenne keine Parteien mehr, ich kenne nur noch Deutsche.”  I do not recognize
      any parties anymore. I only recognize Germans. There it was. To mobilize the people
      to fight a world war (which Germany lost) he had to try to overcome what? The
      fact that the Socialist Party, at least on record, was against fighting a war
      and would have voted against funding it. To stop that, he had to make everybody
      into a loyal German. Let me remind everyone, not just outside of Israel, but a
      huge part of the Jewish population in Israel is against what is going on. They
      consider themselves Jews. That’s the part I’m talking about. They consider themselves
      Israelis, and they consider themselves patriotic Israelis. And in many ways, they
      are. But they are the sworn political enemies of Netanyahu and much, unfortunately
      not all, but much of what Netanyahu stands for- as you can see if you paid attention
      to Mr. Netanyahu’s failed efforts to transform the judiciary in Israel and his
      failed efforts to win a large part of the Jewish population. It is therefore doubly
      ironic that people who are critical of Mr. Netanyahu and of the war, have an easier
      time in Israel than they do in New York or Philadelphia or Los Angeles. And that’s
      because the anti-Semitic nonsense is a cover, not just for Mr. Netanyahu, but
      for Mr. Trump. The Republicans and Trump just voted to defund public radio and
      public television. That’s who they are. They don’t want public anything. They
      want everything to be handled either by the business community, that’s their first
      choice, or by the paid representatives, that’s the religious community. One or
      the other. They don’t want a government that is representative in any way of the
      mass of people. And they want to smash national public radio. They did it. They
      want to smash the universities that train people to think at least critically
      enough to be not amenable to MAGA mentality. The anti-Semitism is purely the thinnest
      of fig leaves covering a political agenda of the extreme right wing who see this
      moment as the first in a century and need to milk it for everything they can get
      before Mr. Trump is ushered out into the pantheon of horrible experiences right
      alongside of Joseph McCarthy. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Michael, before going to the next
      topic, do you want to add something? MICHAEL HUDSON : No, it’s just to point out
      that after all, it was the right-wing party in Israel that assassinated Prime
      Minister Rabin for trying to support peace. So, of course, they kill each other
      politically. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Michael, what has happened with the case of Ukraine?
      Europeans are trying to buy weapons. Donald Trump is bragging about selling more
      weapons to Europeans. These wealthy European countries are going to pay us [Americans]
      for the weapons. And we’re going to to benefit a lot from what’s going on in Ukraine.
      But they’re going to pay, they may send it to Ukraine. But when it comes to the
      economy of European countries, we know that France said they’re not going to pay
      for that. And it seems that mostly they’re going to put it on Germany. And I don’t
      know if the United Kingdom is willing to go in that direction. But considering
      the economy of Germany, how Merz can somehow convince the German people that they
      can pay for that? And nobody knows when they’re going to get these weapons, if
      they’re going to be used in Ukraine anytime soon, and the capability of the military-industrial
      complex of the United States to produce them as soon as possible. These are huge
      questions when it comes to the latest talks between Donald Trump and the NATO
      Secretary General Rutte. MICHAEL HUDSON : You’ve put in a nutshell just about
      everything that I would have said. The problem Trump is dealing with is America’s
      deindustrialization. How can you rebuild a trade surplus if you’ve deindustrialized?
      Well, as we discussed before, the only way to do this is to say, we’re not going
      to compete in automobiles or the usual industrial manufactured products. We’re
      going to deal with monopoly products that will enable us to charge much more for
      the exports than it actually costs to produce them. So we’re not only talking
      about normal profits for industry, which is unable to make a profit under Trump’s
      rules, but super profits which are monopoly rents. And arms, along with information
      technology, are one of the designated monopoly rent-yielding export markets. So
      Trump has said, we’re not going to give any more American arms directly to Ukraine.
      We’re going to say, Europe, it’s up to you to defend yourselves. You want to fight
      Ukraine and Russia? You want to carry the new Cold War costs in Western Europe
      to Russia? Be our guests, but you’ll buy your arms to fight Russia from us. You
      will pay full price, buy American arms, and then it’s up to you whether you want
      to use these directly to fight Russia or whether you want to donate them to Ukraine.
      But we’re not going to spend the American budget directly on supplying the Ukraine
      war anymore. That’s what he’s doing, and that’s a rational procedure. What you’re
      pointing out is what seems to be irrational at first sight. Why on earth would
      the Germans go along with it and change the rules of the European Union? There’s
      a rule against running a budget deficit of more than 3%, maybe more than 5%. We’re
      going to change these rules so that the European Union and Germany, its members,
      can spend much more, can create its own money to buy American arms to fight the
      war to attack Russia. It’s not a defensive war, it’s an attack war. How are we
      going to try to balance the budget? The increase in military spending is from
      the 2% under NATO that was set before Trump, to 5%. That’s an increase by 3% of
      GDP, but the entire economic growth of Europe is normally 3%. The entire economic
      growth each year is to go to providing military exports. And that can only be
      achieved by cutting back social spending, cutting back the subsidies on German
      residents to be able to pay for the gas and electricity to heat and power their
      homes now that they’ve stopped trade with Russia. The cutback in domestic spending,
      in addition to lower living standards, is going to lower GDP. So the increase
      in German spending on weapons, while the economy actually goes into negative GDP
      growth quarter after quarter, is going to be 10, 20, 30 times the GDP growth.
      The German economy is militarizing. Mr. Merz said, we’re going to make the Wehrmacht
      the power that it used to be. The power, obviously, under Adolf Hitler. No wonder
      President Putin and the rest of the world are saying, this is neo-Nazism. They
      don’t realize that World War II is over. They say, okay, let’s have a replay.
      Let’s do it all over again. That’s what it looks like. The German population,
      certainly according to all of the surveys, opposes Merz, opposes the Christian
      Democrats, opposes the war in Ukraine. It doesn’t matter. What the German people
      say doesn’t seem to have an effect on the German government or on the European
      Union, which has appointed the two super-hawks, Van der Leyen and the Estonian
      lady. I can’t believe that the point you’ve made will not split the European Union
      apart. RICHARD WOLFF : Let me approach it from a slightly different angle. Mr.
      Trump promised many times while he was campaigning that he could and would bring
      an end to the war in Ukraine. To this day, he refers to it as Biden’s war because
      he’s so eager not to be responsible. It’s a weak way of defending himself: here
      we are half a year since he’s been president and he’s not one iota closer to ending
      the war in Ukraine than he was when he took office. How do you fix, in the way
      American politics works, a screaming failure? Well, you pick on whatever aspect
      of it that you can find where you can do something to try to make it look like
      you’re doing what you’re supposed to. One of the reasons the Republican and right-wing
      and conservative parts of the United States were not happy with the Ukraine war
      was the point that Michael just made. Namely, it’s the old guns versus butter.
      It was costing a ton of money for the United States to support Ukraine financially,
      politically, and militarily. And that this was our money, tax money, and so that
      was part of the argument. So he can do something there. He can make the Europeans
      pay, so it isn’t we who pay. And he can get up and talk about “See? I got them
      to pay, we don’t pay” and hope that by talking about that, he can distract us
      from the fact that he didn’t promise to make them pay. He promised to bring the
      awful war to an end. Remember how many times he said to the consternation of the
      whole world that he wanted the war in Ukraine to end because, I quote him now,
      “people are dying over there”. And the whole world pointed out that more people
      are dying in Gaza than are dying in Ukraine. If dying is an issue, you’re not
      exactly consistent here. No, it made no difference. People are dying, and he’s
      going to bring it to an end. He’s not. And this week was the failure of failures.
      Every effort he tried: there will be no ceasefire until they do what Putin asked
      them to do. They [Russia] are not prepared to do that. So we don’t have a ceasefire.
      The war continues. What is he going to do? He promised to do what he cannot and
      will not do. How does he square that circle? By making an enormous issue about
      having the Europeans pay. And the Europeans, having not yet decided to make the
      break with the United States, mumble and bumble and fumble, and yes, we will.
      Whether they do or not, whether Mr. Merz can even stay in office – I should remind
      people, he didn’t win by a lot, this is no landslide or mandate-holder. This is
      a slim politician in a precarious situation. It’s very open how many dollars or
      euros will ever find their way into these programs. But for the sound bite, and
      to ease Mr. Trump’s political difficulties, Mr. Merz will go along because he
      wants Mr. Trump to help him in a variety of ways as well. This is an arrangement
      with lots of verbiage, lots of word salad to cover a temporary fix that solves
      absolutely nothing. MICHAEL HUDSON : Richard, I think we now know that Trump never
      intended the war to come to an end. He never said his aim was to increase the
      war, to upgrade it. What he meant when he said bring the fighting to an end is
      a ceasefire. And during that ceasefire, Europe and the United States was supposed
      to rearm Ukraine, as it did after the Minsk accords, to rearm and accelerate the
      fighting to help Ukraine fight against Russia all the more. And it was just a
      trick with words to say, I want to stop the fighting and end the war, when he
      really wanted to accelerate the war. I think the recent speeches of Foreign Secretary
      Lavrov and President Putin have acknowledged the fact that they now realize that
      all of this was just a trick by Trump to make them think that he wanted to end
      the war while actually pacifying them into stopping the fighting so that America
      could accelerate the war against them as a super hawk. And he’s gone beyond Biden’s
      war. He’s made it not only his war, but his war with an exclamation point. RICHARD
      WOLFF : I just want to acknowledge that that is possible. You know, the way diplomacy
      and the way the American government particularly works, all we ever do is guess.
      All you get from Michael and me are the best guesses we can make reading a ton
      of material and trying not to be too easily fooled. But so much information is
      withheld that it’s this endless politics of speculation. Look at all the stuff
      about Epstein. It’s the same thing. We don’t know tens of millions of pieces of
      information that might make it a bit easier to figure out what’s going on. We
      are denied that. And that’s very unhealthy and gives the people in charge a lot
      more freedom to fool around with us than we ought to allow if we took our commitment
      to democracy seriously. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Yeah Michael, the Epstein case that
      Donald Trump is somehow trying to dodge, but in the end, the MAGA movement is
      asking for more from Donald Trump. Why is he so hesitant when it comes to that
      case? MICHAEL HUDSON : Well, he’s more than hesitant. He’s disowned his own MAGA
      supporters. This was one of the big things that he had promised, especially to
      the QAnon conspiracy people. His supporters had said the U.S. government has been
      captured. It’s been captured not only by Trump Derangement Syndrome, but it’s
      been captured by the secrecy of the big state, not only in the JFK files that
      Trump had promised to release, but Trump had made a big case all along about the
      Epstein files. Again and again and again, he had mobilized his MAGA supporters
      by talking about the Epstein files. Why on earth would he make such a volte-face
      and all of a sudden call them the radical left, his own MAGA supporters on the
      radical right? It looks to me like he’s very frightened of something. I don’t
      think he’s frightened by the fact that Musk had accused that, well, Trump is in
      the Epstein files. A few days ago, there was testimony by a girl who was 14 years
      old at the time who described in 20 minutes the awful things that Trump did to
      her with Epstein. But I think there’s been enormous pressure brought on Trump
      to say something that is to try to misrepresent what the files were. I don’t think
      there was a file saying, here’s a file of people I blackmailed. He was doing it
      obviously for another party, and he didn’t need the file. What he had was exactly
      what Bondi, the attorney general, said she had on her desk. She said she had on
      her desk the pictures of all of these young girls. And she said, they’re really
      terrible pictures. To protect the girls, we don’t want to release these pictures.
      Well, you can always black out the pictures of the girls. The question is: who
      are the men with the girls? The men with the girls seem to include a lot of very
      powerful people who either are Donald Trump’s own donors or are powerful enough
      to bring pressure on him to make him so frightened of the thought of actually
      showing who the men were in these pictures that he’s caused a split among his
      own followers. There’s now a spreading distrust of him because of his denial that
      Epstein was involved in any kind of political context for all of this blackmail.
      Just simple blackmail. No, no, he liked young girls, but that was it. Nothing
      to see here. Nothing about Israel, nothing about the deep state, nothing about
      the CIA. The whole context for this is that politics in America for the last 50
      years is all about having blackmail files. In the 1960s, a number of groups said,
      Gee, Michael, you’re a very good speaker. Would you like to run for political
      office? And I asked some political insiders, what do you think of this suggestion?
      They said: Michael, don’t even try it. Nobody has anything on you. You’ve led
      a normal life. You’re happily married. You just do writing. They don’t have anything
      on you. Nobody can trust you because they don’t know what you’re going to say
      that may surprise them in a way that they don’t like. If you really want to run
      for office, you have to make sure they have enough on you, so that you can’t do
      anything to expose something they don’t want to expose. Well, just imagine President
      Clinton trying to run either for governor or more important for president. The
      Democratic Party had a meeting with them – I’m making up a fictional conversation
      – “Bill, you know, we want you to be president, but between you and Hillary, we
      don’t want to be surprised. We’re going to ask you to take a trip with Mr. Epstein.
      And the purpose of this trip is, we want you to get photographed. At least act
      as if you’re doing something that would be very embarrassing when it comes out.
      We’re not going to do anything with the photograph. We’re going to keep it in
      our files just in case you do something that we don’t like. In case you don’t
      support Alan Greenspan, and you don’t get rid of laws that Wall Street doesn’t
      want, etc etc.” Something like that. All of this back in the 60s and for many
      decades was only about U.S. politics. But now, with the Epstein affair, the individuals
      who were his main backers and funders and sponsors all seem to have had very strong
      connections to Israel, like Robert Maxwell himself. And so there’s a belief that
      what will be shown are not only individuals whose politics and statements have
      supported the right wing in America, the Democratic and Republican right-wing,
      but supported Israel too. That’s the whole suspicion of all of this. How else
      can you explain what’s happening and the pressure that obviously is being brought
      in on Trump? Who is bringing this pressure and why? That’s what his MAGA supporters
      are saying, and in fact, what the whole country is saying right now, judging from
      today’s newspapers. RICHARD WOLFF : If Mr. Trump has nothing to fear, as any junior
      prosecutor would say, and if he’s in charge, he can open up the files, and there
      it is, and he’s got nothing to worry about. He says he has nothing to worry about.
      Okay, then open the file! You’re the authority. And if you want to protect the
      young women that were abused, Michael is quite right: there are 50 different ways
      to do that. By the way, it might be that those women would like to have a chance
      to sue, to have a chance to reclaim a little bit of what was in effect taken from
      them by the experience, when they were young and needed money or whatever it is
      that brought them into that situation. He can do good by them, give them the option.
      If they wish to be anonymized, okay, then everything is cleansed up with them.
      But if he really wants there not to be the suspicion that he’s doing something
      stinky, well, he has the authority. It stops with him. He can order his attorney
      general or anybody else to open these files. And, I love the irony (I’m a bit
      of a Hegelian): There’s Mr. Big and Powerful. There he is working night and day
      to make us understand he rules the world. He can hit this country with a tariff.
      He can bomb over here. All the old dying empire’s efforts to keep its empire alive.
      And yet, when it comes to here, he has to deny himself his own power. He has to
      use his power and use it in a way that makes everyone think less of him, no matter
      what happens now, right? If Steve Bannon and all the others… Look at Mr. Johnson,
      the head of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives. He said he wanted
      the files released and literally minutes later voted against having them released.
      You know, this is the power turned in on itself and makes itself undone. It is
      the self-negation that Mr. Hegel talked to us about. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Michael,
      when it comes to the issue of competition between the United States and China,
      it seems that as time goes by, many people, even in the industry in the United
      States, who are not that much connected with the military-industrial complex or
      not that much gaining from endless wars, they’re somehow criticizing the way that
      the United States is dealing with Russia, with China, in terms of competition.
      Here is what the CEO of Ford Motors talked about. He was talking about the competition
      in the car industry between the United States and China. It’s somehow frightening,
      but here is what he said. JIM FARLEY (CLIP 2) : It’s the most humbling thing I’ve
      ever seen. 70% of all EVs in the world, electric vehicles, are made in China.
      They have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car.
      They have facial recognition. INTERVIEWER (CLIP 2) : Cell phone technology… is
      connected to their cell phones. JIM FARLEY (CLIP 2) : Yes, you get in, you don’t
      have to pair your phone. Automatically, your whole digital life is mirrored in
      the car. You have an AI companion, that you can talk to ChatGPT equivalent in
      China… all the automatic payment is already there. You can buy movie tickets.
      It has facial recognition, so it knows who’s in which seat and which media you
      like. INTERVIEWER (CLIP 2) : Why don’t Ford cars have that? Would you need to
      deal with Apple or Google? JIM FARLEY (CLIP 2) : Yeah, because Google and Apple
      decided not to go in the car business. And even beyond that, the cost, the quality
      of their vehicles is far superior to what I see in the West. I mean, we are in
      a global competition with China, and it’s not just EVs. And if we lose this, we
      do not have a future, Ford. NIMA ALKHORSHID : Go ahead, Michael. Your take on
      what’s going on with car production. MICHAEL HUDSON : For many decades now, it’s
      been not only the cost, it’s the design. The American car companies have made
      their recovery of profits basically on selling sports utility vehicles, the very
      large gas-guzzling cars. When Trump and his predecessors asked “why don’t you
      Japanese import more American cars?” The Japanese explained: Your cars are too
      big for our streets. They’re too big for our parking lots. They take up too much
      space. And they take up too much gas, and we have to import our gas. Our car buyers
      want to economize on their gas spending. They want to get a car that they can
      drive easily and park where they want. And they [the Japanese] like their own
      cars better because the Americans have not really aimed their design at what the
      world wants, but what they are advertising has been able to convince American
      buyers: if you want to be safe, buy a big sports utility vehicle with a high center
      of gravity that tends to tip over if you go fast around a curve, buy one of these…
      and also you’ll feel more powerful and it’s your identity. You can imagine what
      Trump’s threat of tariffs on Japan of 35%, maybe 50% even, (including cars) are
      going to do. Trump’s threat against Japan’s car exports and also those of South
      Korea are the largest attack on Japan since the Plaza Accords and the Louvre Accords
      that followed in the 1980s led to Japan’s lost decade of the 1990s. He’s trying
      to block Japanese and Korean exports to the United States, leaving Americans no
      choice but to buy [American] cars and, of course, no ability to buy the Chinese
      electric vehicles anymore, largely because of the American support of Musk’s company,
      made in America, employing American labor largely. Even so, here’s the problem
      with American car manufacturers. Trump has imposed tariffs on copper, steel, and
      aluminum. This is what cars are made out of. The car companies here have to pay
      much higher prices for copper and steel and aluminum – for the raw materials out
      of which cars are made – than foreign countries manufacturers have to pay. And
      American batteries are much more expensive than those that are designed to power
      the Chinese cars. So there’s no way in which American cars can compete either
      on price or in design. How on earth can this problem be cured without absolute
      control of foreign trade blocking Americans from buying these cars? And of course,
      given the role of automobiles in the American budget and the role of taking out
      an automobile loan to buy a car, paying a very high price given the high default
      rates on American automobile loans, is probably one of the major causes of the
      American price inflation that you have today. In sum, Trump’s moves against Japan
      are an attempt to protect an inefficient, uncompetitive automobile industry. Not
      to mention the Canadian and Mexican affiliates that are producing the parts that
      go into the cars are making. He’s tied the economic hands of car makers behind
      their backs. “We’re going to tax what you buy, the parts for your cars from Mexico
      and Canada, and we’re going to increase the cost of raw materials to make the
      cars. And we’re not going to let you buy the batteries to power them.” You can
      imagine how self-destructive this policy is, and I don’t see how it can last.
      RICHARD WOLFF : Yeah, let’s do a very quick economics of why it can’t last. When
      you protect the American economy from the Chinese, whether you use the electric
      vehicles or you use solar panels or you use advanced AI equipment and so on, it’s
      always the same story. You protect it here by excluding the Chinese. What does
      that mean? It means that where the Chinese have broken into the American market,
      it is because they produce either a better quality or offer a lower price or both.
      That’s it. There’s no magic. No one’s holding a gun to anybody’s head. That’s
      how and why, you know, the toaster you have at home is made in China and on and
      on and on. Because that’s a cheaper, better toaster than anybody else makes, which
      is why Walmart or Target or any of the others has it for sale. Now let’s follow
      the economics. If you exclude that, you make Americans buy poorer quality or pay
      a higher price. That’s not good. That’s bad for the consumer, but no one really
      cares about them except in words. Let’s turn next to American businesses, or for
      that matter, to any businesses operating here in America. They have to buy inputs,
      you know, raw materials, machines, parts, whatever it is. And where are they going
      to buy them from? They’re not going to get the good, cheap ones from abroad because
      the government of the United States has put a tariff. That’s the point of the
      tariff. So the American business will not be able to buy its raw material or its
      parts or its inputs. It will not be able to buy from China because we’re in this
      competition, which means it can’t get the cheapest or the best quality. But of
      course, the competitors of the United States located in Canada or Mexico or anywhere
      else in the world are able to go to China and are able to buy at the lower price
      the better quality. So over time, America is shooting itself in the foot competitively.
      It’s losing and not by the hand of anybody else, but by its own. It is following
      a policy that may be good for the posturing of Mr. Trump. “I’m bringing industry
      back.” No, you aren’t. The industries aren’t coming, and they’re not coming because
      of what I just said: namely, in the long run, it makes no sense to come back here
      because you’ll have to not be able to buy the cheapest input or the highest quality.
      Why would you move to a country which promises you competitive disadvantages?
      That’s why American companies went abroad in the first place because it was more
      profitable. You are giving them a reason not to come back. Why this is so difficult,
      I assume, is not because the idea is complex (it isn’t) but because of the noise
      from the Trump administration, sadly not contradicted by the vast majority of
      Democrats and their spokespersons. So it is allowed to give this man, Trump, the
      opportunity to posture as if he was doing good for the American economy. He isn’t.
      It may be bad in any case. I’m not blaming him for it. But what he’s doing is
      really nonsensical self-promotion and making the problem worse. MICHAEL HUDSON
      : Well, only one technical question, Richard. How can you shoot yourself in the
      foot if you first shot yourself in the brain? It doesn’t work that way. RICHARD
      WOLFF : I mean, it’s not, this is not complicated. There are things in economics
      that are complicated. This isn’t one of them. It’s really sad. It’s almost as
      if we had a person who was president who said, I’m going to solve our economic
      problems. I’m going to erect a six-foot-tall tower and I’m going to hang yellow
      streamers and I’m going to have an enormous amount of whipped cream put on top.
      And we would listen to such a person and we would all shake our heads. How demented,
      how sad for him to imagine that a real problem, the declining American economic
      system, could be managed by this fantasy. Well, I got to tell you, with all my
      fancy economic degrees, I’m looking at a program that’s ridiculous. MICHAEL HUDSON
      : I wonder how this will affect the negotiations between the United States and
      Europe right now. Because European companies also not only wanted to export cars
      to the United States, as did South Africa that has heavy tariffs, but Trump is
      pressing them to set up American production plants, as many German car companies
      have done. But if they set up an auto production plant in America, how can they
      make a profit given what we’ve just discussed about their increased costs? This
      action and the tariff policy by Trump is essentially splitting the American economy
      off from the rest of the world and isolating it, as we’ve discussed before. RICHARD
      WOLFF : Yeah. And if you look, Nima’s choice of that clip is very, very smart,
      right? To have the Ford family, which is really the family out of which the American
      car industry grew, right? Henry Ford, way back when, at the beginning of the 20th
      century, creates the assembly line and makes it possible to mass produce this
      odd thing, a self-driving automobile instead of a horse and a carriage. Here you
      have the latest generation, a young man who you would expect, if he were like
      Trump, would be beating the drum of nationalism, is answering an honest question
      by saying, you know, we don’t produce the best cars. We don’t have the best technology.
      We can’t compete. I mean, after you listen to him describe what the Chinese car
      on the average can do… I know enough about American cars. They can’t do those
      things. And they’re more expensive. And we are completely lost in the electric
      vehicle market. Wow. From the mouth of Mr. Ford. You know what that suggests to
      me as an observer? That the car industry in this country is finished. Cars, whatever
      their role in the world economy in the years ahead, are going to be made much
      better elsewhere. Maybe the image of the United States is that we’re so important,
      even though we are, let me remind everyone, four and a half percent of the world’s
      people live in the United States. Four and a half, we’re going to have an economy
      all by ourselves. You know what that means? We’re going to be the oddity that
      now you can see on television when a camera crew goes deep into the Amazonian
      jungle or deep somewhere else and discovers a community that has been living the
      same way for 5,000 years. We’re going to be one of those. The rest of the world
      is going to send tourists here. That’ll be our new economic boom, the tourism
      to look at, look at these ancient automobiles these people still have. You know,
      I’m not being facetious. That’s where we’re going with this policy. MICHAEL HUDSON
      : Well, so much for the materialist approach to foreign policy, thinking that
      nations are going to act in their own self-interest. RICHARD WOLFF : Well, you
      know, “what your self-interest is” has never been uniformly or universally agreed.
      The sentence, if you think about Hegel, takes you in all the different directions.
      The tragedy of Europe is somehow even more poignant for me than the American.
      To be transparent, I was born and lived all my life in the United States, but
      my parents were refugees. They came from Europe. And so I straddle in the sense
      that my parents are European and I’m an American and I have children and they’re
      American and all that. But Europe was once the center of the known world because
      it did the knowing and it was the center. And, you know, it carved up the whole
      world. I remember once studying the meetings in Berlin in 1884 where all the European
      countries had a big map of Africa and made lines with markers. You get this, I
      get that, having nothing to do with the billion people that lived in Africa at
      the time. Extraordinary, really extraordinary. It’s all gone. They can’t unify,
      so they don’t even have the power that a unified unit might have. So they don’t
      even have that. They’re pinched by the Chinese and Russians on one end, by the
      Americans on the other. Israel and Gaza stand out as the final desperate attempt
      to hold on to the colonial idea project. Look at the price being paid. The lesson
      to the world: if you ever wanted an example of why you should get rid of colonialism,
      it’s here. So the Europeans, they face nothing but defeat after defeat after defeat.
      And you know, they deny it and they pretend otherwise. You know, when the Queen
      of England dies and a new king [is enthroned], they actually act as if anybody
      cared, as if the world would be interested in the cortege that takes the Queen
      to her final resting place. This is a theater piece for ancient times, held on
      to by people who have nothing else. The catastrophe here is real. And I understand
      the danger. Societies traumatized by anything can behave in a horrible way. The
      German working class, as I’ve tried to write recently, was traumatized. It was
      led to believe in the 19th century that it was going to inherit the world, that
      the British Empire was fading, and Deutsche Reich, the German Empire, would replace
      it. And they were led to believe it. And German economic development in the 19th
      century was like America. Those were the two up-and-coming contenders to replace
      the British Empire. Then, in a very short time, the German working class was destroyed
      by being defeated in World War I. Four years, five years later, they had the worst
      inflation in modern history, wiped out their savings. And four years after that,
      the Great Depression of 1929 hit. In a short period, they were traumatized by
      three totally destructive events. No wonder they went for Adolf Hitler. That’s
      what happens if you are traumatized. Look what happened to people in Cambodia
      after the United States bombed them forever. They went to Pol Pot, and what was
      that? You traumatize a population. Too many defeats, too many declines, too much
      absence of any change, and you can get very bizarre activity. And part of the
      bizarreness of the Trump government is that. Photo by Pawel Czerwinski on Unsplash

    paragraph_summary: In a recent interview with the New York Times, Mandy Patinkin
      and Kathryn Grody expressed their concerns about the impact of Israeli Prime Minister
      Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on Jewish identity and global antisemitism. Grody
      criticized the misuse of antisemitism accusations against those who critique Israeli
      policies, asserting that compassion for Palestinians in Gaza aligns with Jewish
      values. Both artists conveyed their distress over the current political climate,
      suggesting that Netanyahu's actions not only threaten the State of Israel but
      also jeopardize the safety and perception of Jewish people worldwide. Patinkin
      invoked a poignant moment from "The Princess Bride" to emphasize the need for
      reflection among Jews regarding the implications of their leadership's decisions.

    text: '07.17.2025 – Glenn Diesen GLENN DIESEN : We are joined today by Professor
      Michael Hudson, world-famous and best-selling economist. So welcome back to the
      program. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, thanks for having me back, Glenn. GLENN DIESEN
      : So recently, the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, explained that the post-war
      global order is not just obsolete, it is now being used against us. And it is…
      MICHAEL HUDSON: That’s what it means, obsolete. It’s working just the way it was
      supposed to, but America’s no longer the beneficiary. GLENN DIESEN : Oh, exactly.
      And for me, I thought a bit about what was previously referred to as the free-trade
      empire. If you are in the hegemonic position, often this system can work to your
      advantage. If it’s not, free- trade is expected to be replaced with what can be
      called fair-trade. But it is interesting about the post-war global order because
      there is a, I guess, growing sentiment that the post-World War II economic order
      has indeed come to an end. And the U.S. is therefore pursuing its own alternative.
      It’s unclear, in more precise terms, what this exactly entails. While at the other
      end, we’re developing also on the other side BRICS as an alternative to transition
      away from the seemingly failed or post-World War II economic order that has ended.
      So it might be an oversimplification, but there seems to be at least these two
      different pathways. So I really want to explore with you what both the United
      States and BRICS envision to replace this post-World War II era with. And indeed,
      you wrote or sent me recently a chapter on this, and you referred to a similar
      problem as civilizational conflict. I was wondering if you can flesh out this
      idea. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, by civilizational conflict, I mean the way in which
      society and the economy are going to be organized. And you began your question
      with the 1944-1945 post-war order. And the United States at Bretton Woods designed
      the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the British loan and British
      diplomacy as a means of absorbing the British Empire and later the rest of the
      European former empires into the United States sphere of influence. So the rules-based
      order that the United States created were rules that favored the United States.
      And the origins of this, to really understand the split in the kind of world that
      the Western industrial economies have relative to the 85% of the world majority,
      this goes back really two centuries to the very takeoff of industrial capitalism
      in Britain, France, Germany, and later the United States. And I think in many
      ways, you can say that the takeoff of industrial capitalism was revolutionary
      for the countries that were industrializing. And it was revolutionary because
      the basic principle of industrial capitalism was to lower the cost of production
      so that industrialists in Britain and other countries could undersell competitors
      abroad. And how did you undersell them? Well, there were three ways. The first
      way was to get rid of the carryover from feudalism, the landed aristocracy that
      controlled parliaments with the aim of increasing their land rents and with their
      land rents, the price of food. And the industrialists by 1815, led by David Ricardo,
      the banker, said, well, Britain cannot compete with other countries if we have
      to pay our wage labor so much that it pays exorbitant agricultural rents to the
      landlord class, which had imposed the Corn Laws, the agricultural tariffs in 1815
      to block foreign imports. Ricardo said the first precondition of having an industrial
      country overtake and out-compete its competitors is to minimize the cost of living
      for the labor that it employs. And that means we need free trade in grain and
      food and raw materials so we can import them from abroad. And that entails freeing
      the economy from economic rent. Rent is the increase in price, the excess of price
      over the actual cost value. And Ricardo and the whole school of classical political
      economy aimed at keeping prices in the economy in line with the actual cost of
      production and getting rid of all of the special privileges. The first privilege
      was that of land rent, as I mentioned. The second privilege was monopoly privileges.
      From the 14th to the 18th century, Europe’s kings had needed to increase taxes
      to pay their bankers to lend them the money to go to war with each other. And
      the parliaments of Britain and other countries obviously opposed paying taxes,
      especially during the Crusades when they opposed the kings of England imposing
      taxes to pay the bankers to fight wars on behalf of Rome in its sort of internecine
      fights with Germany and countries that didn’t accept Roman domination. So the
      bankers helped the kings in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries organize trade
      monopolies. You don’t need parliamentary approval to make a trade monopoly. And
      that will yield money. And you, the king, as recipient of these monopolies, can
      pay us, the bankers . So the industrial capitalists of England said, we have to
      get rid of these monopolies. Let’s have a free market free of economic rent, free
      from land rent, free from monopoly rent. And the third thing they needed was:
      we have to take the financial class in general. We have to bring it into the industrial
      capitalist order. The role of bankers should be to make productive loans to finance
      capital formation . And banks in England and other countries had not been lending
      to finance industrial capital formation. They didn’t lend to the inventors of
      the steam engine and James Watt, I think, had to mortgage the land to borrow to
      get money to invest in his innovations. So these three forms, land rent, monopoly
      rent, and interest, which is a form of monopoly rent, had to be freed. And that
      was really the task of classical economics in the 19th century was to create that
      streamlined market free of all the costs that were not really costs of production,
      but were costs of the privileges inherited from the medieval period. Well, things
      were very different in the rest of the world. England took 30 years to get rid
      of the Corn Laws, which it did in 1846, and that committed Britain to free trade
      with other countries. And the British strategists and diplomats went to other
      countries and said, we’ll give you access to the British market. You can buy your
      manufactures from Britain much cheaper than you can make them yourself. We’ll
      buy raw materials from you, your food, your minerals, others, and it’ll be a happy
      exchange. Well, they convinced America, at least the southern states of America,
      not the northern states, and they convinced most of the world to agree to this
      specialization of production between the industrial capitalist countries on the
      one hand and the raw materials producers, host economies on the other. Well, what
      happened was that the industrial countries ran trade surpluses, went far ahead.
      They bought low-priced raw materials, they worked them up into manufactures, and
      they sold them at a profit. And together, the European countries and later the
      United States had a monopoly in industrial products. Well, the problem is that
      the rest of the world producing raw materials ran trade deficits. And to make
      matters even worse, beginning in the 1820s, the newly independent former colonies
      from Haiti in the Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil, and then the Ottoman colonies, Greece,
      Egypt, and Tunisia, all won their independence, but they had to borrow money from
      creditors in order to remake the economy and to begin to develop their own industry
      and their self-sufficiency. Well, almost immediately, every country that borrowed
      defaulted. And by the end of the 19th century, the debts had grown and the defaults
      had mounted up so that the creditor countries were able to appoint central banks
      or national monetary commissions to manage the fiscal policy of these countries
      that had won their development. And of course, in the colonies, you had Britain
      and Germany and France, the colonizing powers running things. And the industrial
      countries used their trade surpluses to invest in the raw materials producers.
      They invested in railroads and communications. They bought out public infrastructure
      monopolies. They especially bought land and plantations and natural resource rights,
      forests, minerals for themselves. And the result is that all of these rent-yielding
      resources that the classical economists said should be the natural tax base were
      not the tax base. They were the equivalent of feudalism as a burden to the raw
      materials exporters. And in the sense that here you had the governments and the
      domestic economy having to pay heavy rent or land rent, natural resource rent,
      which is a kind of land rent, monopoly rent, and financial debt service, all to
      the creditor countries. So the fight that had been against feudalism in Britain
      and France and Germany for the rest of the world, for the global majority, was
      a fight against foreign rentier interests, not only their own rentier interests.
      And this created a kind of dual economy, as it came to be called. And by the 1950s,
      for instance, Latin America, Africa, much of Asia were called developing countries,
      but they were not developing in the way that the European industrial nations developed.
      They were not developing free of economic rent, but as a subject to economic rent.​
      Their governments did not have enough domestic tax returns to be able to make
      the public infrastructure spending and subsidy of industry that was absolutely
      critical to Britain, France, and Germany and the United States that had a mixed
      economy. Because in these industrial countries, industrial capitalism was evolving
      into industrial socialism. It was a mixed economy in all of these countries because
      the industrial class said, well, apart from feeding our wage earners at lower
      priced food that we import, we’re going to minimize their cost of living by providing
      basic needs, basic services, education, health care, transportation, natural monopolies
      at minimum cost prices or at subsidized prices or even freely for education so
      that we’re going to make our European economies and later the U.S. economy the
      lowest cost economies in the world so that we can out-compete any potential competition
      from North America, South America, the global south basically. And that was a
      situation that existed right through World War II. Well, during World War II,
      many of these raw materials exporters actually had accumulated large amounts of
      their own foreign reserves by selling minerals and oil and other inputs to the
      fighters in World War II. And they emerged in 1945 in a very strong position.
      Well, at that point, the United States imposed its IMF rules and the World Bank
      rules. And these claimed to have a doctrine of economic development that would
      help these countries develop. It actually prevented them from developing. And
      so instead of being developing countries, they were warped into dependency countries,
      not developing countries, but host economies in the sense of host to, you could
      even call it a parasite. And the World Bank, for instance, would make loans to
      global south countries, not for their own food production, to make themselves
      supply their own food so they didn’t have to import it, but only to export plantation
      crops and to pick up all of the infrastructure costs, the port costs, and the
      transportation to export their raw materials. They fought against land reform
      and any attempt to produce food that would have rivaled the market and displaced
      American farmers and farm exports. And the same thing happened after the common
      market was formed with its Common Agricultural Policy, which also had very heavy
      government supports, price supports, suspension of free trade in order to support
      a farm investment that vastly increased European farm productivity, just as President
      Roosevelt’s Agricultural Adjustment Act in the United States in the 1930s increased
      American agricultural productivity by being very protectionist. Nothing like this
      occurred in countries that were clients of the World Bank. Well, pretty soon these
      countries lapsed back into the condition that they’d been in since the 19th century.
      They ran trade deficits. They had to borrow money. That meant they ran into debt.
      And at that point, the International Monetary Fund came in, and it said the only
      way you can get rich is by impoverishing yourself. This is a theory that David
      Ricardo had developed, the spokesman of bankers for the Bullion Committee in 1809-1810
      in Britain. They said, well, why don’t you get rich in the way that Britain and
      Europe got rich, lower the wage cost. But they didn’t lower the wage cost by lowering
      the cost of living. They lowered it by preventing labor unions by just lowering
      wages and not providing any of the social support for wages that Europe had, and
      basically imposing austerity programs that had one purpose: to prevent governments
      from having the money to invest in subsidizing their industry and agriculture
      to be independent of the European countries. So basically, these were anti-development
      corporations, institutions. The World Bank published a report under McNamara,
      Partners in Development , but it was really Partners in Dependency, Partners in
      Underdevelopment, because it was all based on the diametric opposite principles
      of classical economics and the way that the European countries had developed by
      raising living standards. The World Bank and the IMF aimed at lowering living
      standards, claiming that this would make them more competitive. But this ignored
      the fact that the American economists pointed out that high-wage labor was so
      much more productive than low-wage pauper labor that it paid for itself. So you
      had Western European and North American labor, high productivity, supported by
      heavy government subsidies and provision of basic needs, and unproductive labor
      that did not have any government or social support in the global south countries.
      And that’s the problem that has led to today’s problem, the crisis, which has
      now, this year coming to a head. And it’s come to a head for two reasons. The
      most obvious reason is the tariff policy that’s imposed by Donald Trump prevents
      other countries, especially the global south countries, from earning the money,
      the dollars, to pay their debts by exporting to the United States market. Now,
      if their debts are denominated in dollars, and the only way they can earn dollars
      is by exporting to the U.S. or Europe, and they’re blocked from doing this, how
      can they pay? The only way for the last 50 years they’ve been able to pay is by
      being forced to sell off and privatize even more of their natural resources, their
      mineral rights, sew off their monopolies, essentially Thatcherize their economy.
      And Thatcherizing their economy has been just as devastating to the global south
      countries as it was to Britain. That’s the crisis. The second crisis is the fact
      that for the first time, the global south countries and Asia and the BRICS countries
      as a whole have an alternative to avoid the dependency trap that they’ve been
      caught in since 1945. And that’s largely because of China. Ever since the Bandung
      Conference in 1955 in Indonesia, countries, the non-aligned countries, got together
      and said, we’ve got to have an alternative to the U.S. and European-designed economic
      order that is not in our interest. But they couldn’t go it alone. They were just
      individuals, and the United States and Britain and Europe were able to divide
      and conquer them to regime change, to basically overthrow governments that were
      not U.S. friendly. And the result was this dual economy structure that you would
      have. Well, they’re stuck with Thatcherized economies with not being able to have
      the fiscal resources that Europe developed with. They don’t have sovereignty to
      impose their own rent tax on land, natural resources, and to create their own
      monetary systems that would finance their own industry. China did that, but it
      took a revolution in 1945 under Mao, just as in Russia, it took a revolution that
      got rid of the landlord class and the financial class. And the question is: how
      are the BRICS countries going to emulate the Chinese industrial capitalist model
      or the industrial socialist model with Chinese characteristics? The Chinese characteristics
      being those of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Marx, the whole classical economic
      school that developed the whole idea of freeing industrial economies from economic
      rent, from special privilege, and making them efficient industrial economies.
      That’s the crisis. And the fact that these countries are now able to have an alternative
      model is what the Americans claim is a clash in civilization. And it’s really
      not a clash of civilization. It’s a fight against the attempt by the global south
      and BRICS and global majority to follow the same path of civilization that industrial
      capitalism began to develop in the 19th century and that the classical economic
      ideology was all about. GLENN DIESEN : If we relate this back to the statement
      by Marco Rubio that the post-war global order is now used against us, is this
      then a reference to the rentier system, the idea that the currency, technologies,
      banking system, all these finances, all these things offered by the United States,
      which it extracts rent from, in other words, money without contributing to the
      productive process, is this eliminating America in this role? Is this what Rubio
      is referring to when he says that the system is being used against us? Or is it
      just the general trade rules? How can we interpret the statement of Rubio? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, it’s not the system that’s changed. It’s the United States and the
      European economies that have changed. What began as industrial capitalism under
      the classical economics of freeing economies from rent didn’t really win the fight
      by the 20th century. The rentier interests fought back, and you had a replacement
      of classical value, price, and rent theory with an idea that, well: price equals
      value. There’s no such thing as economic rent. Everybody earns whatever they can
      get, whether it’s landlords earn all the rent they can take, the banks earn whatever
      they charge, including late fees. All of these are counted in GDP today. If you
      look at the GDP of America and Europe, you have most of it being rentier charges,
      monopoly rents, but especially interest charges, financial charges, real estate,
      land rent. Banks have lent more and more credit relative to the price of the buyers
      on mortgage, more and more of the housing costs in America and Europe are paid
      to the banks. So there’s still economic rent in the U.S. and the European economies,
      but the recipients are no longer the feudal landlord class. They’re the banking
      class. And you’ve had the bank class become the main rentier, not the landlords
      and not the monopolists, but the banking class has been the mother of monopoly,
      the mother of trusts, organizing them, and then lending buyers and organizers
      of trusts and corporate takeovers the money to create monopolies and pay out the
      monopoly rents as interest. So, what began as industrial capitalism that made
      the United States and the European economies so wealthy and so productive has
      ended up being parasitized by turning into finance capitalism. That’s the central
      thesis of almost all of the books and all of the articles that I’ve read. And
      so, it’s the United States that has lost its industrial power by deciding we’re
      going to deindustrialize. We’re going to essentially put the class where we’re
      back in business under President Clinton in the 1990s by, let’s shift our industrial
      production out of the United States to the foreign affiliates of multinational
      corporations. Let’s let foreign labor do the work, and then that will prevent
      American labor from unionizing and raising its wages because we’re replacing it
      with immigrant labor or with Mexican and Canadian labor at first, and then with
      Chinese and other foreign labor. So, the United States took a decision to literally
      deindustrialize. And this deindustrialization has become financialization as well.
      So, you’ve replaced an industrial economy with a bank-centered, Wall Street-centered
      financial economy whose central planning has shifted from governments to the financial
      centers in New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo. And the economic development
      of the 15% global garden and its allies basically have stopped developing and
      have sort of lapsed into the same kind of rentier economy that the whole fight
      to create industrial power in the 19th century was fought against. Well, that’s
      led the United States all of a sudden to find: well, we can’t afford to create
      our own industrial self-sufficiency anymore. So, how are we going to compete?
      Well, President Trump says there are two ways we can compete: We can either force
      other countries to pay us tribute by creating an empire, or we can make monopoly
      rent and financial rent. We can make monopoly rent by monopolizing the new technology
      and information technology, computer chip technology, and especially military
      technology. We’ll tell Europe: increase your military spending from 1.5% of GDP
      to 5%, but you have to buy all your military goods from the United States . And
      that will provide, that will help us balance our international trade and finance
      our budget deficit at the same time. And you also have to remain in the dollar
      system so that whatever surplus that foreign countries are able to save out of
      their trade surplus or investment surplus or domestic earnings, all their monetary
      savings have to be invested in U.S. Treasury securities or other U.S. securities
      in the dollar area. And so the wealth and accumulation of all the world is to
      be sent to the United States. And Trump says he’s going to impose 100%, maybe
      500% tariffs on countries that try to use their income and their trade surpluses
      and their tax surpluses to develop their own economy rather than subsidize the
      United States economy. So this is a war of the United States, not only against
      the global majority, but especially against its own allies in Europe and also
      in Japan and South Korea. As you’ve just seen, America’s moves against Japan to
      end its ability to sell its automobiles in the United States. Same thing with
      Korea, the inability to sell their industrial products here. It’s a declaration
      of economic war against these other countries. And the U.S. diplomacy has sort
      of fixed the outcome by its political interference and regime change pressure
      and the non-government organizations that have provided a huge source of funding
      to promote individual opportunists as politicians or industrial leaders who are
      favorable to the United States and owe their loyalty really to the United States
      or United States companies like I suppose you’d say Merz in Germany. So you have
      European political leaders supporting policies that add to the United States domination
      of Europe. Well, the voters of these European countries do not support this. The
      voters of Germany, France, and other countries are voting against spending their
      money on the war in Ukraine, against fighting against Russia. They want to be
      able to buy in the cheapest market, just like England wanted to buy in the cheapest
      market back in 1815. But they’re blocked. Instead of buying inexpensive Russian
      oil and gas, they’re supposed to buy American liquefied natural gas at four or
      five times the price as you and I have spoken about before. So Europe has been
      turned into a dependency, and the United States is trying to achieve that same
      hegemony globally over the BRICS and global south countries. Well, the problem
      is that the BRICS and global south countries themselves not only have governments
      that are very largely supported by the United States, for instance, the African
      representatives to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are thoroughly
      neoliberal. So their managerial class has been educated in the United States or
      Britain in neoliberal Thatcherite or similar U.S. laws. They’re not even familiar
      with the policy debates that underlay the emergence of industrial capitalism that
      made Europe so successful originally. So they don’t have a model. The only model
      that they have is that of China, which independently has reinvented the wheel,
      the same wheel that Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and the British economists
      and their other classical economists developed of a mixed economy where the government
      is in control of its own money creation and the allocation of money. So you will
      have, for instance, China doing what any country that’s trying to develop and
      being competitive should do. You create money and credit to finance tangible capital
      formation. Not only private capital formation and innovation, but basic infrastructure
      like high-speed railways, port development, or the Belt and Road Initiative that
      China is trying to make in order to create a structure of international trade
      and investment that will make Asia independent of the United States. And Russia’s
      President Putin had said, this is really what the fight is all about. The fight
      is to make other countries sovereign nations in charge of their own fiscal policy
      and investment policy and government policy. But they can’t be independent unless
      they tax away the resource rent from their now foreign-owned companies produced
      by oil, raw materials production, mineral production, forests. Essentially, nationalize
      the monopolies and make them public monopolies, not foreign-owned rentier monopolies.
      They have to de-rentiize their economy. That’s their policy. Well, they don’t
      really have to nationalize these foreign-owned oil and mineral companies. They
      simply have to tax the economic rent. And as sovereign countries, they should
      be able to tax the economic rent. But this is treated as a civilizational conflict,
      as an attack on Western civilization and democracy itself, where actually it’s
      an expression of democracy, an expression of their own domestic national sovereignty.
      So this is the fight they have. But their own ruling class, their own political
      class, and the wealthiest class that they have are themselves rentiers and are
      part of the rentier economy. A huge amount of Argentina’s and Brazil’s foreign
      debt is owned by Argentinians and Brazilians because they know that they’re the
      upper classes and they know that the government is going to pay the dollar debt
      to themselves and not default on it. So you have a class conflict within the BRICS
      countries themselves, very similar, but with key differences to the class conflict
      between labor and capital in the West. That’s a complicating factor in all this.
      And the question is: how are you going to get the BRICS countries and other countries
      to pursue the same kind of economic reform that China has done so efficiently
      without having an actual revolution because the United States has said, if you
      try to make a reform, we’re going to do to you what we did to Venezuela, what
      we did to Iran, what we did to Libya, what we did to Chile. We’re going to overthrow
      you. We don’t want to reform. We’re trying to keep Western power in control. And
      President Putin gave another speech just a week ago saying, you know, all along,
      we thought since the 1990s that the anti-Russian feeling that Europe and the United
      States had really was ideological. That it was a fight between capitalism and
      Soviet ideology. And it turns out that certainly that was an element, but they
      really were just anti-Russian. They wanted to conquer us. They wanted to break
      us up into five different countries or six countries and divide and conquer us
      and make us their colonies. That it really is all about an attempt by the United
      States and Europe to control the world, just as under industrial capitalism they
      tried to control the world by industrial power and productivity and controlling
      the rentier surpluses, financial surpluses, rent surpluses of raw materials exporters,
      that it turns out to be just a raw power grab. And that’s what it’s turned into
      today. GLENN DIESEN : So you have then the split between the more financialized
      economies of the West versus the more aspiring, at least industrial capitalist
      economies of BRICS. So I guess what frustrates me with Europe a lot is the reluctance
      to accept that they’ve gone from being the subject to the object, the reluctance
      to see that the Europeans are the one now being cannibalized by their American
      partners because I think the political leadership sees the future of Europe, its
      greatness or relevance, to be tied up with this transatlantic partnership, while
      at the same time there is some recognition that they’re being cannibalized by
      the Americans. So you end up with politicians such as Macron of France who pivots
      back and forth between, you know, we can’t allow ourselves to be vassals of America
      , and the next day it’s, we have to have solidarity with the US in order to preserve
      the West. So it’s very, they want to be in the political West, but they’re very
      uncomfortable or reject the acknowledgement that they have now become an object
      effectively. But what can BRICS do now, though, in terms of providing an alternative?
      Because the monopolistic system you present as the option of the United States,
      it doesn’t seem like a very stable or even sustainable option. It seems very extractive,
      disruptive, chaotic, and doomed for failure down the road. So what, in your opinion,
      should BRICS be striving for then? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, let me talk about Europe
      first. People like Macron and his counterparts in England, Starmer, and Germany,
      Merz, they’re demagogues. They see on the one hand that the population of Europe
      wants prosperity. They don’t want the budget to be limited in money creation and
      running a deficit. They want the government to run deficits to spend on social
      spending, especially to support living standards or at least to prevent the disaster
      of living standards that have been caused by breaking energy trade with Russia.
      So, what the voters want is one thing, but the leaders are not responsive to the
      voters. They’re just like Donald Trump here. They are serving their basically
      American sponsors. And the problem is, I guess, for Europe, the whole way in which
      the European Union is structured to guarantee failure. The European Union is run
      by NATO. Its foreign policy heads are military hawks whose only interest is basically
      willing to impoverish the European economies in order to fight Russia and try
      to train it in this mythical hope that somehow, if they drain Russia enough, Russia
      will be unable to fight the war in Ukraine, against Europe and America any longer.
      And there will be a regime change. The Europeans and Americans can come up in
      and carve up Russia as they began to do under Yeltsin in the 1990s. European voters
      do not have a role to play in European politics under a condition where Europe
      is part of NATO and where its countries are prevented from doing what any sovereign
      country should do, creating its own money to fund its own spending, to subsidize
      its industry and rising living standards. The European Union’s monetary policy
      was created to prevent running a budget deficit in a Keynesian type economic stimulus.
      So as long as European policy is run from a basement office in the Pentagon saying,
      well, you have to bankrupt your industry by not importing Russian energy anymore.
      You can move your industrial companies to America, maybe bring your skilled labor
      here too, but you’re going to have to sacrifice in order to defend democracy,
      democracy like Zelensky has imposed in Ukraine, the American model of democracy.
      I mean, this is a travesty. And this blocks Europe from saying, well, we really,
      we’re not going to be part of an island off the coast of Rhode Island. We’re going
      to be part of Asia. That’s our natural trade partner. You know, the whole German
      prosperity came from an integration of trade and investment with Russia. They’ll
      have to go back to unifying with the rest of Asia and being just another country
      of equals. But they say, we don’t want to be equals. We want to dominate. If we
      can’t control another economy that we trade with, we feel insecure. We feel threatened.
      And if America cannot control these economies, we feel the threat because we’re
      dependent on the United States. Europe will have to realize that its economic
      enemy is not Russia and China, but rather that China and the rest of Asia are
      the most rapidly growing economies in the world. So who is Europe to look to for
      its long-term trade and investment development with a shrinking economy in the
      United States or a growing economy in East Asia? Europe’s unanimous leaders say,
      we’re with the shrinking economy. We’re going to lower our living standards just
      as rapidly as American living standards are being lowered and we’re going to impose
      austerity because that’s where our loyalty lies. What can the voters of Europe
      do against that given the way in which the European Union’s politics are organized?
      Well, the same problem occurs in the BRICS countries. I’m sure the BRICS voters
      would love to say, why can’t our country in Africa or South Asia or Latin America
      follow the same policy of China? Why can’t we throw off what for us is the equivalent
      of European feudalism? We have to say that this whole two centuries of warped
      development, making us subsidiary dependencies of the industrial creditor nations,
      has not worked out. Our sovereignty is to go to work with each other. We have
      to make a clean slate. The debts cannot be paid unless we forego all of our investment
      in growth. Who are we going to put first? Are we going to put the foreign bondholders
      first as a claim on our tax revenues? Or are we going to put our own economic
      growth first and our own domestic investment in achieving economic self-sufficiency
      and rising living standards first? Well, unanimously, the BRICS countries say,
      forget living standards, we’re going to follow the IMF, we’re going to impose
      austerity because we in the ruling class, the client oligarchy, are doing very
      well ourselves. We’re really an extension of the U.S. finance capitalist economy
      . So this is the ruling class of Argentina, much of Brazil under Bolsonaro. That’s
      what the whole fight in Brazil is all about. This is the whole problem. You not
      only need a revolution by the BRICS countries and global majority countries to,
      in terms of their philosophy of economics development, to adopt classical economics
      and its freeing economies from rent, you need a political revolution against its
      own client oligarchies that have been put in place by this dependency system that’s
      been imposed over the last two centuries, often by force and violence. GLENN DIESEN
      : Well, I fear that it’s almost a law of nature that we can say the political
      elite is no longer delivering on the desires of its public. But if they don’t,
      there will always be this political upheaval. I think so far the political class
      has simply dismissed all reactions to its failure to pursue basic national interests
      as being populists and populists are illegitimate and should be countered almost
      in any possible way. Now this only works for so long though because if they do
      not respond to national interest there will be some massive political instability
      or upheaval coming. But the response to national interest depends on how the distribution
      of power is organized, and in a multi-polar system that is now the actual reality,
      the distribution of power is not being concentrated in the United States anymore.
      The policies have to reflect this in some way it seems. But as you say, the political
      leads in Europe are only pursuing, or, essentially doing America’s bidding while
      its national interests are ignored. I’m wondering how long this can actually go
      on and if there will be some pursuit of, if not joining BRICS, some similar alternative
      at least. Because I think the Europeans… well the Americans, they at least, think
      what you will about Trump and his terrible solutions to this, are trying to pursue
      a new system. At least he recognizes that the post-World War II era is over. I
      think the Europeans are still in denial. If they can only do enough self-sacrifice,
      enough war, enough bootlicking of Trump, then somehow they can bring back or restore
      this era. I think this is what the Americans, the Chinese, and the Russians all
      have in common. I think they realize that this era is over and now, of course,
      split interest. Do you have any final thoughts on this, I would say, very important
      topic of the end of an era? The economic system of the past 80 years is coming
      to an end and there’s no real consensus.  And even among the different alternatives,
      there doesn’t seem to be the conceptual clarity you want. I would like to see,
      for example, BRICS to have a sustainable alternative. And even less so with the
      Trump administration. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, what you’ve described, Glenn, is the
      materialist approach to history. And that history believes that countries are
      going to do what ultimately is in their natural interest. There’s a kind of survival
      of the fittest, and the fittest ultimately are going to work out. But that’s not
      what’s happened in a lot of history. It’s not the fittest that have survived.
      And the materialist approach to history has left out the reasons why the race
      is not always to the swift, as the Bible puts it. And so we really don’t know
      what’s going to happen today. For Germany, for instance, it’s not just that the
      post-war era is over. World War II is not over. It’s still on. Merz says we want
      to make the German army the dominant army as it just was before. The dominant
      army, he means, it’s only one army, the Wehrmacht, the Nazi army. You’re having
      a revival of what really is Nazism in Germany. It’s like all of a sudden we’re
      going back to the World War II period. We’re having a dictatorship in France where,
      despite all of the demonstrators, the yellow vests and the demonstrations throughout
      France have not been able to get rid of Macron. You have a whole obsolescence
      of the political constitutions and the politics that have led to Starmer in Britain
      just following Tony Blair as part of the super Thatcherite development. None of
      this is in the national interest of these countries. They’re not what the voters
      want, but the political system has become dissociated from what the voters want.
      It may be that the only catalyst for this is not going to be in Europe, but it’s
      going to be in other countries that, especially former present allies of the United
      States, such as Japan, South Korea, that decide: well, now that we can’t run trade
      surpluses with the United States anymore, now that it’s doing to us in Japan what
      it did with the Plaza at Louvre Accords in the 1980s, now maybe we’ve got to make
      a rapprochement with China . I think as Western Europe sees other Asian countries
      joining China one after another, and by China, its overall development plan, Belt
      and Road and overall trading and investment area, Europe is going to see: they’re
      pulling further and further ahead of us. They’ve left us behind. How long can
      we agree to be left behind? And what can we do to make a change? Well, the question
      is, can this be done without a revolution? I don’t know. Will it be a peaceful
      revolution? How do you change a constitution that has left Europe and client oligarchies
      in this position? It’s as much a political question as it is an economic question.
      So while we talk in terms of economic self-determination, how do you deal with
      the fact that there’s this political distortion of what you and I would think
      is the natural materialist logic of history? GLENN DIESEN : Well, on those great
      final words, we can wrap it up. But as I like that possibility at least, though,
      because I do see some optimistic signs coming out of East Asia, both from South
      Korea and Japan, It looks as if they’ve also come to realize that as the post-World
      War II era or system is coming to an end, that the American role will change fundamentally
      in terms of also cannibalizing allies. Something, by the way, also evident in
      the rhetoric towards Taiwan. So as this is happening, if they make this shift,
      yeah, it remains to be seen if the Europeans will still throw themselves on the
      sword in this way. But I don’t know. I’m very disillusioned by the Europeans at
      the moment. So I remain pessimistic, but at least that’s a source of optimism,
      though. MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes. Yeah, optimism. Yes, there will be a revolution.
      GLENN DIESEN : Well, Professor Hudson, thank you as always. It’s always fascinating
      to speak with you so, thanks again. MICHAEL HUDSON: Thank you Glenn. Transcription

    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion between Glenn Diesen and economist Michael
      Hudson, they explore the obsolescence of the post-war global order, suggesting
      it no longer benefits the U.S. and may be shifting from free trade to fair trade
      as the global economic landscape evolves.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, economist Michael Hudson and host Glenn
      Diesen explored the idea that the post-World War II global order, once beneficial
      to the United States, is now deemed obsolete and counterproductive for American
      interests, as articulated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. They examined the
      transition from a free-trade system, which favored U.S. hegemony, to a potential
      fair-trade approach, as sentiments grow that the existing economic framework is
      failing. Hudson introduced the concept of "civilizational conflict," suggesting
      that the future organization of society and economy will be shaped by competing
      visions, particularly as the U.S. seeks alternatives to the current order while
      the BRICS nations emerge as a counterforce. The conversation highlights the complexities
      of these two divergent pathways in a changing global landscape.

    text: '07.17.2025 – Glenn Diesen GLENN DIESEN : We are joined today by Professor
      Michael Hudson, world-famous and best-selling economist. So welcome back to the
      program. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, thanks for having me back, Glenn. GLENN DIESEN
      : So recently, the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, explained that the post-war
      global order is not just obsolete, it is now being used against us. And it is…
      MICHAEL HUDSON: That’s what it means, obsolete. It’s working just the way it was
      supposed to, but America’s no longer the beneficiary. GLENN DIESEN : Oh, exactly.
      And for me, I thought a bit about what was previously referred to as the free-trade
      empire. If you are in the hegemonic position, often this system can work to your
      advantage. If it’s not, free- trade is expected to be replaced with what can be
      called fair-trade. But it is interesting about the post-war global order because
      there is a, I guess, growing sentiment that the post-World War II economic order
      has indeed come to an end. And the U.S. is therefore pursuing its own alternative.
      It’s unclear, in more precise terms, what this exactly entails. While at the other
      end, we’re developing also on the other side BRICS as an alternative to transition
      away from the seemingly failed or post-World War II economic order that has ended.
      So it might be an oversimplification, but there seems to be at least these two
      different pathways. So I really want to explore with you what both the United
      States and BRICS envision to replace this post-World War II era with. And indeed,
      you wrote or sent me recently a chapter on this, and you referred to a similar
      problem as civilizational conflict. I was wondering if you can flesh out this
      idea. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, by civilizational conflict, I mean the way in which
      society and the economy are going to be organized. And you began your question
      with the 1944-1945 post-war order. And the United States at Bretton Woods designed
      the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the British loan and British
      diplomacy as a means of absorbing the British Empire and later the rest of the
      European former empires into the United States sphere of influence. So the rules-based
      order that the United States created were rules that favored the United States.
      And the origins of this, to really understand the split in the kind of world that
      the Western industrial economies have relative to the 85% of the world majority,
      this goes back really two centuries to the very takeoff of industrial capitalism
      in Britain, France, Germany, and later the United States. And I think in many
      ways, you can say that the takeoff of industrial capitalism was revolutionary
      for the countries that were industrializing. And it was revolutionary because
      the basic principle of industrial capitalism was to lower the cost of production
      so that industrialists in Britain and other countries could undersell competitors
      abroad. And how did you undersell them? Well, there were three ways. The first
      way was to get rid of the carryover from feudalism, the landed aristocracy that
      controlled parliaments with the aim of increasing their land rents and with their
      land rents, the price of food. And the industrialists by 1815, led by David Ricardo,
      the banker, said, well, Britain cannot compete with other countries if we have
      to pay our wage labor so much that it pays exorbitant agricultural rents to the
      landlord class, which had imposed the Corn Laws, the agricultural tariffs in 1815
      to block foreign imports. Ricardo said the first precondition of having an industrial
      country overtake and out-compete its competitors is to minimize the cost of living
      for the labor that it employs. And that means we need free trade in grain and
      food and raw materials so we can import them from abroad. And that entails freeing
      the economy from economic rent. Rent is the increase in price, the excess of price
      over the actual cost value. And Ricardo and the whole school of classical political
      economy aimed at keeping prices in the economy in line with the actual cost of
      production and getting rid of all of the special privileges. The first privilege
      was that of land rent, as I mentioned. The second privilege was monopoly privileges.
      From the 14th to the 18th century, Europe’s kings had needed to increase taxes
      to pay their bankers to lend them the money to go to war with each other. And
      the parliaments of Britain and other countries obviously opposed paying taxes,
      especially during the Crusades when they opposed the kings of England imposing
      taxes to pay the bankers to fight wars on behalf of Rome in its sort of internecine
      fights with Germany and countries that didn’t accept Roman domination. So the
      bankers helped the kings in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries organize trade
      monopolies. You don’t need parliamentary approval to make a trade monopoly. And
      that will yield money. And you, the king, as recipient of these monopolies, can
      pay us, the bankers . So the industrial capitalists of England said, we have to
      get rid of these monopolies. Let’s have a free market free of economic rent, free
      from land rent, free from monopoly rent. And the third thing they needed was:
      we have to take the financial class in general. We have to bring it into the industrial
      capitalist order. The role of bankers should be to make productive loans to finance
      capital formation . And banks in England and other countries had not been lending
      to finance industrial capital formation. They didn’t lend to the inventors of
      the steam engine and James Watt, I think, had to mortgage the land to borrow to
      get money to invest in his innovations. So these three forms, land rent, monopoly
      rent, and interest, which is a form of monopoly rent, had to be freed. And that
      was really the task of classical economics in the 19th century was to create that
      streamlined market free of all the costs that were not really costs of production,
      but were costs of the privileges inherited from the medieval period. Well, things
      were very different in the rest of the world. England took 30 years to get rid
      of the Corn Laws, which it did in 1846, and that committed Britain to free trade
      with other countries. And the British strategists and diplomats went to other
      countries and said, we’ll give you access to the British market. You can buy your
      manufactures from Britain much cheaper than you can make them yourself. We’ll
      buy raw materials from you, your food, your minerals, others, and it’ll be a happy
      exchange. Well, they convinced America, at least the southern states of America,
      not the northern states, and they convinced most of the world to agree to this
      specialization of production between the industrial capitalist countries on the
      one hand and the raw materials producers, host economies on the other. Well, what
      happened was that the industrial countries ran trade surpluses, went far ahead.
      They bought low-priced raw materials, they worked them up into manufactures, and
      they sold them at a profit. And together, the European countries and later the
      United States had a monopoly in industrial products. Well, the problem is that
      the rest of the world producing raw materials ran trade deficits. And to make
      matters even worse, beginning in the 1820s, the newly independent former colonies
      from Haiti in the Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil, and then the Ottoman colonies, Greece,
      Egypt, and Tunisia, all won their independence, but they had to borrow money from
      creditors in order to remake the economy and to begin to develop their own industry
      and their self-sufficiency. Well, almost immediately, every country that borrowed
      defaulted. And by the end of the 19th century, the debts had grown and the defaults
      had mounted up so that the creditor countries were able to appoint central banks
      or national monetary commissions to manage the fiscal policy of these countries
      that had won their development. And of course, in the colonies, you had Britain
      and Germany and France, the colonizing powers running things. And the industrial
      countries used their trade surpluses to invest in the raw materials producers.
      They invested in railroads and communications. They bought out public infrastructure
      monopolies. They especially bought land and plantations and natural resource rights,
      forests, minerals for themselves. And the result is that all of these rent-yielding
      resources that the classical economists said should be the natural tax base were
      not the tax base. They were the equivalent of feudalism as a burden to the raw
      materials exporters. And in the sense that here you had the governments and the
      domestic economy having to pay heavy rent or land rent, natural resource rent,
      which is a kind of land rent, monopoly rent, and financial debt service, all to
      the creditor countries. So the fight that had been against feudalism in Britain
      and France and Germany for the rest of the world, for the global majority, was
      a fight against foreign rentier interests, not only their own rentier interests.
      And this created a kind of dual economy, as it came to be called. And by the 1950s,
      for instance, Latin America, Africa, much of Asia were called developing countries,
      but they were not developing in the way that the European industrial nations developed.
      They were not developing free of economic rent, but as a subject to economic rent.​
      Their governments did not have enough domestic tax returns to be able to make
      the public infrastructure spending and subsidy of industry that was absolutely
      critical to Britain, France, and Germany and the United States that had a mixed
      economy. Because in these industrial countries, industrial capitalism was evolving
      into industrial socialism. It was a mixed economy in all of these countries because
      the industrial class said, well, apart from feeding our wage earners at lower
      priced food that we import, we’re going to minimize their cost of living by providing
      basic needs, basic services, education, health care, transportation, natural monopolies
      at minimum cost prices or at subsidized prices or even freely for education so
      that we’re going to make our European economies and later the U.S. economy the
      lowest cost economies in the world so that we can out-compete any potential competition
      from North America, South America, the global south basically. And that was a
      situation that existed right through World War II. Well, during World War II,
      many of these raw materials exporters actually had accumulated large amounts of
      their own foreign reserves by selling minerals and oil and other inputs to the
      fighters in World War II. And they emerged in 1945 in a very strong position.
      Well, at that point, the United States imposed its IMF rules and the World Bank
      rules. And these claimed to have a doctrine of economic development that would
      help these countries develop. It actually prevented them from developing. And
      so instead of being developing countries, they were warped into dependency countries,
      not developing countries, but host economies in the sense of host to, you could
      even call it a parasite. And the World Bank, for instance, would make loans to
      global south countries, not for their own food production, to make themselves
      supply their own food so they didn’t have to import it, but only to export plantation
      crops and to pick up all of the infrastructure costs, the port costs, and the
      transportation to export their raw materials. They fought against land reform
      and any attempt to produce food that would have rivaled the market and displaced
      American farmers and farm exports. And the same thing happened after the common
      market was formed with its Common Agricultural Policy, which also had very heavy
      government supports, price supports, suspension of free trade in order to support
      a farm investment that vastly increased European farm productivity, just as President
      Roosevelt’s Agricultural Adjustment Act in the United States in the 1930s increased
      American agricultural productivity by being very protectionist. Nothing like this
      occurred in countries that were clients of the World Bank. Well, pretty soon these
      countries lapsed back into the condition that they’d been in since the 19th century.
      They ran trade deficits. They had to borrow money. That meant they ran into debt.
      And at that point, the International Monetary Fund came in, and it said the only
      way you can get rich is by impoverishing yourself. This is a theory that David
      Ricardo had developed, the spokesman of bankers for the Bullion Committee in 1809-1810
      in Britain. They said, well, why don’t you get rich in the way that Britain and
      Europe got rich, lower the wage cost. But they didn’t lower the wage cost by lowering
      the cost of living. They lowered it by preventing labor unions by just lowering
      wages and not providing any of the social support for wages that Europe had, and
      basically imposing austerity programs that had one purpose: to prevent governments
      from having the money to invest in subsidizing their industry and agriculture
      to be independent of the European countries. So basically, these were anti-development
      corporations, institutions. The World Bank published a report under McNamara,
      Partners in Development , but it was really Partners in Dependency, Partners in
      Underdevelopment, because it was all based on the diametric opposite principles
      of classical economics and the way that the European countries had developed by
      raising living standards. The World Bank and the IMF aimed at lowering living
      standards, claiming that this would make them more competitive. But this ignored
      the fact that the American economists pointed out that high-wage labor was so
      much more productive than low-wage pauper labor that it paid for itself. So you
      had Western European and North American labor, high productivity, supported by
      heavy government subsidies and provision of basic needs, and unproductive labor
      that did not have any government or social support in the global south countries.
      And that’s the problem that has led to today’s problem, the crisis, which has
      now, this year coming to a head. And it’s come to a head for two reasons. The
      most obvious reason is the tariff policy that’s imposed by Donald Trump prevents
      other countries, especially the global south countries, from earning the money,
      the dollars, to pay their debts by exporting to the United States market. Now,
      if their debts are denominated in dollars, and the only way they can earn dollars
      is by exporting to the U.S. or Europe, and they’re blocked from doing this, how
      can they pay? The only way for the last 50 years they’ve been able to pay is by
      being forced to sell off and privatize even more of their natural resources, their
      mineral rights, sew off their monopolies, essentially Thatcherize their economy.
      And Thatcherizing their economy has been just as devastating to the global south
      countries as it was to Britain. That’s the crisis. The second crisis is the fact
      that for the first time, the global south countries and Asia and the BRICS countries
      as a whole have an alternative to avoid the dependency trap that they’ve been
      caught in since 1945. And that’s largely because of China. Ever since the Bandung
      Conference in 1955 in Indonesia, countries, the non-aligned countries, got together
      and said, we’ve got to have an alternative to the U.S. and European-designed economic
      order that is not in our interest. But they couldn’t go it alone. They were just
      individuals, and the United States and Britain and Europe were able to divide
      and conquer them to regime change, to basically overthrow governments that were
      not U.S. friendly. And the result was this dual economy structure that you would
      have. Well, they’re stuck with Thatcherized economies with not being able to have
      the fiscal resources that Europe developed with. They don’t have sovereignty to
      impose their own rent tax on land, natural resources, and to create their own
      monetary systems that would finance their own industry. China did that, but it
      took a revolution in 1945 under Mao, just as in Russia, it took a revolution that
      got rid of the landlord class and the financial class. And the question is: how
      are the BRICS countries going to emulate the Chinese industrial capitalist model
      or the industrial socialist model with Chinese characteristics? The Chinese characteristics
      being those of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Marx, the whole classical economic
      school that developed the whole idea of freeing industrial economies from economic
      rent, from special privilege, and making them efficient industrial economies.
      That’s the crisis. And the fact that these countries are now able to have an alternative
      model is what the Americans claim is a clash in civilization. And it’s really
      not a clash of civilization. It’s a fight against the attempt by the global south
      and BRICS and global majority to follow the same path of civilization that industrial
      capitalism began to develop in the 19th century and that the classical economic
      ideology was all about. GLENN DIESEN : If we relate this back to the statement
      by Marco Rubio that the post-war global order is now used against us, is this
      then a reference to the rentier system, the idea that the currency, technologies,
      banking system, all these finances, all these things offered by the United States,
      which it extracts rent from, in other words, money without contributing to the
      productive process, is this eliminating America in this role? Is this what Rubio
      is referring to when he says that the system is being used against us? Or is it
      just the general trade rules? How can we interpret the statement of Rubio? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, it’s not the system that’s changed. It’s the United States and the
      European economies that have changed. What began as industrial capitalism under
      the classical economics of freeing economies from rent didn’t really win the fight
      by the 20th century. The rentier interests fought back, and you had a replacement
      of classical value, price, and rent theory with an idea that, well: price equals
      value. There’s no such thing as economic rent. Everybody earns whatever they can
      get, whether it’s landlords earn all the rent they can take, the banks earn whatever
      they charge, including late fees. All of these are counted in GDP today. If you
      look at the GDP of America and Europe, you have most of it being rentier charges,
      monopoly rents, but especially interest charges, financial charges, real estate,
      land rent. Banks have lent more and more credit relative to the price of the buyers
      on mortgage, more and more of the housing costs in America and Europe are paid
      to the banks. So there’s still economic rent in the U.S. and the European economies,
      but the recipients are no longer the feudal landlord class. They’re the banking
      class. And you’ve had the bank class become the main rentier, not the landlords
      and not the monopolists, but the banking class has been the mother of monopoly,
      the mother of trusts, organizing them, and then lending buyers and organizers
      of trusts and corporate takeovers the money to create monopolies and pay out the
      monopoly rents as interest. So, what began as industrial capitalism that made
      the United States and the European economies so wealthy and so productive has
      ended up being parasitized by turning into finance capitalism. That’s the central
      thesis of almost all of the books and all of the articles that I’ve read. And
      so, it’s the United States that has lost its industrial power by deciding we’re
      going to deindustrialize. We’re going to essentially put the class where we’re
      back in business under President Clinton in the 1990s by, let’s shift our industrial
      production out of the United States to the foreign affiliates of multinational
      corporations. Let’s let foreign labor do the work, and then that will prevent
      American labor from unionizing and raising its wages because we’re replacing it
      with immigrant labor or with Mexican and Canadian labor at first, and then with
      Chinese and other foreign labor. So, the United States took a decision to literally
      deindustrialize. And this deindustrialization has become financialization as well.
      So, you’ve replaced an industrial economy with a bank-centered, Wall Street-centered
      financial economy whose central planning has shifted from governments to the financial
      centers in New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo. And the economic development
      of the 15% global garden and its allies basically have stopped developing and
      have sort of lapsed into the same kind of rentier economy that the whole fight
      to create industrial power in the 19th century was fought against. Well, that’s
      led the United States all of a sudden to find: well, we can’t afford to create
      our own industrial self-sufficiency anymore. So, how are we going to compete?
      Well, President Trump says there are two ways we can compete: We can either force
      other countries to pay us tribute by creating an empire, or we can make monopoly
      rent and financial rent. We can make monopoly rent by monopolizing the new technology
      and information technology, computer chip technology, and especially military
      technology. We’ll tell Europe: increase your military spending from 1.5% of GDP
      to 5%, but you have to buy all your military goods from the United States . And
      that will provide, that will help us balance our international trade and finance
      our budget deficit at the same time. And you also have to remain in the dollar
      system so that whatever surplus that foreign countries are able to save out of
      their trade surplus or investment surplus or domestic earnings, all their monetary
      savings have to be invested in U.S. Treasury securities or other U.S. securities
      in the dollar area. And so the wealth and accumulation of all the world is to
      be sent to the United States. And Trump says he’s going to impose 100%, maybe
      500% tariffs on countries that try to use their income and their trade surpluses
      and their tax surpluses to develop their own economy rather than subsidize the
      United States economy. So this is a war of the United States, not only against
      the global majority, but especially against its own allies in Europe and also
      in Japan and South Korea. As you’ve just seen, America’s moves against Japan to
      end its ability to sell its automobiles in the United States. Same thing with
      Korea, the inability to sell their industrial products here. It’s a declaration
      of economic war against these other countries. And the U.S. diplomacy has sort
      of fixed the outcome by its political interference and regime change pressure
      and the non-government organizations that have provided a huge source of funding
      to promote individual opportunists as politicians or industrial leaders who are
      favorable to the United States and owe their loyalty really to the United States
      or United States companies like I suppose you’d say Merz in Germany. So you have
      European political leaders supporting policies that add to the United States domination
      of Europe. Well, the voters of these European countries do not support this. The
      voters of Germany, France, and other countries are voting against spending their
      money on the war in Ukraine, against fighting against Russia. They want to be
      able to buy in the cheapest market, just like England wanted to buy in the cheapest
      market back in 1815. But they’re blocked. Instead of buying inexpensive Russian
      oil and gas, they’re supposed to buy American liquefied natural gas at four or
      five times the price as you and I have spoken about before. So Europe has been
      turned into a dependency, and the United States is trying to achieve that same
      hegemony globally over the BRICS and global south countries. Well, the problem
      is that the BRICS and global south countries themselves not only have governments
      that are very largely supported by the United States, for instance, the African
      representatives to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are thoroughly
      neoliberal. So their managerial class has been educated in the United States or
      Britain in neoliberal Thatcherite or similar U.S. laws. They’re not even familiar
      with the policy debates that underlay the emergence of industrial capitalism that
      made Europe so successful originally. So they don’t have a model. The only model
      that they have is that of China, which independently has reinvented the wheel,
      the same wheel that Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and the British economists
      and their other classical economists developed of a mixed economy where the government
      is in control of its own money creation and the allocation of money. So you will
      have, for instance, China doing what any country that’s trying to develop and
      being competitive should do. You create money and credit to finance tangible capital
      formation. Not only private capital formation and innovation, but basic infrastructure
      like high-speed railways, port development, or the Belt and Road Initiative that
      China is trying to make in order to create a structure of international trade
      and investment that will make Asia independent of the United States. And Russia’s
      President Putin had said, this is really what the fight is all about. The fight
      is to make other countries sovereign nations in charge of their own fiscal policy
      and investment policy and government policy. But they can’t be independent unless
      they tax away the resource rent from their now foreign-owned companies produced
      by oil, raw materials production, mineral production, forests. Essentially, nationalize
      the monopolies and make them public monopolies, not foreign-owned rentier monopolies.
      They have to de-rentiize their economy. That’s their policy. Well, they don’t
      really have to nationalize these foreign-owned oil and mineral companies. They
      simply have to tax the economic rent. And as sovereign countries, they should
      be able to tax the economic rent. But this is treated as a civilizational conflict,
      as an attack on Western civilization and democracy itself, where actually it’s
      an expression of democracy, an expression of their own domestic national sovereignty.
      So this is the fight they have. But their own ruling class, their own political
      class, and the wealthiest class that they have are themselves rentiers and are
      part of the rentier economy. A huge amount of Argentina’s and Brazil’s foreign
      debt is owned by Argentinians and Brazilians because they know that they’re the
      upper classes and they know that the government is going to pay the dollar debt
      to themselves and not default on it. So you have a class conflict within the BRICS
      countries themselves, very similar, but with key differences to the class conflict
      between labor and capital in the West. That’s a complicating factor in all this.
      And the question is: how are you going to get the BRICS countries and other countries
      to pursue the same kind of economic reform that China has done so efficiently
      without having an actual revolution because the United States has said, if you
      try to make a reform, we’re going to do to you what we did to Venezuela, what
      we did to Iran, what we did to Libya, what we did to Chile. We’re going to overthrow
      you. We don’t want to reform. We’re trying to keep Western power in control. And
      President Putin gave another speech just a week ago saying, you know, all along,
      we thought since the 1990s that the anti-Russian feeling that Europe and the United
      States had really was ideological. That it was a fight between capitalism and
      Soviet ideology. And it turns out that certainly that was an element, but they
      really were just anti-Russian. They wanted to conquer us. They wanted to break
      us up into five different countries or six countries and divide and conquer us
      and make us their colonies. That it really is all about an attempt by the United
      States and Europe to control the world, just as under industrial capitalism they
      tried to control the world by industrial power and productivity and controlling
      the rentier surpluses, financial surpluses, rent surpluses of raw materials exporters,
      that it turns out to be just a raw power grab. And that’s what it’s turned into
      today. GLENN DIESEN : So you have then the split between the more financialized
      economies of the West versus the more aspiring, at least industrial capitalist
      economies of BRICS. So I guess what frustrates me with Europe a lot is the reluctance
      to accept that they’ve gone from being the subject to the object, the reluctance
      to see that the Europeans are the one now being cannibalized by their American
      partners because I think the political leadership sees the future of Europe, its
      greatness or relevance, to be tied up with this transatlantic partnership, while
      at the same time there is some recognition that they’re being cannibalized by
      the Americans. So you end up with politicians such as Macron of France who pivots
      back and forth between, you know, we can’t allow ourselves to be vassals of America
      , and the next day it’s, we have to have solidarity with the US in order to preserve
      the West. So it’s very, they want to be in the political West, but they’re very
      uncomfortable or reject the acknowledgement that they have now become an object
      effectively. But what can BRICS do now, though, in terms of providing an alternative?
      Because the monopolistic system you present as the option of the United States,
      it doesn’t seem like a very stable or even sustainable option. It seems very extractive,
      disruptive, chaotic, and doomed for failure down the road. So what, in your opinion,
      should BRICS be striving for then? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, let me talk about Europe
      first. People like Macron and his counterparts in England, Starmer, and Germany,
      Merz, they’re demagogues. They see on the one hand that the population of Europe
      wants prosperity. They don’t want the budget to be limited in money creation and
      running a deficit. They want the government to run deficits to spend on social
      spending, especially to support living standards or at least to prevent the disaster
      of living standards that have been caused by breaking energy trade with Russia.
      So, what the voters want is one thing, but the leaders are not responsive to the
      voters. They’re just like Donald Trump here. They are serving their basically
      American sponsors. And the problem is, I guess, for Europe, the whole way in which
      the European Union is structured to guarantee failure. The European Union is run
      by NATO. Its foreign policy heads are military hawks whose only interest is basically
      willing to impoverish the European economies in order to fight Russia and try
      to train it in this mythical hope that somehow, if they drain Russia enough, Russia
      will be unable to fight the war in Ukraine, against Europe and America any longer.
      And there will be a regime change. The Europeans and Americans can come up in
      and carve up Russia as they began to do under Yeltsin in the 1990s. European voters
      do not have a role to play in European politics under a condition where Europe
      is part of NATO and where its countries are prevented from doing what any sovereign
      country should do, creating its own money to fund its own spending, to subsidize
      its industry and rising living standards. The European Union’s monetary policy
      was created to prevent running a budget deficit in a Keynesian type economic stimulus.
      So as long as European policy is run from a basement office in the Pentagon saying,
      well, you have to bankrupt your industry by not importing Russian energy anymore.
      You can move your industrial companies to America, maybe bring your skilled labor
      here too, but you’re going to have to sacrifice in order to defend democracy,
      democracy like Zelensky has imposed in Ukraine, the American model of democracy.
      I mean, this is a travesty. And this blocks Europe from saying, well, we really,
      we’re not going to be part of an island off the coast of Rhode Island. We’re going
      to be part of Asia. That’s our natural trade partner. You know, the whole German
      prosperity came from an integration of trade and investment with Russia. They’ll
      have to go back to unifying with the rest of Asia and being just another country
      of equals. But they say, we don’t want to be equals. We want to dominate. If we
      can’t control another economy that we trade with, we feel insecure. We feel threatened.
      And if America cannot control these economies, we feel the threat because we’re
      dependent on the United States. Europe will have to realize that its economic
      enemy is not Russia and China, but rather that China and the rest of Asia are
      the most rapidly growing economies in the world. So who is Europe to look to for
      its long-term trade and investment development with a shrinking economy in the
      United States or a growing economy in East Asia? Europe’s unanimous leaders say,
      we’re with the shrinking economy. We’re going to lower our living standards just
      as rapidly as American living standards are being lowered and we’re going to impose
      austerity because that’s where our loyalty lies. What can the voters of Europe
      do against that given the way in which the European Union’s politics are organized?
      Well, the same problem occurs in the BRICS countries. I’m sure the BRICS voters
      would love to say, why can’t our country in Africa or South Asia or Latin America
      follow the same policy of China? Why can’t we throw off what for us is the equivalent
      of European feudalism? We have to say that this whole two centuries of warped
      development, making us subsidiary dependencies of the industrial creditor nations,
      has not worked out. Our sovereignty is to go to work with each other. We have
      to make a clean slate. The debts cannot be paid unless we forego all of our investment
      in growth. Who are we going to put first? Are we going to put the foreign bondholders
      first as a claim on our tax revenues? Or are we going to put our own economic
      growth first and our own domestic investment in achieving economic self-sufficiency
      and rising living standards first? Well, unanimously, the BRICS countries say,
      forget living standards, we’re going to follow the IMF, we’re going to impose
      austerity because we in the ruling class, the client oligarchy, are doing very
      well ourselves. We’re really an extension of the U.S. finance capitalist economy
      . So this is the ruling class of Argentina, much of Brazil under Bolsonaro. That’s
      what the whole fight in Brazil is all about. This is the whole problem. You not
      only need a revolution by the BRICS countries and global majority countries to,
      in terms of their philosophy of economics development, to adopt classical economics
      and its freeing economies from rent, you need a political revolution against its
      own client oligarchies that have been put in place by this dependency system that’s
      been imposed over the last two centuries, often by force and violence. GLENN DIESEN
      : Well, I fear that it’s almost a law of nature that we can say the political
      elite is no longer delivering on the desires of its public. But if they don’t,
      there will always be this political upheaval. I think so far the political class
      has simply dismissed all reactions to its failure to pursue basic national interests
      as being populists and populists are illegitimate and should be countered almost
      in any possible way. Now this only works for so long though because if they do
      not respond to national interest there will be some massive political instability
      or upheaval coming. But the response to national interest depends on how the distribution
      of power is organized, and in a multi-polar system that is now the actual reality,
      the distribution of power is not being concentrated in the United States anymore.
      The policies have to reflect this in some way it seems. But as you say, the political
      leads in Europe are only pursuing, or, essentially doing America’s bidding while
      its national interests are ignored. I’m wondering how long this can actually go
      on and if there will be some pursuit of, if not joining BRICS, some similar alternative
      at least. Because I think the Europeans… well the Americans, they at least, think
      what you will about Trump and his terrible solutions to this, are trying to pursue
      a new system. At least he recognizes that the post-World War II era is over. I
      think the Europeans are still in denial. If they can only do enough self-sacrifice,
      enough war, enough bootlicking of Trump, then somehow they can bring back or restore
      this era. I think this is what the Americans, the Chinese, and the Russians all
      have in common. I think they realize that this era is over and now, of course,
      split interest. Do you have any final thoughts on this, I would say, very important
      topic of the end of an era? The economic system of the past 80 years is coming
      to an end and there’s no real consensus.  And even among the different alternatives,
      there doesn’t seem to be the conceptual clarity you want. I would like to see,
      for example, BRICS to have a sustainable alternative. And even less so with the
      Trump administration. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, what you’ve described, Glenn, is the
      materialist approach to history. And that history believes that countries are
      going to do what ultimately is in their natural interest. There’s a kind of survival
      of the fittest, and the fittest ultimately are going to work out. But that’s not
      what’s happened in a lot of history. It’s not the fittest that have survived.
      And the materialist approach to history has left out the reasons why the race
      is not always to the swift, as the Bible puts it. And so we really don’t know
      what’s going to happen today. For Germany, for instance, it’s not just that the
      post-war era is over. World War II is not over. It’s still on. Merz says we want
      to make the German army the dominant army as it just was before. The dominant
      army, he means, it’s only one army, the Wehrmacht, the Nazi army. You’re having
      a revival of what really is Nazism in Germany. It’s like all of a sudden we’re
      going back to the World War II period. We’re having a dictatorship in France where,
      despite all of the demonstrators, the yellow vests and the demonstrations throughout
      France have not been able to get rid of Macron. You have a whole obsolescence
      of the political constitutions and the politics that have led to Starmer in Britain
      just following Tony Blair as part of the super Thatcherite development. None of
      this is in the national interest of these countries. They’re not what the voters
      want, but the political system has become dissociated from what the voters want.
      It may be that the only catalyst for this is not going to be in Europe, but it’s
      going to be in other countries that, especially former present allies of the United
      States, such as Japan, South Korea, that decide: well, now that we can’t run trade
      surpluses with the United States anymore, now that it’s doing to us in Japan what
      it did with the Plaza at Louvre Accords in the 1980s, now maybe we’ve got to make
      a rapprochement with China . I think as Western Europe sees other Asian countries
      joining China one after another, and by China, its overall development plan, Belt
      and Road and overall trading and investment area, Europe is going to see: they’re
      pulling further and further ahead of us. They’ve left us behind. How long can
      we agree to be left behind? And what can we do to make a change? Well, the question
      is, can this be done without a revolution? I don’t know. Will it be a peaceful
      revolution? How do you change a constitution that has left Europe and client oligarchies
      in this position? It’s as much a political question as it is an economic question.
      So while we talk in terms of economic self-determination, how do you deal with
      the fact that there’s this political distortion of what you and I would think
      is the natural materialist logic of history? GLENN DIESEN : Well, on those great
      final words, we can wrap it up. But as I like that possibility at least, though,
      because I do see some optimistic signs coming out of East Asia, both from South
      Korea and Japan, It looks as if they’ve also come to realize that as the post-World
      War II era or system is coming to an end, that the American role will change fundamentally
      in terms of also cannibalizing allies. Something, by the way, also evident in
      the rhetoric towards Taiwan. So as this is happening, if they make this shift,
      yeah, it remains to be seen if the Europeans will still throw themselves on the
      sword in this way. But I don’t know. I’m very disillusioned by the Europeans at
      the moment. So I remain pessimistic, but at least that’s a source of optimism,
      though. MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes. Yeah, optimism. Yes, there will be a revolution.
      GLENN DIESEN : Well, Professor Hudson, thank you as always. It’s always fascinating
      to speak with you so, thanks again. MICHAEL HUDSON: Thank you Glenn. Transcription

    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion between Glenn Diesen and economist Michael
      Hudson, they explore the obsolescence of the post-war global order, suggesting
      it no longer benefits the U.S. and may be shifting from free trade to fair trade
      as the global economic landscape evolves.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, economist Michael Hudson and host Glenn
      Diesen explored the idea that the post-World War II global order, once beneficial
      to the United States, is now deemed obsolete and counterproductive for American
      interests, as articulated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. They examined the
      transition from a free-trade system, which favored U.S. hegemony, to a potential
      fair-trade approach, as sentiments grow that the existing economic framework is
      failing. Hudson introduced the concept of "civilizational conflict," suggesting
      that the future organization of society and economy will be shaped by competing
      visions, particularly as the U.S. seeks alternatives to the current order while
      the BRICS nations emerge as a counterforce. The conversation highlights the complexities
      of these two divergent pathways in a changing global landscape.

      colonialism'

    text: 'Industrial capitalism was revolutionary in its fight to free Europe’s economies
      and parliaments from the hereditary privileges and vested interests that survived
      from feudalism. To make their manufactures competitive in world markets, industrialists
      needed to end the land rent paid to Europe’s landed aristocracies, the economic
      rents extracted by trade monopolies, and interest paid to bankers who played no
      role in financing industry. These rentier incomes add to the economy’s price structure,
      raising the living wage and other business expenses, thus eating into profits.


      The 20th century saw the classical aim of clearing away these economic rents rolled
      back in Europe, the United States, and other Western countries.


      However, today, land and natural-resource rents in private hands are still rising
      and even receiving special tax advantages. Basic infrastructure and other natural
      monopolies are being privatized by the financial sector — which is largely responsible
      for carving up and de-industrializing economies on behalf of its real estate and
      monopoly customers, who pay out most of their rental income as interest to bankers
      and bondholders.


      What has survived from the policies by which Europe’s industrial powers and the
      United States built up their own manufacturing is free trade. Britain implemented
      free trade after a 30-year fight on behalf of its industry against the landed
      aristocracy, aimed at ending the protectionist agricultural tariffs, the Corn
      Laws, which had been enacted in 1815 to prevent opening the home market to low-priced
      food imports, which would have reduced farming rents.


      After repealing these laws in 1846 to lower the cost of living, Britain offered
      free-trade agreements to countries seeking access to its market in exchange for
      these countries not protecting their industry against British exports. The aim
      was to deter less industrialized countries from working up their own raw materials.


      In such countries, Europe’s foreign investors sought to buy rent-yielding natural
      resources headed by mineral and land rights, and basic infrastructure headed by
      railroads and canals. This created a diametric contrast between rent-avoidance
      in the industrial nations and rent-seeking in their colonies and other host countries,
      while European bankers used debt leverage to gain fiscal control of former colonies
      who had won independence in the 19th and 20th centuries.


      Under pressure to pay the foreign debts that were run up to finance their trade
      deficits, development attempts, and deepening debt dependency, debtor countries
      were obliged to relinquish fiscal control of their economies to bondholders, banks,
      and creditor-nation governments, which pressed them to privatize their basic infrastructure
      monopolies. The effect was to prevent them from using revenue from their natural
      endowments to develop a broad economic base for prosperous development.


      Just as Britain, France, and Germany aimed to free their economies from feudalism’s
      legacy of the vested interests with rent extraction privileges, most of today’s
      Global Majority countries need to free themselves from the rent and debt overhead
      inherited from European colonialism and creditor control.


      By the 1950s these countries were being called “less developed” or, even more
      patronizingly, “developing.” But the combination of foreign debt and free trade
      has blocked them from developing along the balanced public/private lines that
      Western Europe and the United States followed.


      The tax policy and other legislation of these countries has been shaped by U.S.
      and European pressure to observe international trade and investment rules that
      perpetuate geopolitical domination by Western bankers and rent-extracting investors
      to control their national patrimony.


      The euphemism “host economy” is appropriate for these countries, because the Western
      economic penetration of them resembles a biological parasite feeding off its host.


      Seeking to maintain this relationship, the U.S. and European governments are blocking
      attempts by these countries to follow the path that Europe’s industrial nations
      and the United States took for their own economies with their 19th-century political
      and fiscal reforms that empowered their own takeoff.


      Without these countries adopting fiscal and political reforms aimed at developing
      their own sovereignty and prospects for growth on the basis of their own national
      patrimony of land, natural resources and basic infrastructure, the world economy
      will remain bifurcated between Western rentier nations and their Global Majority
      hosts and held subject to neoliberal orthodoxy.


      The success of China’s model poses a threat to the neoliberal order


      When U.S. political leaders single out China as an existential enemy of the West,
      it is not as a military threat but for offering a successful economic alternative
      to today’s U.S.-sponsored neoliberal world order.


      That order was supposed to represent the End of History, succeeding through its
      logic of free trade, government deregulation, and international investment free
      of capital controls, while detouring away from industrial capitalism’s anti-rentier
      policies.


      We can now see the absurdity in this self-satisfying evangelical view that had
      emerged just as Western economies were deindustrializing, as a result of the dynamics
      of their neoliberal finance capitalism.


      The vested financial and other rentier interests are rejecting not only China
      but the logic of industrial capitalism as described by its own 19th-century classical
      economists.


      Western neoliberal observers have closed their eyes to recognizing the ways in
      which China’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics” has achieved its success
      by a logic similar to that of the industrial capitalism advocated by classical
      economists to minimize rentier income.


      Most late 19th-century economic writers expected industrial capitalism to evolve
      into socialism of one form or another, as the role of public investment and regulation
      increased. Freeing economies and their governments from control by landowners
      and creditors was the common denominator of the social-democratic socialism of
      John Stuart Mill, the libertarian socialism of Henry George focusing on the land
      tax, and the cooperative mutual-aid socialism of Peter Kropotkin, as well as Marxism.


      Where China has gone further than earlier socialist mixed-economy reforms has
      been in keeping money and credit creation in the hands of government, along with
      basic infrastructure and natural resources.


      Fear that other governments might follow China’s lead has led U.S. and other Western
      finance-capitalist ideologues to view China as a threat by providing a model for
      economic reforms that are precisely the opposite of what the 20th century’s pro-rentier,
      anti-government ideology fought against.


      The foreign debt overhead owed to U.S. and other Western creditors, and enabled
      by the 1945-2025 international geopolitical rules designed by U.S. diplomats at
      Bretton Woods in 1944, obliges the Global South and other countries to recover
      their economic sovereignty by freeing themselves from their foreign (mainly dollarized)
      banking and financial burden.


      These countries have the same land-rent problem that Europe’s industrial capitalism
      faced, but their land and resource rents are mainly owned by multinational companies
      and other foreign appropriators of their oil and mineral rights, forests, and
      latifundia plantations, who extract resource rents by emptying out the world’s
      oil and mineral resources and cutting down its forests.


      Taxing economic rent is a precondition for economic sovereignty


      A precondition for Global South countries to gain economic autonomy is to follow
      the advice of the classical economists and tax the largest sources of rental income
      – land rent, monopoly rent, and financial returns – instead of letting them be
      sent abroad.


      Taxing these rents would help stabilize their balance of payments, while providing
      their governments with revenue to finance their infrastructure needs and the related
      social spending needed to subsidize their economic modernization.


      That is how Britain, France, Germany and the United States established their own
      industrial, agricultural, and financial supremacy. This is not a radical socialist
      policy; it always has been a central element of industrial capitalist development.


      Recapturing a country’s land and natural-resource rents as its fiscal base would
      enable it to avoid taxing labor and industry. A country would not need to formally
      nationalize its land and natural resources outright; it simply needs to tax the
      economic rent over and above actual “earned profits,” to cite the principle of
      Adam Smith and his 19th-century successors that this rent is the natural tax base.


      But neoliberal ideology calls such taxation of rent, and the regulation of monopolies
      or other market phenomena, an intrusive interference into the “free market.”


      This defense of rentier income inverts the classical definition of a free market.
      The classical economists defined a free market as one free from economic rent,
      not as one free for the extraction of economic rent, let alone as freedom for
      creditor-nation governments to create a “rules-based order” to facilitate foreign
      rent extraction and stifle the development of financially and trade-dependent
      host countries.


      Debt remission is a precondition for economic sovereignty


      The fight by countries to free themselves from their foreign debt overhead is
      much harder than Europe’s 19th-century fight to end the privileges of its landed
      aristocracy (and less successfully, of its bankers), because it is international
      in scope, and is now confronted by a creditor-nation alliance to maintain the
      system of financial colonization created two centuries ago, as former colonies
      sought to finance their independence by borrowing from foreign bankers.


      Starting in the 1820s, newly independent countries like Haiti, Mexico, and other
      Latin America nations, as well as Greece, Tunisia, Egypt, and other former Ottoman
      colonies, won nominal political freedom from colonialist control. But to build
      up their own industry they had to take on foreign debt – on which they almost
      immediately defaulted, which enabled their creditors to establish monetary authorities
      in charge of their fiscal policy.


      The governments of these countries were turned into collection agents for international
      bankers by the late 19th century. Financial dependency on bankers and bondholders
      replaced colonial dependency, obliging debtor countries to give fiscal priority
      to foreign creditors.


      World War II enabled many of these countries to accumulate substantial foreign
      monetary reserves as a result of supplying raw materials to the belligerents.
      But the post-war order designed by U.S. diplomats, based on free trade and free
      capital movements, drained these savings, and obliged the Global South and other
      countries to borrow to cover their trade deficits.


      The resulting foreign debts soon came to exceed the ability of these countries
      to pay – that is, to pay without surrendering to the destructive IMF demands for
      austerity that blocked the investment needed to raise their productivity and living
      standards.


      There was no way that they could meet their own development needs to invest in
      basic infrastructure and provide industrial and agricultural subsidies, public
      education, health care, and other basic social spending that is characterized
      by the leading industrial nations. This still remains the case.


      Their choice today, therefore, is between paying their foreign debts – at the
      cost of blocking their own development – or claiming that these debts are odious
      and insisting that they be written off.


      At issue is whether debtor countries will gain the sovereignty that is supposed
      to characterize an international economy of equals, free of foreign post-colonial
      control over their tax and trade policies, as well as their national patrimony.


      Their self-determination can only be achieved by joining together in a collective
      front.


      Donald Trump’s tariff aggression has catalyzed this process by drastically reducing
      the U.S. market for exports from debtor countries, preventing them from obtaining
      the dollars to pay their bonds and bank debts, so these won’t be paid in any event.


      The world is now busy de-dollarizing.


      The need to create an alternative to the U.S.-centered post-war order was expressed
      in 1955 at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, and then later by the Non-Aligned
      Movement. But these countries lacked a critical mass of self-sufficiency among
      themselves to act together.


      Attempts to create a New International Economic Order in the 1960s faced the same
      problem. Countries were not industrially, agriculturally, or financially strong
      enough to “go it alone.”


      Today’s Western debt crisis, de-industrialization, and coercive weaponization
      of foreign trade and financial sanctions under the dollarized international financial
      system, capped by the “America First” tariff policy, have created an urgent need
      for countries to collectively seek economic sovereignty, to become independent
      from U.S. and European control of the international economy.


      The collective BRICS+, with Russia and China taking the lead, have just begun
      talking about making such an attempt.


      China’s success has made a global alternative attainable


      The great catalyst for countries to take control of their national development
      has been China. As indicated above, its industrial socialism has largely achieved
      the classical aim of industrial capitalism of minimizing rentier overhead, above
      all by publicly creating money to finance tangible growth.


      Keeping money and credit creation in government hands, via China’s state-owned
      banks, prevents financial and other rentier interests from taking over the economy
      and subjecting it to the financial overhead that has characterized Western economies.


      China’s successful alternative for allocating credit avoids making purely financial
      gains at the expense of tangible capital formation and living standards. That
      is why it is viewed as an existential threat to the current Western banking model.


      Western financial systems are overseen by central banks that have been made independent
      from the Treasury and government regulatory “interference.” Their role is to provide
      the commercial banking system’s liquidity as it creates interest-bearing debt,
      mainly for the purpose of making wealth financially by debt leveraging (asset-price
      inflation), not for productive capital formation.


      Capital gains – rising prices for housing and other real estate, stocks, and bonds
      – are much larger than GDP growth. They can be made easily and quickly by banks
      creating more credit to bid up prices for buyers of these assets.


      Instead of the financial system being industrialized, Western industrial corporations
      have become financialized, and that has occurred along lines that have deindustrialized
      the U.S. and European economies.


      Financialized wealth can be made without being part of the production process.
      Interest, late charges, other financial fees and capital gains are not a “product,”
      yet are counted as such in today’s GDP statistics.


      Carrying charges on the rising debt overhead are transfer payments to the finance
      sector, by labor and businesses, out of wages and profits earned by actual production.
      That shrinks the income available for spending on the products produced by labor
      and capital, leaving economies debt-ridden and deindustrialized.


      The strategy of creditor-rentier nations to prevent withdrawal from their global
      control


      The broadest strategy to block countries from avoiding the rentier burden has
      been to wage an ideological campaign from the educational system to mass media.
      The aim is to control the narrative in a way that depicts government as an oppressive
      Leviathan, an inherently bureaucratic autocracy.


      Western “democracy” is defined not so much politically as economically, as a free
      market whose resources are allocated by a banking and financial sector independent
      of regulatory oversight.


      Governments strong enough to limit financial and other rentier wealth in the public
      interest are demonized as autocracies or “planned economics” — as if shifting
      credit and resource allocation to the financial centers of Wall Street, London,
      Paris, and Japan does not result in an economy planned by the financial sector
      in its own interest, with the aim of creating monetary fortunes. Its aim is not
      to improve the overall economy and living standards.


      Global Majority officials and administrators who have studied economics at U.S.
      and European universities have been indoctrinated with a value-free (that is,
      rent-free) pro-rentier ideology to frame the way they think about how economies
      work.


      This narrative excludes consideration of how debt polarizes economies by growing
      exponentially at compound interest. Also excluded from mainstream economic logic
      is the classical contrast between productive and unproductive credit and investment,
      and the related distinction between earned income (wages and profits, the main
      components of value) and unearned income (economic rent).


      Beyond this ideological campaign, neoliberal diplomacy uses military force, regime
      change, and control of the main international bureaucracies associated with the
      United Nations, the IMF, and World Bank — and a more covert network of non-government
      organizations (NGOs) — to prevent countries from withdrawing from today’s pro-rentier
      fiscal rules and pro-creditor laws.


      The United States has taken the lead in using force and regime change against
      governments that would tax away or otherwise limit rent extraction.


      It should be noted that few early socialists (except anarchists) advocated violence
      in pursuit of their reforms. It has been the vested interests, unwilling to accept
      loss of the privileges that are the basis of their fortunes, who have not hesitated
      to use violence to defend their wealth and power against attempts at reform to
      check their privileges.


      To be sovereign, nations must create an alternative that enables them to be in
      charge of their own economic, monetary, and political development. But American
      diplomacy views any attempt to enact the necessary political and tax reforms and
      strong government regulatory authority as posing an existential threat to U.S.
      control over international finance and trade.


      This raises the question of whether it is possible to achieve reforms and a strong
      public economy without war. It is natural for countries to wonder whether they
      can achieve economic sovereignty without a revolution, such as the Soviet Union,
      China, and other countries that fought to end their domination by their foreign-supported
      landlords and creditors.


      The only way to protect economic sovereignty against military threats is to join
      an alliance for mutual support, since individual countries can be isolated in
      the way that Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran have been — or destroyed, like Libya.


      As Benjamin Franklin put matters, “If we don’t hang together, we will hang separately.”


      American writers characterize the attempt of other countries to join together
      to achieve economic sovereignty as a civilizational war. While this is indeed
      a civilizational contest, it is the United States and its allies that are waging
      aggression, against countries trying to withdraw from a system that has provided
      the United States and Europe with a huge inflow of economic rents and debt service
      from host countries subject to U.S.-backed diplomacy.


      How U.S.-centered financial colonialism replaced European colonial occupation


      After World War II, the era of settler-state colonialism gave way to financial
      colonialism, with the international economy dollarized under U.S. leadership.


      The Bretton Woods rules established by 1945 enabled multinational corporations
      to keep economic rents for land, natural resources and public infrastructure out
      of domestic fiscal reach. Governments were reduced to the role of acting as collection
      agents for foreign creditors and as protectors of foreign investors from democratic
      attempts to tax rentier wealth.


      The United States was able to weaponize world trade by monopolizing oil exports
      through U.S. and allied oil companies (the Seven Sisters), while U.S. and European
      agricultural protectionism and World Bank “aid” policy steered food-deficit countries
      to focus on tropical plantation crops instead of grain to feed themselves.


      President Bill Clinton’s 1994 NAFTA free-trade agreement swamped Mexico’s market
      with low-priced U.S. farm exports (highly subsidized by strong government support).
      Mexican grain production plummeted, leaving it food-dependent.


      To block governments from taxing or even fining foreign investors to recover compensation
      for damages to their countries, today’s rentier powers have created Investor-State
      Dispute Settlement (ISDS) courts requiring governments to compensate foreign investors
      for increasing taxes or imposing regulations that reduce foreign-owned income.
      (I provide the details of this in Chapter 7 of my 2022 book The Destiny of Civilization.)


      This system blocks national sovereignty, including by preventing host countries
      from taxing the economic rent of their land and natural resources owned by foreigners.
      The effect is to make these resources part of the investor-nation economy, not
      their own. (The Saudi oil company Aramco, for instance, was not a corporately
      distinct corporate affiliate but a branch of Standard Oil of New York (ESSO).
      This legal nicety meant that its income and expenses were consolidated into the
      parent company’s U.S. balance sheet. That enabled it to receive a tax credit for
      the “depletion allowance” for oil, rendering the company effectively free of U.S.
      income tax, although it was Saudi oil that was being depleted.)


      Other nations permitted the United States to dictate the post-World War II order,
      with it promising generous aid to support free trade, peace, and post-colonial
      national sovereignty, as spelled out in the United Nations Charter. But the United
      States squandered its wealth on military spending abroad and financial wealth
      addiction at home.


      That has left America’s post-industrial power based mainly on its ability to harm
      other countries with chaos if they do not accept the U.S. “rules-based order”
      designed to extract tribute from them.


      The U.S. imposes protectionist tariffs and import quotas at will, and subsidizes
      agriculture and key technologies as potential global high-tech monopolies, while
      forbidding other countries from implementing such “socialist” or “autocratic”
      policies to become more competitive. The result is a double standard in which
      the U.S. “rules-based order” (its own rules) replaces adherence to international
      law.


      U.S. agricultural price support policy initiated under Franklin D. Roosevelt in
      the 1930s provides a good example of double standards. It made farming the most
      heavily subsidized and protected sector. It became the model for the European
      Economic Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced in 1962.


      However, U.S. diplomacy opposes the attempts of other countries, especially Global
      South countries, to impose their own protectionist subsidies and import quotas
      aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in basic food production — while U.S. “aid
      lending” and the World Bank have (as indicated above) supported the exportation
      of tropical plantation crops by Global South countries by lending for transportation
      and port development. U.S. policy has consistently opposed family-owned farming
      and land reform throughout Latin America and other Global South countries, often
      with violence.


      Moves toward a multipolar world order


      It is not surprising that, inasmuch as Russia has long been the United States’
      main military adversary, it has taken the lead in protesting against the unipolar
      U.S. order.


      Advocating a multipolar alternative to the U.S. neoliberal order in June 2025,
      Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the post-colonial economic subjugation
      of the countries that achieved political independence from colonialist rule in
      the 19th and 20th centuries but which are now facing the next task needed to complete
      their liberation:


      Our African friends are paying more and more attention to the fact that their
      entire economies are still largely based on siphoning off natural resources from
      these countries. In fact, all value added is produced and pocketed by the former
      Western metropoles and other European Union and NATO members. … The West is using
      illegal unilateral sanctions, which increasingly become the harbinger of a military
      attack, as this has happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and is now happening
      in Iran, as well as the instruments of unfair competition, initiating tariff wars,
      seizing other countries’ sovereign assets and taking advantage of the role of
      their currencies and payment systems. The West itself has actually buried the
      globalization model, which it developed after the Cold War to promote its interests.


      Marco Rubio made the same point in the U.S. Senate hearings to confirm him as
      Donald Trump’s Secretary of State, explaining that the “postwar global order is
      not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us.”


      Violating the rules of foreign trade and investment that the United States itself
      dictated in 1945, and yet another instance of Washington resorting to the “rules-based
      order” of its own rules, President Trump’s unilateral tariffs aimed both at shifting
      the New Cold War’s military costs onto other countries, which are expected to
      buy American arms and provide proxy armies, and at reviving the U.S.’s lost industrial
      power by forcing countries to relocate industries to the United States and to
      permit U.S. companies to extract monopoly rents by controlling the leading emerging
      technologies.


      The United States aims to impose monopoly rights and related rentier privileges
      uniquely favorable to itself on the entire world’s trade and investment. Trump’s
      “America First” diplomacy demands that other countries conduct their trade, payments
      and debt relationships in U.S. dollars, instead of their own currencies.


      The U.S. “rule of law” is one that permits unilateral U.S. demands to impose trade
      and financial sanctions dictating how and with whom foreign countries can trade
      and invest. They are threatened with economic chaos and confiscation of their
      dollar reserves if they do not boycott trade and investment relations with Russia,
      China, and other countries refusing to submit to U.S. control.


      The United States’ leverage to obtain these foreign concessions is no longer industrial
      leadership and financial strength, but its ability to cause chaos for other countries.
      Claiming to be the indispensable nation, the U.S.’s ability to disrupt trade is
      ending its former international monetary and diplomatic power.


      That power originally was based on U.S. holdings of the world’s largest monetary
      gold reserves in 1945, its status as the largest creditor nation and industrial
      economy, and, after 1971, its dollar hegemony, arising in large part as a result
      of its financial market being the safest for other nations to hold their official
      monetary reserves.


      The diplomatic inertia created by these former advantages no longer reflects the
      realities of 2025. What U.S. officials do have is the ability to disrupt the world’s
      trade, supply chains, and financial arrangements, including the SWIFT system for
      international payments.


      The U.S. and European confiscation of $300 billion of Russia’s monetary deposits
      has darkened America’s reputation for financial safety, while its chronic trade
      and balance-of-payments deficits threaten to disrupt the international monetary
      system and free trade that made it the major beneficiary of the 1945-2025 world
      order.


      In keeping with the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference in
      other countries’ internal affairs that underlay the creation of the United Nations
      (the basic principle of international law grounded in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia),
      Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov described (in his speech cited above) the need
      “to establish foreign trade mechanisms [that] the West will be unable to control,
      such as transport corridors, alternative payment systems and supply chains.”


      As an example of how the United States had paralyzed the World Trade Organization,
      which it had created on the basis of free trade at a time when America was the
      world’s leading export power, he explained:


      When the Americans realized that the globalized system they had created – one
      built on fair competition, inviolable property rights, the presumption of innocence,
      and similar principles, and which had allowed them to dominate for decades – had
      also begun benefiting their rivals, primarily China, they took drastic action.
      As China started outplaying them on their own turf and by their own rules, Washington
      simply blocked the WTO’s Appellate Body. By artificially stripping it of a quorum,
      they rendered this key dispute settlement mechanism inactive – and it remains
      so to this day.


      The United States has been able to block foreign opposition to its nationalist
      policies by having veto power in the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank. Even
      without such power, U.S. diplomats have been able to block United Nations organizations
      from acting independently of U.S. wishes by refusing to appoint leaders or judges
      not primarily loyal to U.S. foreign policy.


      The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), charged with keeping nuclear proliferation
      in check is the most recent notorious case in point. Iran published documents
      showing that the agency’s leader Rafael Grossi provided U.S. and Israeli intelligence
      with the names of Iranian scientists who were killed, and details of the Iranian
      nuclear refinement sites that were bombed.


      The U.S. veto has prevented the UN Security Council from condemning Israeli attacks
      on the Palestinian population. And when the International Criminal Court (ICC)
      brought charges against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for committing
      war crimes and crimes against humanity in a genocide against the Palestinians,
      U.S. officials imposed sanctions on the ICC and demanded the removal of the prosecutor.


      The world no longer is to be governed by international law, but by unilateral
      U.S. rules, subject to abrupt change depending on the vicissitudes of American
      economic or military power (or loss thereof).


      As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin described this new state of affairs in 2022,
      “Western countries have been saying for centuries that they bring freedom and
      democracy to other nations,” yet the “unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic
      and unfree; it is false and hypocritical through and through.”


      The United States’ self-image depicts its long dominant world position as reflecting
      its democracy, free market, and equality of opportunity that has enabled its power
      elite, in their view, to acquire their status by being the economy’s most productive
      members, through their management and allocation of savings and credit.


      The reality is that the United States has become a rentier oligarchy, one that
      is increasingly hereditary. Its members’ fortunes are made mainly by acquiring
      rent-yielding assets (land, natural resources, and monopolies) on which they make
      capital gains, while paying most of their rent as interest to their bankers, who
      end up with much of these rents and have become the new oligarchy’s leading managerial
      class.


      Summary


      The real conflict over what kind of economic and political system the Global Majority
      will have is just gaining momentum.


      Global South countries and others have been driven so deeply into debt that they
      have been obliged to sell off their public infrastructure to pay its carrying
      charges. Recovering control of their natural resources and basic infrastructure
      requires the fiscal right to impose an economic-rent tax on their land, natural
      resources and monopolies, as well as the legal right to recover environmental
      cleanup costs caused by foreign oil and mining firms, and to implement financial
      cleanup costs (i.e., write offs and cancellation) of the foreign debt burden imposed
      by creditors who have not taken responsibility to ensure that their loans can
      be paid under existing conditions.


      U.S. evangelistic rhetoric describes the imminent political and economic fracture
      of the world economy as a “Clash of Civilizations” between democracies (i.e.,
      countries that support U.S. policy) and autocracies (i.e., nations acting independently).


      It would be more accurate to describe this fracture as a fight by the United States
      and its European and other Western allies against civilization — assuming civilization
      entails, as it seems it must, the sovereign right of countries to enact their
      own laws and tax systems for the benefit of their own populations within an international
      system that has a common set of basic rules and values.


      What Western ideologues call democracy and free markets has turned out to be an
      aggressive rentier-financial imperialism. And what they call autocracy is a government
      strong enough to prevent economic polarization between a super-rich rentier class
      and an impoverished population at large, such as is occurring within the Western
      oligarchies themselves.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that while industrial capitalism initially
      aimed to dismantle feudal economic rents in Europe, contemporary Global Majority
      countries continue to struggle against foreign debt and rent extraction by Western
      powers, necessitating reforms to reclaim their economic sovereignty through taxing
      land and resource rents, akin to the historical paths taken by industrialized
      nations.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the historical and ongoing struggle of
      nations, particularly in the Global South, to free their economies from the legacy
      of colonialism and the rentier system that benefits Western financial interests.
      It highlights how industrial capitalism in Europe sought to eliminate economic
      rents from feudalism to foster competitive manufacturing, but this aim has been
      undermined in the modern era by rising land and resource rents in private hands,
      coupled with the privatization of infrastructure. The article argues that the
      neoliberal economic order perpetuates dependency through foreign debt and free
      trade agreements that favor creditor nations, preventing developing countries
      from achieving economic sovereignty. It posits that successful models like China's
      state-controlled economy challenge this order by minimizing rentier overhead,
      and advocates for taxing economic rents as a means for these nations to stabilize
      their economies and reclaim fiscal autonomy. Ultimately, it calls for collective
      action among Global South countries to overcome the financial colonialism that
      has replaced traditional colonialism, emphasizing the need for solidarity to achieve
      self-determination and economic independence.

    text: '07.10.2025 NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi everybody. Today is Thursday, July 10, 2025,
      and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson are back with us. Welcome back.
      RICHARD WOLFF: Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Let me start, Michael, with what’s
      going on with BRICS here in Rio de Janeiro. They’ve started the summit and they
      were talking about many things, but one of the main issues is the tariffs and
      the way that the United States is dealing with the rest of the world. You’re taking
      that so far with the BRICS. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I think as far as the response
      of the BRICS is concerned, it’s really Russia and China. Russia’s President Putin
      and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have been the most explicit in spelling out
      exactly what the BRICS need and the obvious reason for it, namely that Russia
      and China are the main object of U.S. attack, which includes an attack on BRICS.
      I think that the breakaway from US control is made urgent right now by the actions
      of Trump’s administration. But the rest of the BRICS are more reactive than proactive.
      They’re complaining, but they haven’t really put in specific policies by which
      to free themselves. They realize something which Trump realizes (while economists
      and the public shy from acknowledging it): that the post-war American era is over.
      But there’s still very little discussion of creating a real alternative. The BRICS
      closing report emphasized that they want higher quotas for the International Monetary
      Fund and the World Bank, but that doesn’t provide an alternative to the U.S. neoliberal
      worldview. It doesn’t really talk about what kind of alternative institutions
      they need to avoid the whole neoliberal development trap that was imposed by America
      in 1945 and has made it very rich for the past 80 years, but is not making America
      rich anymore. Now, all of a sudden, America is changing all of the rules. And
      the fact is, the BRICS have yet to decide their own rules. The only alternatives
      of a leader that I see are those by the Russian leader. Let me talk about what’s
      happening in the U.S. so I can give the context for BRICS. What’s happening in
      America is much like what happened to the Soviet Union in the 1990s when it was
      breaking up. There’s a grab-itization, a grab bag. The post-war elite see that
      the game is over and they’re taking everything they can at the economy’s expense.
      They’re carving it up, raising monopoly prices, lowering the tax on themselves,
      cutting off government programs. The class war is really back in business. I think
      the same thing is happening in Europe. The European military stocks are soaring
      in price. Governments are scaling back public spending and creating a social crisis.
      In Britain, Germany, and France, wages are going down. The same thing’s happening
      in Japan. So America’s allies are experiencing the same kind of breakdown that
      the United States is. The question is, what’s going to take the place of this
      new kind of grab-itization, where the United States says: “Well, we can’t follow
      the old rules of free trade and investment that made us rich for the last 80 years.
      We’re going to impose tribute on you. What are you going to do about it?” The
      question is, can the West prevent the global majority (which I think is more important
      than the BRICS) from becoming a prosperous new center, growing without U.S. control,
      making itself the beneficiary of its trade and investment rather than foreign
      investors? All the United States can do to stop it right now is to act as a wrecker.
      And within BRICS, it’s trying to use, I think, India and Brazil to weaken any
      real break from U.S. policy. I think Trump’s imposition of the 50% tariffs on
      Brazil yesterday was trying to bully it into submission to the United States.
      And he said that if Brazil imposes reciprocal tariffs on the United States, he’s
      going to raise the tariffs on Brazil to more than 50%. After I hear Richard’s
      take, I want to discuss what I think the global majority and the BRICS really
      need. RICHARD WOLFF: Okay. I agree, but I would come at it a little differently.
      I’ve been struck by what the BRICS have achieved. I agree with Michael, the blueprint
      for how to get beyond where we are now is not there yet. I don’t think they’ve
      come up with it. I think they are not sure themselves. I think there are too many
      disagreements and divisions among them that they haven’t worked out. [Interruption]
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the key is that the world’s splitting into two parts. U.S.
      diplomats can see it, they see this as a civilizational split, but BRICS and the
      global majority aren’t treating it this way. Everyone knows there’s a break from
      the past, but BRICS are not clear-eyed about being in the same position today
      that Britain and France and Europe were in 200 years ago when they were trying
      to free themselves from feudalism, from the hereditary aristocracy charging land
      rent – industrial capitalism wanted to free itself from all of this. That’s what
      the BRICS will have to do. RICHARD WOLFF: Let me point out that we oughtn’t to
      be in a rush. Michael is right, but it’s really only been about 16 or 17 years
      since BRICS started. The first few were just getting it started. Now they are
      clearly underway. They have grown in number. They have the two levels of participation,
      the member and the partner, if I have their language correctly. And they did hit
      that milestone a week or two ago when the total amount of trade among them crossed
      the $1 trillion value. That’s an impressive development. We all have to thank
      Mr. Trump, because his tariff program has been a tremendous boost on increasing
      trade among them (since obviously when they trade amongst each other, Mr. Trump’s
      tariffs don’t have any impact, at least not directly). So I’m pretty impressed,
      given all of their differences on many, many issues, that they’ve been able to
      stay together. The second thing I would argue is the grab-itization. I like the
      term if Michael invented that; grabbing everything is a good metaphor, but I would
      like to extend it a little further. The tariff game has a number of benefits to
      it. Number one, it can exact a certain amount of tribute. Although, let’s remember,
      in the end, the tribute is going to be coming from the Americans to their own
      defunct government. We don’t know yet how much of it will be in the end funded
      by the other countries. Mr. Trump loves to talk about tariffs, about what they
      do to the other country. But the first victim of a tariff are the Americans who
      have to pay it, not the foreigners. And it’s an open question, depending on many
      variables, as to how much of the tariff the American who pays it will be able
      to push back onto the foreign country to lower their prices and offset the tariffs’
      effect. Some of that will happen. But much of the effect will be to raise prices
      in the United States. Let me give you one example that became popular 24 hours
      ago. It turns out that the vast majority (90 percent or more) of the shoes and
      sneakers that Americans wear are imported. They’re imported mostly from about
      six countries, all of whom have seen enormous tariffs imposed on them. The estimate
      of the American shoe companies is that they will have to raise the prices about
      37% to deal with the tariffs of 40 to 50 to 60 percent that have been levied on
      many of the countries that produce shoes. Now, that part of the inflation hasn’t
      hit yet in the United States, but it is being already factored into the calculations
      of all of these companies. So I think it’s important to understand that the effect
      of the tariffs, in terms of the U.S. versus BRICS or the rest, is unresolved.
      Next, levying these tariffs – it’s clear that Trump understands this part of it
      – is a way of breaking up any unity e.g. between Vietnam and China around certain
      issues, or the unity that the BRICS have established among the members and partners.
      Because what it does is to encourage the countries to compete with one another
      for the favor of the United States. This is clearly divisive for the BRICS. It
      means that they are perhaps saying one thing while cutting deals with Washington
      underneath the surface. We will learn about that in the months and years ahead.
      But it would be naive not to think that that’s going on. You can see the impact
      of that particular strategy because its biggest victim is Europe, where there’s
      a failure to get together because those countries don’t trust one another not
      to do secret deals with the United States. The continent doesn’t trust Britain,
      and vice versa. France and Germany do not trust each other. Each one worries that
      if they go too far in being anti-Trump, he will favor the other ones over them.
      Etc etc. Europe has been suffering from the failure of how it came out of feudalism
      – all this nationalist noise has cost them very dearly ever since. Finally, another
      dimension. If you look closely at what Trump said about the threat to Brazil and
      the 50% tariff, the argument he made was that he wants to stop the investigation
      into Bolsonaro. He’s not happy with that. He wants allies over there and he wants
      to punish them because of their internal judicial procedures, which is a remarkable
      rationale for a tariff. I mean, we’re not used to seeing that kind of thing. That
      would have been kept a secret, if it were an objective in all of this. But given
      the way Mr. Trump works, this all does seem to be a mess, a mess of tariffs interwoven
      with ideological commitments, interwoven with long-term political goals that are
      poorly defined and probably not achievable anyway. So I’m driven to do what my
      friend Yanis Varoufakis does, to find the method in the madness. I’m glad we’re
      doing that, and we should do it. But we shouldn’t forget that there’s a lot of
      madness here and a lot of multiple clashing objectives that are not going to work
      out. And that’ll help us avoid seeing too much logic, too much management. And
      so I end up not being critical so much of the BRICS, easy though that is to do.
      Could they do more? Yes. Could they have gone further? Yes. But even Lula, if
      I could conclude on that, did an interesting thing in his most recent speech that
      I’ve read. He says, “I am not one of those who attacks globalization. The problem
      wasn’t globalization.” The problem was – he doesn’t use these words, but I’ll
      put them in his mouth – American imperialism. The United States used a globalized
      economy to its own ends. Mr. Lula wants everyone to understand that globalization
      is still on the agenda, and he, for one, favors it. I see there the echo of the
      Chinese and others supporting free trade, repositioning the world around this
      old capitalist struggle, free trade versus protectionism. They are becoming cleverly
      the champions of a free trade regime against the narrow, backward-looking, MAGA
      protectionism. That, I think, is a very powerful image, changing what is the advanced
      world and what is the less developed world. It doesn’t substitute the strategy
      of economic development (which remains to be spelled out), but it is very smartly
      reconceptualizing what’s going on in the world in terms of globalization and protectionism.
      And that is very different from the United States’ way of understanding the world
      economy. MICHAEL HUDSON: I think you’re right. What is really at issue is the
      kind of economic system the world going to have, at least the world outside of
      the United States. The problem is not just capitalism. It’s particularly the European
      and the American version of what capitalism has become, which is very different
      from how it began. The global majority countries today are facing a problem very
      much like the one faced by Europe when it broke away from feudalism, from the
      control of the past, from the control of a predatory, hereditary aristocracy that
      was holding the land and charging its rents and establishing monopolies to pay
      its foreign debts and had a predatory banking system. The whole system had to
      be revised. That’s what made industrial capitalism revolutionary. Industrial capitalism
      wanted to free economies from this whole burden of the rentier class that had
      emerged out of feudalism. And the solution from Adam Smith and the French physiocrats
      and the rest of the classical economists was this: If we tax the rentiers (who
      live on economic rent, unearned income)… if we tax the land, if we tax the monopolies
      and prevent monopolies and make them into the public domain, then we’re going
      to become a low-cost economy. And if England is going to be the workshop of the
      world, we cannot afford to have the costs of this post-feudal rentier class. We’re
      going to have to get rid of them. Well, let’s look at the situation today. Just
      as Britain and France and Germany had to free their economies from feudalism’s
      rentier burden, the BRICS countries and most of the global majority countries
      need to free themselves from the rent overhead inherited from the epoch of European
      colonialism and its creditor control. But the problem is that this rentier control
      is international. It’s foreign. It’s American and European much more than domestic
      investors. It’s the multinational firms that have taken control of the raw materials
      resources, the mineral resources, the oil and the land. It’s the foreign investors
      that have bought up the natural infrastructure monopolies and are bleeding them
      for everything they can do. And it’s the foreign investors that have financed
      local banking and control the local credit system along neoliberal lines. What
      is unique today is that the BRICS haven’t come up with the same solution that
      the classical economists came up with to free industrial capitalism in the early
      19th century from all of this feudal structure. That’s what needs to be done,
      and yet they don’t have a body of classical economists. Most of their economists,
      officials and administrators have been sent to American universities to study.
      When they take an economics course, there’s nothing about classical economics;
      there’s no such thing as economic rent; everybody earns whatever they have; there’s
      no exploitation at all. Whereas classical economics was all about exploitation.
      That’s what economic rent is. It’s unearned income. Today the unearned income
      isn’t paid simply to the global majorities or the BRICS domestic ruling class.
      It’s paid to American and European foreign investors, multinationals. And if they
      were to do what Europe did to become a competitive industrial economy, they’d
      then be able to say, “We have sovereignty. And our sovereignty is going to be
      to do just what Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and his followers said. We’re
      going to tax the economic rent of the oil industry, the mining industry. We’re
      going to tax away monopolies and we’re going to have our own antitrust laws so
      that foreign investors can make normal profits on what they invest, but we’re
      not going to let them make super profits and economic rent.” “And we’re going
      to define the income they make, the taxable income, as their overall cash flow.
      We’re not going to allow foreign investors to say they didn’t make any income
      because they spent all of our income paying interest to ourselves and charging
      depreciation on the oil and minerals that they exhaust, for which there’s a tax
      write-off so that they don’t pay any taxes.” The entire system that has been put
      in place to promote the anti-classical pro-rentier ideological revolution that
      occurred in the early 20th century and flowered under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald
      Reagan has to be replaced by late 19th-century industrial capitalism evolving
      into socialism, into a mixed public-private economy where the government regulated
      natural monopolies and taxed away economic rent. The classical economists’ idea
      of a free market, as we’ve discussed before, was a market free from economic rent,
      not free for the rentiers or free of any government taxation or regulation of
      the economy. So, suppose that the BRICS countries said, “We’re going to develop
      our industry in the same way that England, France, Germany, and the United States
      developed their industry with a mixed public-private economy, blocking economic
      rent from adding to the cost of production. And if we don’t do that, we can’t
      industrialize.” “And by the way, the other feudal burden we have is the foreign
      debt that we’ve been loaded down with because of the way in which the post-war
      economic order was created in 1945.” The Global South countries emerged from World
      War II with very abundant foreign reserves because they’ve been selling raw materials
      to the Allies during the war. And the way in which the United States designed
      the IMF and the World Bank and free trade agreements led to the Global South countries
      losing the reserves they’d accumulated during the war, by falling into trade dependency
      and increasingly into debt dependency. All of that has to be thrown away just
      as Europe threw away the feudal burden, the feudalism that it had. And the fight
      to free themselves from the foreign investment which (as Lula said) mainly is
      coordinated by the United States is the counterpart to how Europe achieved its
      prosperity. Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia gave a wonderful speech about the
      need to establish foreign trade mechanisms that the West will be unable to control,
      such as transport corridors, alternative payment systems, and supply chains. And
      as an example, he cited how the United States has paralyzed the World Trade Organization
      that it created on the basis of free trade, but now free trade doesn’t help America
      because America is deindustrialized. I’ll quote what Lavrov said: “When the Americans
      realized that the globalized system they’d created – one built on fair competition,
      inviolable property rights, the presumption of innocence and similar principles,
      and which had allowed them to dominate for decades – had also begun to benefit
      their rivals, primarily China, they took drastic action. As China started outplaying
      them on their own turf and by their own rules, Washington simply blocked the WTO’s
      Appellate body. By artificially stripping it of a quorum, they rendered this key
      dispute settlement mechanism inactive, and it remains so to this day.” What if
      the BRICS and the global majority countries were saying, what China has done in
      a way followed the exact logic of industrial capitalism when it was emerging!
      China has kept property and land in the public domain. It hasn’t permitted monopolies
      to be private. It hasn’t permitted a private banking system to financialize the
      economy and make loans for corporate takeovers and buy up industrial corporations
      and use their profits for stock buybacks and dividend payouts. China has done
      exactly what Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and the industrial capitalists wanted
      to do, as well as evolving the way industrial capitalism did. For the BRICS to
      become independent of this system that has driven them into debt and debt and
      trade dependency and food dependency, they would have to say: China has provided
      a modern version of the classical free market model free of exploitative rents.
      And we’re going to follow that. But that requires us stripping away the foreign
      ownership of our oil, raw materials, resources, our monopolies. And if we can’t
      nationalize them – we realize that’s out of the question – at least we can tax
      all of their unearned income, the unearned income that David Ricardo and Smith
      and John Stuart Mill and Marx and Veblen, the whole 19th century, spent so much
      effort defining. RICHARD WOLFF: Let me get at this in a slightly different way.
      Here, I’m going to be relying on Marx and his particular way of dealing with this.
      You might say that the break out of feudalism, whether it’s in the form of Smith
      and Ricardo or any of the others, comes out of a recognition that rent on land
      has much to do with the growth of population. That’s why a square foot in New
      York City costs a great deal more than a square foot in Nebraska, right? It is
      not about the soil. It’s not about investments that have been put on the land
      or not. It’s basically that more and more people getting an advantage out of being
      in an agglomerated population enable whoever owns the land simply to raise the
      rent, and it becomes more and more. The anti-feudal people can be thought of as
      having come up with a eureka moment. And in the eureka moment, they realized that
      in order to have access to land, you do not need a landlord. In other words, you
      can, figuratively or not, get rid of the landlord and you still have the land,
      which is what the rest of the population or the rest of the economy needs. Well,
      Marx, in a moment of humor, said the only difference between him and those folks
      who figured out what I just said is that he wants to add that exactly the same
      is true of capital. Do we need machines? Absolutely. Do we need factories and
      offices? Yes. Do we need the owners of those things who can take huge portions
      of our output in order to give us access? No. We can produce those things. You
      know how we know it? Because we already do. It’s workers who make machines. It’s
      workers who erect buildings. It’s workers who do all that anyway. So if the workers
      do it, why would there be others who aren’t workers gathering a revenue? It makes
      no more sense, Marx says, than having the landlord who inherited from his grandfather
      a certain spot of land being able to siphon off a huge amount of revenue. Then
      the punchline, just as Michael said, is if that revenue were acquired by an agency
      of the community that wanted economic development, then of course they would use
      those revenues for that purpose. And that is the old socialist idea. The people
      do the work, they produce consumer goods for their own consumption, they produce
      means of production in order to become more productive as a community. In order
      for this story to be told, you don’t need a separate social class gathering into
      its hands the revenue and only devoting that to growing the well-being of the
      community if that were their objective. But we know that if there is such a class,
      capitalism guarantees that the objective they will pursue with the revenue they
      get is profitability. And profitability has nothing to do with what a community
      of workers would do if they themselves were in charge here. So let me offer to
      the BRICS, as Michael did, a strategic focus that might make a real difference:
      The socialism that they have produced to this point, government with massive regulation
      and ownership (as in China, for example) is a step, probably a necessary step…
      but not a sufficient step. What you have to do is to take it further. You have
      to really put the workers in charge, not indirectly through electing some… no,
      no, no. You have to, at the base, in every office, in every factory, in every
      store, put the people who work there in charge. There is no capitalist class anymore.
      You actually have overcome class division because the employer and the employee
      have become the same persons. One of them an individual, the other one a member
      of the collective. No more master vs slave, no more lord vs serf, and no more
      employer vs employee. Then you have the micro foundation to get the very things
      Michael is talking about to become possible. But that means that in the BRICS
      countries – and there is no way that I can see out of this – to the extent that
      there remain employer-employee organizations, you’re going to have to go beyond
      them. And you’re going to have resistance from whoever the employers are, whether
      these are private individuals or state officials. You’re going to have to bite
      the bullet, not in support of an abstract idea, but in support of the necessary
      foundation for that alternative organization of the world economy that Michael
      is talking about and that the BRICS are moving toward, but are not there yet.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: That leaves the question: how do you get from where you are now
      to where you have described as the ultimate dream of socialism? Marx dealt with
      that. He really was the inventor of cost accounting for industrial capitalism.
      He said that the industrial capitalist was much more than a landlord. The landlord’s
      rent did not add to value. It added to price, but there was no cost of production
      for land because land was provided freely by nature. As the economy becomes more
      prosperous and the population grows, there’s an unearned increment. The landlord
      did nothing. But, Marx said, the capitalist does do something. The capitalist
      organized industry. And Marx included the capitalist’s profit as value, not as
      economic rent, because he said the role of industrial capitalists is to make money
      by making surplus value, by employing labor, selling its product at a profit,
      more than they have to pay the labor and the cost of production. But the dynamic
      of industrial capitalism was that the firm, in order to grow, plugs its profit
      back into more capital investment and more employment. And in that sense, he said
      the capitalist plays a productive role under capitalism. He says ultimately, as
      capitalism plays this role of creating industry on a larger and larger scale,
      it is preparing the whole structure for socialists to take over and at a point
      for there to be socialist management. He also described the whole structure of
      the capitalist’s income. Here is the earned part of income, the actual profits
      on the necessary capital investment per factories. But the cost of producing capitalist
      industry included land rent and other things, other factors – and these should
      not be tax-deductible at all. So Marx refined the whole tax ideology of Adam Smith
      and Ricardo and John Stuart Mill and made sense of it all, and said that the industrial
      capitalist was the key to the transition to socialism. In this way China permits
      private profit-making investment, private capitalism on a small scale to develop,
      but it doesn’t let billionaires develop and it doesn’t let industrial capitalism
      by its innovative class – which is very innovative – become financialized and
      turn into financial capitalism, which has ended up destroying and deindustrializing
      capitalism in the Western economies. That’s the big picture, I think, that the
      BRICS and global south economies have. But to do that, they need a whole idea
      of cost accounting and how exactly you tax these firms, so that you can say, we’re
      not going to nationalize you, we’re just going to make sure that you actually
      earn what you produce. If you make a capital investment, you’re permitted to make
      – on the value of the physical capital, mining equipment, and oil drilling equipment
      – a regular profit of, say, six to eight percent. You’re not allowed to make a
      profit on the vast economic rent-paying investments that you’ve made. That’s not
      an investment. We’re dealing with a whole different concept of national income,
      gross national product, and getting rid of transfer payments to the foreign investors
      that are not part of the product at all but are a transfer payment, essentially,
      a tribute to the rentier class that’s largely formed. In order to do that, they’d
      have to read Volumes two and three of Capital, to see how classical economics
      actually evolved in the 19th century. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, I don’t think we disagree,
      except for me, I want to stress the micro-level adjustment change that radically
      reorganizes every enterprise in order that then they can together do what you
      just said. In the interest of reproducing their power and their social situation,
      they have to have rules in place so that, for example, no one enterprise, even
      if it is organized as a cooperative, can have a monopoly position. So that that
      [position] is not available. Whereas we know that capitalism’s competitive nature
      always produces winners and losers and has no reason not to go until there’s only
      one or two or three monopolistic or oligopolistic firms left. The production of
      a monopolist is intrinsic to the capitalist system. It constantly produces and
      reproduces them. That’s why there is Jeffrey Bezos and there is Elon Musk and
      all the rest. Not only is there nothing preventing it, the system is set up so
      that every capitalist that I’ve ever met dreams of having “market share”. Well,
      that’s a none-too-subtle idea. That’s about getting the ability to jack your price
      up above what it would be if you did the kind of cost calculation Michael just
      specified. If we’re going to do our job, we have to specify the political economy
      that could set itself the task of limiting monopoly. And we tried that. We had
      the Sherman Antitrust bill in 1890. We had the Clayton Act in 1914. Those are
      spectacular failures. They haven’t stopped monopolization. Never did. It is a
      fraud. We have an antitrust department that’s another fraud that doesn’t do its
      job. And it doesn’t do it whether it’s Republican or Democrat because that’s built
      into the system. Bank finance depends on what kind of market share you can promise
      the banker you can get with a loan that allows you to wipe out your competitors.
      That would not be possible if you just differentially organized the base. They
      would not permit that because they could all be victimized by it in a way that
      could actually stick. I think, therefore, that these are the next steps of a BRICS.
      But there’s another dimension to this that I don’t want to lose, and I would like
      to hear Michael’s comments. It seems to me that the BRICS already are a historical
      transformation. The fact is – I know I’ve done this before, but I want us to think
      about it – if you add up the GDP of all the BRICS countries now, it’s roughly
      35% of global GDP. If you add up the GDP of the G7, i.e. the United States and
      its major allies, we’re talking about 27 or 28%. For me, that’s it. We’re done.
      We are no longer where we were for the 80 years since Bretton Woods, a world economy
      where the United States and its allies were the obvious global world-shaping economic
      power, and with that, the political, military, and ideological. We are not the
      economic center of the world economy. The United States isn’t. And the gap, we
      crossed the line in 2020. Here we are five years later, and the gap has gotten
      only bigger in favor of the BRICS and against the United States. This, in my judgment,
      sits as a relentless pressure on Mr. Trump, on everybody in this country, whether
      they admit what I just said as a statistic or they don’t. Consciously or unconsciously,
      they have an ominous sense that the march of time itself is now their enemy. So
      there’s a desperation that then comes and produces that grabbing mentality that
      Michael started us off with today. But that is a mentality grounded in an actual
      material transformation. The BRICS, I suspect, somewhere, they know it too. They
      don’t quite know what to do – Michael is right. On the other hand, they are trading
      more with one another than they ever have. And it is not only emergency trading.
      In other words, it’s not just Russia selling oil and gas to China and India because
      they can’t manipulate. Now a final word: because Michael mentioned the Russian
      Foreign Minister Lavrov. In the same speech that Michael refers to, Lavrov gives
      a statistic, and I’ve checked it and it’s correct. Here it is, and it’s something
      to think about. Since the war in Ukraine began in early 2022, the World Bank,
      a Western institution created by the Bretton Woods meetings, has given twice as
      much money to Ukraine as it gives annually to Africa. Now, let me remind you:
      the population of Ukraine is 39 million people. The population of Africa is 1.55
      billion people. Now, there is no justification on earth for such behavior, except
      if you are desperate and you’re mobilizing every nickel you can, you don’t care
      what the fall. That’s behavior of people very different from what we used to see.
      It’s just like Mr. Trump ending foreign aid to Africa and then inviting those
      five sad leaders yesterday to talk to him. Twice as much for the war in Ukraine,
      the 39 million people affected, than you give annually to 1.55 billion. It is
      stupefying if you think about it. Think about the economic development message
      here. Helping Ukraine basically blow away everything because the money is used
      for war versus helping 1.5 billion people who are the victims of economic underdevelopment
      par excellence in the world we live in. It really is kind of breathtaking. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Richard, the population of Ukraine is only 1,000 people. These 1,000 people
      get all of the IMF, all of the World Bank money. This money doesn’t get spent
      on the rest of the population at large. It goes to the client oligarchy. That’s
      the key. But I want to go back to what you talked about, the march of time. The
      question is: how does the American government, which seems to be the most proactive
      mover right now under Trump, stop the march of time from moving in a direction
      that is not in the American national interest? How does it prevent the BRICS from
      developing? That is really what I think should have been the whole focus of the
      conference in Brazil. I think the U.S. plan is indeed, as you point out, based
      on monopoly. In fact, the head of the Federal Reserve this week made very much
      the point that you’re making about monopoly pricing. He said, “Donald Trump is
      trying to force me to lower interest rates [but I want to keep interest rates
      on hold given the uncertain effect of the tariffs] to stop the rise in pricing.”
      But the rise in prices is not caused by money creation. The rise of prices has
      nothing to do with money creation. Companies are realizing that there is no antitrust
      enforcement at all, that they can just gouge and gouge and gouge their customers.
      The grocery stores are gouging. Everybody’s gouging the customers. That’s what
      he said. And of course, that’s right. On a larger scale, I ask, how is the U.S.
      going to survive as a monopoly country imposing on BRICS and the rest of the world
      its monopoly rights and the related rentier privileges that are uniquely favorable
      to itself on the whole world’s trade and investment? Well, Trump’s America wants
      to make other countries dependent on America’s information technology, its internet
      platforms, its military technology. It wants to become itself the great monopoly
      power over other countries. If it can’t achieve its dominance by industrialization,
      it can achieve it by post-industrial monopoly capitalism, which turns out to be
      the final stage of finance capitalism in this case. Thus for Trump and for the
      United States, the rule of law is based on one that permits unilateral U.S. demands
      to impose trade and financial sanctions, dictating how and with foreign countries
      how they can trade and invest with each other. Also, you’d mentioned at the first
      part of your talk: who’s going to pay these tariffs? Is it going to be the American
      consumers or the foreign exporters? Well, a lot of these tariffs won’t be paid
      because the trade won’t exist. Foreigners cannot afford to gain access to the
      American market paying these tariffs, and the Americans cannot afford to buy from
      foreigners with these tariffs in. There’s going to be a shrinkage of world trade
      in all sorts of connections that have been put in place for the last 80 years
      have been pulled up. You’re going to have such an interruption of trade that the
      real question of the BRICS facing them is, well, now if we can’t export to the
      U.S. and we’re not going to import from the U.S., how do we make our trade and
      investment with each other instead of with the United States? That’s what they
      have to do. All of that is going to require the creation of new international
      institutions, which Russia and China are taking the lead in trying to promote.
      The United States is trying to prevent this. They’re trying to do everything they
      can to break up the creation of any alternative. That’s what the Americans themselves
      call this a clash of civilization. The American idea of civilization is the imposition
      of the neoliberal financialized economy. And the alternative is autocracy, dictatorship,
      like America will say you have in China. But America’s idea of democracy is client
      dictatorships. This isn’t the democracy of countries that are growing and rejecting
      client dictatorships and taking sovereignty for themselves. We’re dealing with
      the fight not between American civilization and British civilization, but between
      barbarism and the very principle of civilization based on international law, equality
      of nations in terms of sovereignty, freedom from foreign interference, rules of
      war making, all the rules that have been smashed by American policy in the last
      few years. RICHARD WOLFF: I’d like, in the few moments we have left, to turn the
      old free trade argument against all of it. The United States is closing itself
      by a wall of protection. All these prices are going to be raised by virtue of
      the tariffs imposed on them, more or less. And the important thing to keep in
      mind is that in the rest of the world that is not following suit, the prices will
      be lower than what they are in the United States. Not to the same extent everywhere,
      but lower. That begins to be built into the price systems outside, that they become
      more and more differentiated from the monopoly-protected prices inside the United
      States. That will mean that the United States, as a capitalist totality, will
      be in a deteriorating competitive position with the rest of the world, because
      all the inputs here will be higher priced than their equivalents outside the protection
      zone. That’s not a sustainable arrangement, or to put it another way, that will
      become itself a mechanism that over time deteriorates and isolates the United
      States’ capitalism from the rest of the world. So that’s not a viable strategy
      either. The early moments of Mr. Trump throwing it around may look like some kind
      of remarkable innovation, but we all know that the history of capitalism is the
      history of oscillations between free trade and protection. We are not the first
      ones to go through that. And the protection phase, which comes when free trade
      doesn’t work, always turns out to be a dead end. In fact, that’s why we go back
      to free trade again because we have a revulsion against the problems of a protection.
      In sum, this is not discovering a new solution. This is hankering after an old
      one that we should have learned doesn’t work. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, this disparity
      in prices is exactly what Britain was dealing with 200 years ago. It saw that
      other countries had a natural price advantage because they could grow, for one
      thing, they could grow their food and produce raw materials much less expensively
      than Britain. So what did Britain do? Apart from reforming its own economy to
      lower its costs, it said: “We’re going to colonize these countries and we’re going
      to invest in them. We can take ownership of their advantages, ownership of their
      land to produce food and ownership of their raw materials. Then, instead of those
      countries getting the benefit of their low-cost of production, we British and
      other colonialist European owners are going to carve out our ownership of these
      countries’ natural patrimony, land, natural resources, and infrastructure for
      ourselves. They’ll be part of our own economy, not the other countries’ economies.”
      This perception of the threat of lower prices abroad led to British colonialism
      and imperialism, and the development of financial imperialism in the form of multinational
      corporations buying control of all of the basic resources and assets that had
      made these other countries more naturally competitive than Europe (which had the
      burden of its aristocracy and everything). That’s the kind of fight that is being
      waged today. It’s as if we’re seeing a new attempt by Americans to do what the
      European colonists did in taking over Africa and other countries, investing in
      the global south, taking ownership of their resources, and denying the income
      from these resources to their host countries. The global south is a host in the
      sense of host to a parasite taking out its value. This is exactly the fight that
      has to be recognized by the global majority countries. And I think it has been
      recognized by Lavrov’s speech and by the Russians and certainly by the Chinese.
      But the problem is: how are you going to get BRICS to admit this requires a really
      radical restructuring of the world order? This is a civilizational fight. How
      are we going to create a plan for this? So far, they really haven’t developed
      a plan. There was talk about de-dollarization as if somehow that could cure the
      problem, but that goes way beyond getting free of using the U.S. dollar. It’s
      getting the economy free from the whole finance capitalist rentier organization
      of the economy. Of course, that’s what industrial capitalism was supposed to be
      doing as it evolved into socialism. So you’re right. The BRICS and global south
      countries have to evolve into socialism. And the question is: can this be done
      without a revolution? We posed that at the end of the last show. It took a revolution
      in Russia in 1917, a revolution in China in 1945. Can the other BRICS countries
      and the global majority achieve this alternative to the US-European exploitation
      without a revolution? The United States is going to do whatever it can to fight
      against it. And that’s what’s going to be determining the next few years of international
      diplomacy. RICHARD WOLFF: I want to remind everyone not to be too gloomy here.
      You saw the European economies go from the 19th century of more or less free trade
      to the 20th century shifting over to colonization and protection of each colony,
      a set of colonial properties one against the other. That eventuated in World Wars
      I and II. That’s a reason why you don’t want to go down the road of protection,
      accompanied by military forces to impose that protection. Notice that the budget
      just passed by Mr. Trump expands the military and expands the police. That’s so-called
      homeland security. Everything else is cut because you have to focus on protection
      in all the meanings of that word. That has led to war over and over again, especially
      as the beleaguered country tries to stop the others from protecting themselves.
      What happens – and I’m not suggesting it, but – if and when the BRICS were to
      sit down and, as a unit, respond to the tariffs of the United States with a uniform
      tariff among them? Making themselves a common market, and the United States the
      excluded one? People with a memory will see here the very evolution of colonial
      empires – the American, the British, the German, the Japanese – which were the
      20th century’s causes of the greatest world wars the human race has ever seen.
      This is not a solution, what is being done here. This is an act of desperation
      coming out of the grabbing that Michael talked to us at the beginning today. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, to create a common market is exactly what China is trying to do
      with the Belt and Road Initiative. If you’re going to have trade among yourselves,
      you need transportation. You need the Belt and Road. And that’s exactly what the
      United States militarily is trying to do to block it in Afghanistan, in Iran,
      with activities in Azerbaijan. This is exactly what the geopolitical fight of
      the next few years is all about: trying to break the ability of other countries
      to work together and to tear up all the connections, leaving no alternative but
      depend upon the United States and Europe. That’s the new Cold War, and it is a
      war of what kind of civilization is the world going to have, or at least the world
      outside of the golden billion in the United States, Europe, and its allies. NIMA

    paragraph_summary: On July 10, 2025, during a summit in Rio de Janeiro, Richard
      Wolff and Michael Hudson discussed the BRICS nations' response to U.S. tariffs
      and foreign policy, particularly emphasizing the roles of Russia and China as
      targets of U.S. aggression. Hudson noted that while Russia's leadership has articulated
      the need for BRICS to break free from U.S. control, the group remains largely
      reactive without concrete policies for establishing a viable alternative to the
      U.S.-dominated neoliberal order. He pointed out that although the BRICS nations
      are seeking reforms like higher quotas in the International Monetary Fund and
      World Bank, these measures do not constitute a genuine alternative to the existing
      system, which has historically benefited the U.S. but is now shifting under new
      American policies.

    text: '07.10.2025 NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi everybody. Today is Thursday, July 10, 2025,
      and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson are back with us. Welcome back.
      RICHARD WOLFF: Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Let me start, Michael, with what’s
      going on with BRICS here in Rio de Janeiro. They’ve started the summit and they
      were talking about many things, but one of the main issues is the tariffs and
      the way that the United States is dealing with the rest of the world. You’re taking
      that so far with the BRICS. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I think as far as the response
      of the BRICS is concerned, it’s really Russia and China. Russia’s President Putin
      and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have been the most explicit in spelling out
      exactly what the BRICS need and the obvious reason for it, namely that Russia
      and China are the main object of U.S. attack, which includes an attack on BRICS.
      I think that the breakaway from US control is made urgent right now by the actions
      of Trump’s administration. But the rest of the BRICS are more reactive than proactive.
      They’re complaining, but they haven’t really put in specific policies by which
      to free themselves. They realize something which Trump realizes (while economists
      and the public shy from acknowledging it): that the post-war American era is over.
      But there’s still very little discussion of creating a real alternative. The BRICS
      closing report emphasized that they want higher quotas for the International Monetary
      Fund and the World Bank, but that doesn’t provide an alternative to the U.S. neoliberal
      worldview. It doesn’t really talk about what kind of alternative institutions
      they need to avoid the whole neoliberal development trap that was imposed by America
      in 1945 and has made it very rich for the past 80 years, but is not making America
      rich anymore. Now, all of a sudden, America is changing all of the rules. And
      the fact is, the BRICS have yet to decide their own rules. The only alternatives
      of a leader that I see are those by the Russian leader. Let me talk about what’s
      happening in the U.S. so I can give the context for BRICS. What’s happening in
      America is much like what happened to the Soviet Union in the 1990s when it was
      breaking up. There’s a grab-itization, a grab bag. The post-war elite see that
      the game is over and they’re taking everything they can at the economy’s expense.
      They’re carving it up, raising monopoly prices, lowering the tax on themselves,
      cutting off government programs. The class war is really back in business. I think
      the same thing is happening in Europe. The European military stocks are soaring
      in price. Governments are scaling back public spending and creating a social crisis.
      In Britain, Germany, and France, wages are going down. The same thing’s happening
      in Japan. So America’s allies are experiencing the same kind of breakdown that
      the United States is. The question is, what’s going to take the place of this
      new kind of grab-itization, where the United States says: “Well, we can’t follow
      the old rules of free trade and investment that made us rich for the last 80 years.
      We’re going to impose tribute on you. What are you going to do about it?” The
      question is, can the West prevent the global majority (which I think is more important
      than the BRICS) from becoming a prosperous new center, growing without U.S. control,
      making itself the beneficiary of its trade and investment rather than foreign
      investors? All the United States can do to stop it right now is to act as a wrecker.
      And within BRICS, it’s trying to use, I think, India and Brazil to weaken any
      real break from U.S. policy. I think Trump’s imposition of the 50% tariffs on
      Brazil yesterday was trying to bully it into submission to the United States.
      And he said that if Brazil imposes reciprocal tariffs on the United States, he’s
      going to raise the tariffs on Brazil to more than 50%. After I hear Richard’s
      take, I want to discuss what I think the global majority and the BRICS really
      need. RICHARD WOLFF: Okay. I agree, but I would come at it a little differently.
      I’ve been struck by what the BRICS have achieved. I agree with Michael, the blueprint
      for how to get beyond where we are now is not there yet. I don’t think they’ve
      come up with it. I think they are not sure themselves. I think there are too many
      disagreements and divisions among them that they haven’t worked out. [Interruption]
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the key is that the world’s splitting into two parts. U.S.
      diplomats can see it, they see this as a civilizational split, but BRICS and the
      global majority aren’t treating it this way. Everyone knows there’s a break from
      the past, but BRICS are not clear-eyed about being in the same position today
      that Britain and France and Europe were in 200 years ago when they were trying
      to free themselves from feudalism, from the hereditary aristocracy charging land
      rent – industrial capitalism wanted to free itself from all of this. That’s what
      the BRICS will have to do. RICHARD WOLFF: Let me point out that we oughtn’t to
      be in a rush. Michael is right, but it’s really only been about 16 or 17 years
      since BRICS started. The first few were just getting it started. Now they are
      clearly underway. They have grown in number. They have the two levels of participation,
      the member and the partner, if I have their language correctly. And they did hit
      that milestone a week or two ago when the total amount of trade among them crossed
      the $1 trillion value. That’s an impressive development. We all have to thank
      Mr. Trump, because his tariff program has been a tremendous boost on increasing
      trade among them (since obviously when they trade amongst each other, Mr. Trump’s
      tariffs don’t have any impact, at least not directly). So I’m pretty impressed,
      given all of their differences on many, many issues, that they’ve been able to
      stay together. The second thing I would argue is the grab-itization. I like the
      term if Michael invented that; grabbing everything is a good metaphor, but I would
      like to extend it a little further. The tariff game has a number of benefits to
      it. Number one, it can exact a certain amount of tribute. Although, let’s remember,
      in the end, the tribute is going to be coming from the Americans to their own
      defunct government. We don’t know yet how much of it will be in the end funded
      by the other countries. Mr. Trump loves to talk about tariffs, about what they
      do to the other country. But the first victim of a tariff are the Americans who
      have to pay it, not the foreigners. And it’s an open question, depending on many
      variables, as to how much of the tariff the American who pays it will be able
      to push back onto the foreign country to lower their prices and offset the tariffs’
      effect. Some of that will happen. But much of the effect will be to raise prices
      in the United States. Let me give you one example that became popular 24 hours
      ago. It turns out that the vast majority (90 percent or more) of the shoes and
      sneakers that Americans wear are imported. They’re imported mostly from about
      six countries, all of whom have seen enormous tariffs imposed on them. The estimate
      of the American shoe companies is that they will have to raise the prices about
      37% to deal with the tariffs of 40 to 50 to 60 percent that have been levied on
      many of the countries that produce shoes. Now, that part of the inflation hasn’t
      hit yet in the United States, but it is being already factored into the calculations
      of all of these companies. So I think it’s important to understand that the effect
      of the tariffs, in terms of the U.S. versus BRICS or the rest, is unresolved.
      Next, levying these tariffs – it’s clear that Trump understands this part of it
      – is a way of breaking up any unity e.g. between Vietnam and China around certain
      issues, or the unity that the BRICS have established among the members and partners.
      Because what it does is to encourage the countries to compete with one another
      for the favor of the United States. This is clearly divisive for the BRICS. It
      means that they are perhaps saying one thing while cutting deals with Washington
      underneath the surface. We will learn about that in the months and years ahead.
      But it would be naive not to think that that’s going on. You can see the impact
      of that particular strategy because its biggest victim is Europe, where there’s
      a failure to get together because those countries don’t trust one another not
      to do secret deals with the United States. The continent doesn’t trust Britain,
      and vice versa. France and Germany do not trust each other. Each one worries that
      if they go too far in being anti-Trump, he will favor the other ones over them.
      Etc etc. Europe has been suffering from the failure of how it came out of feudalism
      – all this nationalist noise has cost them very dearly ever since. Finally, another
      dimension. If you look closely at what Trump said about the threat to Brazil and
      the 50% tariff, the argument he made was that he wants to stop the investigation
      into Bolsonaro. He’s not happy with that. He wants allies over there and he wants
      to punish them because of their internal judicial procedures, which is a remarkable
      rationale for a tariff. I mean, we’re not used to seeing that kind of thing. That
      would have been kept a secret, if it were an objective in all of this. But given
      the way Mr. Trump works, this all does seem to be a mess, a mess of tariffs interwoven
      with ideological commitments, interwoven with long-term political goals that are
      poorly defined and probably not achievable anyway. So I’m driven to do what my
      friend Yanis Varoufakis does, to find the method in the madness. I’m glad we’re
      doing that, and we should do it. But we shouldn’t forget that there’s a lot of
      madness here and a lot of multiple clashing objectives that are not going to work
      out. And that’ll help us avoid seeing too much logic, too much management. And
      so I end up not being critical so much of the BRICS, easy though that is to do.
      Could they do more? Yes. Could they have gone further? Yes. But even Lula, if
      I could conclude on that, did an interesting thing in his most recent speech that
      I’ve read. He says, “I am not one of those who attacks globalization. The problem
      wasn’t globalization.” The problem was – he doesn’t use these words, but I’ll
      put them in his mouth – American imperialism. The United States used a globalized
      economy to its own ends. Mr. Lula wants everyone to understand that globalization
      is still on the agenda, and he, for one, favors it. I see there the echo of the
      Chinese and others supporting free trade, repositioning the world around this
      old capitalist struggle, free trade versus protectionism. They are becoming cleverly
      the champions of a free trade regime against the narrow, backward-looking, MAGA
      protectionism. That, I think, is a very powerful image, changing what is the advanced
      world and what is the less developed world. It doesn’t substitute the strategy
      of economic development (which remains to be spelled out), but it is very smartly
      reconceptualizing what’s going on in the world in terms of globalization and protectionism.
      And that is very different from the United States’ way of understanding the world
      economy. MICHAEL HUDSON: I think you’re right. What is really at issue is the
      kind of economic system the world going to have, at least the world outside of
      the United States. The problem is not just capitalism. It’s particularly the European
      and the American version of what capitalism has become, which is very different
      from how it began. The global majority countries today are facing a problem very
      much like the one faced by Europe when it broke away from feudalism, from the
      control of the past, from the control of a predatory, hereditary aristocracy that
      was holding the land and charging its rents and establishing monopolies to pay
      its foreign debts and had a predatory banking system. The whole system had to
      be revised. That’s what made industrial capitalism revolutionary. Industrial capitalism
      wanted to free economies from this whole burden of the rentier class that had
      emerged out of feudalism. And the solution from Adam Smith and the French physiocrats
      and the rest of the classical economists was this: If we tax the rentiers (who
      live on economic rent, unearned income)… if we tax the land, if we tax the monopolies
      and prevent monopolies and make them into the public domain, then we’re going
      to become a low-cost economy. And if England is going to be the workshop of the
      world, we cannot afford to have the costs of this post-feudal rentier class. We’re
      going to have to get rid of them. Well, let’s look at the situation today. Just
      as Britain and France and Germany had to free their economies from feudalism’s
      rentier burden, the BRICS countries and most of the global majority countries
      need to free themselves from the rent overhead inherited from the epoch of European
      colonialism and its creditor control. But the problem is that this rentier control
      is international. It’s foreign. It’s American and European much more than domestic
      investors. It’s the multinational firms that have taken control of the raw materials
      resources, the mineral resources, the oil and the land. It’s the foreign investors
      that have bought up the natural infrastructure monopolies and are bleeding them
      for everything they can do. And it’s the foreign investors that have financed
      local banking and control the local credit system along neoliberal lines. What
      is unique today is that the BRICS haven’t come up with the same solution that
      the classical economists came up with to free industrial capitalism in the early
      19th century from all of this feudal structure. That’s what needs to be done,
      and yet they don’t have a body of classical economists. Most of their economists,
      officials and administrators have been sent to American universities to study.
      When they take an economics course, there’s nothing about classical economics;
      there’s no such thing as economic rent; everybody earns whatever they have; there’s
      no exploitation at all. Whereas classical economics was all about exploitation.
      That’s what economic rent is. It’s unearned income. Today the unearned income
      isn’t paid simply to the global majorities or the BRICS domestic ruling class.
      It’s paid to American and European foreign investors, multinationals. And if they
      were to do what Europe did to become a competitive industrial economy, they’d
      then be able to say, “We have sovereignty. And our sovereignty is going to be
      to do just what Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and his followers said. We’re
      going to tax the economic rent of the oil industry, the mining industry. We’re
      going to tax away monopolies and we’re going to have our own antitrust laws so
      that foreign investors can make normal profits on what they invest, but we’re
      not going to let them make super profits and economic rent.” “And we’re going
      to define the income they make, the taxable income, as their overall cash flow.
      We’re not going to allow foreign investors to say they didn’t make any income
      because they spent all of our income paying interest to ourselves and charging
      depreciation on the oil and minerals that they exhaust, for which there’s a tax
      write-off so that they don’t pay any taxes.” The entire system that has been put
      in place to promote the anti-classical pro-rentier ideological revolution that
      occurred in the early 20th century and flowered under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald
      Reagan has to be replaced by late 19th-century industrial capitalism evolving
      into socialism, into a mixed public-private economy where the government regulated
      natural monopolies and taxed away economic rent. The classical economists’ idea
      of a free market, as we’ve discussed before, was a market free from economic rent,
      not free for the rentiers or free of any government taxation or regulation of
      the economy. So, suppose that the BRICS countries said, “We’re going to develop
      our industry in the same way that England, France, Germany, and the United States
      developed their industry with a mixed public-private economy, blocking economic
      rent from adding to the cost of production. And if we don’t do that, we can’t
      industrialize.” “And by the way, the other feudal burden we have is the foreign
      debt that we’ve been loaded down with because of the way in which the post-war
      economic order was created in 1945.” The Global South countries emerged from World
      War II with very abundant foreign reserves because they’ve been selling raw materials
      to the Allies during the war. And the way in which the United States designed
      the IMF and the World Bank and free trade agreements led to the Global South countries
      losing the reserves they’d accumulated during the war, by falling into trade dependency
      and increasingly into debt dependency. All of that has to be thrown away just
      as Europe threw away the feudal burden, the feudalism that it had. And the fight
      to free themselves from the foreign investment which (as Lula said) mainly is
      coordinated by the United States is the counterpart to how Europe achieved its
      prosperity. Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia gave a wonderful speech about the
      need to establish foreign trade mechanisms that the West will be unable to control,
      such as transport corridors, alternative payment systems, and supply chains. And
      as an example, he cited how the United States has paralyzed the World Trade Organization
      that it created on the basis of free trade, but now free trade doesn’t help America
      because America is deindustrialized. I’ll quote what Lavrov said: “When the Americans
      realized that the globalized system they’d created – one built on fair competition,
      inviolable property rights, the presumption of innocence and similar principles,
      and which had allowed them to dominate for decades – had also begun to benefit
      their rivals, primarily China, they took drastic action. As China started outplaying
      them on their own turf and by their own rules, Washington simply blocked the WTO’s
      Appellate body. By artificially stripping it of a quorum, they rendered this key
      dispute settlement mechanism inactive, and it remains so to this day.” What if
      the BRICS and the global majority countries were saying, what China has done in
      a way followed the exact logic of industrial capitalism when it was emerging!
      China has kept property and land in the public domain. It hasn’t permitted monopolies
      to be private. It hasn’t permitted a private banking system to financialize the
      economy and make loans for corporate takeovers and buy up industrial corporations
      and use their profits for stock buybacks and dividend payouts. China has done
      exactly what Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and the industrial capitalists wanted
      to do, as well as evolving the way industrial capitalism did. For the BRICS to
      become independent of this system that has driven them into debt and debt and
      trade dependency and food dependency, they would have to say: China has provided
      a modern version of the classical free market model free of exploitative rents.
      And we’re going to follow that. But that requires us stripping away the foreign
      ownership of our oil, raw materials, resources, our monopolies. And if we can’t
      nationalize them – we realize that’s out of the question – at least we can tax
      all of their unearned income, the unearned income that David Ricardo and Smith
      and John Stuart Mill and Marx and Veblen, the whole 19th century, spent so much
      effort defining. RICHARD WOLFF: Let me get at this in a slightly different way.
      Here, I’m going to be relying on Marx and his particular way of dealing with this.
      You might say that the break out of feudalism, whether it’s in the form of Smith
      and Ricardo or any of the others, comes out of a recognition that rent on land
      has much to do with the growth of population. That’s why a square foot in New
      York City costs a great deal more than a square foot in Nebraska, right? It is
      not about the soil. It’s not about investments that have been put on the land
      or not. It’s basically that more and more people getting an advantage out of being
      in an agglomerated population enable whoever owns the land simply to raise the
      rent, and it becomes more and more. The anti-feudal people can be thought of as
      having come up with a eureka moment. And in the eureka moment, they realized that
      in order to have access to land, you do not need a landlord. In other words, you
      can, figuratively or not, get rid of the landlord and you still have the land,
      which is what the rest of the population or the rest of the economy needs. Well,
      Marx, in a moment of humor, said the only difference between him and those folks
      who figured out what I just said is that he wants to add that exactly the same
      is true of capital. Do we need machines? Absolutely. Do we need factories and
      offices? Yes. Do we need the owners of those things who can take huge portions
      of our output in order to give us access? No. We can produce those things. You
      know how we know it? Because we already do. It’s workers who make machines. It’s
      workers who erect buildings. It’s workers who do all that anyway. So if the workers
      do it, why would there be others who aren’t workers gathering a revenue? It makes
      no more sense, Marx says, than having the landlord who inherited from his grandfather
      a certain spot of land being able to siphon off a huge amount of revenue. Then
      the punchline, just as Michael said, is if that revenue were acquired by an agency
      of the community that wanted economic development, then of course they would use
      those revenues for that purpose. And that is the old socialist idea. The people
      do the work, they produce consumer goods for their own consumption, they produce
      means of production in order to become more productive as a community. In order
      for this story to be told, you don’t need a separate social class gathering into
      its hands the revenue and only devoting that to growing the well-being of the
      community if that were their objective. But we know that if there is such a class,
      capitalism guarantees that the objective they will pursue with the revenue they
      get is profitability. And profitability has nothing to do with what a community
      of workers would do if they themselves were in charge here. So let me offer to
      the BRICS, as Michael did, a strategic focus that might make a real difference:
      The socialism that they have produced to this point, government with massive regulation
      and ownership (as in China, for example) is a step, probably a necessary step…
      but not a sufficient step. What you have to do is to take it further. You have
      to really put the workers in charge, not indirectly through electing some… no,
      no, no. You have to, at the base, in every office, in every factory, in every
      store, put the people who work there in charge. There is no capitalist class anymore.
      You actually have overcome class division because the employer and the employee
      have become the same persons. One of them an individual, the other one a member
      of the collective. No more master vs slave, no more lord vs serf, and no more
      employer vs employee. Then you have the micro foundation to get the very things
      Michael is talking about to become possible. But that means that in the BRICS
      countries – and there is no way that I can see out of this – to the extent that
      there remain employer-employee organizations, you’re going to have to go beyond
      them. And you’re going to have resistance from whoever the employers are, whether
      these are private individuals or state officials. You’re going to have to bite
      the bullet, not in support of an abstract idea, but in support of the necessary
      foundation for that alternative organization of the world economy that Michael
      is talking about and that the BRICS are moving toward, but are not there yet.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: That leaves the question: how do you get from where you are now
      to where you have described as the ultimate dream of socialism? Marx dealt with
      that. He really was the inventor of cost accounting for industrial capitalism.
      He said that the industrial capitalist was much more than a landlord. The landlord’s
      rent did not add to value. It added to price, but there was no cost of production
      for land because land was provided freely by nature. As the economy becomes more
      prosperous and the population grows, there’s an unearned increment. The landlord
      did nothing. But, Marx said, the capitalist does do something. The capitalist
      organized industry. And Marx included the capitalist’s profit as value, not as
      economic rent, because he said the role of industrial capitalists is to make money
      by making surplus value, by employing labor, selling its product at a profit,
      more than they have to pay the labor and the cost of production. But the dynamic
      of industrial capitalism was that the firm, in order to grow, plugs its profit
      back into more capital investment and more employment. And in that sense, he said
      the capitalist plays a productive role under capitalism. He says ultimately, as
      capitalism plays this role of creating industry on a larger and larger scale,
      it is preparing the whole structure for socialists to take over and at a point
      for there to be socialist management. He also described the whole structure of
      the capitalist’s income. Here is the earned part of income, the actual profits
      on the necessary capital investment per factories. But the cost of producing capitalist
      industry included land rent and other things, other factors – and these should
      not be tax-deductible at all. So Marx refined the whole tax ideology of Adam Smith
      and Ricardo and John Stuart Mill and made sense of it all, and said that the industrial
      capitalist was the key to the transition to socialism. In this way China permits
      private profit-making investment, private capitalism on a small scale to develop,
      but it doesn’t let billionaires develop and it doesn’t let industrial capitalism
      by its innovative class – which is very innovative – become financialized and
      turn into financial capitalism, which has ended up destroying and deindustrializing
      capitalism in the Western economies. That’s the big picture, I think, that the
      BRICS and global south economies have. But to do that, they need a whole idea
      of cost accounting and how exactly you tax these firms, so that you can say, we’re
      not going to nationalize you, we’re just going to make sure that you actually
      earn what you produce. If you make a capital investment, you’re permitted to make
      – on the value of the physical capital, mining equipment, and oil drilling equipment
      – a regular profit of, say, six to eight percent. You’re not allowed to make a
      profit on the vast economic rent-paying investments that you’ve made. That’s not
      an investment. We’re dealing with a whole different concept of national income,
      gross national product, and getting rid of transfer payments to the foreign investors
      that are not part of the product at all but are a transfer payment, essentially,
      a tribute to the rentier class that’s largely formed. In order to do that, they’d
      have to read Volumes two and three of Capital, to see how classical economics
      actually evolved in the 19th century. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, I don’t think we disagree,
      except for me, I want to stress the micro-level adjustment change that radically
      reorganizes every enterprise in order that then they can together do what you
      just said. In the interest of reproducing their power and their social situation,
      they have to have rules in place so that, for example, no one enterprise, even
      if it is organized as a cooperative, can have a monopoly position. So that that
      [position] is not available. Whereas we know that capitalism’s competitive nature
      always produces winners and losers and has no reason not to go until there’s only
      one or two or three monopolistic or oligopolistic firms left. The production of
      a monopolist is intrinsic to the capitalist system. It constantly produces and
      reproduces them. That’s why there is Jeffrey Bezos and there is Elon Musk and
      all the rest. Not only is there nothing preventing it, the system is set up so
      that every capitalist that I’ve ever met dreams of having “market share”. Well,
      that’s a none-too-subtle idea. That’s about getting the ability to jack your price
      up above what it would be if you did the kind of cost calculation Michael just
      specified. If we’re going to do our job, we have to specify the political economy
      that could set itself the task of limiting monopoly. And we tried that. We had
      the Sherman Antitrust bill in 1890. We had the Clayton Act in 1914. Those are
      spectacular failures. They haven’t stopped monopolization. Never did. It is a
      fraud. We have an antitrust department that’s another fraud that doesn’t do its
      job. And it doesn’t do it whether it’s Republican or Democrat because that’s built
      into the system. Bank finance depends on what kind of market share you can promise
      the banker you can get with a loan that allows you to wipe out your competitors.
      That would not be possible if you just differentially organized the base. They
      would not permit that because they could all be victimized by it in a way that
      could actually stick. I think, therefore, that these are the next steps of a BRICS.
      But there’s another dimension to this that I don’t want to lose, and I would like
      to hear Michael’s comments. It seems to me that the BRICS already are a historical
      transformation. The fact is – I know I’ve done this before, but I want us to think
      about it – if you add up the GDP of all the BRICS countries now, it’s roughly
      35% of global GDP. If you add up the GDP of the G7, i.e. the United States and
      its major allies, we’re talking about 27 or 28%. For me, that’s it. We’re done.
      We are no longer where we were for the 80 years since Bretton Woods, a world economy
      where the United States and its allies were the obvious global world-shaping economic
      power, and with that, the political, military, and ideological. We are not the
      economic center of the world economy. The United States isn’t. And the gap, we
      crossed the line in 2020. Here we are five years later, and the gap has gotten
      only bigger in favor of the BRICS and against the United States. This, in my judgment,
      sits as a relentless pressure on Mr. Trump, on everybody in this country, whether
      they admit what I just said as a statistic or they don’t. Consciously or unconsciously,
      they have an ominous sense that the march of time itself is now their enemy. So
      there’s a desperation that then comes and produces that grabbing mentality that
      Michael started us off with today. But that is a mentality grounded in an actual
      material transformation. The BRICS, I suspect, somewhere, they know it too. They
      don’t quite know what to do – Michael is right. On the other hand, they are trading
      more with one another than they ever have. And it is not only emergency trading.
      In other words, it’s not just Russia selling oil and gas to China and India because
      they can’t manipulate. Now a final word: because Michael mentioned the Russian
      Foreign Minister Lavrov. In the same speech that Michael refers to, Lavrov gives
      a statistic, and I’ve checked it and it’s correct. Here it is, and it’s something
      to think about. Since the war in Ukraine began in early 2022, the World Bank,
      a Western institution created by the Bretton Woods meetings, has given twice as
      much money to Ukraine as it gives annually to Africa. Now, let me remind you:
      the population of Ukraine is 39 million people. The population of Africa is 1.55
      billion people. Now, there is no justification on earth for such behavior, except
      if you are desperate and you’re mobilizing every nickel you can, you don’t care
      what the fall. That’s behavior of people very different from what we used to see.
      It’s just like Mr. Trump ending foreign aid to Africa and then inviting those
      five sad leaders yesterday to talk to him. Twice as much for the war in Ukraine,
      the 39 million people affected, than you give annually to 1.55 billion. It is
      stupefying if you think about it. Think about the economic development message
      here. Helping Ukraine basically blow away everything because the money is used
      for war versus helping 1.5 billion people who are the victims of economic underdevelopment
      par excellence in the world we live in. It really is kind of breathtaking. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Richard, the population of Ukraine is only 1,000 people. These 1,000 people
      get all of the IMF, all of the World Bank money. This money doesn’t get spent
      on the rest of the population at large. It goes to the client oligarchy. That’s
      the key. But I want to go back to what you talked about, the march of time. The
      question is: how does the American government, which seems to be the most proactive
      mover right now under Trump, stop the march of time from moving in a direction
      that is not in the American national interest? How does it prevent the BRICS from
      developing? That is really what I think should have been the whole focus of the
      conference in Brazil. I think the U.S. plan is indeed, as you point out, based
      on monopoly. In fact, the head of the Federal Reserve this week made very much
      the point that you’re making about monopoly pricing. He said, “Donald Trump is
      trying to force me to lower interest rates [but I want to keep interest rates
      on hold given the uncertain effect of the tariffs] to stop the rise in pricing.”
      But the rise in prices is not caused by money creation. The rise of prices has
      nothing to do with money creation. Companies are realizing that there is no antitrust
      enforcement at all, that they can just gouge and gouge and gouge their customers.
      The grocery stores are gouging. Everybody’s gouging the customers. That’s what
      he said. And of course, that’s right. On a larger scale, I ask, how is the U.S.
      going to survive as a monopoly country imposing on BRICS and the rest of the world
      its monopoly rights and the related rentier privileges that are uniquely favorable
      to itself on the whole world’s trade and investment? Well, Trump’s America wants
      to make other countries dependent on America’s information technology, its internet
      platforms, its military technology. It wants to become itself the great monopoly
      power over other countries. If it can’t achieve its dominance by industrialization,
      it can achieve it by post-industrial monopoly capitalism, which turns out to be
      the final stage of finance capitalism in this case. Thus for Trump and for the
      United States, the rule of law is based on one that permits unilateral U.S. demands
      to impose trade and financial sanctions, dictating how and with foreign countries
      how they can trade and invest with each other. Also, you’d mentioned at the first
      part of your talk: who’s going to pay these tariffs? Is it going to be the American
      consumers or the foreign exporters? Well, a lot of these tariffs won’t be paid
      because the trade won’t exist. Foreigners cannot afford to gain access to the
      American market paying these tariffs, and the Americans cannot afford to buy from
      foreigners with these tariffs in. There’s going to be a shrinkage of world trade
      in all sorts of connections that have been put in place for the last 80 years
      have been pulled up. You’re going to have such an interruption of trade that the
      real question of the BRICS facing them is, well, now if we can’t export to the
      U.S. and we’re not going to import from the U.S., how do we make our trade and
      investment with each other instead of with the United States? That’s what they
      have to do. All of that is going to require the creation of new international
      institutions, which Russia and China are taking the lead in trying to promote.
      The United States is trying to prevent this. They’re trying to do everything they
      can to break up the creation of any alternative. That’s what the Americans themselves
      call this a clash of civilization. The American idea of civilization is the imposition
      of the neoliberal financialized economy. And the alternative is autocracy, dictatorship,
      like America will say you have in China. But America’s idea of democracy is client
      dictatorships. This isn’t the democracy of countries that are growing and rejecting
      client dictatorships and taking sovereignty for themselves. We’re dealing with
      the fight not between American civilization and British civilization, but between
      barbarism and the very principle of civilization based on international law, equality
      of nations in terms of sovereignty, freedom from foreign interference, rules of
      war making, all the rules that have been smashed by American policy in the last
      few years. RICHARD WOLFF: I’d like, in the few moments we have left, to turn the
      old free trade argument against all of it. The United States is closing itself
      by a wall of protection. All these prices are going to be raised by virtue of
      the tariffs imposed on them, more or less. And the important thing to keep in
      mind is that in the rest of the world that is not following suit, the prices will
      be lower than what they are in the United States. Not to the same extent everywhere,
      but lower. That begins to be built into the price systems outside, that they become
      more and more differentiated from the monopoly-protected prices inside the United
      States. That will mean that the United States, as a capitalist totality, will
      be in a deteriorating competitive position with the rest of the world, because
      all the inputs here will be higher priced than their equivalents outside the protection
      zone. That’s not a sustainable arrangement, or to put it another way, that will
      become itself a mechanism that over time deteriorates and isolates the United
      States’ capitalism from the rest of the world. So that’s not a viable strategy
      either. The early moments of Mr. Trump throwing it around may look like some kind
      of remarkable innovation, but we all know that the history of capitalism is the
      history of oscillations between free trade and protection. We are not the first
      ones to go through that. And the protection phase, which comes when free trade
      doesn’t work, always turns out to be a dead end. In fact, that’s why we go back
      to free trade again because we have a revulsion against the problems of a protection.
      In sum, this is not discovering a new solution. This is hankering after an old
      one that we should have learned doesn’t work. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, this disparity
      in prices is exactly what Britain was dealing with 200 years ago. It saw that
      other countries had a natural price advantage because they could grow, for one
      thing, they could grow their food and produce raw materials much less expensively
      than Britain. So what did Britain do? Apart from reforming its own economy to
      lower its costs, it said: “We’re going to colonize these countries and we’re going
      to invest in them. We can take ownership of their advantages, ownership of their
      land to produce food and ownership of their raw materials. Then, instead of those
      countries getting the benefit of their low-cost of production, we British and
      other colonialist European owners are going to carve out our ownership of these
      countries’ natural patrimony, land, natural resources, and infrastructure for
      ourselves. They’ll be part of our own economy, not the other countries’ economies.”
      This perception of the threat of lower prices abroad led to British colonialism
      and imperialism, and the development of financial imperialism in the form of multinational
      corporations buying control of all of the basic resources and assets that had
      made these other countries more naturally competitive than Europe (which had the
      burden of its aristocracy and everything). That’s the kind of fight that is being
      waged today. It’s as if we’re seeing a new attempt by Americans to do what the
      European colonists did in taking over Africa and other countries, investing in
      the global south, taking ownership of their resources, and denying the income
      from these resources to their host countries. The global south is a host in the
      sense of host to a parasite taking out its value. This is exactly the fight that
      has to be recognized by the global majority countries. And I think it has been
      recognized by Lavrov’s speech and by the Russians and certainly by the Chinese.
      But the problem is: how are you going to get BRICS to admit this requires a really
      radical restructuring of the world order? This is a civilizational fight. How
      are we going to create a plan for this? So far, they really haven’t developed
      a plan. There was talk about de-dollarization as if somehow that could cure the
      problem, but that goes way beyond getting free of using the U.S. dollar. It’s
      getting the economy free from the whole finance capitalist rentier organization
      of the economy. Of course, that’s what industrial capitalism was supposed to be
      doing as it evolved into socialism. So you’re right. The BRICS and global south
      countries have to evolve into socialism. And the question is: can this be done
      without a revolution? We posed that at the end of the last show. It took a revolution
      in Russia in 1917, a revolution in China in 1945. Can the other BRICS countries
      and the global majority achieve this alternative to the US-European exploitation
      without a revolution? The United States is going to do whatever it can to fight
      against it. And that’s what’s going to be determining the next few years of international
      diplomacy. RICHARD WOLFF: I want to remind everyone not to be too gloomy here.
      You saw the European economies go from the 19th century of more or less free trade
      to the 20th century shifting over to colonization and protection of each colony,
      a set of colonial properties one against the other. That eventuated in World Wars
      I and II. That’s a reason why you don’t want to go down the road of protection,
      accompanied by military forces to impose that protection. Notice that the budget
      just passed by Mr. Trump expands the military and expands the police. That’s so-called
      homeland security. Everything else is cut because you have to focus on protection
      in all the meanings of that word. That has led to war over and over again, especially
      as the beleaguered country tries to stop the others from protecting themselves.
      What happens – and I’m not suggesting it, but – if and when the BRICS were to
      sit down and, as a unit, respond to the tariffs of the United States with a uniform
      tariff among them? Making themselves a common market, and the United States the
      excluded one? People with a memory will see here the very evolution of colonial
      empires – the American, the British, the German, the Japanese – which were the
      20th century’s causes of the greatest world wars the human race has ever seen.
      This is not a solution, what is being done here. This is an act of desperation
      coming out of the grabbing that Michael talked to us at the beginning today. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, to create a common market is exactly what China is trying to do
      with the Belt and Road Initiative. If you’re going to have trade among yourselves,
      you need transportation. You need the Belt and Road. And that’s exactly what the
      United States militarily is trying to do to block it in Afghanistan, in Iran,
      with activities in Azerbaijan. This is exactly what the geopolitical fight of
      the next few years is all about: trying to break the ability of other countries
      to work together and to tear up all the connections, leaving no alternative but
      depend upon the United States and Europe. That’s the new Cold War, and it is a
      war of what kind of civilization is the world going to have, or at least the world
      outside of the golden billion in the United States, Europe, and its allies. NIMA

    paragraph_summary: On July 10, 2025, during a summit in Rio de Janeiro, Richard
      Wolff and Michael Hudson discussed the BRICS nations' response to U.S. tariffs
      and foreign policy, particularly emphasizing the roles of Russia and China as
      targets of U.S. aggression. Hudson noted that while Russia's leadership has articulated
      the need for BRICS to break free from U.S. control, the group remains largely
      reactive without concrete policies for establishing a viable alternative to the
      U.S.-dominated neoliberal order. He pointed out that although the BRICS nations
      are seeking reforms like higher quotas in the International Monetary Fund and
      World Bank, these measures do not constitute a genuine alternative to the existing
      system, which has historically benefited the U.S. but is now shifting under new
      American policies.

    text: 'Dialogue Works NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody. Today is Thursday, July 3rd,
      2025, and our friends, Richard Wolf and Michael Hudson, are back with us. Welcome.
      RICHARD WOLFF: Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: I want to start, Michael, with
      you and the “Big Beautiful Bill” of Donald Trump. We could manage to do something
      with the bill, but we know that the history between Donald Trump and Elon Musk
      — Elon Musk went against him — and what has happened in the aftermath. But when
      it comes to the bill, what is the importance of this bill for Donald Trump? And
      we know that he’s insisting on it. He’s somehow trying to do everything to get
      it passed. Your take on that? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I think that Trump’s bill
      — the (Republican) Big Beautiful (Budget Deficit) Bill — along with Trump’s tariff
      policy will have the effect of ending dollar hegemony and will lead to a falling
      exchange rate of the dollar because Trump has said he wants the dollar’s exchange
      rate to go down, imagining that this is going to make America’s industrial exports
      more expensive. The problem is it doesn’t have many industrial exports anymore.
      They’re all made abroad. So it’s a fantasy that somehow lowering the exchange
      rate of the dollar is going to cure America’s trade deficit and enable much more
      profit to be made and hence taxes to be paid. So it’s all a fantasy. It’s amazing
      junk economics. And looking at the newspaper and media coverage this morning,
      it’s all about how so many Republicans say: We can never be re-elected after we
      pass this bill. We’re not even going to run next time our Senate term’s up. And
      some of the House Representatives have said — [Thom] Tillis, he can’t run again
      because the cutbacks in medical coverage and Medicaid are going to hurt his constituency
      so much that they just give up. So the effect is going to end — the dollar’s free
      lunch — this exorbitant privilege of being able to run huge military and trade
      deficits, without having to see its exchange rate decline and prices rise. Now
      you’re having a flight out of the dollar. The dollar’s exchange rate has gone
      down 10%. That’s the largest decline since Franklin Roosevelt devalued the dollar
      in 1933. They’re running for the exit. So we’re seeing the end of an era. This
      bill is that important. And it’s been an era that enabled the United States to
      finance both its balance-of-payments deficit and its budget deficit by printing
      IOUs — Treasury bonds — that supposedly would never have to be repaid. Because
      (we’ve discussed on an earlier show) when the United States spends money abroad,
      mainly for military purposes, these dollars end up in the hands of foreign central
      banks. And what are they going to do? In the past, until right now, for the last
      54 years, they had only one choice: to recycle them into safe U.S. Treasury bonds,
      or federal agency bonds that have yielded a little bit more. But for the first
      time now, they’re running for the exits. That’s what’s happened today. The Financial
      Times has a wonderful article about how investors are borrowing at a low interest
      rate to buy European junk bonds. And in the last week, as this bill has been working
      its way through Congress, investors have been doing arbitrage, borrowing low rates
      here, buying high-yielding junk bonds in Europe. And it’s a bonanza — but it’s
      all about making money financially, not industrially. So you’re seeing that big
      financial funds in the U.S., as well as foreign investors, are beginning to worry
      that this artificial affluence by the dollar standard for international monetary
      reserves is coming to an end. Today, the stock market’s up because stocks are
      what the wealthiest 1% are going to be spending their money on. Gold prices also
      jumped because they realize that while the stock market’s going up, the economy
      is going down. And interest rates rose for 10-year Treasury bonds because there
      are more sellers than buyers. The Republicans continue to use this old trickle-down
      theory. They claim that giving more money to the wealthiest 1% is going to increase
      investment and employment. But that’s not what billionaires do with their wealth.
      They buy more stocks and bonds and interest-bearing loans. They make money financially,
      not by building new factories and employing more people. So the tax giveaway doesn’t
      really trickle down. It actually trickles up because this added untaxed income
      of the billionaires, the 1%, the 10%, is going to be used in bidding up stock
      market prices, bond prices, and real estate prices, all the more. That’s how you
      make a fortune in today’s finance capital economy. And shifting taxes onto wage
      earners, which the bill also does, the wage earners are taxed more in order to
      help cover up some of the budget deficit resulting from this giveaway. Well, that
      will force them yet further into debt and having to pay yet more of their income
      to the banks as interest and late fees. Well, we’ve just seen the highest returns
      are likely to be made abroad now. So giving more money is going to weaken the
      dollar, as both the U.S. and foreign investors bail out of the U.S. bond market,
      and out of the dollar itself. And the result will be a devaluation of the dollar.
      And that’s going to raise prices because now you have to pay a larger dollar sum
      for imports that remain the same price in foreign countries, quite apart from
      Trump’s tariffs, which are also raising prices. So Trump has managed to pick the
      worst of both worlds for the United States. It’s made the 1% richer, and it’s
      ended the whole era of easy growth for the United States. RICHARD WOLFF: Let me
      comment on that, and take it a couple of steps further. It wasn’t very long ago
      (I’m talking a matter of months), when there was nearly parity between the Euro
      and the dollar. I checked this morning, and the Euro is now costing $1.18. Okay,
      that’s a devaluation relative to the Euro of 18%. By the way, a devaluation of
      the dollar by 18% means that you have a situation where you have to give more
      and more dollars to get the European currency. It’s a statement to everyone in
      the world who has dollar assets, who holds anything denominated in a dollar —
      like a U.S. Treasury note, of which there are 700 billion in the hands of China,
      of which there are a trillion in the hands of Japan, and so on — are now worth
      18% less. That is a screaming message because, as Michael correctly says, that’s
      a devaluation at a speed that is frightening. That is a screaming recommendation
      to people to get rid of the dollar before they suffer worse losses. They’ve been
      doing that for the last year, and they’re going to continue to do it since there
      is no end in sight. And if Mr. Powell, or his successor, is going to lower interest
      rates because Mr. Trump is beating the drum to do it, it will make all of that
      likely worse. Okay, that’s the first thing. The second thing: Let’s do a little
      history. The only meaningful economic act achieved by Mr. Trump in his first presidency
      was the tax cut of December 2017. Let’s remember, that was an enormous tax cut
      for corporations and the rich. It happened at the end of a 40-year period — mid-1970s
      to 2015 (40 years) — during which we have had a massive redistribution of wealth,
      from the bottom and the middle, to the people at the top. Never, therefore, in
      the year 2017, never did an American corporate sector, or rich sector, need a
      tax cut less than they did at the end of a 40-year redistribution. Mr. Trump gave
      it to them anyway. And that signaled an out-of-control ruling class that is simply
      grabbing as much as they can before it all disappears. A behavior very common
      in empires that are declining. The people at the top are in a position because
      they’re at the top to hold on to wealth. Everybody else pays the price of the
      declining empire. So weak were the Democrats in 2017 that the only thing they
      could do was not to stop the tax cut, not to stop all the damage it did, but to
      put a proviso that it would end on the 31st of December of this year, 2025 — eight
      years into the future, then. What did they bring Mr. Trump back into office for?
      To do the next logical step: to get rid of the little limit that the Democrats,
      in their weakness, imposed. And that’s what this new bill does. It permanently
      fixes the cuts of 2017. It negates the sunset they were supposed to suffer at
      the end of this year, and they add a few more. Therefore, the gross inequality
      of the last 40 years, which was worsened by the tax cut of 2017, will be further
      worsened by what we’re going through now. And in my opinion, that’s the biggest
      threat to social stability in this country at this time. You are taking away medical
      support for poor people at the same time that you are giving the wealthy yet another…
      it is grotesque! As, by the way, even a significant number of Republican and Democratic
      politicians have been able to say: It is grotesque! You are taking away from the
      food stamp — the SNAP program — supports that they give. From the poorest people,
      you take food and medical care. This is like a cartoon come to life. And it is
      a severe additional inequality that the country suffers. I did some work on the
      New York City — where I live — economic situation. The city of New York is the
      richest city in the United States, and the city of New York is among the ten poorest
      cities. Both statistics are correct. How is it counted? If you take a measure,
      the percentage of the people in the city who live at or below the poverty line,
      you can get a list of the ten poorest cities. New York City is among them. If
      you ask about wealth, New York City is the richest city in the country. Listen
      to these numbers: 380,000 millionaires live in New York City; 88 people who have
      100 million or more live in New York City; and 66 billionaires live in New York
      City. How is a city as rich as that among the ten poorest cities in the country?
      Because we live in a society in which the gap between rich and poor is stupefying.
      And that’s not tenable. That’s not tenable in any society, very long. But in a
      society whose entire 20th century was devoted to saying: We are the exceptional
      society? We don’t have rich and poor? Everybody here is in the middle class? A
      society trained with that, dumped into what’s happening now, is a recipe for catastrophe.
      And the poor people look, and they watch, and they see that there are special
      police called ICE who beat up and harass poor immigrants. How much of a step do
      you think it takes to wonder whether the next poor people they will be going after
      are the ones that were born here? Come on. We are training people. I learned this
      morning — last point — that in Los Angeles, there is now a volunteer civilian
      patrol: local people who mobilize and drive their cars in and around the immigrant
      neighborhoods, with cameras, who have been trained by lawyers as to what immigrants’
      rights actually are, and what ICE can, or cannot, legally do. There it is, folks.
      There’s the escalation. We’re going to have an army on both sides. This is the
      end of whatever the consensus was that held this country together. We are watching
      the people at the top desperate to become even wealthier than they already are.
      And this is their own undoing. And they will all look back when Warren Buffett,
      himself one of our great billionaires, told us over the recent years that there’s
      something wrong, that his secretary pays a higher percentage of taxes on her income
      than he does on his. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, if any of you have taken an Economics
      101 course, you’re taught in the first week that what Richard said could not possibly
      happen because all of the price theory is based on diminishing marginal utility.
      The idea is that wealth is like bananas. The first one tastes good, after about
      the tenth banana, you really get sort of sick of it. So the idea is that as people
      get wealthier and billionaires, they become satiated. And if that really were
      how economies work, what Richard has described couldn’t possibly happen. The irony
      is that the Greeks, and the Romans, and most of antiquity before that, realized
      that there was such a thing as wealth addiction, as money love. And the fact is
      that wealth is addictive, and they keep wanting more and more. It is insatiable
      and grows, exponential. But I want to focus, my specialty has always been the
      balance of payments. And I want to explain why Trump’s budget is going to lower
      the dollar’s exchange rate. And that’s what affects the 1%, as Richard said, are
      the whole group behind the bill. Most of the media blames the deficit, as if this
      money is going to be spent into the economy to raise prices, instead of on stocks
      and bonds and bank loans. But already in the 17th century (the mid-1600s), there
      was an argument, just like today. And the British economists said: Well, wait
      a minute. Rich people don’t buy goods and services, except for luxury Italian
      imports and luxuries, and luxury real estate. All this money gets recycled into
      more and more loans. And from the vantage point of foreign investors and money
      managers, the most serious threat to the dollar’s exchange rate is Trump’s pressure
      on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. And he said that if Federal Reserve
      Chairman Powell does not lower rates, once his term expires next year, he’s going
      to handpick a successor whose loyalty to Trump will lead him to lower interest
      rates yet more. And I want to describe how this policy is going to be an exclamation
      point beyond the dynamic that Richard has just been explaining. It’s going to
      have a twofold return. First of all, as I mentioned, investors can make an easy
      arbitrage gain by borrowing lower interest rates here to buy high interest rates
      in other countries. They can do it freely. All they have to do is arrange at their
      bank: Lend me money at 4.5%. I’ll buy something yielding 6%. And there’s been
      so much money flowing into junk bonds in Europe, as the Financial Times explains,
      that shipping lines and tourist lines that had to pay double-digit interest rates
      a year or two ago, now are only paying 6.5%. There’s a flooding of the market
      — the stock market and bond market — in Europe and America, and all over the world,
      with money. Well, the second point is that as the dollar declines relative to
      foreign currencies, the bonds and stocks of countries with higher interest rates
      are going to rise, and there will be a foreign exchange premium over and above
      this. So if you’re an American investor, and you move out of 4.5% in the U.S.
      to buy a 6.5% bond in England, that’s going to push up England’s exchange rate,
      and you get an exchange rate premium on top of the interest rate you’re getting.
      So you borrow at a low rate, buy securities yielding a higher rate, all on credit
      for debt-financed capital gains. None of this has anything to do with actual GDP
      production or incomes for the non-financial sector, except to interfere with it,
      as I’ll explain. The decline in the dollar’s exchange rate is probably going to
      exceed the interest that you make on the American bond. And if that’s the case,
      then why would foreign investors and governments and national wealth funds want
      to invest in the United States? If the highest returns are likely to be made abroad,
      it’ll weaken the dollar. That’s going to raise prices and higher import costs,
      plus the tariffs. And the result is that Trump is actually destroying America’s
      financial free lunch of being able to run a balance-of-payments deficit without
      limit. But he’s spurring the stock market. And as Adam Smith said: Wealth is very
      often most apparent in countries “going fastest to ruin.” Well, that’s exactly
      what’s happening in the United States. We’re seeing what the classical economists
      realize: When you let the income be made not by production, not by industrial
      capital, businesses, or labor’s living standards, but solely in a financial way,
      that is purely manipulative, and turns out to be anti-labor and also anti-business.
      That’s what’s ultimately so destructive about Trump’s Big Beautiful (Budget Deficit)
      Bill. And it makes a lot of free, easy money for the billionaires and those financial
      speculators and hedge funds and other capital funds. But in order to make money
      for themselves in this way, they’re willing to sacrifice the actual business.
      Because why would a foreign investor do what Trump has promised that he’s going
      to do, and move their production facilities, their automobile companies, and others,
      into the United States? They can’t, despite the high tariffs in the United States
      that keep Japan’s cars out of the United States. And Trump says he’s going to
      raise the tariffs on Japanese cars and other imports to the U.S. to 35 to 40%.
      Well, even if Toyota and other companies were to move their plants into the United
      States to avoid the tariff, they’re going to have to pay a 20% tariff on aluminum,
      on steel, on the components that go into the car. It’s not going to work. The
      whole bill and the logic that the economics profession is trying to popularize
      turns out to be junk economics that’s going to be destructive because lower interest
      rates mean easier debt financing. That’ll increase the stock and bond prices for
      the wealthy, not consumer prices. But the consumer prices are going to rise anyway
      because of the tariff policy. And you can be sure that a lot of the tax cuts that
      are being given are going to be spent on buying up yet more real estate, concentrating
      the absentee-landlord-owned real estate at the expense of homeowners. So they’re
      ending the membership in the middle class that, as Richard just said, is supposed
      to be what America is all about. So the effect of the giveaway to the financial
      sector is going to accelerate America’s de-industrialization. And that’s the dynamic
      of today’s finance capitalism. And because it’s the dynamic, that’s why the big
      campaign donors — indeed, as Richard said — threw all their support behind him
      to make sure he was the candidate. And also, they must have encouraged the Democratic
      Party to lose, to throw the fight — by keeping either Biden or Harris — which
      guaranteed Trump’s victory. RICHARD WOLFF: Let me give you a different way of
      handling this. In many ways, the world’s manufacturers are comparing the United
      States and the People’s Republic of China as possible, or likely, locations for
      manufacturing industry. China, in recent years, has not imposed tariffs in anything
      like the way the United States has. It hasn’t been changing the few tariffs it
      imposed because most of them are responses to what Mr. Trump did, if they happened
      at all. The country is very stable. It has promised manufacturers that if you
      come to China, you will have access to well-educated, well disciplined, relatively
      low-wage workers, and you will have access to the largest and fastest-growing
      market in the world. They have consistently offered that to the world’s manufacturers,
      and after much hesitation, the world’s manufacturers took the invitation and went
      there, including many, many American mega corporations. They voted with their
      feet that they preferred being in a country run by a communist party, which was
      the political adversary, more or less, of the United States, of which they were
      a company because that was a better deal than the United States could offer them.
      What do we have now? China is offering pretty much the same it always did, and
      doing a good job of giving reasons to go there. Their technology is now top of
      the line, the dispersion of their industry extraordinary, and their social stability
      equally extraordinary. Whereas the United States? We don’t know from one day to
      the next what the tariffs will be. We don’t know from one week to the next what
      the value of the dollar in exchange will be. We don’t know how long Mr. Trump
      will survive as president. We don’t know what he’ll do. We don’t know what his
      successors will do. So, yeah, if in that situation, all the cards say go to China,
      then what Mr. Trump is doing are marginal shifts that cannot change that process.
      That’s what Michael has just explained. Whatever he does, it’s marginal to what
      all led to what we have now lived through in the last 30 to 40 years, which is
      deindustrialization. That’s why we are cutting Medicaid and food stamps. Mr. Starmer
      in England is reducing the money laid out for people with disabilities, and the
      Chinese got an award for lifting 800 million people out of poverty. Hello? There’s
      a difference here. And that difference has to do with the totality. No company
      is going to come here because of a tariff for a moment, or a value of the dollar
      for a while. There are too many other variables that they need to have under control
      that aren’t under control here, or going in the wrong direction. An 18% drop in
      the value of the dollar. That means if you come here and you have inputs that
      are imports, what are you going to do? You factored that in? Think clearly and
      you will understand. The biggest likelihood for a downturn in the American economy
      is the fact that we’re going to have stagnation because the industrial foundation
      of this economy keeps shrinking, as do the recent numbers for manufacturing in
      this country. The return of manufacturing has not happened. He promised it in
      his first administration. It did not happen. Mr. Biden promised it. It did not
      happen. Mr. Trump has promised it again. It still hasn’t happened. You have to
      now answer the question: Why not? And that’s because the totality of variables
      that any decision-making corporate executive uses says: Don’t be crazy, don’t
      undertake the costs and the risks of moving production to the United States, given
      the uncertainties and the instability of what is going on in the United States.
      And Mr. Herky-Jerky Trump’s tariff policy and interest rate policy, only makes
      that worse. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, let’s look at China’s success and see: What
      is it doing so differently from the United States? Why do American leaders accuse
      China of being America’s existential enemy? They are singling it out as an enemy
      because it demonstrates that there is a better way of organizing an economy, and
      raising living standards, and creating prosperity, than the finance capital model
      that the United States and Europe are following. And what China’s doing is actually
      following the classical economics of industrial capitalism. They call it industrial
      socialism, but industrial socialism was the logical evolution of industrial capitalism
      already by the late 19th century. The idea of a free market, from Adam Smith’s
      time to John Stuart Mill all the way through Marx, was a market free from rentier
      income, free from the landlords. The first half of the 19th century was spent
      by the industrialists saying: We cannot compete with foreign countries if we have
      a landlord class that is going to block food imports in order to make higher farm
      rents for their agricultural land at the cost of higher food prices by the labor
      that we have to employ. You have to repeal the Corn Laws. Well, that took 30 years
      from the time that the Corn Laws were imposed in 1815. The economists then said:
      It’s more than landlords. It’s economic rent. It’s the excess of prices over the
      real cost of production. And that cost can be not only for land rent, but for
      the monopolies. And the monopolies are created largely to help kings and parliamentary
      governments raise money to pay the war debts that they were running up ever since
      the 13th century. And the final problem to be attacked was that banks in England
      and America didn’t really play a role in financing industry at all. The whole
      idea was to change the financial system that actually financed industry. None
      of that worked out. All of these hopes: What everybody expected to see, that economies
      would be socialized into a mixed public and private economy, they’d be regulated
      markets to get free of economic rent, so that people wouldn’t have to deal with
      a class of wealthy people that made money without working and contributing to
      production in any way. Well, it turns out that China’s biggest, unique characteristic
      of industrial socialism has been to keep money and finance in the hands of China’s
      central bank, in its own Treasury. So it’s the government that creates money,
      not an independent commercial banking system. And so China’s banks don’t lend
      for corporate takeovers. They don’t borrow money to make dividend payouts or stock
      buybacks to push up their prices. The credit that’s created based on the Chinese
      Treasury and the People’s Bank of China is designed to build infrastructure, factories,
      and all of the things that China has been doing. To the Americans, that’s what
      makes China an existential enemy. If America were to do that strategy of raising
      industrialization, increasing employment and living standards, that would free
      the American economy from this billionaire class that we’ve been talking about
      for the last half hour. The billionaire class is — think of it almost as a tumor
      on the economy, as a parasite. They pretend to be part of the real economy of
      production and consumption. They pretend to be helpful, and even necessary, for
      industry to take place. But they’re not helpful at all. They’ve led the de-industrialization
      of the country. And so, of course, what we’re dealing with is almost a civilizational
      conflict now between a society, from Europe to the United States, run by billionaires
      who make money by de-industrializing the economy, and squeezing living standards,
      and driving the wage-earning force further into debt so that it can’t afford to
      buy the products that it makes, on the one hand. And then you have China’s model
      on the other. And by providing this model — the antithesis of the American model
      — that’s what today’s fights internationally, including next week’s BRICS meetings,
      are all about. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, I think we can bring in the case of BRICS
      and the conflicts we have — the conflict in Ukraine, in the Middle East, with
      China, all of that. How are these conflicts with the West going to be translated
      into the future of BRICS? We have the BRICS summit here in Brazil. In your opinion,
      what are the main issues to be considered by this summit? RICHARD WOLFF: The way
      I would begin this is to remind everyone of a really historic statistic that was
      released last week. And that statistic said that, for the first time, the total
      of trade within the BRICS community crossed $1 trillion. It had never done that
      before, and, for me, this is a summary of everything we’ve been talking about.
      What the BRICS are — and at this point, I feel free to exaggerate a little bit
      because the line of direction is clear — the BRICS are becoming the economic alternative,
      the other context for Russia, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, and the
      other countries that are involved. They are now in a position to do what they
      never could do before in at least three or four hundred years: namely, live and
      grow without a dependency on the United States or Western Europe or Japan. And
      that is what this statistic shows. They could find in one another the market for
      their exports and the source for their needed inputs that would enable them to
      have a growth path adequate to sustain those societies. That’s never been true,
      in my judgment, before. Part of the result of colonialism and its lasting economic
      achievement was to force Asia, Africa, and Latin America into a subordinate position
      in Western capitalism. So that whatever they might do, their dependence on that
      subordinated position would hold them back from doing anything that the West didn’t
      want them to do, which included becoming independent. Oh, they could become, after
      a while, independent politically, when that couldn’t be prevented anymore — when
      the Mau Mau in Kenya and Mahatma Gandhi in India put an end to all of that — they
      were still subordinate to economic capitalism. Now, for the first time, they have
      created an institution that was the dream of the Bandung Conference back in 1955,
      but could not be realized. Now it’s realized. And the credit for that goes to
      China. This has nothing to do with endorsing what happens in China or being critical
      of China, which you can be, and should be, in many ways. They have their flaws
      like everybody else. But what they have achieved, no amount of pretense can be
      taken away from them. They now are able to say to the United States that the longer
      you act as a rogue nation in the world, the more we will build an alternative
      to you that will, in the end, isolate you. And you better be careful, lest the
      policies you choose accelerate your isolation rather than overcome it. And I’ll
      give you two examples. The decision to push NATO all the way into Ukraine. The
      Americans understood it. The literature there is clear. They understood what they
      were doing. They understood that the Russians opposed it. They made that clear.
      They understood that the deal at the end with the unification of Germany entailed
      a commitment not to move NATO to Russia’s border. When they did it anyway, Russia
      was too weak to do anything, when they did it in Poland or they did it in the
      Czech Republic, or they did it in Romania. But when they finally came to Ukraine,
      Russia felt it had the military means, but just as important, it had the BRICS.
      And that meant it could be free of its dependence. The first thing that the Europeans
      and the Americans did, once the Russian military moved into the Donbass in February
      2022, was to develop the so-called sanctions policy. They didn’t need to develop
      the military. They had been working militarily with the Ukrainians for at least
      the previous eight years. What was new, what was different, and what was thought
      to be decisive were the sanctions. Europe would no longer buy Russian oil and
      gas. If Russia was a gas station pretending to be a nation — a joke made in America
      — well, they would show them what happens to a gas station when no one stops by
      to load up with gas. What they never counted on was the BRICS, that Russia could
      turn to two BRICS allies — India and China — and sell all the oil and gas it could
      pump; and thereby fund the very military operation that the sanctions were supposed
      to make impossible. That was a miscalculation whose results we’re living through:
      the de-industrialization of Europe because it doesn’t have cheap energy from Russia
      anymore; the particular disintegration of the leading position of Germany, which
      was the dominant economy and is, now, with Britain, the basket case of the European
      economy… Wow, the cost of not understanding the BRICS! And now the Chinese can
      make jokes about Mr. Trump’s tariffs. If they can’t sell in the United States,
      they have another place to go. This is cataclysmic in its consequences, not just
      in terms of economics, but in terms of military struggles, political struggles,
      on and on and on. Israel cannot proceed against Iran if Iran’s membership as a
      BRICS nation gives it access, as it looks like it does, to the support of Russia,
      China and India. And of course, you have to have a ceasefire. Israel, I mean,
      that’s not going to work: Israel has 8 million Jewish Israelis, and Iran has 90
      million Muslims. You don’t want to do that. You do not want to do that. Not unless
      you have the old colonial system. It’s really the old colonial system that’s finally
      dying. And we have to understand that we have been living through 300 to 400 years
      in which colonialism has been the way the world capitalist system organized itself.
      It shouldn’t have, didn’t have to, but that was the way it developed. And now
      those chickens are coming home and the world has changed. And the BRICS that meets
      next week, having achieved the milestone of a trillion dollars worth of trade
      among them, is in the driver’s seat. And the United States is watching because
      that’s about all it can do. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, President Trump certainly agrees
      with you, Richard, about the BRICS and China, what you just said. I’ve also been
      saying it, and I think we’ve been saying it on Nima’s show. Trump has been threatening
      this week and next week. He says he’s threatening countries that trade with China
      by imposing very high tariffs to deny them the U.S. market. Well, as you point
      out, the United States isn’t the only market, and the market it has is shrinking
      anyway. So, of course, this is going to lead China to work with other Asian countries
      and global south countries to develop the market. Trump is also imposing sanctions
      on Russia. If countries don’t impose trade sanctions on Russia, they’re going
      to have very high tariffs. I think, for China, he said the tariff will be 500%.
      That’s five times the price of the imported good if you trade with China. This
      really is, for Trump, a conflict of civilizations, and he’s betting everything
      on it. And you’re right. What is he defending? It’s financial colonialism. And
      although, quite rightly, this is no longer the old colonialism of military occupation
      and settler states that you’ve had from Africa to South America to North America,
      it’s still very highly military. And as we’ve discussed before, the military arm
      is the final threat that America has against other countries to enforce its policy.
      Well, to do that, you need an enormous military expenditure. And if you look at
      the United States and also Europe, the leaders of the stock market are the military
      firms. This is called Military Keynesianism. Trump’s bill, I think, is leading
      to a trillion dollars to be spent on building the Golden Dome, his version of
      Israel’s Iron Dome, to protect itself from Russian missiles — if they go very,
      very slowly. But Russian missiles don’t go very, very slowly. It doesn’t work.
      The whole strategy is so transparently just a means of spending the largest element
      in the budget for arms and products that don’t have a function, except to make
      profits for the investors in these companies. That’s yet another element in America
      de-industrialization for all of this. But it’s also very dangerous because it’s
      threatening the whole world. If you’re going to have all of these arms, you’re
      going to try to use them sometimes. They don’t work, and you’re going to lose,
      just as you’re losing in Ukraine. But that’s the policy we have, and it’s a bipartisan
      policy. Democrats and Republicans together all have pretty much the same donor
      class funders for deciding who’s going to be on the ballots when you vote in November.
      So that’s really the problem. The BRICS and China are not only breaking away with
      trade and investment in the United States, they’re creating a different kind of
      economy. And that’s really what Richard and I have been talking about for most
      of our lives: a socialist economy as opposed to a finance capitalist economy.
      RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, I should also remind people that the United States, once,
      as the empire, had what its supporters like to call things like ideological influence,
      or cultural hegemony, or, you know, a lot of words — soft power — words like that.
      And there is a great anxiety right now in Washington. I don’t want to minimize
      this. Mr. Trump doesn’t have a clear sailing. There’s a great deal of anxiety
      that, for example, eliminating USAID, whatever you think of it, is damaging American
      soft power. It was an agency that did some good around the world — hyped the good
      it did for the maximum amount of publicity you could get for it — but those are
      parts of what successful empires do. It made sure that when votes came up in the
      United Nations, it could mobilize pretty much the whole world to vote in a particular
      way, to make it look like what the United States was doing was globally supported.
      All of that is gone now. One of the reasons they’re giving all the money to the
      military is their economic influence is shrinking and their political influence
      is shrinking. Really, one of the few things they have is the ability to keep being
      the number one military power, at least by the amount that they spend. There’s
      a famous statistic, been well known for the last 50 years, that the United States
      spends more on military than the next nine countries, together, spend. And those
      nine include Russia and China, and the remaining ones are all allies of the United
      States. So, with this overwhelming predominance, you’re getting a mentality that
      shouldn’t surprise you: that the military has to be what we celebrate, and focus
      on, and rely on. And I think you could see it coming up when a decision is made,
      a week or so ago, by Mr. Trump — unilaterally — to bomb Iran, a country with whom
      we were not at war, which had not declared on us, nor we on them, that we were
      in the midst of actual negotiations with. Mr. Trump suddenly hit them with a bomb,
      and then immediately the next day said: Now let’s sit down and talk. Well, that
      is a use of the military to intimidate, and to shape, and to control, what’s going
      on. And maybe it’ll work for a while, but it is the last card they have to play.
      And it should be understood in that light. And that’s why the BRICS is important.
      And I need to say to some of my fellow economists: This is not an argument that
      the BRICS represent the socialist future, or that the BRICS are homogeneous. They’re
      not. Mr. Modi in India is a different thing from Xi Jinping in China. And they’re
      both very different from Lula in Brazil, and so on. They have enormous differences,
      as an international collection of 25 countries would have to be. What I’m focusing
      on is the project they all share. That’s what’s remarkable. They haven’t been
      able to do that in the past. They haven’t overcome all of their differences to
      be able to do that in the past. They are now being caught up, in my judgment,
      in this historic moment of the final end of colonialism that they know they’ve
      been fighting all of their lives. They know the end is in sight. And the United
      States is a society devoted to not seeing what I just said. That’s why, in the
      last presidential election, neither Mr. Trump, nor Mr. Biden, nor Kamala Harris,
      ever said a word about a declining empire. This is the greatest example of collective
      denial that you could ask for. But for just that reason, it jumps out at those
      of us who don’t need to deny it. We see it all too clearly. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well,
      what you’re saying is that the BRICS and the other countries, despite their differences,
      they’re reinventing the wheel. And what’s so striking is that the wheel that they’re
      reinventing is very much like the revolutionary impact of industrial capitalism
      that it had in Britain and the rest of Europe. The British had to deal with the
      problem that there was land rent that was taken by their landlord class. There
      isn’t a landlord class; they got rid of it. But the BRICS countries have something
      much like a landlord class, and that’s the foreign investors in their subsoil
      wealth; foreign investors in their oil, their mining, their forests. RICHARD WOLFF:
      And, Michael, what you specialize in: their heavy international debt. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Yes, that too. But I want to focus, first of all, on the fact that they’re
      dealing with the rentier class — that England and Germany and the industrial capitalist
      countries of the 19th century had to deal with — [it] was domestic. But the BRICS
      have to deal with a foreign capitalist class. That’s what makes financial imperialism
      so different and independent from colonialism. The monopolies, because the attempt
      to finance their economy when the foreign investors take all of their natural
      wealth rents for themselves — instead of leaving it as the tax base for their
      own countries — means that the government doesn’t have enough money to build the
      infrastructure necessary to make a balanced economy like the industrial capitalists.
      And so they run a budget deficit and a balance of payments deficit. They have
      to borrow from the International Monetary Fund, or else see their currencies plunge
      and their inflation going up. And that requires them to sell off their natural
      monopolies — their communications, their transportation infrastructure — all the
      things that were kept in the public domain in the mixed economies of Europe and
      the United States. Well, of course, once they sell this off, the monopoly rents
      have to be sent abroad, along with the land rents. And finally, as you point out,
      the debt service. Once you borrow from the IMF and from bondholders to finance
      the balance-of-trade deficits that you’ve suffered as a result of letting the
      United States and Europe impose a neoliberal model that doesn’t work, then you’re
      left without national self-sufficiency and sovereignty anymore. The BRICS countries
      are trying to — for the first time — achieve the sovereignty that they have not
      been able to achieve by running into debt, by not being able to tax foreign investment
      in their natural resources, by not being able to tax monopoly rents from the public
      utilities that they’ve had to sell off. All of this had to break down at a point.
      And Trump has catalyzed all of this breakdown because, by imposing tariffs on
      these countries, they can’t pay their foreign debts anymore. The United States
      is going to treat this as an existential threat and do everything it can against
      them. So now they think: Well, why don’t we do what made industrial capitalism
      work so well in its take-off? Why don’t we impose rent taxes on foreign investors
      in our national resources? Why don’t we nationalize the monopolies by passing
      antitrust legislation? And why don’t we just realize that the debts that we’ve
      run up have been run up as a result of financial colonialism, not our sovereign
      decisions, but their odious debts. That’s the fight that we’re going to see, is
      the inherent logic of the situation. RICHARD WOLFF: We’ve already seen that in
      recent years. There are movements around the world to cancel the debts. There
      is a reminder for those who take seriously the religious histories that almost
      all religions many centuries ago understood how we began today’s conversation:
      that unbridled inequality, if allowed to continue, destroys the community, destroys
      whatever social cohesion holds us together. So they developed, and attributed
      to whatever deity they believed in, the commandment for a Jubilee year, for every
      10 years, or every 20 years. It varied. You would take the land and redistribute
      it. If you happened to have gotten a good piece of land that made you a rich person,
      in the redistribution, that land would go to whom? It would go to a person whose
      land didn’t get enough rain or didn’t get enough soil fertility, and that way
      the rich would become poorer and the poorer would become richer. And no one would
      become crazy about accumulating wealth because you are getting every day closer
      to the time when you would lose it anyway. It just transformed the whole relationship
      of people to accumulated wealth. And the irony is, of course, the same religion,
      once capitalism comes, has to get rid of that, and does get rid of that, because
      it would undercut the whole notion of the value, the incentive value, of becoming
      rich, which was their argument, which would justify the endlessness of exploitation.
      All of that is coming to an end. That’s what it means to be at the end of an empire.
      The really interesting question, which maybe we should take up, is whether the
      end of the U.S. capitalist empire, is it the end of capitalism itself? Or not?
      That’s like asking: Is China the next empire? Or will the Chinese bring us a multinational
      community, which was after all the ideal of the League of Nations, the United
      Nations, and people who wanted to see peace as the rule of law, rather than violence,
      which is what we have now. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you so much. Michael, do you
      want to add something? MICHAEL HUDSON: No, I’ve been saying the same thing that
      Richard has been saying. We’re the two people who were saying this because we’re
      taking the long historical point of view. And what Richard has just described
      is what Confucianism was all about: rulers were supposed to keep the peace. They
      were supposed to keep the population satisfied enough so that they did not revolt.
      And again, they’re reinventing the wheel now. It’s a different mentality from
      America’s bully mentality: If you don’t let us take all of the wealth for ourselves,
      we’re going to hurt you. I don’t think that was the philosophy of any earlier
      religion, which was the ideology of their societies. It’s Western finance capitalism,
      or whatever you want to call it, that has diverged from this core of civilization
      from the very beginning. So, in a sense, you could say that the BRICS and China
      and global majority are moving back to this central norm, leaving the United States
      and Europe isolated, unless they join the movement of history, instead of accusing
      this return to civilization as being a clash of civilizations, as if the U.S.
      and Europe is actually a self-sufficient civilization, instead of barbarism. The
      world will choose socialism, not barbarism, as Rosa Luxemburg put it. RICHARD
      WOLFF: Well, I would add that we should remember one more historical reality.
      Successive kings of France accumulated wealth. But when the accumulation of wealth
      reached absolutely insane proportions in the 18th century, when you would have
      unbelievable urban poverty in Paris, and an hour away, in Versailles, you would
      see, as you can still see today, the most spectacular collection and concentration
      of wealth imaginable by the last king. He’s also the one who got his head chopped
      off. That’s how that story of the accumulation… you know. And when you watch Jeffrey
      Bezos take over the city of Venice for two weeks of indulgence of his wedding,
      when he arrives at the port in his $500 million dollar yacht, that’s what we’re
      watching. We’re watching this eon’s Versailles. And we’re going to get the next
      step of it, likely, also. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the question then is: Can this
      return to civilization that we’re talking about be done without a military confrontation?
      Is America actually going to war with China? It’s trying to stir up fights against
      China, with Taiwan, with its neighboring countries. It’s trying to stir up fights
      in Central Asia against Russia. China was able to make its reforms because there
      was a revolution in 1945. And when China emerged as a country in 1949, they didn’t
      have a financial class. So, of course, the government had to create the money.
      But that took a revolution. Will it take a revolution, a defensive revolution,
      for the BRICS, and this higher civilization, to emerge? Because the violence will
      not be on their part. Marx pointed out that there would probably be violence by
      the privileged classes, the rentier classes, by the landlords and the wealthy
      against the people attempting to get a revolution, as you saw in the Paris Commune
      in 1871. It’s the people who have made wealth without working, who know that there
      are parasites who are willing to fight so hard, and so violently, to preserve
      their claims on wealth that consist of the ability to impoverish the rest of the
      population below them. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, and you have to wonder whether that
      isn’t matched by the military thinkers who tell us that looking, as a military
      person, at China over the last 40 years and the United States, one is crystal
      clearly ascending, and the other one is crystal clearly descending. And what that
      means is time is on one side, and not the other. And what will that lead the military
      of the United States to contemplate? NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you so much, Richard
      and Michael. Great pleasure, as always. Have a great time. Bye-bye. Photo by Robs

    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion about Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill,"
      Michael Hudson argues that the bill, along with Trump's tariff policy, could undermine
      dollar hegemony and lead to a depreciation of the dollar's exchange rate.
    paragraph_summary: In a discussion on July 3, 2025, Nima Alkhorchid, Richard Wolff,
      and Michael Hudson examined the implications of Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful
      Bill," which aims to address budget deficits and includes tariff policies. Hudson
      argued that the bill could undermine the dollar's hegemony by intentionally lowering
      its exchange rate, a strategy he deemed unrealistic given the U.S.'s diminished
      industrial exports. He criticized the bill as "fantasy" economics, highlighting
      concerns among Republicans about potential electoral repercussions due to cuts
      in medical coverage and Medicaid, which could alienate their constituents. Overall,
      Hudson suggested that the bill's passage could end the U.S.'s ability to sustain
      large military and trade deficits without facing currency depreciation.

    text: 'Dialogue Works 2025.06.26 NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody. Today is Thursday,
      June 26, 2025, and our friends Michael Hudson and Richard Wolff are back with
      us. Welcome back. RICHARD WOLFF: Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: I’m going to
      start, Michael, with what has happened in the Middle East: the new confrontation
      between Iran and Israel, which later on the United States has joined and attacked
      Iran. It seems that, for the time being, we have some sort of ceasefire and they’ve
      stopped attacking each other. What’s your take on what has happened in the Middle
      East and the implication or the outcome of those policies coming to the United
      States? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the ceasefire obviously lets both sides recover
      for a week or so, maybe a month, and the fighting is obviously going to continue.
      The fighting in the Near East by Israel, and the U.S. fight against Iran, is going
      to continue, certainly until the election. The majority of voters that have been
      tested in America are against the war. They’re against the attacks by Israel on
      Gaza. They’re against America’s participation in the war, extending the war in
      the Near East against Iran. But the leadership of both parties is completely for
      the war. We’re in a very unique situation here. The leadership of both the Republican
      and the Democratic parties are diametrically opposed to what the voters want,
      which is peace. The fight against what the voters want, the fight against advocates
      for peace – advocates against the increase in the military budget at the expense
      of social programs – is becoming very vicious. You saw all of that viciousness
      in the election yesterday on June 25th for who was going to be the Democratic
      [candidate for] mayor of New York. This is the first test of how voters actually
      feel against all of this, and what it means for what the American official politics
      are going to be in the war. That’s why this is so official, because it was very
      explicitly a revolt against the Democratic Party leadership for who is going to
      be the Democratic candidate. It was framed that way. I’d like to give a little
      bit of background on this. I think the election was about much more, as I said,
      against the mayor. It’s the future of the Democratic Party. And the major reason
      for the opposition to the Democratic candidate against [Governor] Cuomo is the
      party’s pro-war, pro-Zionist, pro-Wall Street opposition to labor. And yet the
      most immediate catalyst for the victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York was the
      college-educated young voters. And for them, the major frame of this vote was
      what you’ve been hearing about for the last few months: Columbia’s University
      crackdown on the anti-war protests and its punishment of student anti-war demonstrators.
      This crackdown on opposition to the war has dominated the attention of the whole
      graduating class this June, and of progressives in general. And these protests
      are very much like the Vietnam War protests in the 1960s. Most students are against
      the war. Most progressives are against the war, just as the polls have shown.
      And so most voters supported the students, and there was a universal revulsion
      against Columbia University’s president apologizing to Congress for not protecting
      these students against accusations of anti-Semitism. When the Republican politician
      was accusing the head of Columbia, saying, you know, why did you let students
      say that they want peace and oppose the bombing of Gaza? If they support Palestinian
      rights, they are anti-Semitic. Columbia University’s president apologized and
      said, of course, she will punish the students who demonstrated against the war.
      She will expel the students who gave speeches and wrote papers against the war.
      And of course, she was fired when the public abhorrence of this toadying, this
      surrender to anyone who accused one of being anti-Semitic, that just has been
      in the front pages of the papers for the last few months – because it’s not only
      Columbia University, [it’s also] the fight against Harvard. If Harvard lets a
      professor write a paper or lecture about the need for support for a two-state
      solution or opposing the war, the bombing of Gaza, they’re being forced out, and
      the students are being blocked. President Trump wants to ban foreign students
      altogether. Well, Mamdani, the victor in this election, [was] running against
      the vested interests, against the Democratic Party’s candidate, who one month
      ago was given a 97.5% chance of winning. There was so much money behind Cuomo.
      There were so many vicious attacks. Everyone in New York – I live in Queens, and
      my mailbox was filled with large campaign propaganda against Mamdani. “He’s a
      radical communist.” “He’s a socialist.” “His backers are terrorists.” You can’t
      imagine the extreme. And the fact is that the pro-war candidates, the Zionists,
      overplayed their hands to such a point that there was a revulsion at trying to
      smear him. It’s as if to oppose the war is to be an anti-Semite. So the voters
      for the first time had a chance to come out and react to this polarization of
      the economy between the political parties on the right wing of the spectrum, the
      pro-war, anti-labor parties, both the Republicans and the Democrats, and the voters
      who are not pro-war and are certainly not anti-Semitic, but they’re against the
      war. So anyone who opposes ethnic cleansing in Gaza is accused of being anti-Semitic.
      The fact that a Muslim candidate advocating peace won so overwhelmingly against
      the party’s interests shows that the Democratic central committee’s attempt to
      fight against Bernie Sanders, AOC, and any defender of labor’s interest, of public
      health, of public spending instead of military spending, is going to tear the
      party apart. And, obviously, that is going to affect how American foreign policy
      responds to the Near East. And this Democratic Party leadership is the same that
      in the 2016 presidential election, they preferred to lose with Hillary Clinton
      instead of winning with Bernie Sanders. Their opposition against what they call
      socialism, which used to be called liberalism or social democracy, their opposition
      to this, their support of Wall Street, of the financial class, of the landlord
      class, of the military and budget, and the military industrial complex was responsible
      for Donald Trump’s victory. Voters stopped voting for the Democratic Party. You
      can look at the vote for the mayor of New York as a microcosm of what the fight
      is for voters against the Democratic Party. Last year, you had Jill Stein and
      me on your show explaining what the Green Party’s position was against the war.
      Jill’s campaigning in Michigan and the Midwest, Minnesota, was largely responsible
      for the anti-war voters not voting for the Democratic candidate and opening the
      way for Trump’s victory. The Democrats saw that, and Kamala Harris said she’d
      rather lose the election than support the anti-war position. She lost the election
      by her support of Netanyahu and the Likud Party. The interesting thing is that,
      as I said, the college-educated voters voted three to one for Mamdani. This is
      supposed to be the traditional support of the Democratic Party’s professional
      managerial class, or the future professional managerial class. Cuomo won largely
      with the poorest income districts, especially in Harlem and the very wealthy sections
      of New York. The city was blanketed, and you have that polarization of the Democratic
      Party’s attempt to base its voters on ethnicity and other identities that are
      not those of wage earners, not those of the working class. That basically shows
      the failure of their divide and conquer strategy. All the polls of the voters
      in New York, as they’re doing the post-mortems of the elections, show that they
      want the Democratic leadership replaced. It’s holding on to power, it’s denouncing
      Bernie Sanders and members of the Democratic National Committee who wanted reform
      and said we need younger members than the existing leadership. And we have to
      replace Schumer, who is the candidate of the senator from Wall Street and Tel
      Aviv. That he has discredited himself by the extremism that has polarized American
      politics. For the first time, you’re having all of this broken out into the open.
      The positions that most of your commentators have been taking on your show, Nima,
      are really those of the party. The Wall Street Journal’s headline was: Wall Street
      panics over the prospect of a socialist running New York City. You’ve seen Trump
      call him a communist radical. Imagine: just for supporting rent controls, for
      supporting a raise in the minimum wage, this is now called communism. This is
      called radical. And it’s called anti-semitism. And the people who hate Mamdani,
      who’ve been funding him, there was a $20 million support of the PAC against him.
      The wealthy billionaire supermarket owner, John Catsimatidis, said he was going
      to close his Gristedes grocery stores if New York voted for or ended up electing
      Mamdani. The hedge fund leaders said that they would leave New York if Mamdani
      was there. Citigroup, the most right-wing bank in New York, has thrown all of
      its support against someone else. And even though Mamdani won the election, Cuomo
      said he’s going to run in the [election] to try to attract and get all of his
      funding to fight against Mamdani. And the Democrats have said, no, please don’t
      run. We’re going to back the current mayor, Adams. And we’re also going to convince
      the Republicans not to send, not to mount a New York mayor’s candidate, such as
      Curtis Leva, by offering him a job in the Trump administration, just so Cuomo
      will have another chance to run against Mamdani. And we’re going to throw the
      whole power of the press, of the public media, against them. I think I’ve given
      the idea. Richard lives in New York, too. So the fact is that both of us are right
      in the center of this. And I think its meaning is international in character,
      not merely local. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Go ahead, Richard. RICHARD WOLFF: I would like
      to build on what Michael has said and talk a little bit about further dimensions
      of what has happened. But I certainly start off by saying I was dubious that he
      could do this, Mr. Mamdani, and I was wrong to be dubious. He did it. He did it
      better than I thought he could ever imagine doing it. I don’t know him personally,
      but I would guess if he were sitting here, he’d probably admit that he’s overwhelmed
      by it as well. We live in a country that for the last 75 years has basically decreed
      that any candidate for elective office who accepts the label “socialist” is thereby
      committing political suicide and will not be heard from again. And one of the
      reasons Bernie Sanders is the important person that he is, is because he broke
      that taboo a few years ago. And then AOC and the others who have come since have
      shown us, and this is the first important thing, they have shown us that the American
      people, despite 75 years of unrelenting purging of socialists and anyone who smelled
      or looked like a socialist, from public office, from respect, from a job, from
      an unbelievable program of 75 years of something akin to the Spanish Inquisition
      (it didn’t quite kill people, although indirectly, given the jobs it destroyed,
      the mental health it destroyed, the people imprisoned and deported), because this
      begins with the anti-communism right after World War II. It is extraordinary that
      we can see millions of people come out to support Bernie, hundreds of thousands
      to support other congressional candidates, starting with AOC, and now the biggest
      city in the country overwhelmingly electing Mamdani is a city where the Republican
      Party has very little power. So it’s a Democratic city, and it’s clear what it
      just did. This is therefore an historic event. No matter what happens between
      now and November, this is an enormous step forward for the rehabilitation of socialism
      within the American political discourse. Everybody should understand it, and that
      the person who carries that banner is not your charming grandpa Bernie and is
      not a beautiful young woman who articulates brilliantly, AOC, but is a young man
      who has the nerve to be supportive of the Palestinians and the nerve to present
      himself as a Muslim. It really does tell you of shiftings in the American political
      scene that ought to have the leaders of the Democratic Party very worried. Number
      one. Number two, I would like to link the Middle East with this. And I want to
      do it in this way. Over the last 20 to 25 years, we have seen, I’m exaggerating,
      but I want to make the basic point – we have seen a shift of the definition of
      politics from something done locally, immediately by people going door to door,
      advertising their candidates and leaving a brochure, to spending money on the
      internet, on television, on big, costly promotions. We have, at the same time,
      seen the ability of our leaders to basically live and speak and act in their own
      psychological drama, unconnected with what people think. When Michael reminds
      us that the majority of people don’t want war and the majority of people don’t
      want persecution of students who have a view on something happening thousands
      of miles away, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, he is talking about alienation.
      We don’t believe the bullshit that’s coming from the mass media. That’s why it
      was possible for Mr. Trump to simply say, well, that’s all fake media because
      enough people have figured that out. Not just the ones he called fake media. He’s
      a fake too. Nothing illustrates this more than the last two weeks. We don’t know
      because the political leaders of our world don’t tell us what’s going on. Do you
      know what amount of damage the Iranians did in Israel? The answer is, no, you
      don’t. You have a snippet here and a clip over there. But that doesn’t tell you
      very much. Do you know how much damage was really done in Iran? No, you don’t.
      Do you know whether the nuclear target was the real target? You don’t know. Did
      they actually get that target? If it was, you don’t know. This is theater, folks.
      This is all theater. There’s something going on, no doubt. And I wish I knew,
      and I wish you knew so we could talk intelligently about what the reality means.
      But we can’t. We are a step back. The reality we have is the theater put forward.
      There’s a reaction that people have when they figure out, each in their own little
      moment, when you figure out that you don’t know. And now you are angry because
      you’re being played with. That anger showed up in the race for mayor in New York
      in a very dramatic way. I’m going to give myself as an example. I live in Manhattan.
      I participated in that vote. The vast majority of candidates never interacted
      with me, neither where I shop, nor where I work, nor in my home. However, two
      candidates actually sent a human being. One, the local city council candidate,
      who won a young woman whose political affiliations are the usual, that is to say,
      nothing. Two young people, excuse me, three young people came to me for Mamdani.
      On one occasion, two young men, and on the other occasion, one young woman. All
      three were in their 20s. I could see them and look at them. They had lots to tell
      me about Mamdani, but I cut them short and told them they didn’t need to. This
      household would all go for Mamdani. Mamdani made the decision, to his credit,
      to do that, to try to reach voters one by one in an endless process of citizens
      talking to citizens. And you know, you don’t have to be a Freudian psychologist
      to understand the importance of that is not the words that are spoken, whatever
      they are. It’s the moment in which a person like you, who lives a few blocks from
      you and has a life more or less like you do, and shops where you do, feels strong
      enough to come and talk to you. That’s worth a million dollars of bullshit publicity.
      Mr. Cuomo raised money and presented the usual theater. The people of New York
      responded by giving him the middle finger. You can’t do that in Iran because it’s
      far away. And you can’t do it in Washington and you can’t do it in Tel Aviv. But
      you are also angry at the theater. One of the few things that we know is real
      is that what’s going on in Gaza is horrific and immoral because we have enough
      of the bullshit to know that nobody disagrees on that. The Israelis spin it as
      they wish, the Americans as they wish. We get that, but we know there’s something
      real. Mr. Mamdani is something real because he’s so different from the normal
      theatrics. So, this is a vote that is corroborated by most of the polls that I
      see conducted by the Pew folks who do very good polling and many of the others.
      And that is that the majority of people in the Democratic Party are alienated
      from that party, and it is true of the Republicans now as well. Mr. Trump is too
      much like what he promised he would not be. And so he is falling into the trap,
      as many predicted he would have, so, you know, accommodating. And so he’s losing
      what he once had. I know it sounds far-fetched, but if you follow the logic, Mr.
      Mamdani is doing a better Trump than Trump can now do. That’s why he won. The
      trick will be: can he sustain it? Can he build on what he has started, a good,
      solid foundation, a spectacular win? Can he? Will he get good advice from AOC
      and Bernie and the others to help him do that? Or will the assembled theater producers
      unify themselves the way Michael sketched it and rally behind anybody, somebody
      to try to fight this. Their odds are not good. If they were going to do this,
      they waited for too long. They don’t have a good candidate. Choosing Mr. Cuomo
      with his horrific record of anti-female sexism and being as polite as I know how,
      that was a very poor choice, to say the least. And most of the others they have
      don’t hold a candle. On the other hand, they have what a politics of theater needs.
      They have tons and tons of money. Look at the millions that were reported to have
      been given to Mr. Cuomo in the declining weeks of this campaign, from Michael
      Bloomberg, former mayor, from Mr. Langone, the Home Depot co-founder. You know,
      the billionaires lined it up behind Andrew Cuomo, just like the billionaires lined
      up behind Mr. Trump at his inauguration. Everybody knows it’s a theater paid for
      by billionaires. And Mr. Mamdani teaches everyone across the United States. Every
      city in America has socialists in it. That’s the truth. They have all wondered,
      some of them for 50 years, would it ever be possible that a set of circumstances
      could arrive into which socialists could move? The answer is: that’s what Mr.
      Mamdani just showed you. Yes, New York is different from other cities. But Bernie
      comes from Vermont, and that’s very different from New York. And even AOC comes
      from Queens, which is quite different in many ways from Manhattan and from the
      Bronx, and on and on and on. Mr. Mamdani won across most of that. This is, therefore,
      a very remarkable moment in which, as Marx would have loved to point out, the
      internal contradictions of capitalism, the financialization not only of the economy,
      but of the electoral process, its distraction from all human interaction, the
      desire of capitalists to make money by having each of us lost in our little cell
      phone, lost in our internet box, unconnected to anybody else, so that every human
      activity is mediated by their system of mass media and mass control. All that
      we’re watching is a reaction against that. The candidate who can mobilize that,
      Mr. Mamdani, in this circumstance, yet others we don’t know of yet who will pick
      up this baton. If any of this comes true, as I see the possibility and as I know,
      others like me see the possibility, we are going to be in for some big changes.
      Last point: even the theater is now becoming disorganized out of its own contradictions.
      Let’s not miss this. The president announces with enormous enthusiasm the obliteration
      of the targets in Iran. Within hours, the intelligence chief of the United States
      says, No, it’s not clear that we did it. It’s in a mountain. We don’t know. But
      it looks like not much was done. Okay? This is a poorly organized theater. You
      ought to be able to do better than that. What the hell is going on here? And now
      the Iranians, as if they almost understand it, began in the first day or two saying
      very little damage was done. And yesterday released a statement, “Great damage
      was done.” They’re beginning to understand too that what is the truth here is
      utterly irrelevant. It’s a theater. Everybody’s thinking, what do I need to say
      about this event that will enhance whatever project I have? That’s the only question.
      What the truth of the matter is, is of no importance. You know, you can do that
      for 20 or 30 years. You really can. And then people begin to react to figuring
      out that’s what you’re doing. And then it loses. It’s like chewing gum. Very good
      at the beginning, but within 10 minutes, you have no idea what that is in your
      mouth anymore because it is no longer able to do what it did at the beginning.
      That’s the lesson of every war. Michael made that point a couple of programs ago.
      The lesson of Vietnam was: don’t put troops in these countries. A, you’re going
      to lose, and B, you’re going to lose because your own people will not tolerate
      that level of death and destruction. So now you have to have an electronic war.
      Yeah, but an electronic war can’t do what boots on the ground [can]. The contradictions
      never stop, and they never see them, which is lucky for us because we do. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Richard’s given a wonderful description of why so many Americans actually
      support socialism instead of what we have today. There have been a number of opinion
      polls of Americans saying, how do you react to the word socialism? And how do
      you react to capitalism? Most voters prefer socialism to capitalism as a word
      and presumably as a policy. When Richard says there are going to be big changes
      as a result of this, the change is going to be how this preference of voters against
      the pro-Wall Street finance capitalist policies that we have is ever going to
      express themselves politically in what’s become, as Richard said, a financialized
      electoral system. There’s nothing I can add to what he said about socialism, but
      I want to make one comment about how Netanyahu’s attack on progressive American
      Jews is splitting them. Netanyahu has said that the greatest enemies of Israel
      are the progressive American Jews, who are not supporting Israel’s attack on Gaza.
      He said that anyone who does not support Israel against the Palestinians is an
      anti-Semite. Well, New York City has the largest Jewish population in the world
      outside of Tel Aviv. So you’re having here an expression of how the extent to
      which this Zionism has itself become anti-Semitic. I won’t say anti-Semitic, but
      against Judaism. Netanyahu and Israel’s reading of the covenant of the Lord backing
      Israel is a radical misleading of the Jewish Bible. And, over the weekend, Senator
      Ted Cruz said he’s supporting Israel and wants to be Israel’s strongest supporter
      in Congress because the Bible tells him that God supports Israel and you have
      to support Israel if you support God. It’s all but saying that the secular Jews,
      the assimilationist Jews, the Jews who are not pro-war, are atheists. But this
      compact of the Lord, I want to say something about the compact of the Lord with
      Israel because I’ve written a number of books on this with the leading Hebrews
      in Israel, Baruch Levine, and by one of the leading Israeli Zionist professors
      from Yale. They’re part of my group, my Harvard group, on the history of economics
      from the Near East to ancient Israel. Most of the Bible is about a class war that
      occurred within the Jewish community. Most of the Bible is about what the Jewish
      prophets accused the Judaic ruling class of: abandoning social justice and letting
      its economy polarize between the rich and the poor. You have Isaiah, Amos, and
      the other prophets denouncing them for monopolizing the land and putting house
      to house and plot to plot together until there’s no room for the population in
      the land. This led to Israel and the 10 tribes of Israel withdrawing from the
      house of David, saying, “What has it done for us?” There’s been an oppressive
      class. While the covenant with the Lord in the Bible was all about [how] the Lord
      will support the Israelis as long as their religion is one of social justice and
      even treating the alien decently, that’s not how it worked out, with the wealthy
      classes essentially enslaving and appropriating the land of the poor. You had
      the prophets, Isaiah and others, saying, first of all, the Lord was displeased
      with Israel, Judaism, and let it be conquered by Assyria as punishment for violating
      the compact with the Lord to promote social justice and free the population. Once
      again, after the war, the Jewish ruling class continued to polarize the economy.
      So Isaiah said, we’ve lost to Babylonia because the Lord is not supporting us
      if we don’t support the poor. If we don’t support the covenant as spelled out
      in the book of Leviticus, especially chapter 25, the Jubilee year, if we don’t
      cancel the debts and return the land to the population and liberate the dead bondservants,
      we’re going to be defeated again and again because the Lord will not support us
      if we do that. Well, today, Israel is one of the most economically unequal economies
      in the world. There’s a very wealthy ruling class there, but most of the Israelis
      are not so wealthy. And it’s very hard to find social justice or mutual aid or
      protection and tolerance of aliens, as the indigenous Palestinians are called.
      Very hard to find that. And you could say that if the Bible says anything, it
      says that Israel will be punished for its behavior against this. This is the exact
      opposite of what Netanyahu says. So the fact is that the Zionists and the Likud
      party have a travesty of what the Bible is all about. A travesty about [what]
      Judaism is all about, and also a travesty about how Jesus emerged from this class
      war within Judea and gave his first speech before the synagogue, unrolling the
      tablet of Isaiah and announcing that his mission was to restore the Jubilee Year
      and lead to a debt cancellation. We now know there was a very large movement in
      Israel, not only Jesus’ followers, but it was a majority of the popular movement
      against it. It was defeated by the Jewish rabbinical class led by the rabbis.
      You had the same kind of class war that ended up with Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount
      and the Lord’s Prayer: Forgive them their debts as we forgive our debtors. So,
      the majority of American Jews have played such an important role intellectually
      and politically and financially because they believe in universal equality. They
      believed they were fighting against any kind of ethnicity and total war, obviously
      because they had been the victims of all of this. They were against any kind of
      racism or economic inequality because that was why they’d immigrated to America
      to begin with, just as so many Protestants from France and England, the Huguenots
      and others had come here. This attempt to characterize any socialist, any advocate
      of social justice and of world peace, as being anti-Semitic should be exposed
      as the travesty that it is. RICHARD WOLFF: I want to get yet another dimension
      of all of this on the table so that we’ve talked about it and your audience can
      think about whatever it finds reasonable in it. Mr. Trump became an oddity, a
      Republican candidate who was very strong for peace. He came very close to what
      Michael was just talking about. He promised that he would end the war in Ukraine.
      I believe he said, either I’ll end it in a week or I’ll end it in a day. One of
      his typical exaggerations. I’m being polite. He said much the same about Israel
      in Gaza. He seemed to recognize that by far the most destructive war at the time
      that he was running for president was the war in Gaza. In other words, the Israelis
      were killing people, at a rate on a daily basis, far exceeding what Russia and
      Ukraine did to each other. So, if anything, he was giving us to understand that
      he understood that difference and he would bring wars to an end. Remember, “I’m
      going to end the forever wars in the Middle East, etc.” He has not done that.
      He has given us a theater of doing it: on again, off again. He will not stay with
      Zelensky in Ukraine. He will. He’s now going to meet him. He isn’t going to meet.
      Unbelievable. But one thing we know: the war is not over. And even if he withdraws,
      he is encouraging the Europeans to keep this war going, which they seem concerned
      to do, because they live in the same theatrical universe that we do in this country.
      They have leaders who are in a fight against Russia, but the mass of those people
      do not feel part of, do not want the war in Ukraine, and will not participate
      in it. Meanwhile, the leaders keep doing what they’re doing because they’re engaged
      in a theater. They are making a theater of the evil intentions of Russia, for
      which there is no evidence and no foundation. What did he do about the war in
      Gaza? Nothing. He sat by, like Mr. Biden, and allowed Netanyahu to continue to
      use American money and American weapons to pursue what was the most horrible of
      the existing wars. But he has gone further. He’s now attacked Iran, with whom
      there was no war before. He gets the full credit for starting a third war in that
      part of the world. He didn’t stop the other two. He made it. Now we have a ceasefire.
      Both sides will now be reorganizing themselves because it would be folly for either
      Israel to assume Iran won’t bomb it, or vice versa. So we’re sitting on top of
      more theater, but now, the biggest theater of all, which can’t be spoken. If it
      was true that Mr. Trump believed that there might be nuclear enriched uranium,
      enriched enough to be weapon-ready in those three sites in Iran, and he dropped
      the biggest bombs we have on them, what could have happened is that the bombs
      blew up the nuclear material, in which case we would have had what? Another Chernobyl.
      If we believe him, the risk he took ought to throw him out of office. He risked
      a nuclear catastrophe, which he didn’t have to. Iran wasn’t doing anything to
      the United States at the time. Maybe he knew there was nothing there like that,
      that he could defend himself. But if he did, we would get more evidence that it’s
      all theater. As we are getting hints now that the Iranians knew to move their
      stuff out of those sites, just like the Iranians told the Americans before they
      hit the base in Qatar that they should leave there, which they did. We’re at a
      point which was prefigured by a film made by Dustin Hoffman many years ago called
      Wag the Dog. And his point was: a war was simulated. I don’t know if you’ve seen
      the film, but if not, see it. A war is simulated by Hollywood to achieve the political
      and other objectives of the people who pay for the theater. That’s where we are.
      That’s why Mamdani won. There is a reaction going beyond the details of Israel
      or Judaism or any of this. It’s the honest expression of a population that knows
      it’s being ripped off economically, politically, ideologically. Whoever can emerge
      from this bad time with some genuine honesty attached to him or her will do very,
      very well. Right now, to my fellow left-of-center Americans, Bernie has that,
      and AOC has that, and now Mamdani has that, from which certain lessons should
      be drawn for all of you in terms of thinking about what strategies you should
      pursue to try to take advantage of this situation. Mr. Trump is the president
      because he figured out that nobody had any sympathy, not in the Republican Party
      and not in the Democratic Party, for the victims of 40 years of neoliberal globalization:
      white, male, Christian factory-working union members. They were the forgotten.
      They were the unimportant. And he addressed them. “I’m yours.” And he was brilliant.
      He focused them not on the corporate executives, whose decisions to move production
      to China, to automate and to bring in immigrants – they were exempt. He knew whom
      he had to please. He knew who he was. So he came up with the solution. It’s those
      horrible Democrats who have been favoring black, brown, and female people at your
      expense. That’s why you’re screwed. That’s why you have no job, no future. Instead
      of being a union machinist, you’re a greeter at Walmart. So turn your anger, turn
      your bitterness against black people, brown people, women, all the DEI beneficiaries.
      They’re your enemy. Classic. “Vote for me. I’ll fix it.” What does he fix? Nothing.
      What does he solve? Nothing. We got more war in the Middle East than when he came.
      But he knew that he could cash in. I’m telling us, learn the lesson. Mandani,
      AOC, Bernie, they have taught us something. The system has destroyed the basis
      of its own mass support. We have to act if we’re going to become the inheritors
      of the reaction against where this country has landed. MICHAEL HUDSON: I think
      what Richard has described so wonderfully as the theater of “how do you frame
      the issue?” and “how do you frame the issue in a way that avoids talking about
      what it’s really all about for wage earners in the economy.” This is the theater
      of deception. You can say that the United Nations – and Nima, your guests have
      pointed out how the International Atomic Energy Authority has been a theater of
      deception, pretending to make the world safe from economic, from nuclear war.
      Well, [IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano] Grossi, according to the Iranian
      documentation, simply acted as spies for the CIA and for Israel to turn over to
      Israel the names of the atomic scientists for assassination, and to locate where
      we’ve inspected the actual places where uranium is stored, for the Americans and
      Israelis to bomb and the Israelis to drop American bombs on. This whole framing
      of deception is sort of broken away by an intuitive sense of American voters,
      and I bet voters all over the world, to realize that this is all deception. The
      dominant politics of almost every country have become based on framing the issue
      in a way to distract attention from what most voters care about: the economy and
      the way that society is structured. What is this really all about? It’s what kind
      of an economic system, what kind of a political system are we going to have? There’s
      the perception now, the reality that the political system of both parties here
      is corrupted, just as the European political parties are corrupted in supporting
      NATO and the war in Russia against the votes of their own population, against
      the NATO war, against all of the polling of the voters. You have, from America
      to Europe, politics versus the voters. This is not democratic. This is the antithesis
      of democracy. That’s what’s at issue. RICHARD WOLFF: I want to pick up on the
      question of Europe that Michael just raised. The theater there is so obvious that
      I think Europeans can be expected to give us events like Mamdani in New York soon.
      Here’s the theater: with the United States, Ukraine is defeated by Russia. We’ve
      been watching that for three years, and that’s not going to change. Without the
      United States fully engaged, the Europeans have even less chance. So, why the
      demonization of Russia? What in the world is going on? The answer: Russia no longer
      needs Europe to sell its oil and gas. It can sell oil and gas to India and China
      forever and do very well in the process, as well as cementing a political alliance:
      the BRICS, which is crucial for all of them. So, what is the European plan? You
      hype the Russian danger. Why? So that you can shift governmental spending from
      social benefits to militarism. What we’re watching is a classic program of military
      Keynesianism. The government is going to come in. Look at [Chancellor Friedrich]
      Merz in Germany, an $80 billion a year rearmament for what? You’re going to fight
      Russia? You’re going to lose again. The Europeans, there’s no stomach for it.
      There’s not enough money for it. And whatever they could do, let me remind you:
      $80 billion is the German allocation. The United States in one year allocates
      10 times that amount of money. They’re not going to threaten or endanger the United
      States, and they’re not going to do that with Russia or China either. It’s way
      too late, but they don’t care, because that’s not the point. The point is, with
      higher energy costs, because these idiots sanctioned Russia and wouldn’t buy its
      oil and gas. So now they have to pay too much. They’re deindustrializing. Their
      companies are leaving, moving around Europe, moving to the United States, going
      anywhere. They have to stop that. Otherwise, they literally become a tourist attraction
      and a little more. So now they’ve found the way. They’re going to subsidize industry
      at home by an enormous military Keynesianism. And to cover that, to make that
      fly politically, they put on the theater of evil Russia that endangers all of
      us from right underneath our beds at night. Otherwise, the absurdity of the Russia
      bashing would have to be explained. Russia isn’t the reason for it. Russia’s job
      is to be the player, the symbol in the theater for what is necessary. That’s what
      I mean. These are theatrics designed to cover in some acceptable idiom a project
      that they dare not honestly present. We have a political system of theater which
      has now run out of tolerability. Even large parts of Europe don’t believe their
      own leaders. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Exactly. Thank you so much, Richard and Michael,
      for being with us today. Great pleasure, as always. RICHARD WOLFF: Thank you.

    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion about the ongoing conflict in the Middle East,
      Michael Hudson predicts that the recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel is temporary
      and that hostilities will resume, particularly influenced by U.S. involvement
      and upcoming elections.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent dialogue, Nima Alkhorchid, Michael Hudson, and Richard
      Wolff discussed the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, particularly the tensions
      between Iran and Israel, which have escalated to U.S. involvement. Hudson noted
      that while a temporary ceasefire allows both sides to regroup, the underlying
      hostilities are likely to persist, especially with the upcoming elections influencing
      political dynamics. He highlighted a disconnect between the American electorate,
      which largely opposes the war and military spending, and the leadership of both
      major political parties, which continues to support military actions. This situation
      reflects a growing frustration among voters, as evidenced by recent electoral
      outcomes, indicating a potential shift in political attitudes regarding war and
      peace in the U.S.

    text: 'War on Iran is part of the US empire’s larger attempt to re-impose its unipolar
      dominance on the global political and financial system, argues economist Michael
      Hudson. Washington wants to preserve dollar hegemony and the petrodollar, while
      disrupting BRICS and Eurasian integration with China and Russia. Hudson explained
      this in the following interview with Geopolitical Economy Report editor Ben Norton.
      You can read Michael Hudson’s article here: War on Iran is fight for US unipolar
      control of world . Introduction BEN NORTON: Why is the United States so concerned
      about Iran? US President Donald Trump admitted that what Washington wants is regime
      change in Tehran, to overthrow the Iranian government. Trump backed a war on Iran
      in June, in which both the US and Israel directly bombed Iranian territory. Trump
      claimed that he brokered a ceasefire after what he calls the 12 Day War that the
      US and Israel waged against Iran. But it’s very difficult to believe that this
      ceasefire will hold. Especially considering that Trump said the same in January.
      He claimed to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, but then in March, two months later,
      Israel started the war again, after Trump had given Israel the green light to
      violate the ceasefire that he helped to broker. So it’s very difficult for Iranian
      officials to believe that the ceasefire will truly hold. And even if it does hold
      in the short term, the reality is that the US government has been waging a kind
      of political war and an economic war against Iran for many decades, going back
      to 1953, when the US carried out a coup that overthrew Iran’s democratically elected
      Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and installed a pro-US dictator, Shah Mohammad
      Reza Pahlavi. Iran’s dictator, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, with US President Richard
      Nixon in the White House in 1973 So why is this? What does Washington want to
      get out of its never-ending political and economic war on Iran? To try to answer
      this question, I interviewed the renowned economist Michael Hudson, who has written
      many books and is an expert on global political economy. Michael Hudson published
      an article in which he outlines the economic and political reasons for this war
      on Iran, and he posits that this is part of the attempt by the US empire to impose
      a unipolar order on the world, like we saw in the 1990s, when the US was the only
      superpower and it could impose its political and economic will on almost all countries
      on Earth. Iran was one of the very few countries that was actually resisting US
      unipolar hegemony. And today we see, as the world is more and more multipolar,
      Iran plays an important role as a BRICS member, and as a supporter of resistance
      groups. Iran is pushing for a more multipolar world, in opposition to the US empire’s
      unipolarity, as the economist Michael Hudson describes in this essay. Hudson wrote:
      What is at stake is the US attempt to control the Middle East and its oil as a
      buttress of US economic power, and to prevent other countries from moving to create
      their own autonomy from the US-centered neoliberal order administered by the IMF,
      World Bank, and other institutions to reinforce US unipolar power. In our discussion
      today, Michael connects all of the different factors involved in this conflict,
      including the oil and gas and other resources in West Asia (in the so-called Middle
      East); including the role of the US dollar and the petrodollar system; and how
      Iran, as a member of BRICS, and many other Global South countries, are de-dollarizing
      and seeking alternatives to the dollar. We also talk about the geopolitics of
      the region, the trade routes and interconnectivity among China, Iran, and Russia,
      as part of a project of Eurasian integration; we talk about the geopolitical goals
      of the US and Israel; and much, much more. Here is an excerpt of our conversation,
      and then we’ll go straight to the interview: MICHAEL HUDSON: What we have seen
      in the last month — or I should say the last two years actually — is the culmination
      of the long strategy that America has had ever since World War II, to take complete
      control of the Near Eastern oil lands and make them proxies of the United States,
      under client rulers, such as Saudi Arabia and the king of Jordan. Iran represents
      a military threat to Russia’s southern border, because if the United States could
      put a client regime in Iran, or break up Iran into ethnic groups who would be
      able to interfere with Russia’s corridor of trade southwards, into access to the
      Indian Ocean, well, then you have boxed in Russia, you have boxed in China, and
      you have managed to isolate them. That is the current American foreign policy.
      If you can isolate countries that do not want to be part of the American international
      financial and trade system, then the belief is that they cannot exist by themselves;
      they are too small. America is still living back in the epoch of the 1955 Bandung
      Conference of Non-Aligned nations in Indonesia. When other countries wanted to
      go alone, they were too economically small. The 1955 Bandung Conference But today,
      for the first time in modern history, you have the option of Eurasia, of Russia,
      China, Iran, and all of the neighboring countries in between. For the first time,
      they are large enough that they do not need trade and investment with the United
      States. In fact, while the United States and its NATO allies in Europe are shrinking
      — they are de-industrialized, neoliberal, post-industrial economies — most of
      the growth in world production, manufacturing, and trade has occurred in China,
      along with the control of the raw materials refining, such as rare earths, but
      also cobalt, even aluminum, and many other materials in China. So America’s strategic
      attempt to isolate Russia, China, and any of their allies in BRICS or the Shanghai
      Cooperation Organization ends up isolating itself. It is forcing other countries
      to make a choice. That is the only thing that America has to offer other countries
      in today’s world. It can’t offer them exports. It can’t offer them monetary stability.
      The only thing that America has to offer the world is to refrain from destroying
      their economy and causing economic chaos, such as Trump has threatened to do with
      his tariffs, and what he has threatened to do to any country trying to create
      an alternative to the dollar. Hence this free lunch, where other countries can
      earn dollars, but they have to re-lend them to the United States. And the United
      States, as their banker, has to hold it all, and the banker may just decide whom
      to pay and whom not to pay. It’s a gangster. It has been called a gangster state,
      for just such reasons. And other countries are afraid of what the United States
      can do, not only under Donald Trump, but what it has been doing for the last 50
      years. It is simply confiscating, and destabilizing, and overthrowing. America
      has basically declared war against any attempt to create an international trade
      and investment system that the United States does not control, in its own self-interest,
      wanting all of the earnings from it, all of the revenue from it, not just part
      of it. It’s a greedy empire. Interview BEN NORTON: Michael, thanks for joining
      me. It’s always a real pleasure having you. Let’s talk about this article you
      wrote, in which you argue that the war on Iran is part of an attempt by the United
      States to impose its unipolar hegemony on the world. We see that we’re living
      in more and more of a multipolar world, and Iran has played an important part
      of the multipolar project as a member of BRICS, as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation
      Organization, as a partner of China and Russia. Iran has also been pushing for
      de-dollarization of the global financial system. Talk about how you see the war
      on Iran — which didn’t start under Donald Trump, this goes back many years — and
      how you see it in particular as an economist. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the war on
      Iran started in 1953, when the United States and MI6 overthrew the elected Prime
      Minister [Mohammad Mosaddegh], and the reason he was overthrown was because he
      wanted to nationalize the oil reserves of Iran. The United States has always viewed
      Iran as part of the Near Eastern oil Gulf. American foreign policy, in terms of
      weaponizing its foreign trade, has always been based on two commodities: food
      grains — the ability to stop exporting food to countries that oppose US policy,
      as the United States stopped exporting grain to China under Mao — and oil. For
      a century, the United States has focused on control of the oil as the basis of
      its international trade balance — it’s the largest contributor to the trade balance
      — and of its ability to sanction the rest of the world, by turning off the oil
      supply, and thereby turning off the electricity, turning off the gas, turning
      off the home heating, of countries that break away from US policy. When I worked
      for the Hudson Institute in the early 1970s, Herman Kahn brought me to a meeting
      with some generals, and they were discussing what to do with Iran in case, under
      the shah, Iran should ever once again try to assert its autonomy and go its own
      way. Iran has always been the strongest power in the entire Near East, and the
      capstone to controlling the Near East. You cannot fully control the Near Eastern
      oil — Syria, Iraq, the rest of the countries there — without controlling Iran
      too, because of the size of its population and the strength of its economy. Herman
      Kahn It was a very interesting meeting. Herman Kahn, the model for Dr. Strangelove,
      discussed how to break up Iran into its various ethnicities, five or six ethnicities,
      in the case that it should, take a policy independent from the United States.
      The United States’ concern already in the 1970s, 50 years ago, was, “What do we
      do if other countries do not follow the kind of international world order that
      we are, organizing?” Herman said that he thought the crisis point that was going
      to break up in international news was going to be Balochistan, at Iran’s border
      with Pakistan. The Balochis are a distinct population, just as the Azerbaijanis,
      Azeris, the Kurds. Iran is a composite of many ethnic groups, including a very
      large Jewish group there. It is a multi-ethnic society, and the United States’
      strategy, in case there was a war against Iran, was to play on these ethnicities
      — just as similar plans were drawn up for Russia, how to break it into separate
      ethnic parts; and China, how to break China into ethnic parts, at such point as
      America wants to take them on. And the reason this ethnic division was developed
      was, as a democracy, especially in the 1970s, it became very apparent that the
      United States never again could field an army for invasion, as it was doing in
      Vietnam. At the time I sat in on this meeting, late 1974 I think, or early ’75,
      there were demonstrations. It was obvious that there could never be a military
      draft again. How was the United States to exert its international power without
      military power? It had military bases all over the world; it spent more on military
      than any other country. The entire US balance of payments deficit was military
      spending abroad, and yet it couldn’t go to war. It had to use proxies. This was
      the time when, in addition to the discussions that I sat in on how to use ethnicities
      in countries that we declared war on, as opponents; America decided to create
      the largest military base in the Near East, and that was Israel. Henry Jackson,
      the pro-war, Military-Industrial Complex’s senator, met with Herman Kahn — I actually
      was in Herman’s office, listening to the phone call, when it came through — and
      the agreement was that the Military-Industrial Complex and Jackson would back
      Israel, if Israel agreed to act as America’s landed aircraft carrier in the Near
      East, as it was put at the time. Herman very gladly made that arrangement, because
      the Hudson Institute at that time was a Zionist organization, and it was a training
      ground for Mossad. One of my colleagues was Uzi Arad. We made a number of trips
      together to Asia. And Uzi became Netanyahu’s advisor and head of Mossad in subsequent
      years. So I sort of sat in at the time when the American strategy was being outlined.
      Israel was going to be America’s face, and indeed has been coordinating America’s
      backing of Al-Qaeda and the Wahhabi butchers who have taken over Syria, and are
      now busy killing the Christians, killing the Shiites, killing the Alawites. And
      you will never see any criticism of Israel by Al-Qaeda, or the group [Hayat Tahrir
      al-Sham (HTS)] in Syria, whatever you want to call it there now. And vice versa,
      there has always been a working relationship. So this gives some background as
      to how long the United States has anticipated the day when it would try to finally
      capstone its invasion of Iraq, its attack on Syria, its destruction of Libya,
      its backing of the destruction of Lebanon, and other countries, in North Africa,
      etc. What we have seen in the last month — or I should say the last two years
      actually — is the culmination of the long strategy that America has had ever since
      World War II, to take complete control of the Near Eastern oil lands and make
      them proxies of the United States, under client rulers, such as Saudi Arabia and
      the king of Jordan. Geopolitics and global trade BEN NORTON: You raised so many
      interesting points, Michael. I want focus on two main issues here: one is the
      geopolitics of Iran’s integration with Eurasia, and the other is oil and the petrodollar
      system. I will start with the geopolitics. Of course, when we talk about the petrodollar,
      we should keep in mind that Iran has been selling its oil and gas in other currencies,
      and pushing for de-dollarization. But before we get to that, I want to talk about
      the role that Iran has played not only in supporting resistance groups in West
      Asia, but also in deepening its political and economic partnership with China
      and Russia, as part of a larger Eurasian partnership. There are numerous physical
      projects integrating these regions. Iran is at the heart of China’s New Silk Road.
      This was originally launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, and then
      it expanded into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Iran is an important part
      in that, connecting East Asia, through Central Asia, through Iran, into West Asia.
      And the US has really tried to disrupt that. Iran also plays an important role
      in a Russian-led economic corridor that connects from St. Petersburg, through
      Moscow, down through the Caspian Sea, through Iran, and to India. This is known
      as the International North-South Transport Corridor, the INSTC. So we have seen
      that Iran has played a very important role challenging the US dollar, challenging
      US hegemony, and also seeking economic and political integration with other countries
      in Eurasia. Can you speak more about this and why these imperial planners in Washington
      see this as so much of a threat? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you just summarized the
      two maps that I included in my article. About a month ago, Iran just completed
      its Belt and Road railroad, that goes all the way to Tehran. For the first time,
      there is a land corridor from Iran to China. Now, the Belt and Road corridor means
      they’re avoiding going by sea. American and British military policy has been based
      for a hundred years on control of the seas, and control of the oil trade was part
      of that strategy. Because if Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other oil-producing
      countries can’t load up tankers with oil, how are they going to be able to export?
      And how can importers such as China, or India, obtain oil from the Near East?
      Well, with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, its intention was to go all the way
      through, via Iran, and then proceed on all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, to Europe.
      This Belt and Road was to span the entire Eurasian continent, the entire eastern
      hemisphere. And if the United States could conquer Iran and take it over, that
      would interfere with China’s long-distance railroad development, and it would
      block it — just as the United States is hoping to goad India and Pakistan into
      some kind of fight that would interrupt China’s Belt and Road Initiative that
      goes through through Pakistan [the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)]. So,
      on the one hand, Iran is the key to China’s overland transportation to Europe.
      And as you just pointed out, with Russia: Iran represents a military threat to
      Russia’s southern border, because if the United States could put a client regime
      in Iran, or break up Iran into ethnic groups who would be able to interfere with
      Russia’s corridor of trade southwards, into access to the Indian Ocean, well,
      then you have boxed in Russia, you have boxed in China, and you have managed to
      isolate them. That is the current American foreign policy. If you can isolate
      countries that do not want to be part of the American international financial
      and trade system, then the belief is that they cannot exist by themselves; they
      are too small. America is still living back in the epoch of the 1955 Bandung Conference,
      of Non-Aligned nations, in Indonesia. When other countries wanted to go alone,
      they were too economically small. The 1955 Bandung Conference But today, for the
      first time in modern history, you have the option of Eurasia, of Russia, China,
      Iran, and all of the neighboring countries in between. For the first time, they
      are large enough that they do not need trade and investment with the United States.
      In fact, while the United States and its NATO allies in Europe are shrinking —
      they are de-industrialized, neoliberal, post-industrial economies — most of the
      growth in world production, manufacturing, and trade has occurred in China, along
      with the control of the raw materials refining, such as rare earths, but also
      cobalt, even aluminum, and many other materials in China. So America’s strategic
      attempt to isolate Russia, China, and any of their allies in BRICS or the Shanghai
      Cooperation Organization ends up isolating itself. It is forcing other countries
      to make a choice. This was made very clear immediately upon Trump taking the presidency
      and announcing his tariff policy, saying, “In three months, I’m going to impose
      such devastatingly high tariffs that you, the Global South countries, the Global
      Majority countries, your economies will be in chaos without having access to the
      American market”. But, [Trump said], “We have three months to negotiate, and,
      if you give us a give-back, I will roll back these tariffs to 10%, so that it
      won’t devastate your economies. And one of the agreements that you have to make
      is you’ll agree to America’s sanctions not to trade with China, not to invest
      in China, not to use alternatives to the US dollar”. China is trying to avoid
      using dollars, just as Russia no longer is able to use dollars, because the United
      States has simply confiscated $300 billion of Russia’s foreign exchange holdings
      in the West, that it held in Brussels, in order to manage its foreign exchange,
      to stabilize its exchange rate, which is what central banks do throughout the
      world. Well, it’s very interesting. The Financial Times had a front page article
      [reporting] that now European countries, especially Germany and Italy, which have
      the second- and third-largest gold holdings, have asked, “Could you please [give
      us our gold back]? We have, since World War II, we have left all of our gold supplies
      at the Federal Reserve in New York”. America’s gold is in Fort Knox, but other
      countries keep their gold reserves in the basement of the Federal Reserve Bank,
      right across from Chase Manhattan bank in the downtown area. And other countries
      now realize that, under Trump, if he says, “Well, Europe has been really taking
      advantage of us; they have been exporting more to us than we’ve sold to them”
      — you know, Italy and Germany are worried that somehow America will say, “Well,
      we’re just gonna grab all of this gold that you’ve built up by taking advantage
      of us”. So you’re having the rest of the world pull back from the dollar. This
      reflects the effect of everything that the United States is trying to do to isolate
      the other parts of the world from contact with the United States, if they try
      to have an alternative economic system to neoliberal finance capitalism, if they
      try to have industrial socialism — which is really industrial capitalism on the
      way to being industrial socialism, with active government investment in basic
      infrastructure, instead of privatizing the infrastructure Margaret Thatcher style.
      The effect will be to leave the United States isolated, and all the rest of the
      world going its own way, unable to trade with the United States because of the
      high tariffs that Trump has imposed, and afraid to trade in dollars because of
      the predatory weaponization of the dollar standard, which had been America’s free
      lunch under the whole epoch of US Treasury bill standard, since America went off
      gold in 1971. Oil and the petrodollar BEN NORTON: Again, Michael, you raised so
      many good points there. I want to stick with this issue of oil and the US dollar,
      and the petrodollar system. Now, you have mentioned a few times that the US really
      relies on exports of oil and control of the oil trade, partially to try to reduce
      its enormous current account deficit — which, I mean, it still is not very successful.
      The US runs massive current account deficits — that is, trade deficits with the
      rest of the world. But what is something that is different in the 2020s is that
      the US is now the world’s largest exporter of oil. It’s the largest producer of
      oil on Earth, and the largest producer of gas. So that’s a significant difference.
      That’s largely a development in the past decade due to the explosion in fracking
      in the US, and also the shale oil revolution. So, it’s not necessarily that the
      US needs to physically get access to all of the oil in the region. Although, of
      course, US fossil fuel corporations would love to privatize all of the oil in
      West Asia, that is state-owned. So for instance, we talked about Mohammad Mosaddegh,
      the prime minister of Iran who was overthrown in the 1953 CIA-backed coup, after
      he nationalized the oil in Iran and kicked out US and British oil companies. Well,
      the current Iranian government, following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, also
      nationalized the oil, and the Iranian state does actually have a lot of influence
      in the economy, including through state-owned enterprises. So, of course the US
      would love to privatize that. But this is not really necessarily about getting
      access to all that oil. This is about maintaining the current financial order,
      which is really backed by oil, especially after Richard Nixon in 1971 took the
      dollar off of gold. Then, in 1974, Nixon sent his treasury secretary, William
      Simon — Bill Simon, from Salomon Brothers — who was a bond expert. He ran the
      Treasuries desk, trading US government debt at Salomon Brothers, this major Wall
      Street investment bank. He was sent to Jeddah in 1974, where they brokered a deal
      saying that the US would protect the Saudi monarchy, and, in return, Saudi Arabia
      would sell all of its oil in dollars, maintaining global demand for the US dollar.
      This came one year after the OPEC oil embargo, in which the countries in the Global
      South showed that they could use their control of oil as a geopolitical tool to
      punish the US and the West for their support of Israel. So I mean, all this history
      is still so relevant today. Now, Iran is directly challenging that petrodollar
      system. Iran is selling its oil to China in Chinese yuan, the renminbi. Iran is
      also trading with India, selling its oil, and it is using its currency, the rial.
      India is also using its currency, the rupee, and India is essentially trading
      its agricultural goods for Iranian oil. So can you talk about this petrodollar
      system, and why Iran is seen as such a major challenge to this system? And really
      what that means is a direct challenge to the global dominance of the US dollar
      itself. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I mentioned that the original drive of the United
      States was to control Near Eastern oil. I was the balance of payments economist
      for Chase Manhattan Bank, and I did a whole study on behalf of the US oil industry
      to calculate the balance of payments returns, and the average dollar spent by
      the Seven Sisters, the big oil companies. The average dollar invested in Saudi
      Arabia, Kuwait, other Arab countries, was recovered in only 18 months. Oil was
      the most profitable investment in the entire US economy, and it was tax free.
      Now, the original plan, as I mentioned, of the US in the Near East, it viewed
      as having oil. Then came the oil war — and it was more than an oil war — in 1974,
      after Israel waged the 1973 war, and after the United States quadrupled its grain
      prices. Well, you mentioned [Nixon’s Treasury Secretary] Bill Simon. Herman Kahn
      and I went to meet with Bill Simon in 1974, to discuss what should America’s strategy
      be with the oil companies. Simon said, “We’ve explained to them that, they can
      charge whatever they want for oil. They can quadruple the prices”. In fact, that
      made Standard Oil of New Jersey, Socony [later Mobil], and the other American
      oil companies very happy, because, as you point out, America was itself a huge
      oil producer. When the OPEC countries quadrupled the price of oil, that made the
      American oil companies immensely profitable on their and Canada’s oil production.
      So, Bill Simon told me that he had explained to them that they could charge whatever
      they wanted for the oil; quadrupling was okay. But the agreement was they had
      to keep all of their savings from what they made off this oil — I won’t call it
      profit, because it’s really natural resource rent — they had to keep their rents
      in the United States economy. The deal was that Saudi Arabia and other countries
      would export their oil for dollars; they would not remove these dollars from the
      United States. They would leave the dollars that they were paid by European countries,
      by other countries buying their oil; they would invest it primarily in US Treasury
      securities, and they could also buy US stocks and bonds. But they could not do
      what America did with its foreign exchange of European currency, for instance.
      The OPEC countries could not buy control of any major American company. They could
      buy stocks and bonds, but they had to spread the investment in the stock market
      over the market as a whole. So I think the king of Saudi Arabia bought a billion
      dollars of every stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, to spread it all out.
      But most of their money was kept safely in US Treasury securities. So, essentially,
      the OPEC revenue — I won’t say earnings because, again, it wasn’t really earned;
      it’s unearned income — OPEC revenue from the oil sales all ended up in the United
      States, most of it lent to the United States government. Well, that inflow of
      dollars is what enabled the United States to do two things. One, as a balance
      of payments inflow, it enabled the United States to continue spending its military
      overseas spending abroad, in order to have the military fist behind its economic
      empire. But it also funded the domestic budget deficit. Foreign central banks
      were largely funding America’s own domestic budget deficit, by their holding of
      American Treasury bills. So the OPEC countries essentially became captive parts
      of the American financial system that I had described in my book Super Imperialism.
      So I met with the Treasury Treasury people, basically explaining what I had written
      about in Super Imperialism, about how ending other countries’ practice of holding
      their international monetary reserves in gold, but holding them in loans to the
      US Treasury in the form of buying Treasury bonds as the vehicle for their savings,
      essentially made the savings of the entire world, the monetary savings, all centralized
      in Washington and New York. That control of what began as control of the oil trade,
      to weaponize the trade in oil, became control of the international financial system
      with the dollar’s surpluses being thrown off by the oil trade. So you had that
      symbiosis between the trade system and the financial system as the basis for American
      military policy, and what I called super imperialism. Super imperialism BEN NORTON:
      Yeah, and what you described over 50 years ago, so brilliantly, as the system
      of super imperialism, what we’re seeing today is that Iran and other BRICS countries
      are challenging that system. They are challenging the exorbitant privilege of
      the US dollar and trying to seek alternatives. So maybe you can speak more about
      this global de-dollarization movement and how Iran plays a central role in this.
      And that is one of the reasons, of course, why it’s a target of the US. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, Iran really wasn’t central to it, because the United States has
      been able to isolate Iran. As soon as the shah was overthrown, the United States
      played a dirty trick on Iran — Chase Manhattan Bank did. Iran had a foreign debt
      — like every country has, by issuing foreign bonds — and it sent the dollars to
      the Chase Manhattan Bank, to pay the bond holders their dividends. The Treasury
      went to David Rockefeller and told him, “Don’t send this Iranian money along.
      Just hold it there”. And so Iran was considered to be in default, and the entire
      foreign debt came due, and America seized, confiscated, Iranian economic and financial
      resources in the United States. They later negotiated to give it back, because
      all of this was illegal under international law, but that has never stopped the
      United States, as we’re seeing right now. After the shah was overthrown, the United
      States said, “We’ve got to destabilize the the new Iranian government, and if
      we grab its foreign reserves, that will cripple it and cause chaos, and that’s
      how we run the world, by causing chaos”. That is the only thing that America has
      to offer other countries in today’s world. It can’t offer them exports. It can’t
      offer them monetary stability. The only thing that America has to offer the world
      is to refrain from destroying their economy and causing economic chaos, such as
      Trump has threatened to do with his tariffs, and what he has threatened to do
      to any country trying to create an alternative to the dollar. Hence this free
      lunch, where other countries can earn dollars, but they have to re-lend them to
      the United States. And the United States, as their banker, has to hold it all,
      and the banker may just decide whom to pay and whom not to pay. It’s a gangster.
      It has been called a gangster state, for just such reasons. And other countries
      are afraid of what the United States can do, not only under Donald Trump, but
      what it has been doing for the last 50 years. It is simply confiscating, and destabilizing,
      and overthrowing. America has basically declared war against any attempt to create
      an international trade and investment system that the United States does not control,
      in its own self-interest, wanting all of the earnings from it, all of the revenue
      from it, not just part of it. It’s a greedy empire. Sanctions and economic warfare
      BEN NORTON: Yeah, and what you’re getting at, Michael, is such an important point,
      because essentially what this shows is that these tactics that the US has abused
      more and more frequently in the past few decades are not entirely new. Today,
      one-third of all countries on Earth are under US sanctions, which are unilateral;
      they are illegal under international law. But of course, Iran was one of the first
      countries to be sanctioned, after its revolution in 1979. And we know that in
      2022, the US and the EU seized $300 billion dollars and euros worth of Russian
      assets, and that was a huge wake-up call to the world. But, actually, Iran was
      the kind of first test case. It was the US that seized Iran’s assets first, and
      then they later seized Venezuela’s assets, and then Afghanistan’s assets, and
      now Russia. So Iran was always the first country to be targeted by these aggressive
      tactics, and now they have become so commonplace that we have seen a kind of global
      rebellion against this system, even by longtime US allies. Like for instance Saudi
      Arabia and the UAE, which historically have been US client states, but they see
      what has happened to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, and they’re worried that they
      could be next. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, this is exactly what is shaping Saudi Arabian
      and Arab policy in the region. Obviously, the Arabs don’t like what Israel is
      doing in Gaza.They don’t like the ethnic cleansing, and the ethnic cleansing of
      the West Bank, and the whole attack on the Palestinians and other Arab populations.
      But they’re afraid of acting on behalf of Iran.They may be very sympathetic with
      it. The populations of these countries are very much against the violence that
      Israel is waging against the Arab states, but the leaders of these countries have
      a problem: All of the savings that Saudi Arabia has accumulated for the last 50
      years are held as hostage in the US Treasury and in the US banks. And the US banks,
      essentially, are arms of the Treasury. Most of all, Chase Manhattan was a designated
      bank that would act on behalf of the Treasury. Citibank was more independent,
      of that. So you have not heard a peep out of Saudi Arabia and its neighboring
      oil-producing countries, because they’re afraid. They realize that they’re in
      a very delicate position. All of this money that their sovereign wealth fund that
      they have built up to finance their own future development — if you can call what
      they’re doing, it’s a twisted development — but their plans for the future are
      held hostage, and they’ve been politically neutralized, because of this exposure
      to the US dollar. Well, you can imagine that other countries realize what is happening,
      and Asian countries, the Global South countries, and even European countries like
      Germany and Italy, say, “We don’t want to be stuck in the same trap that the Arab
      countries are stuck in, where not only our savings, and Treasury securities, and
      US stocks and bonds, and our investments in the United States are held hostage;
      our gold supply is being held there!” And the whole world is now moving toward
      gold.They’re afraid to hold dollars. Dollar holdings by foreign central banks
      have been at just stable, while the gold holdings have been going up. And many
      foreign official gold holdings are held off the books. The government will hold
      stock in a company that holds gold. You can conceal what they’re doing, so they
      won’t very conspicuously being shown to be dumping the dollar. There’s a kind
      of Kabuki dance going on in financial statistics, as well as in dropping bombs
      on countries. The Military-Industrial Complex BEN NORTON: Michael, I want to talk
      about the military-industrial complex, because another point that you made in
      this article which is very important and is often left out is how US military
      contractors profit from these wars — like we saw in what they’re now calling the
      12-Day War, between the US/Israel and Iran. You pointed out that Iran was mostly
      using its older missiles. It was emptying its stockpile of old missiles to hit
      Israel, and trying to overwhelm Israel’s air defense system. Now, we know that
      US military contractors have boasted about the advanced military equipment the
      US has given to Israel, like the Iron Dome, the David’s Sling system, and the
      Arrow system. US corporations have benefited from helping to design these systems,
      and from providing the missiles and interceptors. So Israel has spent many millions
      of dollars trying to shoot down these old Iranian missiles that Iran wanted to
      get rid of anyway. If the war had continued, it would obviously have bled more
      and more resources of Israel and the US. But as you point out, this is actually
      something that the military-industrial complex in the US benefits from, because
      what the US calls the “aid” that it gives to many countries is actually not really
      aid; it’s actually contracts given to US private contractors, and then they give
      that military equipment to Israel, or to Egypt, or to Japan, South Korea, and
      other countries. So can you talk more about the role of the military-industrial
      complex, and how it has profited from all of this? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, this
      is the key to the debate in Congress that is now occurring over the Republican
      tax law. The enormous amount of money that is spent on the military-industrial
      complex that basically, the weapons it makes do not work. We’ve seen in Ukraine
      the inability of the NATO countries to defend against the Russian missiles. We’ve
      seen in Israel that the Iron Dome is very easily penetrated by Iran. And Iran,
      already several months ago, demonstrated this when it sent two sets of rockets.
      It warned Israel, “We don’t want to go to war. We don’t want to hurt anybody,
      but we just want to show you that we can bomb you whenever you want, and so we’re
      gonna drop a bomb on this particular location; get everybody out of there; we’re
      just gonna show you that it works. Try to shoot us down”. And they dropped it.
      They did the same with the United States, in Iraq, saying, “You know, we don’t
      want to really have to go to war with you in Iraq. We lost a million Iranians
      fighting the Iraqis, when you were setting Saddam Hussein against us before [in
      the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s], but you should know that we can wipe out your
      American bases whenever we want. Let’s give you a demonstration. Here’s a base
      that’s not very populated. We’re going to bomb it, so get everybody out; we don’t
      want anyone to get hurt. We’re gonna bomb you on such and such a date. Do everything
      you can to shoot us down”. Whoosh! They bombed it. America could not shoot them
      down. Well, the Iron Dome obviously doesn’t work, nor does the American military
      defense work. Well, President Trump has just come out and said, “We’re going to
      vastly increase the US budget deficit by creating an Iron Dome in the United States
      for $1 trillion”. Well, imagine spending a trillion dollars replicating the system
      that Iran and Russia show that they can penetrate right away. BEN NORTON: Michael,
      this is called the Golden Dome. And Elon Musk’s companies like SpaceX are poised
      to get massive US government contracts. It is estimated that hundreds of billions
      of dollars in total will be spent to make this Golden Dome that won’t even work.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Of course, for Trump, everything is gold, not iron — I should
      have noticed that — just like the doorknobs in his Trump Towers, of course. So
      we’re seeing this fantasy. What the military-industrial complex makes aren’t arms
      to actually be used in war. They’re arms to be traded or sold. And, as as you
      pointed out, in addition to the enormous amount of direct Congressional spending
      on buying arms for the US Army, Navy, and Marines, on the military, the United
      States gives foreign aid to South Korea, Japan, and other countries, and this
      foreign aid is spent by their own purchases of US military arms. This is not included
      in the American military budget, but in effect, it’s financing the military-industrial
      complex through the back door, by giving money to America’s allies to buy America’s
      arms, that also don’t work. Well, you must wonder what these allies are thinking
      now, especially in Europe, it’s almost embarrassing to see NATO refusing to acknowledge
      the fact that the American arms that it wants to buy, and the European arms that
      it has made, simply are not able to defend themselves against Russian and Iranian
      arms. American technology is backwards, because the military-industrial complex
      companies have taken all this enormous money that they’ve paid, their profits
      that they’ve made, by paying out dividends and buying their own stocks. They haven’t
      spent it on research and development. 92% of every dollar they’ve got is recycled
      into supporting their stock prices, not in actually making arms. So, by financializing
      its military system, along with the industrial economy as a whole, the United
      States has essentially de-industrialized itself, and you could almost say disarmed
      itself, against the rest of the world, that actually spends their military money
      on arms that work, arms that are intended to work, not simply to make profits,
      to increase the stock prices of military-industrial companies. BEN NORTON: Yeah,
      I think that’s actually a great note to end on. We could go on for another hour,
      but we should save that for another time. Michael, is there anything you would
      like to recommend for people who want to find more of your work? MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Well, I have my website, Michael-Hudson.com, and all of my articles are on the
      website, including the one that Ben has just mentioned. So you can see my ongoing
      commentary on all of this. And my book Super Imperialism explained the whole unfolding
      dynamic of all of this. BEN NORTON: As always, Michael, it’s a real pleasure.
      Thanks for joining us today, and we’ll talk again soon. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well,
      it was a timely discussion.Thanks for having me. Photo by Karsten Winegeart on

    one_sentence_summary: Economist Michael Hudson argues that the U.S. war on Iran
      is driven by a desire to maintain dollar dominance and disrupt global integration
      efforts led by BRICS and Eurasian powers like China and Russia, as discussed in
      his interview with Ben Norton.
    paragraph_summary: In an interview with Geopolitical Economy Report editor Ben Norton,
      economist Michael Hudson argues that the U.S. conflict with Iran is part of a
      broader strategy to maintain its unipolar dominance in the global political and
      financial landscape. Hudson asserts that Washington's primary goals include preserving
      the hegemony of the U.S. dollar and the petrodollar, while simultaneously undermining
      the integration efforts of BRICS nations and their partnerships with China and
      Russia. He highlights the historical context of U.S. interventions in Iran, including
      the 1953 coup that installed a pro-U.S. regime, and discusses the ongoing political
      and economic warfare against Iran, which has persisted for decades. Hudson's analysis
      suggests that the U.S. is motivated by a desire for regime change in Tehran and
      a strategic effort to disrupt Iran's influence in the region.

    text: 'GLENN DIESEN: Hi everyone and welcome. Today we are joined by Michael Hudson,
      Professor of Economy, to discuss the strategies for the American Empire. Now when
      we look at empire, we often tend to look at military capabilities and deployment
      but, as we know, empires also require an economic foundation. So to explore this,
      we’re gonna look into one of Professor Michael Hudson’s great books, which is
      Super Imperialism , the economic strategy of American Empire . So I will put a
      link to the book in the description. So please make sure to have a look and yeah
      welcome back to the program. MICHAEL HUDSON: Thanks for having me, Glenn. GLENN
      DIESEN: And yeah, after we address the, we’ll look at the economic strategy for
      the American Empire it would be interesting to get your take on how some of these
      economic foundations are, well, less stable now than they were when your first
      version of this book came out. But I thought a good place to start would be how
      you see the, well, what you name one of the sections of your book, the birth of
      the American World Order. What is the foundation for the economic strategy of
      the American Empire? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the Americans never attempted, apart
      from the War of 1898, they have not attempted military overt colonialism in the
      sense that Europe did. It has turned out to be financial colonialism and financial
      imperialism. And the actual attempt to create an empire as such wasn’t really
      implemented until 1944 and 1945, when World War II ended. But the roots of all
      of it were found at the end of World War I, when the settlement of World War I
      ended up imposing American demands for repayment of the war debts that the United
      States had lent to Britain, France, and other allies before the United States
      had entered the war. Well, when the war ended, the Europeans expected what would
      be normal practice and what was the practice after the Napoleonic Wars, for instance,
      that the Allies would forgive the debts to each other because this was all supposed
      to be part of the war effort, not only supplying armies, but supplying the funds
      and the money to buy the arms. But the United States said, well, we agree with
      you. Of course, we will not think of charging you for all the expenses of the
      war once we entered it on your side against Germany. But before we entered the
      war, that was something else. We were a neutral party, and we expect you to pay
      the war debts that you took on. A debt is a debt. Well, the Allies then turned
      on Germany and said, well, we don’t want to have to pay the debts to the United
      States. Quite frankly, we don’t have the money to pay the debts that the United
      States has calculated that we owed. We’ll make Germany pay reparations. And by
      1921-22, when all of this was set up, that essentially became the rule. So I have
      to say that Europe was somewhat complicit in this. All of the European countries,
      including Germany, believed that a debt was a debt. And if that was the official
      debt, if it was the reparations imposed on Germany to pay for the war by the Allies
      against it, it was clearly beyond its ability. All of the parties in Germany,
      even the Social Democrats and the anti-war parties, agreed that the debts had
      to be repaid. Well, we know the result. Germany had only one way to pay because
      it had lost its main, most productive steel industry, its lands, Alsace de Lorraine.
      It was financially crippled by the Versailles Treaty. And the only way that it
      could pay the debts was to throw reichsmarks, its currency, onto the foreign exchange
      market to buy the dollars, what ended up the dollars, to repay its debts to the
      Allies that the Allies simply passed on to the United States as their payment
      of the inter-ally debts. Well, the result is that Germany had hyperinflation.
      The United States didn’t want to enable Germany to earn the money to pay the Allies
      and to pay it because that would have threatened American industry. So the United
      States passed a tariff against importing currencies with depreciating currencies,
      namely Germany. So Germany was left without any way of paying. What happened was
      the American investors lent German cities and local states money to borrow. The
      cities that borrowed their dollars in order to fund their own local budgets turned
      the dollars over to the Reichsbank. The Reichsbank used these dollars to pay the
      Allies, and the Allies paid the United States. So what was established was a circular
      flow, and it was all based ultimately on the demand for gold. And America’s buildup
      of international power between World War I and World War II all reflected its
      increasing power of gold, against which all of the major currencies were convertible.
      And during, by the time that Germany collapsed into Nazism, there was a massive
      flight of capital out of Europe to the United States that led to the U.S. gold
      supply growing even more. So that by the time World War II ended, the United States
      controlled the great bulk of the world’s monetary gold. And because Europe was
      devastated, the United States was also in a position to dictate how the international
      trade and financial system was going to operate upon the return to peace. And
      so the United States used its power to create the International Monetary Fund,
      the World Bank, international trade organizations, and bilateral diplomacy, basically
      to very quickly absorb what had been the British Empire. The United States had
      kept the sterling afloat by lending sterling the money to balance its international
      payments and recover after World War II. The condition was that Britain had to
      open the sterling area to let India and other countries that had built up their
      gold and their sterling balances during World War II to be able to spend these
      balances, not limited to British industry, but to the United States. And so the
      United States, basically, there were a number of plans to try to, by John Maynard
      Keynes, to create some assurance that the post-war order wouldn’t be so unbalanced
      that all the gold and all the power would flow to the United States. The United
      States rejected them. And they created the IMF and the World Bank basically to
      serve U.S. national interests. I don’t know if you want me to go into the details.
      For instance, the World Bank was supposed to lend other countries money to develop
      their economies. But first, Europe, and then what are now the Global South countries,
      were called developing countries at that time. But the World Bank policy from
      World War II, ever down to today, was not to provide loans for countries to be
      self-sufficient in any kinds of commodities that the United States controlled.
      And the United States balance of payments since World War II was based very largely
      on food exports as well as control of the oil industry, as we’re seeing today.
      And so there was no attempt at all by the World Bank to follow the recommendations
      of its own economists. The World Bank undertook a series of country studies and
      every study that it did of Latin America or the Middle East said, well, you have
      to have land reform. You have to enable farming to do in these countries what
      the United States did in the United States with its Agricultural Adjustment Act,
      very strongly organizing government support of farming to support grain to become
      independent and be able to feed yourself. That was a prime aim of self-sufficiency,
      historically. The United States and the World Bank basically made loans to finance
      international trade dependency on the United States, and that was where the International
      Monetary Fund came in. The monetary fund applied the same self-destructive economic
      philosophy that the United States and Europe had followed after World War I. There
      was a great debate after World War I between John Maynard Keynes in England and
      the anti-German economists from France and from the United States, saying, Yes,
      the debts really are not unpayable. Any country can pay any foreign debt volume
      at all if it depreciates its currency to such a low point that its exports become
      competitive. And in practice, the IMF philosophy is if countries simply lowered
      the cost of labor, it had a labor theory of value, as it were, if countries can
      impose austerity and cut back government budgets not to run a budget deficit to
      pump money into the economy, then deflation and low wages will enable these countries
      to pay their foreign debt. That has been the policy of the International Monetary
      Fund ever since its foundation in 1945. And that deflationary austerity philosophy
      has been largely responsible for preventing the Global South countries and Middle
      Eastern and Asian countries from finance being able to finance themselves at the
      same time that they have to pay foreign debts to pay the loans that they had to
      undertake in order to finance their trade deficits with the United States since
      World War II. And as these trade deficits have grown and grown and grown, countries
      have scrambled to obtain the dollars. And in effect, that meant the gold to pay
      the debts that they had to pay, putting the interests of foreign creditors, the
      United States government above all, but also United States bondholders and banks
      above their own domestic development. Well, you can imagine what happened to threaten
      this dynamic that the United States had put in place to make essentially to make
      itself the beneficiary of the division of labor and the specialization of production
      between the United States as the leading industrial nation and other countries
      as suppliers of raw materials to it and low-wage manufacturers. There was what
      was called a dual economy structure. One economy for the United States and to
      a lesser extent Europe, and the other economy of the Global South countries and
      countries that were not self-sufficient. Well, what ended all of this started
      in 1950-51 with the Korean War. Between 1945 and 1950, the United States gold
      stock had actually increased to 80% of the world’s monetary gold. Now, that meant
      that the United States owning gold and the insistence that all the currencies
      of major countries be defined in terms of gold meant that the United States had
      an overwhelming financial power. In 1950, for the first time, the United States
      moved into a balance of payments deficit as a result of its military spending
      connected to the Korean War. And from the 1950s on, right down through the end
      of the 1970s, the United States moved into balance of payments deficit that was
      settled by having to pay gold to the countries that were receiving the dollars
      that the United States was throwing off. And the entire deficit was a result of
      military spending. I worked first for the Chase Manhattan Bank as their balance
      of payments analyst, and then for Arthur Anderson, the accounting firm, analyzing
      the U.S. balance of payments, showing that the entire deficit was military in
      character. Well, you can imagine what happened during the Vietnam War of the late
      1960s. When I was at Chase, every Friday morning, we would look at the Federal
      Reserve reporting of what is the U.S. gold stock doing this week. How much gold
      did America have to send to France when General de Gaulle was receiving the dollars
      that America was throwing off in what had been French Indochina, Vietnam, Cambodia,
      Laos? These dollars were all sent to France that were cashed in for gold by France.
      Well, Germany was also obtaining a lot of dollars that other countries receiving,
      American military spending, were spending on German industrial exports. So we
      would watch, week by week by week, the claims on the American gold stock rising.
      And it was obvious that if America’s Cold War spending continued at the rate it
      was going then, at some point, it would run out of enough gold that was needed
      to legally cover the U.S. paper currency. Every dollar prior to 1971, the dollar
      bills that you had in your pocket had to be backed 25% by the gold supply. And
      by 1971, President Nixon realized that this was no longer the case. He closed
      the gold window and said, we cannot afford to pay the cost of our military spending
      in Asia and the whole world in gold anymore. There was some panic within the United
      States government. Well, a year after, almost to the month, a year after the United
      States went off gold in August 1971, my Super Imperialism was published in, I
      think, August, September 1972. And it turned out that the largest purchasers,
      I’m told, were the CIA and the Defense Department, who’d bought it through the
      Washington bookstores. And my friends at Drexel Burnham, the investment bankers,
      came to me and said, look, what are you doing in academia? We’re going to invite
      you to address our annual meeting. Herman Kahn will be there. He’s going to love
      your presentation and he’s going to offer you a job. Accept it, leave academia.
      So indeed, I explained to them that the ending of America’s payment in gold did
      not have to mean the end of American power. Just the opposite, that once foreign
      countries no longer could use their dollars to spend on U.S. gold, they had only
      one practical choice, given the arrangement of international financial diplomacy
      at the time. What did they use their dollars for? They bought the safest investment
      there was, U.S. Treasury securities, Treasury bonds, Treasury bills. And so what
      happened was, as the United States spent military spending abroad, it got the
      recipients, the, turned their dollars over to the central banks for their own
      local currency. The central banks invested these dollars in U.S. Treasury securities,
      and that financed not only foreign military spending by the United States, but
      it financed the budget deficit that within the United States was primarily military
      in character, the military-industrial complex. And I pointed out that what had
      happened was that, instead of being a disaster by ending the United States control
      of the world economy through its gold supply, other countries really had no alternative
      but to have their own central banks themselves finance U.S. military spending
      domestically by recycling their dollars. Well, Herman Kahn hired me. I went to
      work for this Hudson Institute. He said, you know, why are you hoping that your
      classes of maybe 50 graduate students at the New School are going to end up, maybe
      somebody’s going to be a senator or something later. If you join the Hudson Institute,
      I’ll take you to the White House and introduce you and we’ll get a contract and
      you’ll become a government advisor in all of this. And it seemed to make sense.
      And so the Defense Department gave the Hudson Institute an $85,000 grant, much
      more than I’d gotten as an advance for Super Imperialism, for me to go back and
      forth to the War College and to walk to the White House and other venues to explain
      what I just said. That the U.S. dollar standard, which I called the Treasury Bill
      Standard of international finance, had replaced the gold standard and that essentially
      locked other countries into the financial support of Americans spending abroad.
      And that going off gold essentially removed the limit on military spending. I
      gave one talk at the White House to Treasury officials with Herman Kahn, and we
      said, gold is, you can think of it as the peaceful metal, because if other countries
      have to pay their balance of payments deficits in gold, any country waging war,
      any country entailing a very major military expenditure abroad and to fight a
      war, always entails running a big deficit, is going to have to run out of gold
      and lose its power in a system that’s based on gold. Well, immediately the Treasury
      people said, well, we don’t want that. We don’t want because it’s America that
      is going to war. It’s America that’s spending almost all of the world’s military
      budget. And we don’t want gold to play a role in any system that the United States
      cannot control. And we can’t control gold outflows if we have to convert our dollars
      into gold. So, actually, to deprive other countries of any ability to cash in
      their dollars into gold means they’ve been co-opted into a financial system. And
      it’s at that point that America truly became an empire because the entire world’s
      financial system and it was therefore its tax system, its fiscal system, its money
      creation was basically directed by the U.S. Treasury to finance the costs of what
      America claimed were the needs of its empire in creating its 800 military bases
      all over the world and then waging the wars that it’s been fighting since the
      1970s. And that is until this year, other countries were willing to be part of
      this system because the facts of geopolitics led them to support U.S. military
      spending, but also because there wasn’t an alternative. Well, today, with President
      Trump’s budget that he and the Republicans have sent to Congress, the American
      debt, domestic debt has been so great, and it’s foreign debt to foreign central
      banks and to foreign investors, including private quasi-government funds, such
      as Saudi Arabia and Norway, have realized that the foreign debt that central banks
      hold that was supposed to be as good as gold and the safest asset to buy, cannot
      be paid. There is no way that the United States can or would or is willing to
      somehow pay the amount of money that other countries hold as loans to the United
      States, mainly treasury bills, but also U.S. agencies, Fannie Mae, government
      agencies pay a little bit more than the Treasury, and even corporate securities
      such as Saudi Arabia holds and Norway holds. There is no way that America is willing
      to pay these debts, either by exporting because it’s deindustrialized and it’s
      not running an export service anymore, or by selling off its industry to foreign
      buyers. The United States until this year,a has said that if foreign countries
      could not pay their finances and their balance of payments deficits, they had
      to do so by privatizing their public utilities, selling off their infrastructure
      to foreigners, selling off their mineral rights, selling off their land to foreign
      investors. The United States is not willing to do what it’s insisted that other
      countries do as the basis of world trade and investment that it’s created. So
      other countries realize this double standard, that they’re really not getting
      savings that can be converted into ownership of U.S. industry or agriculture or
      infrastructure or anything else. They’re just paper dollars. And so for the first
      time, you’re having a move to seek an alternative to the U.S. dollars. Well, the
      only alternative so far that people can agree upon is gold. And when Herman Kahn
      and I went to the White House in 1973, Herman brought a map of the world. And
      there was a map of countries that trusted governments. And that was Northern Europe,
      Europe as a whole, the United States, the English-speaking countries, countries
      whose populations did not trust governments. Well, you could call them the global
      majority. Most people didn’t. Then he had countries that supported gold and commodity
      money. Well, there were countries like India, Asia, Global South countries. They
      wanted something secure, not an IOU. The countries that trusted paper money were
      Northern Europe and the English-speaking countries. So you have this faith in
      paper money that is “A debt is a debt.” And that was the principle on which America
      began to accumulate gold after World War I. But the United States, certainly the
      current budget that is before Congress, is saying, well, yes, a debt is a debt
      on the balance sheet. Yes, on the balance sheet, we owe foreign countries more
      money than there’s any way we can see can be repaid. But that’s it. It’s a debt
      that will never be repaid. It’s as if you went to the grocery store and tried
      to pay in an IOU, and the grocery store would say, well, you run up quite a tab
      in the last week. You know, you got to pay it. And the customer will say, well,
      I can’t pay. But you can use this debt to maybe you can give this IOU to the farm
      that’s giving you the eggs and the dairy or the vegetables that you’re selling.
      And somehow, if only this IOU could be circulated as a claim on the customer,
      then it would be, technically, it’s a debt. Well, a lot of the financial system
      and the world financial system are now based on that kind of debt that there’s
      no ability to pay behind it. And that is what has become the key, you could say,
      to the American empire, because it’s the key to America’s ability to spend abroad
      and be really the first nation in history that does not have to pay its war debts
      or other debts that it has run up to foreign countries. That’s the double standard
      that America has been able to achieve to make it the unique nation, or the indispensable
      nation. And that is why, right now, other countries are buying gold, and you can
      see the gold price going up and why they’re trying to realize, well, we can’t
      spend all of our dollar holdings on gold. Isn’t there some way we can create an
      alternative paper currency owed by other countries? Well, you have the BRICS talking
      about that. And you really can’t have such a currency by other countries because
      to issue a currency, you need a parliament to say, well, who’s going to get the
      benefit of this currency? And if you issue the currency, what’s it going to be
      spent on? Who’s going to spend it? You’d have to have something like a real Europe
      deciding who’s going to get the result of Euros that are being created, except
      the United States created the Eurozone in a way that it really can’t run enough
      of a deficit to recover from the downturn that it’s now been forced into. So,
      the world is in a quandary. And that’s what my Super Imperialism is all about.
      And I’ve tried to update it to the present, but that’s the basic theme. GLENN
      DIESEN: Well, I find this to be fascinating that the U.S., initially, the massive
      power after World War II, was obviously based on America’s position as a credit
      nation. And obviously, yeah, the military forces, privileged position in the World
      Bank, IMF, and the U.S. dollar. But it’s quite unique, though, isn’t it, that
      it became its, as a deficit country, its growing debt became the source for further
      imperial strength. But nonetheless, this seems to have always been a temporary
      model. I do remember back in the 90s and early 2000s when you had political leaders
      in Washington arguing that, well, actually, our debt is a sign of strength. It
      shows that the world trusts our economy and trusts our currency. However, this,
      if it’s not sustainable, at some point you’ll hit a wall. And I looked at the
      debt clock this morning and it’s almost running into 37 trillion and this rise
      has only intensified. So at some point you do need alternatives which appear to
      be emerging. You also mentioned, you said facts of geopolitics. I guess one of
      the facts of geopolitics during the Cold War was simply that the main two rivals,
      be it the Soviets and the Chinese, were Communist states, largely decoupled from
      this kind of economic statecraft, while the allies of the United States in the
      capitalist world all had to prioritize, as you said, the facts of geopolitics.
      That is, you couldn’t really allow too many economic squabbles to go along. So,
      you know, there were some incentives to prevent rivalry between the capitalist
      industrial nations as you’ve had prior to World War II. But where are we heading
      now, though? Because, again, the debt model seems to have exhausted itself and
      the facts of geopolitics have changed. Now you have the key rivals, be it China,
      Russia, and others, who are also embracing economic statecraft. How are the foundations,
      I guess, of the American empire eroding? MICHAEL HUDSON: The debt model has not
      exhausted itself. And Trump has given a number of speeches, and Congress has backed
      him up, saying any country that is moving to establish an alternative to the dollar,
      we’re going to hit with special tariffs, up to 500% even. He said, any attempt
      by countries to shift out of the dollar to the Chinese payment system towards
      China will be treated as an enemy and we will block their access to the United
      States market. What he’s, he realizes that America’s power is no longer a creditor
      country, but its power is precisely because it’s a debtor country. Keynes made
      a joke saying that if you owe a thousand dollars to a bank, then you’re in trouble.
      If you owe a billion dollars to the bank, the bank’s in trouble. And that’s the
      United States’ strength. It owes so much money to other countries that if it doesn’t
      pay, for instance, if it grabs the Russian savings that were held in the United
      States and in Brussels, it’ll confiscate it, then the savings, poof, disappear.
      The debt is basically annulled. The United States is unwilling to annul Global
      South debt that can’t be paid, but it has any attempt by countries to break away
      from the United States dollar and the dollarization is treated as an act of war.
      Now, that was explained to me by the Treasury Secretary, already in 1974 and 75,
      with the oil war when Saudi Arabia and the OPEC countries quadrupled the price
      of oil in response to the United States quadrupling the price of grain. And the
      United States told them that if they could charge whatever price of oil they wanted
      to, that was fine with the United States because the United States controlled
      much of the world’s oil industry, including domestic oil production. And the United
      States oil companies had a price umbrella as the price of oil went. However, the
      condition for letting OPEC countries raise the price of oil was that all of their
      export earnings would be recycled into the United States. It didn’t have to be
      only in treasury securities. It could be in stocks and bonds, but only a minority
      ownership. So the Saudi kings bought, I think, a billion dollars of every stock
      in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They spread their savings over the U.S. bond
      and stock market in a way that did not involve any ability to control the companies
      whose stocks they owned, in contrast to most stockholders who try to have some
      voice in the company’s management. So that’s the situation we have today. Imagine
      what’s happening in the Near East now when Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United
      Arab Republics all own and have huge holdings of U.S. securities. They’ve seen
      the United States grab Russia’s savings. They’ve seen the United States through
      England confiscate Venezuela’s oil gold holdings and the Bank of England. And
      the whole process began with the Iranian Khomeini, the Iranian revolution against
      the Shah, when Iran tried to pay the interest due on its foreign debt and Chase
      Manhattan refused to make the payment. Iran was counted as default and immediately
      foreclosed upon. The rest of the Near Eastern countries that are major holders
      of American debt are locked in to, they’re fearful of acting in any way that would
      oppose the current fight U.S. buildup against Iran because anything they do, whether
      it’s to support the Palestinians or to support Iran or anything that is at odds
      with U.S. diplomacy in the Near East, would result in the United States holding
      all of their savings in its own pocket under their control, able to freeze them
      or confiscate them at will. That’s the power that America has as a debtor over
      other countries and that’s why Trump has said, any attempt to de-dollarize is
      an act of war today just as they were told 50 years ago in countries were told
      way back in 1974, 75. GLEN DIESEN: Well, there’s also an old truth though that
      is any system which becomes too dependent on coercion will eventually begin to,
      I guess, degrade over time and there’s,  well, the whole thing that the whole
      world, that America owes money to the whole world so America sits on their piggy
      bank or their savings and can’t take it whenever they want. It’s it seems as if
      it only works to such an extent and I can appreciate the theft of Venezuelan gold
      and all of this. But it looked as looked as if the stealing of the Russian sovereign
      funds was really one step too far because when there’s no trust anymore in the
      system, it can’t really work. And we see not just the opponents such as China
      being worried because they know they’re never going to get all their money back
      but also countries like India are concerned about secondary sanctions and other
      American allies. So, how long can this, I guess, a new changing character of the
      American empire continue? Because, well, from my perspective, one of the key things
      driving China these days is exactly the search for alternatives because they are
      preparing themselves for an almost never-ending trade war with the United States,
      and they can’t really outsource everything from their financial stability to the
      goodwill of the United States. So, surely the rest of the world is looking for
      alternatives to escape U.S. financial control. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you’ve summarized
      the dilemma perfectly. Trust is gone, but so far there’s no alternative. So, the
      answer to your question is to how long this system can last until there’s an alternative.
      And that’s why the United States’ foreign policy, now, to maintain what you could
      call its financial empire and control of world trade and investment is based on
      preventing any alternative that might come, be developed. Obviously, the countries
      running the strongest balance of payments and trade surpluses are the logical
      sponsors of such an alternative, China, oil-producing countries. This is why the
      United States has designated China, and any country that looks powerful enough
      to create an alternative is viewed as an enemy. And the U.S. tries to prevent
      and preempt their creating an alternative form of international monetary savings
      by imposing sanctions on them, which are counterproductive, but it’s the United
      States strategy, or trying to organize European diplomacy and diplomacy of its
      proxies and satellites to somehow delay this development that, as you point out,
      it’s inevitable. Yes, someday the United States cannot get a free lunch anymore.
      And the first step in preventing a free lunch is for other countries to recognize
      that there is a free lunch and that they’re essentially giving up money that loses
      their control over it and actually funds the United States willing to take aggressive
      actions against them if they do anything to try to ensure real value for their
      money. Well, the question is, how long can the U.S. ability to control German
      politicians, European politicians, Asian politicians, especially OPEC country
      politicians, how long can it actually threaten them to live in the short run?
      In the long run, they realize the U.S. cannot do it. But living in the short run,
      they can do tactics. The problem is that the tactics that they’re using are so
      heavy-handed that they’re the opposite of strategy. The more they go to tactics
      of enforcing and threatening and bullying other countries, the more they’re destroying
      the strategy of actually making the United States a sufficiently viable economy
      to promise to actually have something to repay other countries with. I think the
      U.S. plan is what the Trump administration hoped for; it is that America can create
      an internet monopoly, a computer monopoly, an artificial intelligence monopoly,
      a chipmaking monopoly, and somehow use its monopoly earnings to reverse the balance
      of payments deficit and reestablish world power. That’s a pipe dream because,
      in order to achieve technological dominance, you need research and development.
      And because the financial sector and corporations, the private corporations that
      are supposed to be developing this technological lead, live in the short run,
      they’re using most of their income for Apple and the other countries and buying
      off their own stocks and paying out as dividends to support their stock prices.
      So, the way in which the American economy is being financialized is actually undercutting
      its ability to maintain its financial power over the world because it’s resulted
      in deindustrializing the United States economy, which makes other countries feel
      even more queasy about what’s happening to their savings invested here and what
      on earth can they do? So, what you’ve seen in the last two weeks, last month,
      is something very surprising. The United States’ interest rates have been going
      up and up, but the dollar has been going down. This is the first time in history
      that when a country has raised its interest rates, like the United States, it
      actually loses. There’s an outflow of currency instead of attracting other countries
      to the world. Arbitrage, as European and Asian countries say, well, we can make
      a higher interest rate by borrowing cheap in our countries and buying these high-yielding
      Treasuries, 10-year Treasury securities at 4.5% interest. Well, all of a sudden,
      it doesn’t work anymore. And that is what is panicking the Treasury and people
      who are actually trying to figure out how are we going to pay. The United States
      is turning into the condition that England was in after World War II of limping
      along and being unable to survive. The difference is that there, right now, is
      no alternative that European and Near Eastern countries are willing to accept
      as long as they refuse to accept China and Asia and Russia as an alternative.
      That’s exactly what is underlying the war, of America’s insistence of the new
      Cold War, saying that China is our existential enemy. We are going to try to drain
      Russia’s economy by the war in Ukraine. We’re doing everything we can to disrupt
      the ability to other countries to be an attractive alternative to the dollar.
      This attempt to maintain dollarization and prevent de-dollarization and therefore
      ending the Treasury Bill standard in a way that America cannot benefit either
      from the Treasury Bill standard or a gold standard. This is the key to understanding
      not only American diplomacy, but the American military action against Iran today
      is part of its attempt to control the entire Near East, partly using Israel as
      its proxy and ISIS and al-Qaeda in Syria and Iraq as its proxies. This is the
      key to why you have such a seemingly bizarre international military situation.
      How on earth would it can, people are saying, how is Iran a threat to the United
      States? Well, it’s a threat to the United States because it exists, and the United
      States does not control it as the key to controlling the overall Near East and
      all of the balance of trade surplus that Near Eastern oil draws in from the rest
      of the world. That’s what makes the United States think of Iran, the war in Iran,
      and the destruction of Iran as being in the United States’ interest. It’s the
      role of Iran as the last potential alternative in the Near East to U.S. control
      of making the Near East a client economy, like it has made Latin American economies
      clients for so many years. GLENN DIESEN: But this is the only path out of the
      current dilemma that is either establish some important tech monopolies in this
      new industrial revolution or establish, I guess, quasi-colonies around the world.
      I mean, it just appears that all of these initiatives, even if one is optimistic,
      amounts to just kicking the can down the road. What are possible pathways? I mean,
      if you wrote a sequel to your book now on super imperialism, where could the United
      States go from here if you want something more sustainable? Because it appears
      that the tech leadership is not going to monopolize anything with the presence
      of China and it’s also these colonies. Obviously, it’s not going to be able to
      make a colony out of Iran either, it seems. So, what exactly are we looking at?
      Well, if you had a, not an attractive option for an academic, but if you had a
      chapter of future speculation where we’re heading, what would you see? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: The only way that the United States can remain a solvent economy is to
      give up the attempt to run the world with an empire. Empires do not pay. That’s
      the lesson of history. Empires cost a lot of money, and in the end, the imperial
      power goes broke, just as Britain went broke with its empire, ending up turning
      its monetary power over to the United States. The French Empire went under. Empires
      don’t pay. So the only way the United States can exist is re-industrializing.
      That means definancializing its economy. You point out that we’re living in the
      short run. How do we move to the long run? The financial sector lives in the short
      run. As long as the United States economy has shifted its central planning away
      from government to Wall Street and to the other financial centers, these financial
      centers have a timeframe of three months to a year. They’re looking at what is
      the stock price doing for this quarter, because that’s what the bonuses of the
      chief financial officer and the CEOs are based on: their stock price. So you’re
      having an economic mentality in the United States that is essentially the neoliberal
      mentality of living in the short run, making money financially instead of in a
      productive industrial, agricultural, and commercial way. So the United States
      would have to be just another country, like all other countries. It would have
      to be an equal. There would have to be parity between the United States and other
      countries, all following the same set of rules. That is anathema to Congress.
      There’s still a nationalism and a populist nationalism here that says we don’t
      want to be another country. We don’t want to have to live by the rules that other
      countries live by. We want to continue to be able to dominate other countries
      because we worry that if other countries have the ability to become independent
      diplomatically, they may do something that we don’t like. Well, as long as you
      have this mentality, you’re going to end up setting yourself against the rest
      of the world. You’re going to lose your ability to trade and make your economy
      an investment magnet for other countries. There’s no way that other countries
      can invest in the United States with the hope of making money from American corporate
      growth because the growth that’s occurring is only financial in character. Stocks
      and bonds, real estate prices, asset price inflation financed by debt, creating
      more and more debt to bid up the price of real estate, bid up the price of bonds,
      and bid up the price of stocks. That’s what the zero interest rate policy was
      all about after 2008. The United States has been transformed from an industrial
      capitalist economy into a finance capitalist economy that actually is not old-fashioned
      capitalism at all, but is purely financial. You could say it’s closer to a neo-feudal
      economy than to the kind of industrial economy that Britain, Germany, and the
      United States were becoming after World War, at the end of the 19th century, up
      to World War I, the kind of economy that gave them all of their world power in
      the first place. That kind of industrial, productive, non-financial power no longer
      exists in the West. So the problem’s not only the United States, it’s the neoliberal
      economic philosophy that has spread from the United States, Western Europe, and
      America’s major allies. So the real conflict between the United States and let’s
      say China, Asia, and the Global South is not simply a conflict over how they’re
      going to hold and save their balance of payment surpluses; it’s a conflict of
      economic systems. Are other countries going to create an economic system that
      is not military in character, that does not base itself on making financial wealth,
      but makes itself by creating public infrastructure, such as China does, base itself
      on actual industrial growth, not rent-seeking. And that’s sort of been left out
      of the economic models that are made. America’s turned into a rentier economy,
      not an industrial economy. It makes money financially. It makes money for interest
      rates. It makes money by creating monopolies, such as in the tech sector. But
      none of these are based on the actual cost of production and cost. It’s all based
      on special privileges and special distortions of the market away from everything
      that Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and even Marx talked about. What you have
      today is a form of capitalism that none of the classical economists or Marx anticipated.
      They all thought countries are going to act in their self-interest. And if you’re
      forecasting what is going to happen to the United States and what the alternative
      is for Europe, and you think, well, they’ll act in their self-interest, you have
      to deal with the fact that countries are, none of these countries are acting in
      their own self-interest. They’re acting in an economic model, a neoliberal model,
      a military model, a diplomatic institutional model that turns out not to be in
      their self-interest, but is self-destructive. So all I can do is explain why it’s
      self-destructive. And I think that the natural tendency, as I think you’ve hinted
      at, is for other countries to follow the creation of real wealth, not financial
      wealth. And there’s a reason why China has been growing so rapidly with its real
      GDP and Russia with its GDP. China’s GDP and Russia’s GDP does not include an
      increase in rents, an increase in interest and financial penalties, and capital
      gains. It’s not financial in character. It’s real in character. The fight is between
      living in unreality in the short run or reality in the long term. How are you
      going to bring that about? For me, all I can do is say what I’ve just said to
      you today. If people understand this, at least that’s step one in trying to accept
      the alternative that the empire is, any country dominating another country is
      over. China would not be able to do it. No country is able to be an empire at
      the rest of the world’s expense without the rest of the world pulling back and
      trying to create an alternative. GLENN DIESEN: Yeah, the lack of rationality these
      days is one of my main concerns because you do see foreign policy and economic
      policy being less and less dictated by national interest and reason. But this
      was the need to adjust is one of the reasons I was a bit optimistic about Trump’s
      presidency, because at least he talked about reindustrialization. At least he
      talked about the need for the US to have a different role. He challenged NATO
      expansionism, which was a key manifestation of this hegemonic system. It looked
      as if he kind of, if he didn’t put words on it, more or less intuitively recognized
      that, you would have to let go of the empire in order to save the republic. So
      he, it looked as if he was, but, of course, he made a mess out of everything.
      And of course, this attack on Iran now makes it even more so. But yeah, well,
      before we wrap this up, what do you think is, not the long term, is going to happen
      now in the short term? You mentioned that the United States attempts to raise
      interest rates to attract capital, but instead you have capital flight. So how,
      what do you expect, if not over the months to come, the weeks to come? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Other countries are running for the exit and Trump’s policies are driving
      them to the exit. His tariff policy essentially threatens to deny them the U.S.
      market if they don’t agree to stop trading with China, to refuse to de-dollarize,
      and essentially to surrender their economies to U.S. directions. They’re not going
      to do it. And the response by other countries is going to say, well, we’re not
      going to accept your terms. If you’re going to raise the tariffs to 40%, 60%,
      do it. Of course, we will. What you’re doing is stopping us from trading with
      the United States. We’ll have tariffs against you, and you go your way. We’re
      going ours. So Trump himself is, if there were any plans of any plans, how do
      I break up the American empire? I would do just exactly what Donald Trump is doing.
      You drive other countries away and you prod them to say, you think there’s no
      alternative? I’m going to be so aggressive towards you, just as I’m aggressive
      towards Russia, towards China, towards Iran and the Middle East. I’m closing the
      U.S. market to you. Trump has said that if you try to move your, to buy U.S. Treasury
      bonds yielding 4.5%, I’m going to charge a fee and a tariff fee on your buying
      bonds of 10%. So you’ll actually lose money on the bonds. And even if the United
      States does pay 4.5%, the dollar will be falling against the Euro. It’s fallen
      10% against the Euro already. The Euro was up to 120 before. Now it’s back near
      parity. Other countries are losing in their own currency the valuation of the
      dollars they have. So Trump is speeding up the parting guest. He’s closing off
      the U.S. market to them. And that means go it alone, folks. Make your own agreement.
      And certainly there will be, despite the fact that the politicians of America’s
      client countries, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, Britain, are all basically
      voting against what their own populations vote for, just as American Congress
      in wanting to press for war in Iran is voting against what the opinion polls sold
      the Americans for. This cannot last.  It has to be temporary or there’ll be a
      revolution. And you have to remember that industrial capitalism itself in the
      19th century was revolutionary. In order for British industry to become competitive,
      the industrialists had to end the power of the most powerful vested interests
      of their day, the real estate interests. They had to overcome the power of the
      House of Lords. They had to change the whole political system. They had to widen
      the vote to democratize politics. That was a revolution. This is the kind of revolution
      that is recurring today in the global majority countries. Industry in Europe had
      to throw off the remnants of feudalism. The landlord class, the monopolies that
      had been created by international bankers to help kings pay the war debts that
      they ran up. Well, today, these were all rentier interests, land rent, monopoly
      rent, and interest. This is the problem that the Global South and global majorities
      are fighting. It’s like the equivalent of what were the feudal interests that
      Europe overthrew to industrialize and become capitalist countries, are today,
      foreign interests. Foreign investors own their raw material rents, their natural
      resource rent, their land rent. Foreign investors own their major monopolies.
      And now that they’ve privatized public infrastructure into monopolies, like Thames
      Water in England, and run these countries into foreign dollar debt so that they
      own interest. The fight by other countries today to gain control of their own
      destiny, their own autonomy, their own sovereignty is very similar to the fight
      that Europe had against its own domestic interests that were carried over from
      feudalism. The world today, the rest of the world outside of the United States,
      has to cope with the fact that we don’t have feudalism anymore, but what we have
      is a superstructure of rentier interests that are not part of the production economy.
      We’re back in the position of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and Marx saying,
      they’re two parts of the economy. There’s a production economy, and then there’s
      the rentier economy, the circulation economy, finance, industry, real estate,
      and monopolies. There has to be a way of thinking about, what is gross national
      product? What is a product? Is a product really all the money that the financial
      sector and the real estate sector makes in rents, or is it what we actually produce,
      like what China is producing without a rentier class? The fight of de-dollarization
      is really involves getting rid of the rentier class that these countries have,
      and also they cannot afford to pay the foreign debt that they’ve run up. Trump’s
      tariffs prevent other countries from earning enough export returns to earn the
      dollars to pay the bondholders and banks that have debts owed in U.S. dollars.
      So they’re going to be huge defaults that turn into a very conscious and deliberate
      debt repudiation of what are odious debts, because all these debts that have been
      run up since 1945 as a result of a U.S.-sponsored philosophy of the International
      Monetary Fund and the World Bank on essentially predatory pro-U.S. lines have
      ended up not helping other countries pay, but preventing them from paying. And
      if a creditor country will not let a debtor country pay by exporting enough in
      competition with its own industry, then there’s no economic or moral claim that
      this foreign debt is a viable debt. It’s unviable. So not only is the American
      empire unviable, but the whole superstructure of debt, the superstructure of monopolies,
      the superstructure of privatization and financial Thatcherizing and Reaganizing
      the world economy are unviable. So we’re dealing with a real clash of economic
      systems. Some people call this a clash of civilizations, but it’s really a clash
      of economic systems. And you could say it’s between the promise of industrial
      capitalism as it was developing in the beginning in the 19th century and the disastrous
      reality of finance capitalism with a single geopolitical center in the United
      States run increasingly in its own interest in exploitative, predatory fashion.
      GLENN DIESEN: Well, Michael, thank you so much. And for anyone who wants to know
      more on the economic strategy for the American Empire and also why this is collapsing,
      again, go to the description and look for the link to Michael Hudson’s book, Super
      Imperialism. So thank you for going through these important topics and I hope
      to have you back on soon. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, thank you for giving me a chance
      to explain my philosophy, Glenn. Transcription and Diarization: hudsearch Editing

    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion with Glenn Diesen, economist Michael Hudson
      explores the economic foundations of the American Empire, referencing his book
      "Super Imperialism" and addressing the current instability of these economic strategies
      compared to when the book was first published.
    paragraph_summary: In a discussion led by Glenn Diesen with economist Michael Hudson,
      the focus is on the economic strategies underpinning the American Empire, as explored
      in Hudson's book "Super Imperialism." Hudson argues that the U.S. has historically
      engaged in financial colonialism rather than traditional military imperialism,
      with significant developments occurring post-World War II. He highlights the origins
      of this strategy in the aftermath of World War I, where the U.S. imposed debt
      repayment demands on its European allies, defying the expectation of debt forgiveness
      that typically followed such conflicts. The conversation aims to examine the current
      stability of these economic foundations compared to when Hudson's book was first
      published.

    text: 'March 20, 2025 The Quarterly Q&A with our Patreon Supporters Episode #15
      KARL FITZGERALD: Welcome everyone to another Patreon Q&A session with Michael
      and his beloved Patreon supporters. We’re with Michael Hudson, renowned author,
      Wall Street analyst, and seer of modern times. Michael, I wanted to sort of frame
      this conversation. I love reading Substack and I’m all fired up today after Trump’s
      big speech. And more particularly, I wanted you to delve into Project 2025. Can
      you tell us how you’ve seen this developing over the years, over the decades,
      and any insights you may have on the Heritage Foundation? What is the real big
      picture behind Project 2025? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I can see from what Mr. Musk
      is doing and what Trump talked about that he has two ideals that he wants the
      American economy and the European economy to be like. The first is Margaret Thatcher.
      He wants, he says, ‘we want to get rid of the government. We want to get rid of
      the state. We want a centrally planned economy. The planning should be by the
      people that you see right around me, the billionaires of the financial sector.’
      The second ideal he has (of course, he needs a team to do this) is what the neoliberals
      did in Russia after 1991. What Trump wants to do, and what his commerce secretary
      announced yesterday they want to do, is to take all of the government property
      and put it into private hands where it can be used to make a profit. Well, what
      they really mean is economic rent because there’s a reason why government property
      and enterprises are public and not private. And that’s because almost all of the
      government enterprises and government agencies are natural monopolies, like the
      post office, which now, of course, isn’t so much anymore. It’s being undercut.
      Communications, transportation, all of these things that if you look at a century
      ago in Europe and other countries, all of these things were basically public and
      were provided for free, like health care or education. And these were conservative
      policies. And there were conservative policies such as Benjamin Disraeli in England,
      who, as I’ve said before, said health, health is all. And the reason that the
      government took them over was that the employers were not going to pay their wage
      earners high enough wages to pay for their own health care, or pay for their own
      education, or pay monopoly prices for the buses and transportation and railroads
      and later airplanes they have to take, or for communications, telephone service,
      or for gas and electricity and water. The government taxed the wealthiest people,
      which was the original American income tax, and it fell on 2% of the population,
      mainly the landlords and the bankers and the monopolists. Trump would like to
      make all of America look like Thames Water in England. You know, here’s a company
      that began with no debt at all and was given to a privatizer at a low price. They
      created billions of dollars of wealth for the stockholders by just borrowing money
      and paying what they borrowed from the banks out as dividends. They keep raising
      the price and saying: Well, we have to raise the price that we sell you water
      for because we’re paying so much interest to the banks for the money that we paid
      to buy our stock, to push up the stock price, and to pay special dividends to
      the private capital owners of Thames Water. Trump says this is what we need to
      do for the United States. Here’s a wonderful thing about tariffs that we want
      to change our tax policy around. America didn’t have an income tax until 1913.
      And the way that the government funded its activities over and above what it could
      raise in taxes was by the tariffs. And Trump said the wonderful thing about tariffs
      is that billionaires don’t have to pay them. The bankers don’t have to pay them.
      Bondholders in the financial sector and landlords don’t have to pay them. Tariffs
      fall entirely on industry and on the consumers and the employees that they have.
      And so tariffs can free the American economy from having to have an income tax,
      at least on the upper brackets, such as they pay after they get all of the special
      tax benefits and deductibilities, such as depreciation that we’ve discussed before.
      So, essentially, Trump wants to get rid of the mixed economy and have only a one-sector
      economy, only the private sector. His Congress Department Secretary came out yesterday
      and said, let’s change the way we report gross domestic product. We know that
      with tariffs, there are going to be supply interruptions. We know that what we’re
      doing is going to throw a lot of people out of work, starting with all the government
      people that we’ve just fired. And so that means that GDP will go down. So let’s
      have two parts of the GDP. One will be the private sector GDP, and the other will
      be the government sector. So that when the government sector shrinks as a proportion
      of GDP, you don’t want the newspapers to come out with the headline, America’s
      GDP falls 5%. The Trump administration and the Commerce Department said we will
      focus on the private sector element of GDP, because what they said is the government
      doesn’t produce any service people want. There’s nothing that it does that’s productive.
      Productive means making a profit. And that’s because the government isn’t supposed
      to make a profit when it provides emergency service like health care or research
      or National Endowment of Health. Well, I admit that they’ve done an awful job
      with COVID, but there are various reasons that governments throughout the world
      have created all these public agencies. And the Trump team, the cabinet, says,
      let’s just get rid of all the government agencies now. They can be given away.
      They can all be privatized. And if you look at the people, the Silicon Valley
      people around Trump, the billionaires who’ve contributed so much to his campaign,
      Mr. Musk himself, who’s doing all the cutting, you can see that what they know,
      and ….. … what a lot of people don’t realize, is that most great fortunes in history
      have been made by privatizing the public domain. Most of the great landlords came
      by the enclosure movement in England in the 16th and 17th century, just enclosing
      the land. As Balzac said,  most fortunes stem from some long-forgotten theft that
      is viewed as, well, somehow the family’s wealth has been around so many centuries
      that it’s all been interwoven into just the way the world works. And Trump realizes
      that, well, if all the great fortunes of the European aristocracy, the wealthy
      families of the past, have all come from appropriating the public domain, we can
      do it all over again in America. We can do for America what Russia did for the
      kleptocrats that  created so many more billionaires. That basically is the free
      market plan that you referred to, Karl. And by a free market, they mean one that
      is not run by government subsidy, but is run for profit. And the profit motive,
      meaning the economic rent motive, because all of these are monopolies, will be
      to make the entire economy look like Thames Water in England, or you can pick
      your analogy in almost any other country, Gasgrom in Russia, Autovox, whatever.
      So that’s the plan. And that’s why this is not only a domestic war. I think Trump
      has said, well, you know, this plan to remake the economy is not only the American
      economy, it’s the worldwide economy. And don’t think of our enemy as Russia. Our
      enemy is wage earners and the government sector. And so we’re going to back similar
      parties in Europe. The Alternative for Deutschland is a far-right party. In Italy,
      it  used to be called fascism. But Mussolini said, really, you shouldn’t call
      it fascism. You should call it corporatism. It’s the corporate state where what
      used to be the state, what used to be a government that was run by elected representatives,
      will now be run by the corporations. And the problem is that elected representatives
      don’t want these government agencies to make a profit or a monopoly rent. They’re
      actually providing services that are very essential, for less than they could
      charge people. For Trump, as for the Fascists, if they’re essential services like
      health care, water, electricity, they’re that essential, then we can just raise
      the price and make these into money-making, profit, and rent-generating enterprises.
      And that’s really what economic growth is all about – according to the ‘libertarians’.
      KARL FITZGERALD: And so, really, we’ve just got neoliberalism on steroids. And
      I wonder if with Project 2025 and these policies, they are sort of making it so
      obvious now. Are they actually doing us a favor in awakening people to what neoliberalism
      has been doing quite subtly for, well, not subtly, but forcefully for, 20, 30-odd
      years? The privatization agenda. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it’s working. I mean, you
      saw that Alternative for Deutschland is the second-largest vote getter, 20% of
      the vote in the recent elections. Whereas the left-wing, Sarah Wagenknecht’s party,
      the real left-wing party, and there’s only one, Sarah Wagenknecht’s, got just
      under 5%, 4.9 plus percent, not enough to get into parliament. There is her former
      party that she broke from, the Linka, the left party, which is basically also
      like the Social Democrats, a neoliberal party. There’s no party that is what the
      left used to be like, which is supporting rising living standards for labor or
      consumers or wage earners; however, you want to characterize them. It’s all about
      how do you create profit opportunities that are going to increase the stock market
      and the bond market and the real estate market. And the problem is that the stock
      and bond markets are held almost entirely by the wealthiest 10% of the population.
      So the part of the economy that is going to be raised is  the economy of the wealthiest
      10% and especially the 1% and overwhelmingly the 0.1%. Those are the people who
      are grouped around Trump now, and they’re making their move. And in America, that’s
      unchecked because of the Citizens United ruling here that essentially lets elections
      be bought by the donor class and campaign contributors. Then you have Elon Musk
      giving $200 million to the party that appointed him to begin cutting down government
      and ending it so that the huge swaths of government buildings are going to be
      sold off. And that will include courthouses and almost everything. Are they going
      to gentrify them? Are there going to be so many billionaires’ families that they’re
      going to be able to move into all of these luxury apartments that are made by
      the sell-off of government buildings and other public buildings? And also, the
      national parks are being talked about being sold off. The Park Service employees
      have been slashed. I think something like 50% of the guides and the workers and
      employees who are supposed to take care of the gardening, the presentation, the
      vegetation, protection against fire – all of these people are basically fired.
      They’ll have to find new jobs. And the government apparently doesn’t want unemployment
      rates to go up. They’re not going to be able to collect unemployment, especially
      if they’re told, “If you resign now, we won’t have to fire you.” We’ll give you
      something, but nobody knows what that something is. And when you’re given a promise
      by Donald Trump to give you something, you know that from experience that people
      who’ve been promised very rarely get what they’ve been promised. And it looks
      like what’s in store for a lot of American former government workers is the need
      to find a new job. And that means finding a new city to live in, not Washington,
      D.C., not the big cities that are centers of mainly government employment. Santa
      Fe, New Mexico, is a city  with very heavy federal employment. Kansas City is
      a city with very heavy federal buildings. Chicago, again. All of these cities
      where there’s already an oversupply of office real estate are now going to get
      a lot more. So you’re going to have all of this government property of various
      forms, from parks to various enterprises run by the government, to buildings.
      All of this is going to be thrown onto the open market at prices that can best
      be afforded by the private capital agglomerations that have been developing in
      the last few years. So you’re going to have a whole change in the ownership pattern
      of the American economy. And the U.S. is trying to push similar right-wing parties
      all over the world wherever it can. Just today on Johnson’s Russia list, there
      are reports of what the administration is doing to replace Zelensky. Well, Trump’s
      people are over there in Kiev interviewing the former kleptocrats, Tymoshenko
      and the chocolate king there. They think:  what kleptocrat are we going to pick
      who’s going to pledge to promote a similar kleptocratic policy to what made Ukraine
      the country that it is, and what made Russia the country it was in the 1990s under
      Yeltsin? They’re looking for a Ukrainian leader who will be the closest approximation
      to Yeltsin or Zelensky. And we’re dealing with a movement, I won’t say it’s worldwide
      because it’s really limited to the West and to the 15% of the world’s population.
      But it looks like it gives new meaning to the decline of the West. KARL FITZGERALD:
      Michael, you’re answering this very calmly. Hopefully, we can say something to
      really fire you up today. But good to see the Patreon supporters here. If you
      can put your QA question and your questions in the QA panel, that would be good.
      I am going to read a webinar chat here from Rezwan Rezani that’s related to this
      theme. And he says, the thing about Project 2025 is how systematic and organized
      it is and how they’ve been building up to this with an intense network of churches
      and NGOs that echo the talking points. My mom was the recipient of a flood of
      regular mailings telling her how important it is to support these goals. And they
      have such a strident shorthand. Do we have anything similar to counter that juggernaut?
      MICHAEL HUDSON: No, that’s what’s so striking. There’s really nothing like what
      used to be the socialist parties or the left-wing parties. They’ve been so co-opted
      by the non-government organizations that have given grants to members of these
      parties, who are sort of like Starmer or Tony Blair in England. They’re looking;
      every country has people on the left, and every party has a bell-shaped curve.
      And you have people who are idealists, you have pragmatic people, you have opportunists,
      and the non-governmental network of organizations is able to act as a talent scout
      for these people. And they can find the Kier Starmers or the Tony Blairs or the
      Macrons and give them promotions and find lesser models for them to staff the
      prestigious non-governmental organizations. Well, of course, that’s what Trump
      has said the National Endowment for Democracy has been doing, putting the neocons
      in favored positions. I think what they want to do is not so much oppose non-government
      organizations itself, but to create perhaps privately funded organizations like
      the Heritage Foundation, the foundations, the Cato Institute, and the foundations
      that are supported by the wealthy class or the two brothers. I’m blocking out
      the names right now, but the right wing. And so they’ve been able to nurture them
      for many years. It’s very much like Operation Gladio that the CIA organized in
      Italy to isolate any real left-wingers from the political scene and replace them
      with a kind of zombie-like pro-American smoothies, politicians who could use the
      right rhetoric, sort of someone like Obama, who could speak as if he’s in favor
      of democracy and actually in practice supporting his elite class, the neoliberal
      class, and the banking class. So there’s been this “poisoning the swamp” for the
      last 50 years or so, maybe 75 years, I guess you could say, in international politics,
      mainly by the United States, and now also funded by other groups: Germany, England,
      and France. That’s really what we’re seeing. And the political spectrum is no
      longer right and left in the sense that it used to be in  the early 20th century
      and late 19th century. The terms left and right have no more meaning now that
      the left has been more neoliberal than the conservatives. And Tony Blair was to
      the right of Margaret Thatcher and did things that Thatcher never could have done,
      like privatizing the railways, privatizing things that would have been unthinkable
      and could only have been done by a nominally Labor Party or nominally Social Democratic
      Party, sort of like Nixon goes to China. Only somebody who’d been using the rhetoric
      of their party that all of its  history  was opposing privatization and kleptocracy
      and rent-seeking could actually come out and say, well, we’re going to promote
      it all. Hey we’ve been able to capture their voters and convince their voters
      to “look at what we say we’re going to do instead of what we’re actually trying
      to do.” You have the media as part of this system, and what Trump has said was,
      well, a lot of the National Endowment for Democracy money has gone to the media.
      I think he mentioned a number of press services like Reuters; that’s been getting
      money and various other media. I guess that must mean the New York Times, the
      Washington Post, or the papers throughout Europe that used to be considered left-wing
      papers like The Guardian are now neocons, at least when it comes to Russia. So
      you’re having a combination of politics, the media, and even economic theory,
      academic economics. There’s nowhere [in the media] where we can put the kinds
      of things that we’ve been discussing on Patreon and that I’ve been writing about
      and doing my interviews about. There’s no way that you can get this kind of discussion
      into the public press, at least the main public press. And you’re not going to
      get them into universities either right now. So, the question is, how are people
      even going to know that there is an alternative? The whole idea of the right-wing,
      the neoliberals, and the libertarians is there is no alternative. And if they
      can somehow repress any knowledge that  there used to be an alternative, and there
      is an alternative, if they can marginalize that and isolate it, then you’ve got
      enough of the population to make it quiescent and willing to go along with whatever
      you’ve planned for it. KARL FITZGERALD: Patty Lynn asks, “What are your thoughts
      on the recent one-day boycott? Do you recommend labor strikes instead? Do you
      think financialization and outsourced labor make our collective power to strike
      less effective?” MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, that just means you’re going to buy your
      groceries tomorrow. I mean, if it’s buying, that’s pretty not focused. There’s
      used to be a phrase: he who underlines everything, underlines nothing. And I guess
      we don’t go shopping every day. I don’t think we went to the store today. Were
      we part of a boycott? Not consciously, but we don’t need to shop every day. Sure,
      we can; there are days of the week that we shop more. So I’m not sure what the
      boycott really means. A boycott means it’s not one day. You target a given objective
      and that’s what you target. It’s not a one-day thing. So I’m not impressed with
      a one-day boycott. There has to be a particular thing that you’re boycotting that
      is longer than 24 hours. KARL FITZGERALD: Virginia, our host here from the Real
      Progressives, asked, Michael, if you can clarify, the federal government doesn’t
      really need income tax or borrowing, at least not in the US, UK, Australia, Japan.
      Can you answer that from an MMT perspective? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, every government
      needs taxes because that’s what gives money. When government prints money, how
      does it give value to money? Well, ever since the third millennium in Mesopotamia
      and Egypt, the government gives money value and gives value to whatever it designates
      as money, whether it’s silver or grain or gold or paper currency. It accepts this
      money in payment for taxes so that there’s always a use for it. Otherwise, you
      just print it and it’s out there. And what do you do with it? I think  Hyman Minsky
      said anybody can print money. The problem is, how do you get it accepted? Well,
      general purpose money that is used for anything is money; ultimately, that can
      be spent on services from the government or paying taxes from the government.
      Now, of course, there are other kinds of money. Look in the 16th and 17th centuries,
      banks used letters of credit. And while government bonds and other government
      debt were selling at a discount, the mercantile claims on each other, financing
      imports and exports (it used to be called the real bills doctrine), that could
      be money, but it was only used by merchants. So governments need to tax. I think
      what Virginia meant to say is governments do not need to borrow to finance their
      budget deficits. They can finance their government deficits by doing what banks
      do and creating money. The difference is that banks create money by lending it
      into the economy, and the government creates money by spending it into the economy
      on goods and services. And that spending it into the economy adds to economic
      activity. Whereas when banks create money by making a loan, then that creates
      debt on which interest is charged. And gradually this growing debt and its carrying
      charges eat into the economy, siphoning off more and more revenue from being spent
      within the economy. And that’s why the government’s money creation is so much
      more productive than commercial bank money creation. I think that’s basically
      the difference. VIRGINIA COTTS:  Is there, may I just intervene? Because earlier
      you were talking about income tax and supporting services like social security,  l,
      like the post office, I think you used as an example. And I just want to clarify
      that at least since we’ve been off the gold standard, the government hasn’t needed
      to tax for those things. Taxes serve the purpose that you were just talking about,
      driving the value of the currency and the need for the currency. MICHAEL HUDSON:
      I mean, so the question then is: what’s going to give money, give value to money
      once Trump says, well, we won’t have an income tax anymore, or we’ll only tax
      the bottom 50% of the American population, not the top 50% or whatever. Can you
      say that, well, the value of money is going to be being used to pay tariffs to
      import the goods and services that we need? I guess you could say that in part,
      but basically, the ideal [in Trump’s policy] is not to have government money at
      all. The money that will be created, will be created entirely by Wall Street and
      by commercial banks. And that money will be essentially taking the form of loans,
      collateralized by real property, like a house or commercial property or a stock
      in a bond, something that the banks would like to foreclose upon. So that’s essentially
      the kind of money that the Trump administration wants. You had this argument after
      the Civil War. You had governments blocking governments, you had the British government
      forbidding the American colonies in the 18th century from printing their own money.
      And the idea was if you don’t let the colonies print money, they’ll have to get
      money in the form of coinage or loans from the British creditors that come over.
      The bankers wanted to keep the economy reliant on having to go to them for the
      money. Same thing in the early 19th century, President Jackson and his vice president
      Van Buren declared war on the Bank of the United States, saying we don’t want
      a moneyed oligarchy to develop. Well, Van Buren called the moneyed interest and
      essentially wanted to get rid of them. And the great quantum leap, way beyond
      what the American colonies did, was the Civil War. And in the Civil War, the American
      government did what the European governments had to do in World War I. It had
      to print the money in order to provide the economy with enough circulating medium
      to fight the war and defeat the South and hold the Union together. Well, it was
      pretty widely understood and agreed with. This was an emergency condition because
      it was a war condition, and there wasn’t enough gold and silver around to finance
      the war. And in fact, there wasn’t enough private credit to finance the war. But
      when the war was over, the bankers said, well, now you’ve got to go back to gold,
      not only go back to gold standard as a means of backing for the money, but you’ve
      got to go back to gold at the old pre-war price. You’ve got to reduce wages and
      prices to a fraction of what they are now so that we creditors, who have debt
      claims on borrowers, the money that we’ve lent will have the same power over labor
      and goods and services that we had before the war. Well, that led to three decades
      of arguments saying, well, the bankers are our enemies. There was the whole fight
      over the deflation that was forced by the bankers, convincing the government that
      the real money can only be either bullion, silver, and gold that was a pure asset
      with no debt, or bank credit. Well, you ended up with Williams Jennings Bryan
      saying, well, this is crucifying the farmers and the rest of the population on
      a cross of gold. And there was a real fight. The banks became very worried about
      this because you had monetary reformers and socialists saying, “Why don’t we make
      money in banking a public utility? Why don’t we socialize money and have the government
      print it? If banks can create money just by printing it, why can’t the government
      create money by printing it?” And the fact that America was so successful during
      the Civil War and being able to print its own money, the greenbacks, to finance
      it all, sent shivers of fear throughout the banking class. And right after the
      1907 crash in the United States, the wealthiest bankers, J.P. Morgan and his crowd,
      got together and said, we’ve got to take all the power away from the Treasury
      Department. We’ve got to take it away from Washington. We’ve got to make sure
      that there’s never going to be the public and Congress and voters in charge of
      what money will be created for and what it will be spent on. So they designed
      the Federal Reserve. And the Federal Reserve took monetary policy and money creation
      out of the hands of Washington and put it in the hands of the money centers, mainly
      New York City, but also Boston, Philadelphia, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
      there. And there was not even a government official, such as the Secretary of
      the Treasury, on the board of the Federal Reserve. It was completely privatized.
      This is, I think, part of the utopian Gilded Age that Donald Trump is hoping to
      make America great again to restore. So you’ve had this argument over what kind
      of money are you going to have? Is it going to be just hard money, gold and silver
      coinage? Is it going to be bank money created by creating debt and lending it
      out? Or is it going to be government money spent? These are the three kinds of
      money, and each of these three kinds of money benefits a particular part of the
      population. Coinage and bank money benefit the creditor class. Government money
      benefits labor and industry, which is the indebted economy at large. So I think
      you should look at when people talk about what kind of money are you going to
      have. Well, you should always ask who benefits? Is it the creditor class or the
      debtors of the economy at large? KARL FITZGERALD: Thank you, Michael. Feels like
      there was a bit of an insight into your upcoming new book there. Yeah, beautiful.
      Virginia responded: seize the means of production of money. And Andre asks, in
      Canada, they are parachuting Mark Carney, a U.S. banker, on us, a greenbacker,
      banker. What is he going to get us to accept to put us more into debt? He’s really
      worried. MICHAEL HUDSON: I’m not aware of what’s happening in Canada. The Bank
      of Canada used to be great back in the 50s and 60s, but that was a different epoch.
      That was before the Liberals took over. So I don’t know what’s happening these
      days in Canada. But once it comes to 51st state, of course, I’ll follow it. KARL
      FITZGERALD: Michelle asks, Michael, first, thanks so much for continuing to educate
      people and taking your time to help us understand how it all really works. You
      stated the difference between commercial banks and savings banks, and you further
      stated this would decentralize power and help small business. Can you be explicit
      at how this helps small business? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, most people think of banking
      as what savings banks do. Savings banks, and I used to be the economist for the
      central bank for the savings banks, a commercial bank. So I worked with them for
      years. The savings banks can only lend out money that they have on deposits. And
      they used to be, like savings and loans, required by law to limit what they could
      lend out. And it was mainly real estate. So their loans were to real estate, initially,
      mainly to small families. That’s why, in New York, if you look at who, what were
      the big savings banks? The Bowery Savings Bank, the Immigrants Savings Bank, and
      the Dime Savings Bank. These were savings for small depositors. And the idea was
      that small depositors would make interest there, and the interest would mount
      up, and the banks would have more money to lend out for mortgages to the class
      of people who were their depositors. Well, by the time I joined the savings banks
      trust company in 1962, the bankers had already sort of forgotten their social
      obligation of savings banks, and they just wanted to make as much money as they
      could. Their thinking was: we can make more money lending to Florida than lending
      to New York State. So let us lend to other states. We don’t want to lend to our
      depositors. We want to lend to whoever gives us the most money. And then they
      said, we want to lend to commercial developers also. And they did. Then finally,
      under, I think it was under Alan Greenspan, after the savings and loan crisis,
      the commercial banks came up and said, well, let’s give the banks more money to
      lend. Let us merge and buy them out. And so the commercial banks bought the savings
      banks and emptied out all of the consumer savings that was supposed to be the
      capital stock. They’re like the securities, the stock that the depositors had,
      and they gave them to themselves. And then they, being commercial banks, didn’t
      have to be limited to how much their deposits were because, as a commercial banker,
      somebody could go into the bank and say, you know, can we make a loan to buy another
      company or to buy an office building or whatever. They could just create the money
      and say, okay, sign this. We’ll credit you with a deposit. So you’ll have the
      deposit and we’ll have your IOU. I suspect what Virginia was asking, what the
      question we just talked about wasn’t about savings banks, it was about community
      banks. And community banks functioned like commercial banks. I was also a consultant
      to one of the community banks in Chicago. And they were supposed to give loans
      to bankers in their neighborhood or community, however you described it, whether
      it was a geographic community or however you define the community. But I went
      to Chicago, I think this must have been just before the 2008 crisis. And the bank
      president said, “Well, you know, we have a real problem. We have to make money
      for our stockholders. And we’re making money in the same way that the commercial
      banks are making money, recklessly. We’re making reckless real estate deals for
      operators to come in, and buy an apartment building.” You try to kick out everybody.
      You turn an apartment building into condominiums. An apartment building, say it’s
      a million-dollar building. You take out a million-dollar mortgage so you don’t
      have a penny of your own money in this. You’ve got a building completely with
      bank money, and then you say, “Okay, we’re going to sell you the apartments, and
      the price we’re going to charge for the apartment is another million dollars capitalized.”
      People bought these condominiums and co-ops that were financialized in this way.
      The community banks, as well as the other banks, ended up making hundreds of millions
      of dollars for real estate operators like that. And that was the whole co-op and
      condominium scam that happened here. And so, everybody can say they’re part of
      the community, but the real community is a community of people who want to get
      rich quick at other people’s expense. KARL FITZGERALD: Brutal, but true. Rezwan
      asks a great question that kind of brings us into the campaign front that Patty
      was hinting at before. How can we actually arrest this change that’s going on
      in society? So, Rezwan says: “So, how to get money, the money distinction conversation
      in the press, taking some inspiration from Grover Norquist and his mission to
      get every politician to sign a pledge not to raise marginal income tax rates.
      The pledge was just a vehicle to spark public conversation. It was also a handy
      way for him to raise money through an NGO creating funding and awareness. So,
      his question is: Could we try a parallel pledge except instead of government tax,
      it would target private rent-seeking and make the connection that is a sort of
      tax on everyone? The goal here is to start a conversation that has a clear conceptual
      connection to what Grover has done to help people see rent-seeking as a sort of
      tax, but worse because you don’t even get any services back for that. And to quantify
      it, the goal is simplicity, anchoring, and repetition to get a concept out there.
      Part of a set of parallel strategies to project 2025, Heritage et al. that both
      shine a light on their strategy and also instantly connect it to conceptual alternatives.
      I’d love to brainstorm with folks on this.” Yes, well, Reswen, so would I. That’s
      a really important sort of campaigning prop you’ve put forward there, Michael.
      How does that stretch your thinking? MICHAEL HUDSON: You need a time machine to
      do that. You need to go back to the 19th century, the 1880s, and 1890s. Everybody
      was talking about this at that time. That was the entire classical economic school,
      from the French physiocrats in the 18th century through Adam Smith, Ricardo, John
      Stuart Mill, Marx, Henry George in America, and the entire classical economics.
      Value theory was all about:  we want to distinguish between value, which is the
      actual cost of producing something, and the price of something. And that excess
      price, market price, over intrinsic cost value is economic rent. Everybody knew
      what this was, and that was a political issue at the time. But there was a counter-revolution.
      The landlords and the banking class that ended up collecting most of the rent
      in the form of mortgage interest fought back and said there’s no such thing as
      economic rent. This was the anti-classical theory that Veblen sort of confusingly
      called the neoclassical theory, meaning the new theory that’s replaced classical
      economics. It said there’s no such thing as economic rent. Everybody makes what
      they earn. And if there’s a price, it’s because people have decided to pay it.
      They get utility out of whatever they’re paying. And so there’s no such thing
      as rent, no such thing as unearned income, no such thing as unearned wealth. And
      so that whole concept has disappeared not only from public discussion, but from
      the economic curriculum. And at least when I went to school for my PhD in the
      1960s, there was still a course in the history of economic thought. It was a core
      course, everybody had to take it. There are no such courses being taught now.
      It’s just mathematics. Well, how do you mathematize the sort of trivia that the
      economic tunnel vision has become? So people are not aware of the fact that there
      is such a thing as economic rent that does not have to be charged. The original
      idea, again from Adam Smith, the idea of a free market for the classical economists
      was a market free from economic rent, where you take natural monopolies into the
      public domain so that there won’t be an opportunity to get monopoly rent. You
      have a land tax bringing money into the government so that as the site value of
      land rises, as economies get wealthier and have more and better transportation
      and parks and museums and schools, the government gets paid back instead of going
      deeper into debt. And, of course, the desirability of having a home is the badge
      of being a member of the middle class, which is why the middle class in America
      was white, not black, because blacks were not able to get mortgages and were not
      able to get homes of their own normally. The middle class was basically a white
      and very racist concept. Well, everybody back then discussed this. So, how are
      you going to get this into the curriculum? Well, that’s basically what I’m trying
      to do in my writing. I’m a classical economist. I use value and price theory to
      isolate economic rent and to say what you think is a product of gross national
      product, it’s not when a landlord charges more. That rent is not a product. That’s
      a transfer payment from the renter to the owner. When a bank raises its interest
      rate charge to credit card users or to its borrowers, that payment of interest
      and late fees, which are larger than interest, that’s not a product. That’s a
      transfer payment from the economy. And there are monopoly rents from the private
      capital, privatizing a government agency and then taking an agency that was providing
      a basic need and saying, ah, if it’s a basic need, then we’ve got them by the
      throat and we can charge whatever the market will bear. That’s economic rent.
      But it’s not really a product. Instead of the Trump Administration’s Commerce
      Secretary saying, ‘let’s get the government out of GDP’, I’m trying to advocate,
      let’s get the economic rent out of GDP. Well, in order to popularize this idea,
      you’d need a whole staff of statisticians and accountants to recalculate the GDP.
      And you can make a first approximation pretty easily from the national income
      and product accounts. You’ll take interest, you’ll take rent, and you’ll estimate
      some form of monopoly rent. You can do it by looking at the prices of the big
      internet and the Silicon Valley companies. These are all monopoly rent companies,
      Google and the other high-tech companies are that. It used to take me a year to
      make a table like that. It took me a year to do just the balance of payments of
      the oil industry back in 1965. It took me a year to do just the balance of payments
      of the United States back in 1968 and 9. And I’m spending all my time now explaining
      how the economy works. I’m not doing accounting anymore. I’ve done the accounting,
      which was explained to me, by taking the numbers apart. That’s how I found out
      how the economy works. And that’s something that’s not taught in school. The only
      way of learning it is to actually do it, and you need someone to employ you to
      do it. Well, I had banks employing me to do it once when banks used to do their
      own research. And I had Arthur Anderson do it before it was sent to jail for being
      a criminal enterprise and closed down. They had accounting people do it, but nobody,
      there’s no non-governmental organization or foundation like the institutes that
      Karl mentioned earlier that are at all interested in financing this kind of research.
      So all I can do is explain the basic principle and suggest that you study the
      history of economic thought, and it’s all clear there. Marx wrote a wonderful
      history of economic thought all about rent theory in volumes 2 and 3 of Capital.
      And this first economic history of economic thought was actually by Marx, his
      theories of surplus value, which compared profit, rent, wages, and basically the
      returns to the various classes of society. So, all of that’s been written. There’s
      no need for me to write it again because if they’re not reading it in the original,
      why would they want to read it in my re-explanation? So, there’s just not a critical
      mass that is able to put this on the spectrum. I can’t even find a critical mass
      to do this in China or Russia. KARL FITZGERALD: We should almost have a competition
      for the most frivolous NGO pulling in a million dollars in donations a year because
      that’s basically what we need: Michael mentoring a school of economists who can
      produce yearly reports. And then we have some heavy-hitting media professionals
      and some PR people writing up press releases highlighting the research, making
      news regularly. And yeah, we start pushing politicians to come out and talk about
      rent-seeking, particularly in marginal seats. We hold public forums there, and
      Michael speaks, asks the politicians their stance on the various privatizations
      going on in that community. Then we create some political pressure, but there
      just isn’t the sort of economic campaigning now that’s around. Yeah, we’ve got
      the American Liberties Project doing good things. There are a few in that sort
      of anti-monopoly space, Matt Stoller, of course, but you know, it would be great
      to see a real campaign focus coming through on the economic front. The left does
      so well in health and education, but that sort of papers over the neoliberal hawks
      within their organizations, and that’s what is so frustrating. It would be good
      to have some people come up on screen. Karl Sanchez? A number of people are talking
      about tariffs. Can you give us the insights on your PhD that focused on the early
      use of tariffs and how it can help domestic economies grow? Can you give us, play
      the devil’s advocate? Is there some sense in the tariff agenda? MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Well, we know that every major industrial country of the world, starting with
      England under mercantilism, and then going to the United States, Germany, even
      France, developed their industry by subsidizing it and protecting it with tariffs.
      And tariffs were not only to promote industry. The most successful application
      of tariffs of all was in the United States in the 1930s. President Roosevelt’s
      Agricultural Adjustment Act that had parity pricing that supported the price of
      farm products high enough so that the farmers could afford to mechanize their
      production, to buy better seed, better seeds, to develop marketing systems, and
      to really develop a whole infrastructure of agriculture. And that made the United
      States, as I think I’ve said before, productivity in American agriculture exceeded
      that of any other industry. Same thing with the common agricultural policy in
      Europe. That’s what turned Europe from a food importer to a food exporter. And
      I guess you have the equivalent of that in Russia, not deliberately protecting
      its agriculture, but because the West has done it a favor in saying, look, we
      really want you Russians to develop in the way that we did in America and Europe.
      But since you don’t have any economists who are familiar with how we develop,
      we’re just going to put sanctions on you, and that’s going to force you to produce
      your own agriculture. And the farmers, obviously, if they’re going to do farming
      and produce crops, they have to cover their cost of production and they have to
      get credit to mechanize and to organize their farms. So you’ve seen Russia do
      the same thing. Well, Trump pretends that this protective tariff can be any kind
      of tariff. And the whole idea of tariff policy, from Ricardo through all of the
      free market economists and protectionists of the 19th century, said, well, how
      is England going to get rich? Ricardo said, it’s going to be, we want to get rich,
      by industry. We want other countries to buy our industrial manufactures. But we’re
      a small island. In order to make these manufactures, we have to import food to
      feed our employees. And we don’t want to have to depend on British landlords to
      produce the foods because it costs much more to produce food in Little Britain
      than it does in the United States and Canada and other countries. So, the key
      to becoming an industrial power is to import raw materials, not only food, which
      was the main example that Ricardo used, but raw materials, iron, and steel, copper.
      We want to import the raw materials out of which manufacturers are made and then
      take all of our profit in the value added or rent added for the industrial products
      that we make out of this steel and copper and the other materials that we import.
      Well, Trump turns all of this inside out. He says, tariffs were wonderful back
      with McKinley, but he doesn’t realize that he’s taxing everything that McKinley
      and his advisors (and I wrote my book on this, America’s Protectionist Takeoff
      ), were against taxing; they said, “We don’t want to tax raw materials. We don’t
      want to try to compete with other countries to produce raw materials. We want
      to do what England did. We want their raw materials at a low price, and we want
      to protect our manufacturers to sell superior machinery and cars and all of the
      industrial products that made America the leading industrial country in the world
      by the end of World War I.” Well, Trump doesn’t realize that when you increase
      the tariffs, as he just did specifically, on steel and on copper and on aluminum,
      that means everyone who makes aluminum cans to drink beer out of, that’s going
      to go up. So the price of beer is going to go up in America because, in order
      to sell beer, you have to have it in an aluminum can. Cooking utensils, anything
      made out of steel, is going to go up because the raw material price that now has
      to pay a tariff to be imported is going to be passed on all along the line, as
      it’s made into a higher and more complex set of manufacturers. If you’re going
      to charge for copper, then that’s going to increase the cost of copper wiring.
      And of course, there goes the cost of electrifying a house or electrifying everything
      else. Trump had the idea that somehow other countries are going to have to pay
      the tariff:  We can impose a tariff. It’ll make the American treasury so rich
      that we won’t have to tax rich people anymore. And other countries are going to
      pay for it all. So it’s like we’re just grabbing them with rent-seeking. But there’s
      a common price for steel and copper and aluminum all over the world. And wherever
      you buy it, you’re going to have to buy it in a commodities market. And it’s going
      to be the importer that pays the price for that. Same thing with agricultural
      products, same things with all of the things that Trump is concentrating his tariffs
      on, like automobile parts from Canada and Mexico, the various parts that are put
      together when the cars are actually all made into a single unit in Detroit, all
      come from Mexico and from Canada right across the bridge in Windsor. And so, obviously,
      if these foreign offshoring companies that are owned by the car companies themselves,
      they’re going to have to, the car companies are going to have to pay the tariffs,
      and that’s going to increase the price of the car. The estimate is between $3,000
      and $10,000 per car for Americans. This is not how to make American cars competitive
      in the world. And Trump thinks that somehow these tariffs are going to enable
      Volkswagen and Mercedes and other British car companies to relocate to America,
      but the prices are going to be much higher here because of the kind of tariff
      that he’s putting on. So it’s really crazy. And Trump said tariffs that he’s proposing
      will yield trillions of dollars. Well, trillions of dollars. I mean, just think
      of what that is. It’s like it’s almost as big as half the GDP. And so if you can
      imagine, if half the GDP is paid in tariffs by consumers, prices are going to
      go up, what, three or four times. You know, you’re going to have $10 an egg, not
      $1 an egg, I guess, the equivalent. It’s absolutely crazy. KARL FITZGERALD: But
      is that the plan, Michael, to actually crash the economy so that, with his hands
      all over the controls, he can direct fire sales towards his crony capitalists?
      MICHAEL HUDSON: There’s no indication that that’s the plan. I don’t see how you’re
      going to really benefit by crashing the economy. I think Trump is really like
      an eighth grader who is given a set of vocabulary words and doesn’t look at what
      the vocabulary means and doesn’t have a sense of history. None of the politicians
      (and even the economic academic advisors around them haven’t really studied history)
      know anything; all they have is a vocabulary, and it’s like studying the history
      of magic or astrology, with just not really knowing what these magical words mean
      and, you know, what everything is, except just slogans that you can put on. So
      it’s somehow in their mind; all they have are slogans without any context and
      any concept of empirical experience. All this is theory. It’s as if the whole
      policymaking system is autistic. Just everything is abstract and just some postmodern,
      I guess you’d say, a set of words. That’s the problem. KARL FITZGERALD: And when
      he faced such embarrassment at the Detroit Economic Club and I think the New York
      Economic Club, he was absolutely pasted there over tariffs, but he still stuck
      to it. Matt Connors asked, what is your understanding of why Trump delayed implementation
      of tariffs on Mexico and Canada until April? Did the automobile industry speak
      up? Or was it big agriculture? MICHAEL HUDSON: Yeah, big auto said we’re going
      to go broke. So then Trump said, okay, tell you what, we don’t want you to go
      broke. We’ll postpone the tariff for one month. You have one month to build a
      whole set of factories in the United States. The factories that you have in Mexico
      and Canada, you have one month to build a whole set of factories here. Well, it
      takes three or four years to build a factory, not to mention getting the local
      zoning approval for them. So somehow there’s no sense of time. There’s no sense
      of systems analysis. There’s no sense of how you put together a… how long is all
      this going to be when you actually plot out what has to be done to make a factory
      to produce the automobile parts that are now being made in Windsor, Canada, or
      south of the border in Mexico. KARL FITZGERALD: Okay, Karl Sanchez has joined
      us. Over to you two. KARL SANCHEZ: Hey Michael, how are you doing? MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Pretty good. KARL SANCHEZ: Your show this morning with Richard was really good.
      I enjoyed it very much as usual. I do have a question for you here. We talked
      about the tariffs already, that was one of them. But what I’m getting at here
      is the Airds 2025 gig and its effect on state governments. Trump controls the
      federal government, but he doesn’t have any control at all over the 50 other state
      governments. And all those governments will need to have money. They all have
      taxes to be paid, and so on and so forth. They have their own institutions. So
      what’s going to happen to the federalist system with this Heritage 2025 thing?
      I see it breaking the federalist system into three different sectors. You have
      the state and locals together, then you have the federal off by itself. So there’s
      no more three-tiered federalist system. MICHAEL HUDSON: This is a problem all
      over the world, not only in the United States, but in China. That’s exactly the
      problem in China, where China says to the localities, well, if you want to finance
      your public services, sell more land to the developers. Well, so they kept selling
      the land. Then China, the bank, would give money to the developers or to a bank
      that would give money to the developers to make more real estate from this land.
      All of this real estate bubble was simply to enable the localities and provinces
      to be able to finance their own budgets. Sometimes it’s easier to understand a
      phenomenon like that when you can see it in a foreign country than to see it in
      your own country. But this is exactly the problem in the United States now. There
      used to be revenue sharing between the federal governments and the state and local
      governments. And now, as you just pointed out, the local governments and states
      are broke. What are they going to do? Well, there are two ways they can finance
      their budgets. They can have an income tax, but if you have an income tax, then
      people who make high incomes tend to move out of state. So they have a real estate
      tax.  This increases the real estate tax by states and localities. I pay a New
      York State real estate tax and New York City real estate tax together, and they’re
      going up quite rapidly and not efficiently. There’s a lot of theft by – I’m in
      a condominium, and the condominium company just pockets a lot of the subsidies
      for these taxes. It’s just a disaster here. The problems that the states and cities
      are having in financing their budgets are driving the population out of their
      states and cities. I guess, in New York City, you’d say this has the highest real
      estate tax of any all-around. Well, there’s an enormous homeless problem here.
      So you have homelessness and high real estate taxes that means it has to be factored
      into either the cost of rent to the landlords or to the homeowner. You’re having
      housing become unaffordable as a result of the fact that the real estate tax and
      income tax should be federal, not state and local, and the federal should redistribute
      this tax revenue to the states and localities, not only in America, but in China
      and every other country. So you’re having the constitutional structure of countries
      that were drawn up many years ago in a different kind of economic world, having
      the exact problem that you’re pointing to. And no one’s really saying, well, the
      solution is you federalize it and recycle the tax to the localities so that you’re
      not going to have a war where states keep slashing their income tax to compete
      with other states and cities. There’s a race to the bottom in the United States
      now among the cities and localities. And that race to the bottom makes states
      and cities unlivable. Nobody’s saying, well, gee, the solution is  bigger, more
      federal government. But the fact is, that’s the only way to avoid this kind of
      a race to the bottom that you’re having. KARL SANCHEZ: What if the states were
      to go ahead and make their own money? MICHAEL HUDSON: No state’s making its own
      money because you can have a state bank like North Dakota, South Dakota, but you
      can’t make this money spent elsewhere in the United States. So money creation
      has to be a national, federal creation, not a local creation. That’s part of the
      problem. KARL SANCHEZ: Well, if you have the state making its own money, that
      would be able to go ahead and pay the taxes of that state. So it would be localized
      to the state. And it would be a magnitude for that. MICHAEL HUDSON: In principle,
      you’re right, but I guess that would work in the colonial era in the 1770s and
      1760s in Massachusetts. But the magnitudes at work wouldn’t really work for that.
      I know Ellen Brown has tried to say, well, look, at least we can have the state
      have its own banks instead of a commercial bank. They can make their own loans
      to their own population and to the government. We’ll take our bank, we’ll pay
      the people to deposit there, and we’ll lend that money to the government so we
      don’t have to borrow it from outsiders. And that certainly is a help, but it’s
      not sufficient in itself. KARL SANCHEZ: Well, I was thinking about ways to try
      and combat the Heritage Foundation’s plan here, their plot, which I’ve characterized
      as a leveraged buyout. MICHAEL HUDSON: That’s exactly what it is. Well, we, of
      course, have the Koch brothers financing them. All these foundations are funded
      by right-wing billionaires like the Koch brothers, or, I guess, by Silicon Valley
      now jumping onto the bandwagon. And you and I don’t have billions to do that.
      And we don’t even have the resources to put together a whole team to work on the
      projects that we write about. All we can do is write about the principles that
      work, but can’t work out the actual legal bit. And we can’t get candidates elected.
      Dennis Kucinich was running for many years on the Chicago plan, essentially to
      have the government print its own money instead of relying on the commercial banks
      and the various donor class members and the Democratic Party re-gerrymandered
      his position to get him out in favor of the neocon Marcy Kaptur to get in. So
      any politician drawing something like that finds himself or herself isolated politically
      because there’s no political party that is an umbrella organization for people
      supporting this kind of idea. KARL SANCHEZ: So what do you think might act as
      a poison pill for this plan? MICHAEL HUDSON: I wish I knew. Can you think of one?
      KARL SANCHEZ: Well, that’s why I asked you. MICHAEL HUDSON: Ha! The plan itself
      is poison. So how do you poison a poison pill? KARL SANCHEZ: I look at it and
      I see, well, the only thing I can see is you’re going to have, we’ve talked about
      what Ukraine looks like economically, not just the war-tornness. Then there’s
      the 90s of Russia and what happened to that economy and their social structure
      when it got crashed. So I’m thinking that you’re just going to see something like
      early 1930s America. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you would think that a crisis provides
      a nurturing environment for a solution to be voiced. But the solution can be voiced,
      but now you have a whole organized political phalanx, an oligarchy arrayed against
      such a voice to make sure that it’s isolated, to misrepresent what it’s taken,
      and to prevent it from getting access on the mass media, the respectable newspapers
      and television channels. So again, it’s happening much easier in the global majority
      countries to discuss it than it is in the West. KARL SANCHEZ: Yeah, our marginalization
      has been pretty complete, unfortunately. KARL FITZGERALD: Can I jump in? If we’re
      ever to really arrest what’s going on, we have to split the right wing. We have
      to get small business to recognize what is going on. A lot of good people are
      in small business, and we know they’ve been crushed through globalization over
      the last 30-odd years. So that’s where it starts and getting those classical liberals
      who understand the difference between price and value to really start to speak
      up. And the problem is, no one’s providing them with any data. We need reports
      coming out that highlight how much this rent-seeking is hurting society. And so
      that’s why it’s so crucial we find a million bucks for Michael and his team of
      economic hitmen to really start peeling back to provide the chambers of commerce
      in local communities with the sort of information that is so crucial at this point
      in time. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you’d think people used to be able to go to the
      government and get grants for this. You’d think there are so many foundations
      that are trying to do good work. But if the foundations are funded mainly by the
      billionaires, I don’t think the billionaires are interested in supporting the
      kind of work that we’re doing. And the small businesses, indeed, there may be
      some, I just don’t know of any. I mean, we’re there. All we can do is throw our
      bread upon the water. If there’s somebody out there that responds and thinks,
      well, gee, I just inherited a few million dollars. Maybe I’ll give them. That’s
      how Paul J. began now, the Real News. Somebody inherited money, and I’ll just
      give him money to start the real news in Baltimore. Maybe it’ll happen. Maybe
      there is a small businessman like that. I don’t know. It’s got to be a lot of
      people. I have a site, Karl has a site, you have a site, and other people here
      have sites. But all we can do is say what we’re saying on our sites. KARL FITZGERALD:
      Okay. You’ve got to wrap up soon. Okay. So Flo has a hand up. Come on in, Flo.
      FLO SCHADE: Sure. Hi, everyone. So to take a little different turn, I guess, really
      great discussion today. Talking about alternatives, back to that, you know, there
      is no alternative in our systems and stuff here. It got me thinking, you know,
      this whole Doge situation, fiasco, we have some folks on the right kind of fear-mongering
      about all this instability is going to lead to a collapse of U.S. bond sales and
      treasuries. Some people have been saying that. I know, obviously, the stock market’s
      super volatile right now. It got me thinking, on the other hand, you know, we
      have leftists, at least in the MMT world, that have been arguing that, you know,
      bond sales are unnecessary. It’s essentially a UBI to the 1%. And so you try to
      put those kinds of things together. And I’ve never really thought through what
      would happen if, let’s say, theoretically a new government came in and stopped
      selling bonds tomorrow, kind of what effect that would have, given that, you know,
      it is so embroiled in our global economy. And is there a way to actually move
      away from it? Or is it going to be like a class war bloodbath either way? Or any
      kind of thoughts on the role of bond sales in our economy and how we could potentially
      think about or theorize an alternative system, like moving there from where we
      are today? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, every economy works on credit, and I don’t know
      how you can avoid people raising money by bonds. The problem is that a lot of
      bonds are issued not for productive purposes at all, but for stock buybacks or
      for corporate takeovers, the junk bonds. Most bond issues are not invested productively.
      FLO SCHADE: So it’s treasury bonds specifically. I guess, sorry, I should have
      specified, like selling treasury bonds to raise revenue for the U.S. government,
      right? That model of financial. MICHAEL HUDSON: No, if you raise treasury bonds,
      then you have to pay interest to bondholders. FLO SCHADE: Well, what would happen
      if the U.S. government stopped doing that? MICHAEL HUDSON: You don’t have to borrow
      from rich people. If you borrow from rich people, you’ll have the money, and then
      you’ll print your own money. What do you need the bondholders for? You can just
      print the money. FLO SCHADE: What do you think the effect on the economy would
      be if that happens? MICHAEL HUDSON: What’s – less interest charge? FLO SCHADE:
      That’s it? Like, you would be fine, aside from you think, like, the political.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes. FLO SCHADE: Okay. Yes. That is good to know. So it’s going
      to be a class war. MICHAEL HUDSON: Money in banking should be a public utility.
      It should be a basic right in a way. It should not be privatized. The privatization
      of money in banking is what creates financial oligarchies. And if you don’t want
      a financial oligarchy, you create money without interest. Very simple. That again
      was Dennis Kucinich’s Chicago plan. FLO SCHADE: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I assume
      there would be a big effect on markets and, you know, arbitrage or the foreign
      exchange markets or no, or would that go haywire, you think? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well,
      it’s very hard to create money that can be spent abroad. That’s the problem. You
      can always create money to spend in your own economy, but you can’t create the
      money that will be accepted by Germans and Europeans and other foreigners. That’s
      the constraint. So that you don’t want to create so much money that it ends up
      in a balance of payments deficit that lowers the exchange rate. FLO SCHADE: Okay,
      thanks, Michael. KARL FITZGERALD: All right, so it sounds like, Michael, we need
      to wrap up pretty soon. Is that right? Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks, everyone, for
      another deep dive into Michael’s incredible intellectual archive. You have some
      great questions, and let’s hope we can find that unicorn out there that can bring
      some of us together to work on Michael’s great work and really start campaigning
      for a fairer future because it’s not looking good from down here in Australia.
      And we really feel for all of you Americans going through this. Yeah, just horrific
      what is coming through. But great to at least understand why this is happening
      thanks to Michael’s great work. So I appreciate everyone’s support through Patreon
      and we will look forward to being with you, I think, June 5th or 6th, somewhere
      around there. So thanks once again, and we’ll see you soon. MICHAEL HUDSON: Thanks
      for coming. Thanks for being on part of my Patreon list. That keeps me going.

      to benefit the financial elite rather than the public. Hudson emphasizes that
      many government enterprises serve as natural monopolies, which historically provided
      essential services like healthcare and education for free, and warns against the
      dangers of transferring these public assets into private hands for profit.

      Transcript


      Introduction


      BEN NORTON: Why is the United States so concerned about Iran?


      US President Donald Trump admitted that what Washington wants is regime change
      in Tehran, to overthrow the Iranian government.


      Trump backed a war on Iran in June, in which both the US and Israel directly bombed
      Iranian territory.


      Trump claimed that he brokered a ceasefire after what he calls the 12 Day War
      that the US and Israel waged against Iran. But it’s very difficult to believe
      that this ceasefire will hold.


      Especially considering that Trump said the same in January. He claimed to broker
      a ceasefire in Gaza, but then in March, two months later, Israel started the war
      again, after Trump had given Israel the green light to violate the ceasefire that
      he helped to broker.


      So it’s very difficult for Iranian officials to believe that the ceasefire will
      truly hold. And even if it does hold in the short term, the reality is that the
      US government has been waging a kind of political war and an economic war against
      Iran for many decades, going back to 1953, when the US carried out a coup that
      overthrew Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and
      installed a pro-US dictator, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.


      Iran’s dictator, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, with US President Richard Nixon in
      the White House in 1973


      So why is this? What does Washington want to get out of its never-ending political
      and economic war on Iran?


      To try to answer this question, I interviewed the renowned economist Michael Hudson,
      who has written many books and is an expert on global political economy.


      Michael Hudson published an article in which he outlines the economic and political
      reasons for this war on Iran, and he posits that this is part of the attempt by
      the US empire to impose a unipolar order on the world, like we saw in the 1990s,
      when the US was the only superpower and it could impose its political and economic
      will on almost all countries on Earth.


      Iran was one of the very few countries that was actually resisting US unipolar
      hegemony. And today we see, as the world is more and more multipolar, Iran plays
      an important role as a BRICS member, and as a supporter of resistance groups.


      Iran is pushing for a more multipolar world, in opposition to the US empire’s
      unipolarity, as the economist Michael Hudson describes in this essay.


      Hudson wrote:


      What is at stake is the US attempt to control the Middle East and its oil as a
      buttress of US economic power, and to prevent other countries from moving to create
      their own autonomy from the US-centered neoliberal order administered by the IMF,
      World Bank, and other institutions to reinforce US unipolar power.


      In our discussion today, Michael connects all of the different factors involved
      in this conflict, including the oil and gas and other resources in West Asia (in
      the so-called Middle East); including the role of the US dollar and the petrodollar
      system; and how Iran, as a member of BRICS, and many other Global South countries,
      are de-dollarizing and seeking alternatives to the dollar.


      We also talk about the geopolitics of the region, the trade routes and interconnectivity
      among China, Iran, and Russia, as part of a project of Eurasian integration; we
      talk about the geopolitical goals of the US and Israel; and much, much more.


      Here is an excerpt of our conversation, and then we’ll go straight to the interview:


      MICHAEL HUDSON: What we have seen in the last month — or I should say the last
      two years actually — is the culmination of the long strategy that America has
      had ever since World War II, to take complete control of the Near Eastern oil
      lands and make them proxies of the United States, under client rulers, such as
      Saudi Arabia and the king of Jordan.


      Iran represents a military threat to Russia’s southern border, because if the
      United States could put a client regime in Iran, or break up Iran into ethnic
      groups who would be able to interfere with Russia’s corridor of trade southwards,
      into access to the Indian Ocean, well, then you have boxed in Russia, you have
      boxed in China, and you have managed to isolate them.


      That is the current American foreign policy. If you can isolate countries that
      do not want to be part of the American international financial and trade system,
      then the belief is that they cannot exist by themselves; they are too small.


      America is still living back in the epoch of the 1955 Bandung Conference of Non-Aligned
      nations in Indonesia. When other countries wanted to go alone, they were too economically
      small.


      The 1955 Bandung Conference


      But today, for the first time in modern history, you have the option of Eurasia,
      of Russia, China, Iran, and all of the neighboring countries in between. For the
      first time, they are large enough that they do not need trade and investment with
      the United States.


      In fact, while the United States and its NATO allies in Europe are shrinking —
      they are de-industrialized, neoliberal, post-industrial economies — most of the
      growth in world production, manufacturing, and trade has occurred in China, along
      with the control of the raw materials refining, such as rare earths, but also
      cobalt, even aluminum, and many other materials in China.


      So America’s strategic attempt to isolate Russia, China, and any of their allies
      in BRICS or the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ends up isolating itself. It
      is forcing other countries to make a choice.


      That is the only thing that America has to offer other countries in today’s world.
      It can’t offer them exports. It can’t offer them monetary stability.


      The only thing that America has to offer the world is to refrain from destroying
      their economy and causing economic chaos, such as Trump has threatened to do with
      his tariffs, and what he has threatened to do to any country trying to create
      an alternative to the dollar.


      Hence this free lunch, where other countries can earn dollars, but they have to
      re-lend them to the United States. And the United States, as their banker, has
      to hold it all, and the banker may just decide whom to pay and whom not to pay.


      It’s a gangster. It has been called a gangster state, for just such reasons. And
      other countries are afraid of what the United States can do, not only under Donald
      Trump, but what it has been doing for the last 50 years. It is simply confiscating,
      and destabilizing, and overthrowing.


      America has basically declared war against any attempt to create an international
      trade and investment system that the United States does not control, in its own
      self-interest, wanting all of the earnings from it, all of the revenue from it,
      not just part of it. It’s a greedy empire.


      Interview


      BEN NORTON: Michael, thanks for joining me. It’s always a real pleasure having
      you.


      Let’s talk about this article you wrote, in which you argue that the war on Iran
      is part of an attempt by the United States to impose its unipolar hegemony on
      the world.


      We see that we’re living in more and more of a multipolar world, and Iran has
      played an important part of the multipolar project as a member of BRICS, as a
      member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as a partner of China and Russia.
      Iran has also been pushing for de-dollarization of the global financial system.


      Talk about how you see the war on Iran — which didn’t start under Donald Trump,
      this goes back many years — and how you see it in particular as an economist.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the war on Iran started in 1953, when the United States
      and MI6 overthrew the elected Prime Minister [Mohammad Mosaddegh], and the reason
      he was overthrown was because he wanted to nationalize the oil reserves of Iran.
      The United States has always viewed Iran as part of the Near Eastern oil Gulf.


      American foreign policy, in terms of weaponizing its foreign trade, has always
      been based on two commodities: food grains — the ability to stop exporting food
      to countries that oppose US policy, as the United States stopped exporting grain
      to China under Mao — and oil.


      For a century, the United States has focused on control of the oil as the basis
      of its international trade balance — it’s the largest contributor to the trade
      balance — and of its ability to sanction the rest of the world, by turning off
      the oil supply, and thereby turning off the electricity, turning off the gas,
      turning off the home heating, of countries that break away from US policy.


      When I worked for the Hudson Institute in the early 1970s, Herman Kahn brought
      me to a meeting with some generals, and they were discussing what to do with Iran
      in case, under the shah, Iran should ever once again try to assert its autonomy
      and go its own way.


      Iran has always been the strongest power in the entire Near East, and the capstone
      to controlling the Near East. You cannot fully control the Near Eastern oil —
      Syria, Iraq, the rest of the countries there — without controlling Iran too, because
      of the size of its population and the strength of its economy.


      Herman Kahn


      It was a very interesting meeting. Herman Kahn, the model for Dr. Strangelove,
      discussed how to break up Iran into its various ethnicities, five or six ethnicities,
      in the case that it should, take a policy independent from the United States.


      The United States’ concern already in the 1970s, 50 years ago, was, “What do we
      do if other countries do not follow the kind of international world order that
      we are, organizing?”


      Herman said that he thought the crisis point that was going to break up in international
      news was going to be Balochistan, at Iran’s border with Pakistan. The Balochis
      are a distinct population, just as the Azerbaijanis, Azeris, the Kurds.


      Iran is a composite of many ethnic groups, including a very large Jewish group
      there. It is a multi-ethnic society, and the United States’ strategy, in case
      there was a war against Iran, was to play on these ethnicities — just as similar
      plans were drawn up for Russia, how to break it into separate ethnic parts; and
      China, how to break China into ethnic parts, at such point as America wants to
      take them on.


      And the reason this ethnic division was developed was, as a democracy, especially
      in the 1970s, it became very apparent that the United States never again could
      field an army for invasion, as it was doing in Vietnam.


      At the time I sat in on this meeting, late 1974 I think, or early ’75, there were
      demonstrations. It was obvious that there could never be a military draft again.


      How was the United States to exert its international power without military power?
      It had military bases all over the world; it spent more on military than any other
      country.


      The entire US balance of payments deficit was military spending abroad, and yet
      it couldn’t go to war. It had to use proxies.


      This was the time when, in addition to the discussions that I sat in on how to
      use ethnicities in countries that we declared war on, as opponents; America decided
      to create the largest military base in the Near East, and that was Israel.


      Henry Jackson, the pro-war, Military-Industrial Complex’s senator, met with Herman
      Kahn — I actually was in Herman’s office, listening to the phone call, when it
      came through — and the agreement was that the Military-Industrial Complex and
      Jackson would back Israel, if Israel agreed to act as America’s landed aircraft
      carrier in the Near East, as it was put at the time.


      Herman very gladly made that arrangement, because the Hudson Institute at that
      time was a Zionist organization, and it was a training ground for Mossad.


      One of my colleagues was Uzi Arad. We made a number of trips together to Asia.
      And Uzi became Netanyahu’s advisor and head of Mossad in subsequent years.


      So I sort of sat in at the time when the American strategy was being outlined.


      Israel was going to be America’s face, and indeed has been coordinating America’s
      backing of Al-Qaeda and the Wahhabi butchers who have taken over Syria, and are
      now busy killing the Christians, killing the Shiites, killing the Alawites.


      And you will never see any criticism of Israel by Al-Qaeda, or the group [Hayat
      Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)] in Syria, whatever you want to call it there now. And vice
      versa, there has always been a working relationship.


      So this gives some background as to how long the United States has anticipated
      the day when it would try to finally capstone its invasion of Iraq, its attack
      on Syria, its destruction of Libya, its backing of the destruction of Lebanon,
      and other countries, in North Africa, etc.


      What we have seen in the last month — or I should say the last two years actually
      — is the culmination of the long strategy that America has had ever since World
      War II, to take complete control of the Near Eastern oil lands and make them proxies
      of the United States, under client rulers, such as Saudi Arabia and the king of
      Jordan.


      Geopolitics and global trade


      BEN NORTON: You raised so many interesting points, Michael. I want focus on two
      main issues here: one is the geopolitics of Iran’s integration with Eurasia, and
      the other is oil and the petrodollar system.


      I will start with the geopolitics. Of course, when we talk about the petrodollar,
      we should keep in mind that Iran has been selling its oil and gas in other currencies,
      and pushing for de-dollarization.


      But before we get to that, I want to talk about the role that Iran has played
      not only in supporting resistance groups in West Asia, but also in deepening its
      political and economic partnership with China and Russia, as part of a larger
      Eurasian partnership.


      There are numerous physical projects integrating these regions.


      Iran is at the heart of China’s New Silk Road. This was originally launched by
      Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, and then it expanded into the Belt and Road
      Initiative (BRI).


      Iran is an important part in that, connecting East Asia, through Central Asia,
      through Iran, into West Asia. And the US has really tried to disrupt that.


      Iran also plays an important role in a Russian-led economic corridor that connects
      from St. Petersburg, through Moscow, down through the Caspian Sea, through Iran,
      and to India.


      This is known as the International North-South Transport Corridor, the INSTC.


      So we have seen that Iran has played a very important role challenging the US
      dollar, challenging US hegemony, and also seeking economic and political integration
      with other countries in Eurasia.


      Can you speak more about this and why these imperial planners in Washington see
      this as so much of a threat?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you just summarized the two maps that I included in my article.


      About a month ago, Iran just completed its Belt and Road railroad, that goes all
      the way to Tehran. For the first time, there is a land corridor from Iran to China.


      Now, the Belt and Road corridor means they’re avoiding going by sea.


      American and British military policy has been based for a hundred years on control
      of the seas, and control of the oil trade was part of that strategy.


      Because if Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other oil-producing countries can’t
      load up tankers with oil, how are they going to be able to export? And how can
      importers such as China, or India, obtain oil from the Near East?


      Well, with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, its intention was to go all the way
      through, via Iran, and then proceed on all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, to Europe.


      This Belt and Road was to span the entire Eurasian continent, the entire eastern
      hemisphere.


      And if the United States could conquer Iran and take it over, that would interfere
      with China’s long-distance railroad development, and it would block it — just
      as the United States is hoping to goad India and Pakistan into some kind of fight
      that would interrupt China’s Belt and Road Initiative that goes through through
      Pakistan [the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)].


      So, on the one hand, Iran is the key to China’s overland trantransportation to
      Europe.


      And as you just pointed out, with Russia: Iran represents a military threat to
      Russia’s southern border, because if the United States could put a client regime
      in Iran, or break up Iran into ethnic groups who would be able to interfere with
      Russia’s corridor of trade southwards, into access to the Indian Ocean, well,
      then you have boxed in Russia, you have boxed in China, and you have managed to
      isolate them.


      That is the current American foreign policy. If you can isolate countries that
      do not want to be part of the American international financial and trade system,
      then the belief is that they cannot exist by themselves; they are too small.


      America is still living back in the epoch of the 1955 Bandung Conference, of Non-Aligned
      nations, in Indonesia. When other countries wanted to go alone, they were too
      economically small.


      The 1955 Bandung Conference


      But today, for the first time in modern history, you have the option of Eurasia,
      of Russia, China, Iran, and all of the neighboring countries in between. For the
      first time, they are large enough that they do not need trade and investment with
      the United States.


      In fact, while the United States and its NATO allies in Europe are shrinking —
      they are de-industrialized, neoliberal, post-industrial economies — most of the
      growth in world production, manufacturing, and trade has occurred in China, along
      with the control of the raw materials refining, such as rare earths, but also
      cobalt, even aluminum, and many other materials in China.


      So America’s strategic attempt to isolate Russia, China, and any of their allies
      in BRICS or the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ends up isolating itself. It
      is forcing other countries to make a choice.


      This was made very clear immediately upon Trump taking the presidency and announcing
      his tariff policy, saying, “In three months, I’m going to impose such devastatingly
      high tariffs that you, the Global South countries, the Global Majority countries,
      your economies will be in chaos without having access to the American market”.


      But, [Trump said], “We have three months to negotiate, and, if you give us a give-back,
      I will roll back these tariffs to 10%, so that it won’t devastate your economies.
      And one of the agreements that you have to make is you’ll agree to America’s sanctions
      not to trade with China, not to invest in China, not to use alternatives to the
      US dollar”.


      China is trying to avoid using dollars, just as Russia no longer is able to use
      dollars, because the United States has simply confiscated $300 billion of Russia’s
      foreign exchange holdings in the West, that it held in Brussels, in order to manage
      its foreign exchange, to stabilize its exchange rate, which is what central banks
      do throughout the world.


      Well, it’s very interesting. The Financial Times had a front page article [reporting]
      that now European countries, especially Germany and Italy, which have the second-
      and third-largest gold holdings, have asked, “Could you please [give us our gold
      back]? We have, since World War II, we have left all of our gold supplies at the
      Federal Reserve in New York”.


      America’s gold is in Fort Knox, but other countries keep their gold reserves in
      the basement of the Federal Reserve Bank, right across from Chase Manhattan bank
      in the downtown area.


      And other countries now realize that, under Trump, if he says, “Well, Europe has
      been really taking advantage of us; they have been exporting more to us than we’ve
      sold to them” — you know, Italy and Germany are worried that somehow America will
      say, “Well, we’re just gonna grab all of this gold that you’ve built up by taking
      advantage of us”.


      So you’re having the rest of the world pull back from the dollar. This reflects
      the effect of everything that the United States is trying to do to isolate the
      other parts of the world from contact with the United States, if they try to have
      an alternative economic system to neoliberal finance capitalism, if they try to
      have industrial socialism — which is really industrial capitalism on the way to
      being industrial socialism, with active government investment in basic infrastructure,
      instead of privatizing the infrastructure Margaret Thatcher style.


      The effect will be to leave the United States isolated, and all the rest of the
      world going its own way, unable to trade with the United States because of the
      high tariffs that Trump has imposed, and afraid to trade in dollars because of
      the predatory weaponization of the dollar standard, which had been America’s free
      lunch under the whole epoch of US Treasury bill standard, since America went off
      gold in 1971.


      Oil and the petrodollar


      BEN NORTON: Again, Michael, you raised so many good points there.


      I want to stick with this issue of oil and the US dollar, and the petrodollar
      system.


      Now, you have mentioned a few times that the US really relies on exports of oil
      and control of the oil trade, partially to try to reduce its enormous current
      account deficit — which, I mean, it still is not very successful. The US runs
      massive current account deficits — that is, trade deficits with the rest of the
      world.


      But what is something that is different in the 2020s is that the US is now the
      world’s largest exporter of oil. It’s the largest producer of oil on Earth, and
      the largest producer of gas.


      So that’s a significant difference. That’s largely a development in the past decade
      due to the explosion in fracking in the US, and also the shale oil revolution.


      So, it’s not necessarily that the US needs to physically get access to all of
      the oil in the region.


      Although, of course, US fossil fuel corporations would love to privatize all of
      the oil in West Asia, that is state-owned.


      So for instance, we talked about Mohammad Mosaddegh, the prime minister of Iran
      who was overthrown in the 1953 CIA-backed coup, after he nationalized the oil
      in Iran and kicked out US and British oil companies.


      Well, the current Iranian government, following the Iranian Revolution in 1979,
      also nationalized the oil, and the Iranian state does actually have a lot of influence
      in the economy, including through state-owned enterprises.


      So, of course the US would love to privatize that. But this is not really necessarily
      about getting access to all that oil.


      This is about maintaining the current financial order, which is really backed
      by oil, especially after Richard Nixon in 1971 took the dollar off of gold.


      Then, in 1974, Nixon sent his treasury secretary, William Simon — Bill Simon,
      from Salomon Brothers — who was a bond expert. He ran the Treasuries desk, trading
      US government debt at Salomon Brothers, this major Wall Street investment bank.


      He was sent to Jeddah in 1974, where they brokered a deal saying that the US would
      protect the Saudi monarchy, and, in return, Saudi Arabia would sell all of its
      oil in dollars, maintaining global demand for the US dollar.


      This came one year after the OPEC oil embargo, in which the countries in the Global
      South showed that they could use their control of oil as a geopolitical tool to
      punish the US and the West for their support of Israel.


      So I mean, all this history is still so relevant today.


      Now, Iran is directly challenging that petrodollar system. Iran is selling its
      oil to China in Chinese yuan, the renminbi.


      Iran is also trading with India, selling its oil, and it is using its currency,
      the rial. India is also using its currency, the rupee, and India is essentially
      trading its agricultural goods for Iranian oil.


      So can you talk about this petrodollar system, and why Iran is seen as such a
      major challenge to this system? And really what that means is a direct challenge
      to the global dominance of the US dollar itself.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I mentioned that the original drive of the United States
      was to control Near Eastern oil.


      I was the balance of payments economist for Chase Manhattan Bank, and I did a
      whole study on behalf of the US oil industry to calculate the balance of payments
      returns, and the average dollar spent by the Seven Sisters, the big oil companies.


      The average dollar invested in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, other Arab countries, was
      recovered in only 18 months.


      Oil was the most profitable investment in the entire US economy, and it was tax
      free.


      Now, the original plan, as I mentioned, of the US in the Near East, it viewed
      as having oil. Then came the oil war — and it was more than an oil war — in 1974,
      after Israel waged the 1973 war, and after the United States quadrupled its grain
      prices.


      Well, you mentioned [Nixon’s Treasury Secretary] Bill Simon. Herman Kahn and I
      went to meet with Bill Simon in 1974, to discuss what should America’s strategy
      be with the oil companies.


      Simon said, “We’ve explained to them that, they can charge whatever they want
      for oil. They can quadruple the prices”.


      In fact, that made Standard Oil of New Jersey, Socony [later Mobil], and the other
      American oil companies very happy, because, as you point out, America was itself
      a huge oil producer.


      When the OPEC countries quadrupled the price of oil, that made the American oil
      companies immensely profitable on their and Canada’s oil production.


      So, Bill Simon told me that he had explained to them that they could charge whatever
      they wanted for the oil; quadrupling was okay.


      But the agreement was they had to keep all of their savings from what they made
      off this oil — I won’t call it profit, because it’s really natural resource rent
      — they had to keep their rents in the United States economy.


      The deal was that Saudi Arabia and other countries would export their oil for
      dollars; they would not remove these dollars from the United States.


      They would leave the dollars that they were paid by European countries, by other
      countries buying their oil; they would invest it primarily in US Treasury securities,
      and they could also buy US stocks and bonds.


      But they could not do what America did with its foreign exchange of European currency,
      for instance. The OPEC countries could not buy control of any major American company.


      They could buy stocks and bonds, but they had to spread the investment in the
      stock market over the market as a whole. So I think the king of Saudi Arabia bought
      a billion dollars of every stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, to spread
      it all out.


      But most of their money was kept safely in US Treasury securities.


      So, essentially, the OPEC revenue — I won’t say earnings because, again, it wasn’t
      really earned; it’s unearned income — OPEC revenue from the oil sales all ended
      up in the United States, most of it lent to the United States government.


      Well, that inflow of dollars is what enabled the United States to do two things.


      One, as a balance of payments inflow, it enabled the United States to continue
      spending its military overseas spending abroad, in order to have the military
      fist behind its economic empire.


      But it also funded the domestic budget deficit. Foreign central banks were largely
      funding America’s own domestic budget deficit, by their holding of American Treasury
      bills.


      So the OPEC countries essentially became captive parts of the American financial
      system that I had described in my book Super Imperialism.


      So I met with the Treasury Treasury people, basically explaining what I had written
      about in Super Imperialism, about how ending other countries’ practice of holding
      their international monetary reserves in gold, but holding them in loans to the
      US Treasury in the form of buying Treasury bonds as the vehicle for their savings,
      essentially made the savings of the entire world, the monetary savings, all centralized
      in Washington and New York.


      That control of what began as control of the oil trade, to weaponize the trade
      in oil, became control of the international financial system with the dollar’s
      surpluses being thrown off by the oil trade.


      So you had that symbiosis between the trade system and the financial system as
      the basis for American military policy, and what I called super imperialism.


      Super imperialism


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, and what you described over 50 years ago, so brilliantly, as
      the system of super imperialism, what we’re seeing today is that Iran and other
      BRICS countries are challenging that system.


      They are challenging the exorbitant privilege of the US dollar and trying to seek
      alternatives.


      So maybe you can speak more about this global de-dollarization movement and how
      Iran plays a central role in this.


      And that is one of the reasons, of course, why it’s a target of the US.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, Iran really wasn’t central to it, because the United States
      has been able to isolate Iran.


      As soon as the shah was overthrown, the United States played a dirty trick on
      Iran — Chase Manhattan Bank did.


      Iran had a foreign debt — like every country has, by issuing foreign bonds — and
      it sent the dollars to the Chase Manhattan Bank, to pay the bond holders their
      dividends.


      The Treasury went to David Rockefeller and told him, “Don’t send this Iranian
      money along. Just hold it there”. And so Iran was considered to be in default,
      and the entire foreign debt came due, and America seized, confiscated, Iranian
      economic and financial resources in the United States.


      They later negotiated to give it back, because all of this was illegal under international
      law, but that has never stopped the United States, as we’re seeing right now.


      After the shah was overthrown, the United States said, “We’ve got to destabilize
      the the new Iranian government, and if we grab its foreign reserves, that will
      cripple it and cause chaos, and that’s how we run the world, by causing chaos”.


      That is the only thing that America has to offer other countries in today’s world.
      It can’t offer them exports. It can’t offer them monetary stability.


      The only thing that America has to offer the world is to refrain from destroying
      their economy and causing economic chaos, such as Trump has threatened to do with
      his tariffs, and what he has threatened to do to any country trying to create
      an alternative to the dollar.


      Hence this free lunch, where other countries can earn dollars, but they have to
      re-lend them to the United States. And the United States, as their banker, has
      to hold it all, and the banker may just decide whom to pay and whom not to pay.


      It’s a gangster. It has been called a gangster state, for just such reasons. And
      other countries are afraid of what the United States can do, not only under Donald
      Trump, but what it has been doing for the last 50 years. It is simply confiscating,
      and destabilizing, and overthrowing.


      America has basically declared war against any attempt to create an international
      trade and investment system that the United States does not control, in its own
      self-interest, wanting all of the earnings from it, all of the revenue from it,
      not just part of it. It’s a greedy empire.


      Sanctions and economic warfare


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, and what you’re getting at, Michael, is such an important point,
      because essentially what this shows is that these tactics that the US has abused
      more and more frequently in the past few decades are not entirely new.


      Today, one-third of all countries on Earth are under US sanctions, which are unilateral;
      they are illegal under international law.


      But of course, Iran was one of the first countries to be sanctioned, after its
      revolution in 1979.


      And we know that in 2022, the US and the EU seized $300 billion dollars and euros
      worth of Russian assets, and that was a huge wake-up call to the world.


      But, actually, Iran was the kind of first test case. It was the US that seized
      Iran’s assets first, and then they later seized Venezuela’s assets, and then Afghanistan’s
      assets, and now Russia.


      So Iran was always the first country to be targeted by these aggressive tactics,
      and now they have become so commonplace that we have seen a kind of global rebellion
      against this system, even by longtime US allies.


      Like for instance Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which historically have been US client
      states, but they see what has happened to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, and they’re
      worried that they could be next.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, this is exactly what is shaping Saudi Arabian and Arab policy
      in the region.


      Obviously, the Arabs don’t like what Israel is doing in Gaza.They don’t like the
      ethnic cleansing, and the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank, and the whole attack
      on the Palestinians and other Arab populations.


      But they’re afraid of acting on behalf of Iran.They may be very sympathetic with
      it. The populations of these countries are very much against the violence that
      Israel is waging against the Arab states, but the leaders of these countries have
      a problem: All of the savings that Saudi Arabia has accumulated for the last 50
      years are held as hostage in the US Treasury and in the US banks.


      And the US banks, essentially, are arms of the Treasury. Most of all, Chase Manhattan
      was a designated bank that would act on behalf of the Treasury. Citibank was more
      independent, of that.


      So you have not heard a peep out of Saudi Arabia and its neighboring oil-producing
      countries, because they’re afraid. They realize that they’re in a very delicate
      position.


      All of this money that their sovereign wealth fund that they have built up to
      finance their own future development — if you can call what they’re doing, it’s
      a twisted development — but their plans for the future are held hostage, and they’ve
      been politically neutralized, because of this exposure to the US dollar.


      Well, you can imagine that other countries realize what is happening, and Asian
      countries, the Global South countries, and even European countries like Germany
      and Italy, say, “We don’t want to be stuck in the same trap that the Arab countries
      are stuck in, where not only our savings, and Treasury securities, and US stocks
      and bonds, and our investments in the United States are held hostage; our gold
      supply is being held there!”


      And the whole world is now moving toward gold.They’re afraid to hold dollars.
      Dollar holdings by foreign central banks have been at just stable, while the gold
      holdings have been going up.


      And many foreign official gold holdings are held off the books. The government
      will hold stock in a company that holds gold. You can conceal what they’re doing,
      so they won’t very conspicuously being shown to be dumping the dollar.


      There’s a kind of Kabuki dance going on in financial statistics, as well as in
      dropping bombs on countries.


      The Military-Industrial Complex


      BEN NORTON: Michael, I want to talk about the military-industrial complex, because
      another point that you made in this article which is very important and is often
      left out is how US military contractors profit from these wars — like we saw in
      what they’re now calling the 12-Day War, between the US/Israel and Iran.


      You pointed out that Iran was mostly using its older missiles. It was emptying
      its stockpile of old missiles to hit Israel, and trying to overwhelm Israel’s
      air defense system.


      Now, we know that US military contractors have boasted about the advanced military
      equipment the US has given to Israel, like the Iron Dome, the David’s Sling system,
      and the Arrow system.


      US corporations have benefited from helping to design these systems, and from
      providing the missiles and interceptors.


      So Israel has spent many millions of dollars trying to shoot down these old Iranian
      missiles that Iran wanted to get rid of anyway.


      If the war had continued, it would obviously have bled more and more resources
      of Israel and the US.


      But as you point out, this is actually something that the military-industrial
      complex in the US benefits from, because what the US calls the “aid” that it gives
      to many countries is actually not really aid; it’s actually contracts given to
      US private contractors, and then they give that military equipment to Israel,
      or to Egypt, or to Japan, South Korea, and other countries.


      So can you talk more about the role of the military-industrial complex, and how
      it has profited from all of this?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, this is the key to the debate in Congress that is now occurring
      over the Republican tax law. The enormous amount of money that is spent on the
      military-industrial complex that basically, the weapons it makes do not work.


      We’ve seen in Ukraine the inability of the NATO countries to defend against the
      Russian missiles.


      We’ve seen in Israel that the Iron Dome is very easily penetrated by Iran.


      And Iran, already several months ago, demonstrated this when it sent two sets
      of rockets. It warned Israel, “We don’t want to go to war. We don’t want to hurt
      anybody, but we just want to show you that we can bomb you whenever you want,
      and so we’re gonna drop a bomb on this particular location; get everybody out
      of there; we’re just gonna show you that it works. Try to shoot us down”. And
      they dropped it.


      They did the same with the United States, in Iraq, saying, “You know, we don’t
      want to really have to go to war with you in Iraq. We lost a million Iranians
      fighting the Iraqis, when you were setting Saddam Hussein against us before [in
      the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s], but you should know that we can wipe out your
      American bases whenever we want. Let’s give you a demonstration. Here’s a base
      that’s not very populated. We’re going to bomb it, so get everybody out; we don’t
      want anyone to get hurt. We’re gonna bomb you on such and such a date. Do everything
      you can to shoot us down”. Whoosh! They bombed it. America could not shoot them
      down.


      Well, the Iron Dome obviously doesn’t work, nor does the American military defense
      work.


      Well, President Trump has just come out and said, “We’re going to vastly increase
      the US budget deficit by creating an Iron Dome in the United States for $1 trillion”.


      Well, imagine spending a trillion dollars replicating the system that Iran and
      Russia show that they can penetrate right away.


      BEN NORTON: Michael, this is called the Golden Dome. And Elon Musk’s companies
      like SpaceX are poised to get massive US government contracts. It is estimated
      that hundreds of billions of dollars in total will be spent to make this Golden
      Dome that won’t even work.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Of course, for Trump, everything is gold, not iron — I should
      have noticed that — just like the doorknobs in his Trump Towers, of course.


      So we’re seeing this fantasy.


      What the military-industrial complex makes aren’t arms to actually be used in
      war. They’re arms to be traded or sold.


      And, as as you pointed out, in addition to the enormous amount of direct Congressional
      spending on buying arms for the US Army, Navy, and Marines, on the military, the
      United States gives foreign aid to South Korea, Japan, and other countries, and
      this foreign aid is spent by their own purchases of US military arms.


      This is not included in the American military budget, but in effect, it’s financing
      the military-industrial complex through the back door, by giving money to America’s
      allies to buy America’s arms, that also don’t work.


      Well, you must wonder what these allies are thinking now, especially in Europe,
      it’s almost embarrassing to see NATO refusing to acknowledge the fact that the
      American arms that it wants to buy, and the European arms that it has made, simply
      are not able to defend themselves against Russian and Iranian arms.


      American technology is backwards, because the military-industrial complex companies
      have taken all this enormous money that they’ve paid, their profits that they’ve
      made, by paying out dividends and buying their own stocks.


      They haven’t spent it on research and development. 92% of every dollar they’ve
      got is recycled into supporting their stock prices, not in actually making arms.


      So, by financializing its military system, along with the industrial economy as
      a whole, the United States has essentially de-industrialized itself, and you could
      almost say disarmed itself, against the rest of the world, that actually spends
      their military money on arms that work, arms that are intended to work, not simply
      to make profits, to increase the stock prices of military-industrial companies.


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, I think that’s actually a great note to end on. We could go
      on for another hour, but we should save that for another time.


      Michael, is there anything you would like to recommend for people who want to
      find more of your work?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I have my website, Michael-Hudson.com, and all of my articles
      are on the website, including the one that Ben has just mentioned. So you can
      see my ongoing commentary on all of this.


      And my book Super Imperialism explained the whole unfolding dynamic of all of
      this.


      BEN NORTON: As always, Michael, it’s a real pleasure. Thanks for joining us today,
      and we’ll talk again soon.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it was a timely discussion.Thanks for having me.'
    one_sentence_summary: Economist Michael Hudson argues that the U.S. war on Iran
      is part of a broader strategy to re-establish its unipolar dominance in global
      politics and finance, aiming to maintain dollar hegemony and disrupt the integration
      of BRICS and Eurasian countries, particularly in light of Iran's resistance to
      U.S. influence and its role in promoting a multipolar world.
    paragraph_summary: In an interview with Geopolitical Economy Report editor Ben Norton,
      economist Michael Hudson argues that the U.S. war on Iran is part of a broader
      strategy to re-establish its unipolar dominance in global politics and finance,
      particularly in the context of preserving dollar hegemony and the petrodollar
      system. Hudson explains that the U.S. seeks to disrupt the integration of BRICS
      and Eurasian countries, particularly China and Russia, which Iran supports as
      a member of these alliances. He highlights the historical context of U.S.-Iran
      relations, tracing back to the 1953 coup that overthrew Iran's democratically
      elected Prime Minister, and discusses how Iran's resistance to U.S. hegemony,
      along with its strategic partnerships and efforts toward de-dollarization, poses
      a significant threat to U.S. interests. Hudson emphasizes that the U.S. aims to
      control Middle Eastern oil resources and prevent countries from achieving autonomy
      outside the U.S.-centric neoliberal order, ultimately isolating itself as it attempts
      to impose its will on nations that seek alternatives to American dominance.

    text: '2025.06.19 NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi everybody. Today is Thursday, June 19th, 2025,
      and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson are back with us. Welcome back.
      RICHARD WOLFF: Good. Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Let’s start, Richard, with
      you. What’s going on in the Middle East between Iran and Israel? The United States
      had decided to talk with Iran on Sunday, and just before, on Friday, Israel attacked
      Iran. What’s going on in your opinion? RICHARD WOLFF: Well, you know, no one will
      be surprised who watches this program about my answer. But, you know, if you have
      a point of view and if things begin to develop that are consistent with that point
      of view, well, then you’re going to hear that point of view repeated. Here’s what
      I think is going on. We are living through the final stages of the century of
      anti-colonialism. It’s over, this European effort that is several centuries old
      to expand from the European core and to take over the rest of the world, either
      on the grounds that it was empty and therefore needed to be populated, which was
      mostly not true, or that it was peopled by inferiors who needed the blessing of
      the Christian religion, by and large, and modern civilization and advanced economics,
      and so was lucky to be colonized because it sped up all of those important activities.
      Okay, that worked for several centuries. It allowed capitalism to grow, to grow
      its market above all else, to source its inputs all over the world so that the
      profitability of capitalism could be maintained. If you remember, Adam Smith,
      David Ricardo, and Karl Marx, each in their different ways, talked about a tendency
      for the rate of profit to fall, by which they meant the mechanism whereby capitalism
      would shut down its own economic development. This could be postponed, as Marx
      showed in Volume 3 of Capital, if you were able to get cheaper and cheaper sources
      of raw materials and so forth, which the colonized world was good for. And the
      same applied to labor, once you made that mobile, et cetera, et cetera. The last
      hundred years, so from the early 20th now to the early 21st century, has been
      the century of anti-colonialism, the end, the pushback, the exhaustion of colonialism
      as the mass of the people, Asia, Africa, Latin America, each in their own way,
      at their own pace, shaped by their own cultures and religions and physical natural
      conditions, fought for independence, fought to be out from under the colonial
      yoke. And the last and final stages of that we are living through. And why? Why
      do I call it the last and final stages? Because I think there’s something very
      basic linking U.S. policy in Ukraine, in China, and in the Middle East. And in
      each of those cases, it’s an attempt to hold back the last stage of anti-colonialism,
      which is why I think it is a doomed effort. It will not work, whether it works
      in the immediate moment or not. This is going against history. And as history
      has shown us, you go against history, you lose. And we have been losing one ex-colony
      after another. And why do I say they’re all the same? Well, I’m going to focus,
      just because I don’t want to keep talking, on China and the Middle East. Starting
      around 2010, the United States figured out, having deluded itself before that
      by pretending that China wasn’t developing, by 2010, it was so obvious around
      the world that even the United States figured out that China had not only never
      been a colony, not only set itself the goal of undoing what is called in China
      the 100 years of humiliation, but that they had figured out this mixture of private
      and state enterprise, which could achieve economic growth rates that nothing in
      the West could come near, including the United States. From that time, about 20
      years now, the United States has shifted over into trying to slow, to stop, to
      reverse the economic development of China. And none of that has worked either.
      Oh, here and there they may have achieved some slowing, but the larger picture,
      as everybody can see, is China grows; American efforts to prevent it fail. Okay,
      now let’s turn to Israel and Iran. You’ll see the same thing. Israel is an anomaly.
      It is settler colonialism after that’s no longer possible. The only settler colonialisms
      that ever worked, which are a model for Israel, were the settler colonialism states
      that literally, genocidally killed all the local people, whether they be the Māori
      or the Aboriginals in Australia or the Native Americans here in the Western Hemisphere.
      But that’s over. You can’t do that anymore. You cannot extinguish the local population
      because the local population has friends, has associates, and has supporters.
      The Palestinians are not in the position that the Māoris were or the Aboriginals
      or the American so-called Indians, etc., etc. So it’s a hopeless quest. But the
      United States needs them. It needs them as their proxy in the Middle East because
      the Middle East has a lot of oil. Okay, so now the Iranians enter. The Iranians
      are part of the whole rebellion against colonialism. Modern Iran is the rebellion
      against what the United States did to the Shah, excuse me, to Mossadegh back in
      the 1950s. And yeah, they had a temporary victory. They put in the reactionary
      Shah, who was a pawn of the West. Eventually, because it’s history, the Shah was
      overthrown and ended up a sick old man protected by Henry Kissinger because the
      project of controlling Iran is over. Yes, it was captured by the religious rebellion.
      That often happened because the West was so busy killing off the revolutionary,
      socialist, communist opposition that it left either the proxies of the imperial
      or the religious community. You saw that in Iran, they got rid of one of the largest
      and most powerful communist parties anywhere in the so-called Third World, the
      Tudeh party in Iran, which, if you go back and study, could have and would have
      been the revolutionary leadership of that country. They got rid of the equivalent
      in Afghanistan so that it was the Taliban, you know, the religious, the very people
      armed by the West to destroy the revolutionary anti-imperialism. It’s replaced
      by religious anti-imperialism. It’s the irony of it all. So here you have the
      one remaining settler colonialism that has not or has not yet exterminated the
      local people in the way the older ones did. And it can’t really do it now. There’s
      too much opposition. Look what they are doing. Put aside for a moment the horror
      of it, but the extremity that Israel has to do what it is doing to survive. It’s
      hopeless. They face extinction or they face extinction. And they can have any
      future they want as long as it’s extinction. It’s like your parents taking you
      for ice cream, and you can have any flavor you want as long as it’s vanilla. You
      know, it is a disaster. And what will happen now with Iran? Iran has friends.
      Iran has mutual defense arrangements with Russia and with China. And what are
      you doing here? Even inside the Trump administration, there are people saying,
      don’t be crazy here, what you are doing. You are isolating yourself. Well, that’s
      not news. That’s already been happening. Every vote on Israel and Palestine in
      the last several years has been the whole world against the United States and
      Israel. So it’s over. History is moving in a direction that makes all of this
      a hopeless effort. Let me conclude this way: Whatever happens now, the current
      situation is laying out the path forward for Iran-you better get nuclear weapons
      or else this kind of game will be played on you whenever the West wants. You’re
      not getting rid of nuclear. You’re making it even more certain that Iran and many
      other countries watching all of this will pursue it. People don’t get the news
      here in this country. But let me conclude with an illustration. Over the last
      few days, the government in Pakistan issued a statement: If any nuclear weapons
      are used against Iran, they, the Pakistanis, will use them against Israel. Iran
      is a very large country. You could use nuclear weapons there and it can survive.
      Israel is a very small country, small in geography, and small in population. It
      cannot survive a nuclear attack. We are actually at the point where this is what
      is being done. I know the extremity of it scares everybody; I’m not saying it
      shouldn’t, but put it in its historical context, these are the desperate final
      efforts of the West to try to cope with the end of the whole colonial operation.
      They can’t do it. They can’t maintain the strength of the dollar. They can’t maintain
      the power of Western financial arrangements. They can’t do it. And you’re watching
      the frustration and the rage that works that out. And it may overwhelm. Watch
      on. Mr. Trump may have his chosen intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, explain to
      him that the consensus of the intelligence community is that Iran is several years
      away from being able to have a nuclear weapon, which, by the way, has been the
      finding about Iran for the entirety of this century. If you go back to 2004, when
      Colin Powell was the Secretary of State, he said so too. All right? We are bringing
      up this dead horse about nuclear weapons being fashioned in the depths of a mountain.
      We’ve been doing this for 25 years. That’s what I mean. It’s a desperate effort
      to try somehow by argument, by intervention, by overt activity, covert activity,
      to stop the movement of history. And that’s a hopeless task. That makes these
      people crazy. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, go ahead. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I think
      Richard has framed the issue correctly. We’re seeing the final U.S.-Western struggle
      against what the West sees as an attempt by the global majority to escape from
      Western control, especially U.S. control. And he talked about colonialism. World
      War I and the aftermath set a new stage of European colonialism with the breakup
      of the Ottoman Empire. And that saw Britain and France redraw the map of the Middle
      East. We all know how it cut across ethnic lines and caused the last century of
      instability from Iraq to Syria and the rest of the Near East. And the key to all
      of this was already emerging as control of oil. And with this control of oil and
      with the redrawing of old colonialism, you had the emergence of financial colonialism
      led by the United States. And you could say it’s really financial imperialism
      because the American financial policy started with imposing inter-allied debts
      on Europe, plunging Europe into financial chaos that led to World War II as a
      result of the Allies turning to Germany to pay reparations debts way beyond its
      ability to pay so that the Allies could pay the United States. This whole system
      broke down in 1929, and by 1931 there was a moratorium. But while the U.S.-European
      relationships were breaking down, oil was being put in place. And after World
      War II, you saw what seemed to be what Richard was talking about: the withdrawal
      from American-sponsored colonialism. And to the United States, it tried to prevent
      this from the very beginning with a military umbrella. This military umbrella
      has led to, well, it led to the overthrow of the Iranian elected middle-class
      democracy in 1953 by MI6 in Britain in conjunction with Kermit Roosevelt in the
      United States. And the imposition of the Shah and his SAVAK dictatorship led the
      United States to solidify its plans to control the entire Near East because if
      you could control the Near Eastern regimes, you could control oil. And oil was
      the key to American financial control of the world because oil was the most profitable
      rent extracting sector in the world. I did a study for the Chase Manhattan Bank
      in 1965 showing that the average U.S. oil company investment in Middle Eastern
      and other foreign oil, the entire investment was recouped in balance of payments
      terms in only 11 months. So the United States realized that the Middle East was
      the key to American policy. Now, there’s been a lot of discussion, especially
      on your side, that certainly has a great point-that opponents of this looming
      war with Iran say that it’s not in American interest. What interest do we have
      in fighting with Iran? Is this only Israel’s interest? Why is it our interest
      in fighting in Iran? Look at what happened in Iraq. Iraq was not posing a threat
      to America. Iran was not posing a threat to America. But to the American empire
      strategists, the post-colonialists are posing a threat simply by existing independently
      and seeking to act in their own economic self-interest. Now, already 50 years
      ago, this logic of American imperialism in the Near East was guiding U.S. foreign
      policy. Around 1974 and 1975, probably late ‘74, I sat in on a military strategy
      discussion. I was invited by my boss, Herman Khan, at the Hudson Institute, to
      sit in on this. And the strategy was how to break up Iran into its ethnic parts
      in the event that there was another attempt by Iran to ever seek its own self-interest.
      Well, the whole reason we’d imposed the Shah was so it wouldn’t do that, but in
      case the Shah sought to do that. And Herman Khan found the weakest spot in the
      Iranian multi-ethnic nation to be Balochistan on Iran’s eastern border with Pakistan.
      And Iran also contains the Kurds, Tajiks, and Turkic Azerbaijanis, and others,
      whose ethnicities are to be played off against each other. You can be sure that,
      in the last few years or decades, the United States has been working with these
      ethnicities to try to do in Iran what the Kurds were doing to destabilize Syria
      by pressing for their own interests. This is the U.S. strategy that has been applied
      to Russia and China. If you can break up these great countries into parts and
      have client oligarchies in these ethnic parts that are split up, then they will
      be unable to lead the fight against the U.S. NATO-centered world order. Well,
      this fight is not simply against colonialism. Russia was not a colony, and China
      really was not a colony. But Russia, China, and Iran might lead the anti-colonialist
      and essentially the de-dollarization plans that are at work. Well, three decades
      after this 1974 meeting of how to make a long-term plan for American control of
      Near Eastern oil, General Wesley Clark pointed out that Iran was to be the capstone
      in seven countries that the United States needed to take over and control in order
      to dominate the Near East, starting with Iraq and Syria, Lebanon, Libya, certainly
      in North Africa, Somalia, and Sudan. All this was to culminate in the takeover
      of Iran. So, what we’re seeing today is not simply Mr. Netanyahu telling Trump,
      please protect us by attacking Iran. I think you had Lawrence Wilkerson a few
      days ago, Nima, on your show saying that Netanyahu and Israel were certainly acting
      in keeping with a long U.S. plan for how to break up Iran. And here’s how the
      neocons spell out the U.S. national interest in overthrowing the Iranian government
      for a regime change. The assumption is that if Israel can indeed blow up Khomeini,
      that his religious leadership will fall apart and there will be a secular reaction
      that will somehow not really press for Iranian national interest, but will just
      be demoralized and will let the United States impose a kind of client dictatorship,
      sort of like we have over Jordan. Well, the national interest in the Near East,
      first of all, we already know it’s centered in Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates
      and Kuwait with oil. And the aim is not only to control Near Eastern oil, but
      the money, the vast investment funds that Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states
      have accumulated in running their trade surpluses have been invested, mainly in
      the United States, in treasury bonds and in stocks and bonds. And this investment
      is sort of holding them hostage. Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states are really
      afraid to come to Iran’s support, even though they realize that the attack on
      Iran is to consolidate American control over the Near East. Because if they acted
      against U.S. interests, all of their foreign investment, their national funds
      and their private investments are held hostage by New York and London. Just as
      the United States confiscated 300 billion of Russia’s savings in the West, they
      could do the same with Near Eastern holdings. But it goes much further than that.
      To the United States, Iran is not only the key to controlling the Near East and
      its oil, but also for China’s Belt and Road program through a new Silk Road of
      railway transport to the West. That’s the map. If the United States can block
      this road, then China’s attempt to create a new Silk Road by railway will not
      be able to link up with Europe and the Silk Road will not be able to go all the
      way to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, as China hoped to do. You can see there,
      it goes from Western China through Central Asia to Iran. Well, the same thing,
      the same logic appears with Russia. And Iran is the key to blocking Russian development
      via the Caspian and access to the south. Under U.S. control, an Iranian client
      regime could threaten Russia from its southern flank and prevent Russia from bypassing
      the Suez Canal and having direct export access to the south and all the way to
      India, as this map shows. Screenshot So Iran is the key not only to U.S. control
      of oil, but to its fight against Russia and China together. And that’s what makes
      Iran a central pivot on which the U.S. national interest in preventing the rest
      of the world from creating an alternative to financial colonialism and imperialism
      rests.. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, when it comes to the conflict that you’ve mentioned
      between Iran and Israel, do you believe that Netenyahu and his administration
      really believe that they’re playing some sort of role? As we’ve learned, they
      are just a pawn. They are being used by the United States, similarly to Ukraine.
      This doesn’t seem to be the case in the mind of Netenyahu and his administration.
      RICHARD WOLFF: Well, I have no special knowledge of the inside of what’s going
      on in Israel, but for me, it seems clear, from what I can tell, that Israel understands,
      and I think they’re right about this, that without the support of the United States,
      their situation is over. They cannot prevail against Palestine. They cannot prevail
      against anybody without the United States. And therefore, they can’t make independent
      judgments. So when I hear the United States is going to go into Iran, because
      of Israel, I don’t believe that. I mean, I don’t think the Israelis have that
      power. I don’t think they ever did. I understand they have supporters here in
      the United States who play important roles, APAC and other organizations like
      that. I’ve read that literature. I understand that. But that’s not enough. And
      they’re not big enough, even domestically, here to be able to do quite that. At
      least I don’t think so. So for me, it’s more the United States pulling the strings
      and Israel performing what it is the United States wants them to do. You know,
      if you go back historically, Israel xxx played a very, I’m going to be polite
      now, ambiguous role in South Africa during all the long years of struggle to get
      them out from under apartheid. Israel played another ambiguous role with the Contras
      in El Salvador. If you remember learning about it, Israel was asked to do all
      kinds of things to support U.S. strategies and tactics. And I think that’s what
      the deal is. We will support you so that you survive, but you have to do what
      we tell you, or else you’re on a short leash. So I think Michael’s arguments about
      why or how Iran may play a role is much more the driver of what’s going on. Israel
      is a junior partner. And, you know, it has been noted all through the Middle East
      for decades that the United States benefits because a great deal of the Arab world
      focuses on Israel and the horror of Israel and the humiliation by and from Israel.
      And this is very useful because it keeps the heat lower on the United States than
      it might otherwise be. We have a facade. It’s Israel that is the oppressor. And
      of course, now in Gaza, this has gone to lengths that the Israeli state now approaches
      a situation where its behavior is too grotesque to be salvaged by anything. I
      mean, you are digging a long-term grave of your own in Gaza, independent of what
      you do to the Palestinian people who happen to be in your way. I would say, though,
      not in disagreement with Michael, but I think we can put our two perspectives
      together. The attempt to slow down China, if you read Michael’s argument just
      a little bit differently, the effort to slow down China requires messing up the
      planned role of Iran in the Belt and Road Initiative, which, in turn, is key to
      China’s having the economic relationships that will save it from whatever damage
      the United States can do. For example, tariffs and so on. They reroute their trade
      to the rest of the BRICS. They don’t need the United States in the way they once
      did. And that’s something they’ve been working on anyway, and they continue. And
      as to the United States’ emphasis on Iran, the Belt and Road, the route of the
      train, can be changed. If you can’t go through Iran, there are other ways to proceed.
      They will be expensive. That will be a cost. The United States can slow them a
      little bit. But in the end, they would have to do a lot more. And they will try.
      They will try. They’ve been trying for a long time. They’ll continue to try. They
      have no other policy. They are not yet persuaded that they have to sit down with
      the Chinese and work out a deal. They don’t get that part. And they don’t think
      they have to do that yet. On the other hand, when they lose, even if they lose
      a little at a time, slowly the balance shifts. They lost the war in Vietnam, or
      else Vietnam might have been a very different situation. They lost the war in
      Iraq. They are losing the war in Ukraine. They lost the war in Afghanistan. They
      had all kinds of plans for those countries. Those are gone or they’re sitting
      on a shelf waiting to be resurrected at some future point in their fantasy when
      the world makes it possible. But their options are shrinking. Their freedom of
      action is shrinking. And that’s part of why they put so much emphasis on Iran,
      because it may be one of their last chances to try to stop the march of history.
      But my money is on the history. I don’t think they can do it any more than Britain.
      I don’t want to harp on it, but I think it’s relevant. Britain fought the two
      wars to prevent the runaway colony, the United States, from achieving independence
      and then from developing itself. The British tried. They tried in 1776. They tried
      again in 1812. And they were ambivalent in the American Civil War about whether
      they should side with the North or the South. But once they lost the two wars
      and once they saw which way the Civil War was going, they understood they couldn’t
      do that anymore. So they cut a deal. The first part of that deal was the Monroe
      Doctrine, which had very little to do with Mr. Monroe. It had to do with the fact
      that the British said, okay, okay, okay. You don’t bother us in Asia and Africa,
      and we won’t bother you in South America. In other words, they made a deal. I
      don’t admire it, I understand it’s the quintessence of colonialism. It’s like
      in 1884 when they sat down in Berlin and carved up Africa among the participating
      European countries. The same thing, but it is the recognition that repressing
      the United States wasn’t going to work. And to the credit of the British and the
      Americans, they held to that plan even as their roles were reversed. From the
      United States being a minor colony of Britain, today we have Britain a minor colony
      of the United States, and the British have no option, no choice, and are behaving
      in just the way we would imagine. Hopeless economic decline, horrible politics,
      and abuse of the working class on a scale that even other European countries do
      not allow, at least not yet. Extraordinary. It’s really extraordinary. NIMA ALKHORSHID:
      Go ahead, Michael. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I think that Richard is quite right in
      the way that he’s framed the issue that the United States indeed has lost the
      wars that he’s mentioned. But this fight with Iran has become, in its turn, an
      issue for framing the U.S. plans for a vast new military buildup. And you can
      see it’s a crazy plan. The ease with which Iranian missiles have been able to
      penetrate Israel’s iron dome defense has shown the whole folly of Trump’s pressure
      for an enormous trillion-dollar subsidy for the American military-industrial complex
      to make a similar boondoggle here. So far, only the oldest and least effective
      Iranian missiles have been used because their aim is to deplete Israel’s anti-missile
      defenses so that in a few days, a week at most, Israel will be unable to block
      any serious Iranian attack with its really big hypersonic missiles. Well, this
      already was demonstrated a few months ago when Iran showed how easily it could
      bomb not only Israel with demonstration, but it could bomb U.S. military bases,
      even when it gave them advanced knowledge. Here is where we’re going to send,
      you know, the missiles are not going to explode, they’re not going to blow up
      your soldiers, but we’re just going to show you how easily we can get right through
      your defenses. Well, the center point of Trump’s Republican budget that is now
      in Congress for enormously increasing the U.S. deficit, increasing the United
      States debt, and official government debt is based on the need to essentially
      say, oh, it’s all for Israel. And just as Richard said, they’re using Israel as
      an excuse to try to deflect foreign anger away from the United States, “Yeah,
      focus on Israel. It’s all Israel’s doing, not our doing, even though we’re supplying
      Israel with bombs and doing everything that Richard described.” So I want to explain
      the congressional dynamics in giving Trump the right to actually declare war on
      Iran. This is the constitutional fight in Congress. A president is not supposed
      to go to war without getting the support of Congress. Trump has not got that yet.
      Congress has not passed a pro-war authorization for Trump to do this. So we’re
      in a constitutional crisis in the United States now that Trump is simply ignoring,
      as he’s ignored the Constitution in other ways, saying, “Well, what are you going
      to do about it?” There’s not much that they’re doing. So the U.S. military budget
      is being vastly increased by this crazy American iron dome plan here. The Reagan
      administration had toyed with this beam the bomb attempt to say, “Oh, well, we
      can get lasers, huge lasers to blow up any kind of Russian or other foreign missile
      attack on us.” Well, that was shown to be unworkable, but it cost a lot of money
      and profits for the military-industrial complex. Well, not only is the military
      budget vastly increasing, forcing the U.S. into deficit, but the military budget
      is only half of what the United States is actually paying on military because
      American foreign military aid to its allies, Ukraine, Israel, South Korea, Europe,
      and Asian countries, to buy U.S. arms all appears as foreign aid, not as part
      of the U.S. military budget. The U.S. is concealing the enormous cost of this
      new Cold War buildup to the American economy. And this cost of the war is doing
      here just what it’s doing in Germany and Europe. It’s forcing a cutback of social
      programs, a cutback in medical insurance, and Medicaid is part of the bill. We’re
      having a polarization of spending towards the financial 1% at the top of the economic
      pyramid, with tax cuts and with a payment to the military complex (MIC), not only
      by direct contracts, but by all of this foreign aid that is immediate. The dollars
      for foreign aid don’t ever leave the United States. They’re paid directly to the
      military to provide the arms that the recipients of this foreign military aid
      have received in order to so-called “Defend themselves,” with all sorts of boondoggles
      connected to it. So that’s really the constitutional problem. And I want to, just
      in passing, mention one other constitutional issue. Article 51 of the UN Charter
      says that a member state may not attack another state unless it’s attacked by
      that country. The U.S. is violating the UN Charter as well as its own domestic
      policy. The 2001 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) in America
      is not applicable to this because the United States hasn’t been under attack.
      The U.S. is attacking or planning to attack Iran. So the whole body of law, the
      whole context that was supposedly put in place to have the United States create
      a post-World War II order of world peace and trade and investment has been torn
      apart by this. And it’s torn apart, again, by the pretense that the war in Iran
      is in America’s national interest because our interest is preventing any attempt
      by other countries to withdraw from the U.S.-centered financial system. Any attempt
      to de-dollarize their economies, Trump has said, will be met with enormous tariffs
      on these countries. This fight goes way beyond simply bombing Iran. I think Richard’s
      introductory comment said, this is like the final struggle between Western hegemony,
      way beyond military colonialism, between Western hegemony and the global majority
      seeking to break free and follow its own national self-interest. NIMA ALKHORSHID:
      Richard? RICHARD WOLFF: Let me add a couple of things that are different topics,
      but I’ll show you how they link. The United States, as most countries, as most
      people who follow know, has got one of the worst crime problems in the world.
      We have guns, as everybody knows, and we use them, as everybody knows. And more
      people are shot, either killed or injured by guns in criminal activities of one
      kind or another every year. Nonetheless, we have always required that police officers
      whose job it is to deal with that problem have a badge that must be visible so
      that anyone they arrest or anyone who observes them can get their name and their
      badge number and they are not allowed to refuse a request for that information.
      We now have a militarized police force, the ICE, which is allowed to wear masks
      and to refuse to identify itself. Okay, what are you doing if no one in their
      right mind could suggest that the immigrant population, documented or otherwise,
      represents a threat to the American people more urgent or more immediate than
      gun crime? We don’t allow the police to deal with gun crime by officers who have
      masks and don’t have to identify themselves, but we are doing that with immigrants.
      And we have endless displays of ICE agents surrounding a farmer in the field,
      a car wash worker in the corner car wash, a person who does the dishes in the
      back of a restaurant or cleans the hotel room-the glorious jobs that our immigrants
      are supposed to be taking from us. So what are you doing with police, who are
      not required to follow the rules of a civilized society the way the police are
      who are asked to deal with violent armed criminals? Wow. Wow. This ought to be
      front and center a big problem. Why isn’t it? Well, I would argue that we now
      have a population that the people who run this country believe can be treated
      this way. And I think it is very naive to imagine that if you’re going to behave
      towards perfectly non-dangerous people… I read today of a farmer in California
      who works in the vineyards, you know, the wine country, being surrounded at his
      church while he’s doing his religious activity, surrounded by ICE people, yanked
      away. His children and his wife do not know where he is. The ICE does not tell
      them where he’s going and does not allow him access to his own family or to the
      lawyer they have procured. You know, to think that this kind of behavior unloaded
      on these people would not be applied next to others. Well, you can already see
      there are already all kinds of signs of the ideological right wing wanting to
      make that application. Before the huge demonstrations last Saturday, I watched
      a sheriff somewhere in Florida; I don’t remember the name, explaining on television
      that if any of those protesters come here and they don’t do what we tell them,
      we will shoot them. We will kill you, says the man in full uniform who is the
      police chief of this jurisdiction. Okay, if you’re a responsible leader, you know
      that among the people who take instructions from you lower, are people whose understanding
      of boundaries is, let’s say, underdeveloped and who will misunderstand what you’re
      saying as a license to persecute people. You know, Mr. Netanyahu doesn’t give
      the order, but below him are the people who bomb hospitals. It’s remarkable where
      we are being led. And you know, it’s possible that that isn’t orchestrated, but
      it is also possible that it is, and that there is a notion here that one needs
      to prepare the American people for a long period of war, as all of these battles
      are fought out, just in case it turns out that you can’t bunker bomb your way
      out of the morass of Iran. I do want to remind people, because I think many don’t
      know, that Iran is a very large country in a way that Afghanistan and Vietnam
      and others aren’t or weren’t. This is a different kind of enemy. We haven’t had
      that before, and we didn’t do well in Vietnam and Afghanistan and Iraq. And I
      want to remind people: we didn’t do well, even though the United States is the
      most militarily armed country in the world and among the richest. And those enemies,
      Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, were among the poorest countries on this planet, and
      they won and we lost. That itself should make you worry that there’s a larger
      historical process going on here that you maybe ought to ask some questions about
      rather than to assume. And I am very worried that if this goes badly for Israel
      and for Iran, it will only serve to persuade that part of the country that supports
      this activity to support more of it. It’s that old problem-If the plan doesn’t
      succeed, you have to do more of it. If it doesn’t succeed again, you have to do
      still more. Whereas the rest of us are saying, see, this is not a good plan. No,
      no, no, no, no. And those lines have been drawn in this country now pretty well.
      And the support for Mr. Trump, even though I also will note that there are now
      quite a few people in Mr. Trump’s MAGA organizations who do not want this war
      in Iran. Tucker Carlson speaks out against it. The strange woman from Georgia,
      Greene, speaks out against it. Steve Bannon speaks out against it. Okay, these
      are very serious dissenters, and they have a fairly strong following. Now Mr.
      Trump has to deal with the damage to his own movement of moving in this direction.
      But of course, he has to worry about the damage if he doesn’t. And that’s what
      happens to you when you’re on the wrong side of a historical process. You can’t
      find anything that solves your problem. You’re reduced to picking the one with
      the least damage to your situation, but damage you’re going to have. MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Well, Richard’s point is that we’re living in a lawless country, lawless domestically
      as well as internationally. And his other point is that it’s self-defeating. You
      could look at Trump’s plan to bomb Iran as a tactic in this plan of U.S. hegemony,
      but it’s a tactic that is at the expense of long-term strategy. It’s self-defeating.
      And just as the American-NATO plan in Ukraine to bleed Russia and to impose sanctions
      on Russia backfired and had just the opposite effect of increasing Russia’s self-sufficiency
      and strategy, every tactical move that the United States has employed has impaired
      any possible success of its long-term strategy in actually locking other countries
      into the U.S. dollarized international order. Obviously, what is happening now
      has created such a revulsion among other countries, as you can see in the United
      Nations discussions and the vote to censure Israel. And it should be to censure
      the Trump administration and the Biden administration for fully backing it and
      enabling its genocide. You can see that the effect is to speed up and catalyze
      the breakaway of 85% of the global majority from the U.S.-NATO center that had
      been the old colonialism. Since we’re almost over, I just want to say one thing
      about how I see what’s happening in Iran. I don’t think that Trump is going to
      bomb it while the stock market is still open. Remember, after our show last Thursday,
      we thought, “Well, is the United States buildup in the Middle East simply trying
      to be a negotiating tactic to tell Iran, ‘Look, we’re really serious’?” Well,
      then you had the Israeli attack on Iran that had been obviously planned for almost
      a year. The Israeli attack on Iran was not mainly from Israel. It was within Iran
      by Israeli agents and U.S. agents and British agents that had prepared the attack
      on the defense facilities that Iran had against air attacks. The Israeli attempts
      at air attacks have not been successful from Israel, only by local bomb owners.
      So I think that the United States is going to make a more serious attempt to attack.
      But last weekend, when the Israeli attacks began, the pre-trading of U.S. stocks
      and oil prices showed the stock market was going to go down on Monday. The oil
      prices were going to go up. But when trading opened, the stock market was up and
      actually went up. And oil prices went down, not up. There’s a kind of blindness
      in the hundreds of billions of dollars of investors that actually believe that
      all of this is going to blow over and that the United States will successfully
      be able to lock in its control of the world’s financial system, trading system,
      and military supremacy. They believe that they will be able to defeat China, Russia,
      and Iran, who are leading post-colonialism, the global south, and the rest of
      the countries that had been colonized by Europe. But remember, before the actual
      colonization, which was primarily in the late 19th century, you already had the
      newly independent republics from Latin America, Haiti, Greece, Egypt, and Tunisia
      all run into debt dependency. They all issued bonds that almost immediately defaulted
      and led to the Europeans imposing monetary commissions to take control of the
      fiscal policy of these countries. This was independent of colonialism. This was
      a purely financial character. The European control of debtor countries already
      at that time was pioneered. This is what the United States is trying to continue
      today. Not only colonialism explicitly of a military character by appointing direct
      control of governments, but financial control and dollarization. That’s what is
      ultimately thought about by the United States. And as I said, I spent my 30s,
      the 1970s, in describing all this through my book, Super Imperialism, which explained
      all of this. And that was the Defense Department, the State Department, the White
      House, and the Treasury all followed exactly the logic that I’d spelled out in
      Super Imperialism, which I’d hoped would actually create a reaction against this.
      The U.S. government strategists used it as a how-to-do-it book instead. So that
      showed me at that time how all of the exploitation that we’re seeing today was
      being put in place already in the early 1970s. RICHARD WOLFF: If I could just
      add one final thing, Nima, I know we’re running out of time. Michael’s comment
      makes me want to reiterate once again, so we don’t miss it: the utter irrelevance
      of Europe to all that is going on here. Look, every strategist that I’ve read
      knows that if damage is done to Iran, one of the things Iran will do is close
      the Straits of Hormuz there, through which something like a quarter of the oil
      traffic in the world has to pass, and which couldn’t pass if they blocked it or
      threatened it with missiles in the way that the Houthis have been doing nearby.
      And who relies on the oil going through the Suez Canal and so forth? It’s the
      Europeans. Where are they? They can’t handle another inflation of their energy
      cost. They can’t handle the one they’re living through now. They worry each year
      about whether they get through the winter. That’s where they are. Their industry
      is hemorrhaging while they wait for the hammer to drop on the tariffs. I mean,
      it’s too much. You are overstraining these societies, and they have nothing to
      say. They’re not at the relevant meeting, they’re not part of the relevant decision-making.
      They will, of course, live with the consequences. The United States will escape
      many of them. So it’s again, it’s a testimony. And if I’m right that we’re looking
      at the end of colonialism, then for Europe, it is the end that has already happened.
      They are whatever the opposite is of on top of the situation; they are underneath
      the situation. As the sparks explode, their houses will be set on fire. But other
      than watching it all, they have no role to play. It’s an extraordinary step and
      moment in the history of colonialism’s decline from its origins in Europe. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, I have to point out that China and India are also very major customers
      of Iranian oil. And that has led to some discussion. Well, is Iran really going
      to sink a ship in the Gulf of Hormuz and impair China? And we know that China
      has been sending airplanes to Iran. I have no idea at all what China’s policy
      will be. But the Americans are willing to create this anarchy for Europe that
      Richard has just pointed out in order to say, “Well, look at how it’s going to
      hurt China.” And, of course, it’ll also hurt India. And I don’t know how that’s
      going to affect Indian-U.S. relations. But the disruption is going to be global,
      way beyond Europe. It’ll affect all of Asia and South East Asia and South Asia.
      And the United States will be able to remain largely immune in the sense that
      it is independent in oil, but its stock market and financial markets are not independent.
      And the effect on the United States won’t be an inability to get oil, but the
      fact that oil prices are going to go way up, pushing up inflation here as well
      – exactly what Trump has said that he’d wanted to avoid. So it’s going to destabilize
      the U.S. economy just as much as the European, Chinese, and Indian economies.
      NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you so much, Richard and Michael. Great pleasure, as always.

    paragraph_summary: In a discussion on June 19, 2025, Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson
      analyzed the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, particularly in light
      of Israel's recent attack on Iran just before the U.S. announced its intention
      to engage in talks with Iran. Wolff articulated his perspective that the current
      geopolitical climate reflects the decline of centuries-long European colonialism,
      which had previously facilitated capitalism's growth by exploiting global resources
      and labor. He emphasized that the historical narrative of colonization, often
      justified by notions of civilizing missions, is coming to an end, suggesting that
      the dynamics of capitalism are shifting as the sources of cheap labor and materials
      become less accessible, echoing themes discussed by economic theorists like Adam
      Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx regarding the inherent contradictions and
      eventual decline of capitalist systems.

      – Glenn Diesen GLENN DIESEN: Hi everyone and welcome. Today we are joined by Michael
      Hudson, Professor of Economy, to discuss the strategies for the American Empire.
      Now when we look at empire we tend often to look at military capabilities and
      deployment but as we know empires also require an economic foundation. So to explore
      this we’re gonna look into one of Professor Michael Hudson’s great books, that
      is Super Imperialism, the economic strategy of American Empire. So I will put
      a link to the book in the description. So please make sure to have a look and
      yeah welcome back to the program. MICHAEL HUDSON: Thanks for having me Glenn.
      GLENN DIESEN: And yeah after we address the, we’ll look at the economic strategy
      for the American Empire, would be interesting to get your take on how some of
      these economic foundations are, well, less stable now than they were when your
      first version of this book came out. But I thought a good place to start would
      be how you see the, well, what you name one of the sections of your book, the
      birth of the American World Order. What is the foundation for the economic strategy
      of the American Empire? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the Americans never attempted, apart
      from the War of 1898, they have not attempted military overt colonialism in the
      sense that Europe did. It has turned out to be financial colonialism and financial
      imperialism. And the actual attempt to create an empire as such wasn’t really
      implemented until 1944 and 1945 when World War II ended. But the roots of all
      of it were found at the end of World War I, when the settlement of World War I
      ended up imposing American demands for repayment of the war debts that the United
      States had lent to Britain, France, and other allies before the United States
      had entered the war. Well, when the war ended, the Europeans expected what would
      be normal practice and what was the practice after the Napoleonic Wars, for instance,
      that the Allies would forgive the debts to each other because this was all supposed
      to be part of the war effort, not only supplying armies, but supplying the funds,
      the money to buy the arms. But the United States said, well, we agree with you.
      Of course, we will not think of charging you for all the expenses of the war once
      we entered it on your side against Germany. But before we entered the war, that
      was something else. We were a neutral party, and we expect you to pay the war
      debts that you took on. A debt is a debt. Well, the Allies then turned on Germany
      and said, Well, we don’t want to have to pay the debts to the United States. Quite
      frankly, we don’t have the money to pay the debts that the United States has calculated
      that we owed. We’ll make Germany pay reparations. And by 1921-22, when all of
      this was set up, that essentially became the rule. So I have to say that Europe
      was somewhat complicit in this. All of the European countries, including Germany,
      believed that a debt was a debt. And if that was the official debt, if it was
      the reparations imposed on Germany to pay for the war by the Allies against it,
      was clearly beyond its ability. All of the parties in Germany, even the Social
      Democrats and the anti-war parties, agreed that the debts had to be repaid. Well,
      we know the result. Germany had only one way to pay because it had lost its main,
      most productive steel industry, its lands, Alsace de Lorraine. It was financially
      crippled by the Versailles Treaty. And the only way that it could pay the debts
      were to throw Reichsmarks, its currency, onto the foreign exchange market to buy
      the dollars, what ended up the dollars, to repay its debts to the Allies that
      the Allies simply passed on to the United States as their payment of the inter-ally
      debts. Well, the result is that Germany had a hyperinflation. The United States
      didn’t want to enable Germany to earn the money to pay the Allies, to pay its,
      because that would have threatened American industry. So the United States passed
      a tariff against importing currencies with depreciating currencies, namely Germany.
      So Germany was left without any way of paying. What happened was the American
      investors lent German cities and local states money to borrow. The cities that
      borrowed their dollars in order to fund their own local budgets turned the dollars
      over to the Reichsbank. The Reichsbank used these dollars to pay the Allies, and
      the Allies paid the United States. So what was established was a circular flow,
      and it was all based ultimately on the demand for gold. And America’s buildup
      of international power between World War I and World War II all reflected its
      increasing power of gold against which all of the major currencies were convertible.
      And during, by the time that Germany collapsed into Nazism, there was a massive
      flight capital out of Europe to the United States that led to the U.S. gold supply
      growing even more. So that by the time World War II ended, the United States controlled
      the great bulk of the world’s monetary gold. And because Europe was devastated,
      the United States was also in a position to dictate how the international trade
      and financial system was going to operate upon the return to peace. And so the
      United States used its power to create the International Monetary Fund, the World
      Bank, international trade organizations, and bilateral diplomacy, basically to
      very quickly absorb what had been the British Empire. The United States had kept
      the sterling afloat by lending sterling the money to balance its international
      payments and recover after World War II. But the condition was that Britain had
      to open the sterling area to let India and other countries that had built up their
      gold, their sterling balances during World War II to be able to spend these balances,
      not limited to British industry, but to the United States. And so the United States
      basically, there were a number of plans to try to, by John Maynard Keynes, to
      create some assurance that the post-war order wouldn’t be so unbalanced that all
      the gold and all the power would flow to the United States. The United States
      rejected them. And they created the IMF and the World Bank basically to serve
      U.S. national interests. I don’t know if you want me to go into the details. For
      instance, the World Bank was supposed to lend other countries money to develop
      their economies. But first, Europe and then what are now the Global South countries,
      they were called developing countries at that time. But the World Bank policy
      from World War II ever down to today was not to provide loans for countries to
      be self-sufficient in any kind of commodities that the United States controlled.
      And the United States balance of payments since World War II has been, was based
      very largely on food exports as well as control of the oil industry, as we’re
      seeing today. And so there was no attempt at all by the World Bank to follow the
      recommendations of its own economists. The World Bank undertook a series of country
      studies and every study that it did of Latin America or the Middle East said,
      well, you have to have land reform. You have to enable farming to do in these
      countries what the United States did in the United States with its Agricultural
      Adjustment Act, very strongly organizing government support of farming to support
      grain to become independent and be able to feed yourself. That was a prime aim
      of self-sufficiency historically. The United States, the World Bank basically
      made loans to finance international trade dependency on the United States, and
      that was where the International Monetary Fund came in. The monetary fund applied
      the same self-destructive economic philosophy that the United States and Europe
      had followed after World War I. There was a great debate after World War I between
      John Maynard Keynes in England and the anti-German economists from France and
      from the United States, saying, Yes, the debts really are not unpayable. Any country
      can pay any foreign debt volume at all if it depreciates its currency to such
      a low point that its exports become competitive. And in practice, the IMF philosophy
      is: if countries would simply lower the cost of labor, it had a labor theory of
      value, as it were, if countries can impose austerity and cut back the government
      budgets not to run a budget deficit to pump money into the economy, then deflation
      and low wages will enable these countries to pay their foreign debt. That has
      been the policy of the International Monetary Fund ever since its foundation in
      1945. And that deflationary austerity philosophy has been largely responsible
      for preventing the Global South countries and Middle Eastern and Asian countries
      from finance being able to finance themselves at the same time that they have
      to pay foreign debts to pay the loans that they had to undertake in order to finance
      their trade deficits with the United States since World War II. And as these trade
      deficits have grown and grown and grown, countries scrambled to obtain the dollars.
      And in effect, that meant the gold to pay the debts that they had to pay, putting
      the interest of foreign creditors, the United States government above all, but
      also United States bondholders and banks above their own domestic development.
      Well, you can imagine what happened to threaten this dynamic that the United States
      had put in place to make essentially to make itself the beneficiary of the division
      of labor and the specialization of production between the United States as the
      leading industrial nation and other countries as suppliers of raw materials to
      it and low-wage manufacturers. There was a kind of, it was called a dual economy
      structure. One economy for the United States and to a lesser extent Europe, and
      the other economy for countries that, the Global South countries and countries
      that were not self-sufficient. Well, what ended all of this started in 1950-51
      with the Korean War. Between the end of World War I, World War II, I’m sorry,
      between 1945 and 1950, the United States gold stock had actually increased to
      80% of the world’s monetary gold. Now, that meant that the United States owning
      gold and the insistence that all the currencies of major countries be defined
      in terms of gold meant that the United States had an overwhelming financial power.
      In 1950, for the first time, the United States moved into a balance of payments
      deficit as a result of its military spending connected to the Korean War. And
      from 1950s on, right down through the end of the 1970s, the United States moved
      into balance of payments deficit that was settled by having to pay gold to the
      countries that were receiving the dollars that the United States was throwing
      off. And the entire deficit was a result of military spending. I worked for first
      for the Chase Manhattan Bank as their balance of payments analyst, and then for
      Arthur Anderson, the accounting firm, analyzing the U.S. balance of payments,
      showing that the entire deficit was military in character. Well, you can imagine
      what happened during the Vietnam War of the late 1960s. When I was at Chase, every
      Friday morning, we would look at the Federal Reserve reporting of what is the
      U.S. gold stock doing this week. How much gold did America have to send to France
      when General de Gaulle was receiving the dollars that America was throwing off
      in what had been French Indochina, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos. These dollars were
      all sent to France that were cashed in for gold by France. Well, Germany was also
      obtaining a lot of dollars that other countries receiving, the American military
      spending, were spending on German industrial exports. So we would watch, week
      by week by week, the claims on the American gold stock rising. And it was obvious
      that if America’s Cold War spending continued at the rate it was going, at some
      point, it could not, it would run out of enough gold that was needed to legally
      cover the U.S. paper currency. Every dollar prior to 1971, the dollar bills that
      you had in your pocket had to be backed 25% by the gold supply. And by 1971, President
      Nixon realized that this was no longer the case. He closed the gold window and
      said, we cannot afford to pay the cost of our military spending in Asia and the
      whole world in gold anymore. There was some panic within the United States government.
      Well, a year after, almost to the month, a year after the United States went off
      gold in August 1971, my Superimperialism was published in, I think, August, September
      1972. And it turned out that the largest purchasers, I’m told, were the CIA and
      the Defense Department who’d bought it through the Washington bookstores. And
      my friends at Drexel Burnham, the investment bankers, came to me and said, look,
      what are you doing in academia? We’re going to invite you to address our annual
      meeting. Herman Kahn will be there. He’s going to love your presentation and he’s
      going to offer you a job. Accept it, leave academia. So indeed, I explained to
      them that the ending of America’s payment in gold did not have to mean the end
      of American power. Just the opposite, that once foreign countries no longer could
      use their dollars to spend on U.S. gold, they had only one practical choice, given
      the arrangement of international financial diplomacy at the time. What did they
      use their dollars for? They bought the safest investment there was, U.S. Treasury
      securities, Treasury bonds, Treasury bills. And so what happened that as the United
      States spent military spending abroad, it got the recipients, the, turned their
      dollars over to the central banks for their own local currency. The central banks
      invested these dollars in U.S. Treasury securities, and that financed not only
      the foreign military spending by the United States, but it financed the budget
      deficit that within the United States was primarily military in character, the
      military-industrial complex. And I pointed that what had happened was that instead
      of being a disaster by ending the United States control of the world economy through
      its gold supply, other countries really had no alternative but to have their own
      central banks themselves finance U.S. military spending domestically and foreign
      by recycling their dollars. Well, Herman Kahn hired me. I went to work for this
      Hudson Institute. He said, you know, why are you hoping that your classes of maybe
      50 graduate students at the New School are going to end up, maybe somebody’s going
      to be a senator or something later. If you join the Hudson Institute, I’ll take
      you to the White House and introduce you and we’ll get a contract and you’ll become
      a government advisor in all of this. And it seemed to make sense. And so the Defense
      Department gave the Hudson Institute an $85,000 grant, much more than I’d gotten
      as an advance for Superimperialism, for me to go back and forth to the War College
      and to walk to the White House and other venues to explain what I just said. That
      the U.S. dollar standard that I called the Treasury Bill Standard of international
      finance had replaced the gold standard and that essentially locked other countries
      into the financial support of American spending abroad. And that going off gold
      essentially removed the limit on military spending. I gave one talk at the White
      House to Treasury officials with Herman Kahn, and we said, gold is, you can think
      of it as the peaceful metal, because if other countries have to pay their balance
      of payments deficits in gold, any country waging war, any country entailing a
      very major military expenditure abroad and to fight a war, always entails running
      a big deficit, is going to have to run out of gold and lose its power in a system
      that’s based on gold. Well, immediately the Treasury people said, well, we don’t
      want that. We don’t want that because it’s America that is going to war. It’s
      America that’s spending almost all of the world’s military budget. And we don’t
      want gold to play a role in any system that the United States cannot control.
      And we can’t control gold outflows if we have to convert our dollars into gold.
      So, actually, to deprive other countries of any ability to cash in their dollars
      into gold means they’ve been co-opted into a financial system. And it’s at that
      point that America truly became an empire because the entire world’s financial
      system and it was therefore its tax system, its fiscal system, its money creation
      was basically directed by the U.S. Treasury to finance the costs of what America
      claimed were the needs of its empire in creating its 800 military bases all over
      the world and then waging the wars that it’s been fighting since the 1970s. And
      that is until this year, other countries were willing to be part of this system
      because the facts of geopolitics led them to support the U.S. military spending,
      but also because there wasn’t an alternative. Well, today, with President Trump’s
      budget that he and the Republicans have sent to Congress, the American debt, domestic
      debt, has been so great, and it’s foreign debt to foreign central banks and to
      foreign investors, including private quasi-government funds such as Saudi Arabia
      and Norway, have realized that the foreign debt that central banks hold that was
      supposed to be as good as gold and the safest asset to buy cannot be paid. There
      is no way that the United States can or would or is willing to somehow pay the
      amount of money that other countries hold as loans to the United States, mainly
      treasury bills, but also U.S. agencies, Fannie Mae, government agencies pay a
      little bit more than the Treasury, and even corporate securities such as Saudi
      Arabia holds and Norway holds. There is no way that America is willing to pay
      these debts either by exporting because it’s deindustrialized and it’s not running
      an export service anymore or by selling off its industry to foreign buyers. The
      United States until 19 this year has said that if foreign countries could not
      pay their finance, their balance of payments deficits, they had to do so by privatizing
      their public utilities, selling off their infrastructure to foreigners, selling
      off their mineral rights, selling off their land to foreign investors. The United
      States is not willing to do what it’s insisted that other countries do as the
      basis of world trade and investment that it’s created. So other countries realize
      this double standard, that they’re really not getting savings that can be converted
      into ownership of U.S. industry or agriculture or infrastructure or anything else.
      They’re just paper dollars. And so for the first time, you’re having a move to
      seek alternative to the U.S. dollars. Well, the only alternative so far that people
      can agree upon is gold. And when Herman Kahn and I went to the White House in
      1973, Herman brought a map of the world. And there was a map of countries that
      trusted governments. And that was Northern Europe, Europe as a whole, the United
      States, the English-speaking countries, countries whose populations did not trust
      governments. Well, you could call them the global majority. Most people didn’t.
      Then he had countries that supported the gold, the commodity money. Well, there
      were countries like India, Asia, Global South countries. They wanted something
      secure, not an IOU. The countries that trusted paper money were Northern Europe
      and the English-speaking countries. So you have this faith in paper money that
      is a debt is a debt. And that was the principle on which America began to accumulate
      gold after World War I. But the United States, certainly the current budget that
      is before Congress is saying, well, yes, a debt is a debt on the balance sheet.
      Yes, on the balance sheet, we owe foreign countries more money than there’s any
      way we can see can be repaid. But that’s it. It’s a debt that never will be repaid.
      It’s as if you went to the grocery store and tried to pay in an IOU, and the grocery
      store would say, well, you run up, put a tab in the last week. You know, you got
      to pay. And the customer will say, well, I can’t pay. But you can use this debt
      to maybe you can give this IOU to the farm that’s giving you the eggs and the
      dairy or the vegetables that you’re selling. And somehow, if only this IOU could
      be circulated as a claim on the customer, then it would be technically be a debt.
      Well, a lot of the financial system and the world financial system is now based
      on that kind of debt that there’s no ability to pay it, behind it. And that is
      what has become the key, you could say, to American empire, because it’s the key
      to America’s ability to spend abroad and be really the first nation in history
      that does not have to pay its war debts or other debts that it has run up to foreign
      countries. That’s the double standard that America has been able to achieve to
      make it the unique nations or the indispensable nation. And that is why, right
      now, other countries are buying gold, and you can see the gold price going up
      and why they’re trying to realize: well, we can’t spend all of our dollar holdings
      on gold. Isn’t there some way we can create an alternative paper currency owed
      by other countries? Well, you have the BRICS talking about that. And you really
      can’t have such a currency by other countries because to issue a currency, you
      need a parliament to say, well, who’s going to get the benefit of this currency?
      And if you issue the currency, what’s it going to be spent on? Who’s going to
      spend it? You’d have to have something like a real Europe deciding who’s going
      to get the result of Euros that are being created, except the United States created
      the Eurozone in a way that it really can’t run enough of a deficit to recover
      from the downturn that it’s now been forced into. So, the world is in a quandary.
      And that’s what my Superimperialism is all about. And I’ve tried to update it
      to the present, but that’s the basic theme. GLENN DIESEN: Well, I find this to
      be fascinating that the U.S. initially, the massive power after World War II,
      obviously based on America’s position as a credit nation. And obviously, yeah,
      the military forces, privileged position in the World Bank, IMF, the U.S dollar.
      But it’s quite unique, though, isn’t it, that it became its, as a deficit country,
      its growing debt became the source for further imperial strength. But nonetheless,
      this seems to have always been a temporary model. I do remember back in the 90s
      and early 2000s when you had political leaders in Washington arguing that, well,
      actually, our debt is a sign of strength. It shows that the world trusts our economy
      and trusts our currency. However, this, if it’s not sustainable, at some point
      you’ll hit a wall. And I looked at the debt clock this morning and it’s almost
      running into 37 trillion and this rise only intensifies. So at some point you
      do need alternatives which appear to be emerging. You also mentioned, you said
      facts of geopolitics. I guess one of the facts of geopolitics during the Cold
      War was simply that the main two rivals, be it the Soviets and the Chinese, were
      economist states, largely decoupled from this kind of economic statecraft, while
      the allies of the United States in the capitalist world all had to prioritize,
      as you said, the facts of geopolitics. That is, you couldn’t really, you couldn’t
      allow too much economic squabbles go along. So, you know, there were some incentives
      to prevent rivalry between the capitalist industrial nations as you’ve had prior
      to World War II. But where are we heading now, though? Because, again, the debt
      model seems to have exhausted itself and the facts of geopolitics have changed.
      Now you have the key rivals, be it China, Russia, and others, who are also embracing
      economic statecraft. How are the foundations, I guess, of the American empire
      eroding? MICHAEL HUDSON: The debt model has not exhausted itself. And Trump has
      given a number of speeches, and Congress has backed him up, saying any country
      that is moving to establish an alternative to the dollar, we’re going to hit with
      special tariffs, up to 500% even. He said, any attempt by countries to shift out
      of the dollar to the Chinese payment system towards China will be treated as an
      enemy and we will block their access to the United States market. What he’s, he
      realizes that America’s power is no longer a creditor country, but its power is
      precisely because it’s a debtor country. Keynes made a joke saying that if you
      owe $1,000 to a bank, then you’re in trouble. If you owe $1 billion to the bank,
      the bank’s in trouble. And that’s the United States’ strength. It owes so much
      money to other countries that if it doesn’t pay, for instance, if it grabs the
      Russian savings that were held in the United States and in Brussels, it’ll confiscate
      it, then the savings poof, disappear. The debt is basically annulled. The United
      States is unwilling to annul Global South debt that can’t be paid, but it has
      any attempt by countries to break away from the United States dollar and the dollarization
      is treated as an act of war. Now, that was explained to me by the Treasury Secretary
      already in 1974 and 75 with the oil war when Saudi Arabia and the OPEC countries
      quadrupled the price of oil in response to the United States quadrupling the price
      of grain. And the United States told them that if they could charge whatever price
      of oil they wanted to, that was fine with the United States because the United
      States controlled much of the world oil industry, including the domestic oil production.
      And the United States oil companies had a price umbrella as the price of oil went.
      However, the condition for letting OPEC countries raise the price of oil was that
      all of their export earnings would be recycled into the United States. It didn’t
      have to be only in treasury securities. It could be in stocks and bonds, but only
      a minority ownership. So the Saudi kings bought, I think, a billion dollars of
      every stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They spread their savings over
      the U.S. bond and stock market in a way that did not involve any ability to control
      the companies whose stocks they owned, in contrast to most stockholders who try
      to have some voice in the company’s management. So that’s the situation we have
      today. Imagine what’s happening in the Near East now when Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
      the United Arab Republics all own, have huge holdings of U.S. securities. They’ve
      seen the United States grab Russia’s savings. They’ve seen the United States through
      England confiscate Venezuela’s oil gold holdings and the Bank of England. And
      the whole process began with the Iranian Khomeini, the Iranian revolution against
      the Shah when Iran tried to pay the interest due on its foreign debt and Chase
      Manhattan refused to make the payment. Iran was counted as default and immediately
      foreclosed upon. The rest of the Near Eastern countries that are major holders
      of American debt are locked in to, they’re fearful of acting in any way that would
      oppose the current fight U.S. buildup against Iran because anything they do, whether
      it’s to support the Palestinians or to support Iran or anything that is at odds
      with US diplomacy in the Near East would result in the United States holding all
      of their savings in its own pocket under their control able to freeze them or
      confiscate them at will. That’s the power that America has as a debtor over other
      countries and that’s why Trump has said, any attempt to de-dollarize is an act
      of war today just as they were told 50 years ago in countries were told way back
      in 1974, 75. GLEN DIESEN: Well, there’s also an old truth though that is any system
      which becomes too dependent on coercion will eventually begin to, I guess, degrade
      over time and there’s,  well the the whole thing that the the whole world, that
      America owes money to the whole world so America sits on their piggy bank or their
      savings and can’t take it whenever they want. It’s it seems as as if it only works
      to such an extent and I can appreciate the theft of the Venezuelan gold and all
      of this but it looked as looked as if the stealing the Russian sovereign funds
      was really one step too far because when there’s no trust anymore in the system,
      it can’t really work. And we see not just the opponents such as China being worried
      because they know they’re never going to get all their money back but also countries
      like India are concerned about secondary sanctions and other American allies.
      So, how long can this, I guess, new changing character of the American empire
      continue? Because, well, from my perspective, one of the key things driving China
      these days is exactly the search for alternatives because they are preparing themselves
      for an almost never-ending trade war with the United States, and they can’t really
      outsource everything from their financial stability to the goodwill of the United
      States. So, surely the rest of the world are looking for alternatives to escape
      U.S. financial control. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you’ve summarized the dilemma perfectly.
      Trust is gone, but so far there’s no alternative. So, the answer to your question
      is to how long this system can last until there’s an alternative. And that’s why
      the United States’ foreign policy now to maintain what you could call its financial
      empire and control of world trade and investment is based on preventing any alternative
      that might come, be developed. Obviously, the countries running the strongest
      balance of payments and trade surpluses are the logical sponsors of such an alternative,
      China, oil-producing countries. This is why the United States has designated China.
      And any country that looks powerful enough to create an alternative is viewed
      as an enemy. And the U.S. tries to prevent and preempt their creating an alternative
      form of international monetary savings by imposing sanctions on them, that are
      counterproductive, but it’s the United States strategy, or trying to organize
      European diplomacy and diplomacy of its proxies and satellites to somehow delay
      this development that, as you point out, it’s inevitable. Yes, someday the United
      States cannot get a free lunch anymore. And the first step in preventing a free
      lunch is for other countries to recognize that there is a free lunch and that
      they’re essentially giving up money that loses their control over it and actually
      funds the United States willing to take aggressive actions against them if they
      do anything to try to ensure real value for their money. Well, the question is,
      how long can the U.S. ability to control German politicians, European politicians,
      Asian politicians, especially OPEC country politicians, how long can it actually
      threaten them to live in the short run? In the long run, they realize the U.S.
      cannot do it. But living in the short run, they can do tactics. The problem is
      that the tactics that they’re using are so heavy-handed that they’re the opposite
      of strategy. The more they go to tactics of enforcing and threatening and bullying
      other countries, the more they’re destroying the strategy of actually making the
      United States a sufficiently viable economy to promise to actually have something
      to repay other countries with. I think the U.S. plan is what the Trump administration
      hoped for, is that America can create an internet monopoly, a computer monopoly,
      an artificial intelligence monopoly, a chip-making monopoly, and somehow use its
      monopoly earnings to reverse the balance of payments deficit and reestablish world
      power. That’s a pipe dream because, in order to achieve technological dominance,
      you need research and development. And because the financial sector and corporations,
      the private corporations that are supposed to be developing this technological
      lead, live in the short run, they’re using most of their income for Apple and
      the other countries and buying off their own stocks and paying out as dividends
      to support their stock prices. The way in which the American economy is being
      financialized is actually undercutting its ability to maintain its financial power
      over the world because it’s resulted in deindustrializing the United States economy
      that makes other countries feel even more queasy about what’s happening to their
      savings invested here and what on earth can they do. So, what you’ve seen in the
      last two weeks, last month, is something very surprising. The United States’ interest
      rates have been going up and up, but the dollar has been going down. This is the
      first time in history that when a country has raised its interest rates, like
      the United States, it actually loses. There’s an outflow of currency instead of
      attracting other countries to the world. An arbitrage. As European and Asian countries
      say, well, we can make a higher interest rate by borrowing cheap in our countries
      and buying these high-yielding Treasury, 10-year Treasury securities at 4.5% interest.
      Well, all of a sudden, it doesn’t work anymore. And that is what is panicking
      the Treasury and people who are actually trying to figure out how are we going
      to pay. The United States is turning into the condition that England was in after
      World War II of limping along and being unable to survive. The difference is that
      there, right now, is no alternative that European and Near Eastern countries are
      willing to accept as long as they refuse to accept China and Asia and Russia as
      an alternative. That’s exactly what is underlying the war of America’s insistence
      of the new Cold War, saying that China is our existential enemy. We are going
      to try to drain Russia’s economy by the war in Ukraine. We’re doing everything
      we can to disrupt the ability of other countries to be an attractive alternative
      to the dollar. This attempt to maintain dollarization and prevent de-dollarization
      and therefore ending the Treasury Bill standard in a way that America cannot benefit
      either from the Treasury Bill standard or a gold standard. This is the key to
      understanding not only American diplomacy, but the American military action against
      Iran today is part of its attempt to control the entire Near East, partly using
      Israel as its proxy and ISIS and Al-Qaeda in Syria and Iraq as its proxies. This
      is the key to why you have such a seemingly bizarre international military situation.
      How on earth would it can, people are saying, how is Iran a threat to the United
      States? Well, it’s a threat to the United States because it exists, and the United
      States does not control it as the key to controlling the overall Near East and
      all of the balance of trade surplus that Near Eastern oil draws in from the rest
      of the world. That’s what makes the United States think of Iran, the war in Iran,
      and the destruction of Iran as being in the United States’ interest. It’s the
      role of Iran as the last potential alternative in the Near East to U.S. control
      of making the Near East a client economy, like it made Latin American economies
      clients for so many years. #49:48 GLENN DIESEN: But this is the only path out
      of the current dilemma: that is either establish some important tech monopolies
      in this new industrial revolution or establish, I guess, quasi-colony around the
      world. I mean, it just appears that all of these initiatives, even if one is optimistic,
      amounts to just kicking the can down the road. What are possible pathways? I mean,
      if you would write a sequel to your book now on super imperialism, where could
      the United States go from here if you want something more sustainable? Because
      it appears that the tech leadership is not going to monopolize on anything with
      the presence of China and it’s also these colonies. Obviously, it’s not going
      to be able to make a colony out of Iran either, it seems. So, what exactly are
      we looking at? Well, if you would have a not an attractive option for an academic,
      but if you would have a chapter of future speculation where we’re heading, what
      would you see? MICHAEL HUDSON: The only way that the United States can remain
      a solvent economy is to give up the attempt to run the world with an empire. Empires
      do not pay. That’s the lesson of history. Empires cost a lot of money, and in
      the end, the imperial power goes broke, just as Britain went broke with its empire,
      ending up turning its monetary power over to the United States. The French Empire
      went under. Empires don’t pay. The only way the United States can exist is by
      reindustrializing. That means definancializing its economy. You point out that
      we’re living in the short run. How do we move to the long run? The financial sector
      lives in the short run. As long as the United States economy has shifted its central
      planning away from government to Wall Street and to the other financial centers,
      these financial centers have a timeframe of three months to a year. They’re looking
      at what is the stock price doing for this quarter, because that’s what the bonuses
      of the chief financial officer and the CEOs are based on, their stock price. So
      you’re having an economic mentality in the United States that is essentially the
      neoliberal mentality of living in the short run, making money financially instead
      of in a productive industrial, agriculture, and commercial way. So the United
      States would have to be just another country, like all other countries. It would
      have to be an equal. There would have to be a parity between the United States
      and other countries, all following the same set of rules. That is anathema to
      Congress. There’s still a nationalism, a populist nationalism here that says we
      don’t want to be another country. We don’t want to have to live by the rules that
      other countries live by. We want to continue to be able to dominate other countries
      because we worry that if other countries have the ability to become independent
      diplomatically, they may do something that we don’t like. Well, as long as you
      have this mentality, you’re going to end up setting yourself against the rest
      of the world. You’re going to lose your ability to trade and make your economy
      an investment magnet for other countries. There’s no way that other countries
      can invest in the United States with the hope of making money from American corporate
      growth because the growth that’s occurring is only financial in character. Stocks
      and bonds, real estate prices, asset price inflation financed by debt, creating
      more and more debt to bid up the price of real estate, bid up the price of bonds,
      bid up the price of stocks. That’s what the zero interest rate policy was all
      about after 2008. The United States has been transformed from an industrial capitalist
      economy into a finance capitalist economy that actually is not the old-fashioned
      capitalism at all, but is purely financial. You could say it’s closer to a neo-feudal
      economy than to the kind of industrial economy that Britain, Germany, and the
      United States were becoming after World War at the end of the 19th century, up
      to World War I, the kind of economy that gave them all of their world power in
      the first place. That kind of industrial, productive, non-financial power no longer
      exists in the West. So the problem’s not only the United States, it’s the neoliberal
      economic philosophy that has spread from, that includes the United States, Western
      Europe, and America’s major allies. So the real conflict between the United States
      and let’s say China, Asia, and the global south is not simply a conflict over
      how they’re going to hold and save their balance of payment surpluses, it’s a
      conflict of economic systems. Are other countries going to create an economic
      system that is not military in character, that does not base itself on making
      financial wealth, but makes itself in creating public infrastructure, such as
      China does, base itself on actual industrial growth, not rent-seeking. And that’s
      sort of been left out of the economic models that are made. America’s turned into
      a rentier economy, not an industrial economy. It makes money financially, it makes
      money for interest rates, it makes money by creating monopolies, such as in the
      tech sector. None of these are based on actual cost of production and cost. It’s
      all based on special privileges and special distortions of the market away from
      everything that Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and even Marx talked about. What
      you have today is a form of capitalism that none of the classical economists or
      Marx anticipated. They all thought countries are going to act in their self-interest.
      And if you’re forecasting what is going to happen to the United States and what
      the alternative is for Europe, and you think, well, they’ll act in their self-interest,
      you have to deal with the fact that countries are, none of these countries are
      acting in their own self-interest. They’re acting in an economic model, a neoliberal
      model, a military model, a diplomatic institutional model that turns out not to
      be in their self-interest, but is self-destructive. So all I can do is explain
      why it’s self-destructive. And I think that the natural tendency, as I think you’ve
      hinted at, is for other countries to follow the creation of real wealth, not financial
      wealth. And there’s a reason why China has been growing so rapidly with its real
      GDP and Russia with its GDP. China’s GDP and Russia’s GDP do not include increase
      in rents, increased in interest and financial penalties, capital gains. It’s not
      financial in character. It’s real in character. The fight is between living in
      unreality in the short run or reality in the long term. How are you going to bring
      that about? For me, all I can do is say what I’ve just said to you today. If people
      understand this, at least that’s step one in trying to accept the alternative
      that the empire is of any country dominating another country is over. China would
      not be able to do it. No country is able to be an empire at the rest of the world’s
      expense without the rest of the world pulling back and trying to create an alternative.
      GLENN DIESEN: Yeah, the lack of rationality these days is one of my main concerns
      because you do see foreign policy and economic policy being less and less dictated
      by national interest and reason. But this was the need to adjust is one of the
      reasons I was a bit optimistic about Trump’s presidency, because at least he talked
      about reindustrialization. At least he talked about the need for the US to have
      a different role. He challenged the NATO expansionism, which was a key manifestation
      of this hegemonic system. It looked as if he kind of, if he didn’t put words on
      it, more or less intuitively recognized that you would have to let go of the empire
      in order to save the republic. So he it looked as if he was, but of course he
      made a mess out of everything. And of course, this attack on Iran now makes it
      even more so. But yeah, well, before we wrap this up, what do you think is not
      the long term? It’s going to happen now in the short term. You mentioned that
      the United States attempts to raise interest rates to attract capital, but instead
      you have capital flight. So what do you expect, if not over the months to come,
      the weeks to come? MICHAEL HUDSON: Other countries are running for the exit, and
      Trump’s policies are driving them to the exit. His tariff policy essentially threatens
      to deny them the U.S. market if they don’t agree to stop trading with China, to
      refuse to de-dollarize, and essentially to surrender their economies to U.S. directions.
      They’re not going to do it. And the response by other countries is going to say,
      well, we’re not going to accept your terms. If you’re going to raise the tariffs,
      40%, 60%, do it. Of course, we will, what you’re doing is stopping us from trading
      with the United States. We’ll have tariffs against you, and you go your way. We’re
      going ours. So Trump himself is, if there were any plans of any plans, how do
      I break up the American empire? I would do just exactly what Donald Trump is doing.
      You drive other countries away and you prod them to say, you think there’s no
      alternative? I’m going to be so aggressive towards you, just as I’m aggressive
      towards Russia, towards China, towards Iran and the Middle East. I’m closing the
      U.S. market to you. Trump has said that if you try to buy U.S. Treasury bonds
      yielding 4.5%, I’m going to charge a fee, a tariff fee on your buying bonds of
      10%. So you’ll actually lose money on the bonds. And even if the United States
      does pay the 4.5%, the dollar will be falling against the Euro. It’s fallen 10%
      against the Euro already. The Euro was up to 120 before, now it’s back near parity.
      Other countries are losing in their own currency the valuation of the dollars
      they have. So Trump is speeding the parting guests. He’s closing off the U.S.
      market to them. That means go it alone, folks. Make your own agreement. And certainly
      there will be, despite the fact that the politicians of America’s client countries,
      Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, Britain, are all basically voting against
      what their own populations vote for, just as American Congress in wanting to press
      for war in Iran is voting against what the opinion polls sold the Americans for.
      It has to be temporary or there’ll be a revolution. This cannot last. And you
      have to remember that industrial capitalism itself in the 19th century was revolutionary.
      In order for British industry to become competitive, the industrialists had to
      end the power of the most powerful vested interests of their day, the real estate
      interests. They had to overcome the power of the House of Lords. They had to change
      the whole political system. They had to widen the vote to democratize politics.
      That was a revolution. This is the kind of revolution that is recurring today
      in the global majority countries. Industry in Europe had to throw off the remnants
      of feudalism. The landlord class, the monopolies that had been created by international
      bankers to help kings pay the war debts that they ran up. Well, today, these were
      all rentier interests, land rent, monopoly rent, and interest. This is the problem
      that the global south and global majorities are fighting. It’s like the equivalent
      of what were the feudal interests that Europe overthrew to industrialize and become
      capitalist countries are today foreign interests. Foreign investors own their
      raw material rents, their natural resource rent, their land rent. Foreign investors
      own their major monopolies. And now that they’ve privatized public infrastructure
      into monopolies like Thames Water in England and run these countries into foreign
      dollar debt so that they own interest. The fight by other countries today to gain
      control of their own destiny, their own autonomy, their own sovereignty is very
      similar to the fight that Europe had against its own domestic interests that were
      carried over from feudalism. The world today, the rest of the world outside of
      the United States, has to cope with the fact that we don’t have feudalism anymore,
      but what we have is a superstructure of rentier interests that are not part of
      the production economy. We’re back in the position of Adam Smith and John Stuart
      Mill and Mark Singh. There are two parts of the economy: there’s a production
      economy, and then there’s the rentier economy, the circulation economy, finance,
      industry, real estate, and monopolies. There has to be a way of thinking about
      what is gross national product, what is a product? Is a product really all the
      money that the financial sector and the real estate sector makes in rents, or
      is it what we actually produce, like what China is producing without a rentier
      class? The fight of de-dollarization is really involves getting rid of the rentier
      class that these countries have, and also they cannot afford to pay the foreign
      debt that they’ve run up. Trump’s tariffs prevent other countries from earning
      enough export returns to earn the dollars to pay the bondholders and banks that
      have debts owed in U.S. dollars. So they’re going to be huge defaults that turn
      into a very conscious and deliberate debt repudiation of what are odious debts,
      because all these debts that have been run up since 1945 as a result of a U.S.
      sponsored philosophy of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on
      essentially predatory pro-U.S. lines have ended up not helping other countries
      pay, but preventing them from paying. And if a creditor country will not let a
      debtor country pay by exporting enough in competition with its own industry, then
      there’s no economic or moral claim that this foreign debt is a viable debt. It’s
      unviable. Not only is the American empire unviable, but the whole superstructure
      of debt, the superstructure of monopolies, the superstructure of privatization
      and financial Thatcherizing and Reaganizing the world economy is unviable. So
      we’re dealing with a real clash of economic systems. Some people call this a clash
      of civilization, but it’s really a clash of economic systems. And you could say
      it’s between the promise of industrial capitalism as it was developing in the
      beginning in the 19th century and the disastrous reality of finance capitalism
      with a single geopolitical center in the United States run increasingly in its
      own interest in an exploitative, predatory fashion. GLENN DIESEN: Well, Michael,
      thank you so much. And for anyone who wants to know more on the economic strategy
      for the American Empire and also why this is collapsing, again, go to the description
      and look for the link to Michael Hudson’s book, Superimperialism. So thank you
      for going through these important topics and I hope to have you back on soon.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, thank you for giving me a chance to explain my philosophy,

    one_sentence_summary: The article features a discussion between Glenn Diesen and
      economist Michael Hudson about the economic foundations of American imperialism,
      particularly focusing on Hudson's book "Super Imperialism" and the declining stability
      of these economic strategies in the context of the Global South's rejection of
      America's rentier capitalism.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, economist Michael Hudson and host Glenn
      Diesen explored the economic foundations of American imperialism, as detailed
      in Hudson's book "Super Imperialism." They emphasized that the United States has
      primarily engaged in financial rather than military colonialism, establishing
      its global economic dominance after World War II. Hudson traced the origins of
      this strategy back to the aftermath of World War I, where the U.S. imposed repayment
      demands on its European allies, setting the stage for a new world order centered
      on American economic interests. The conversation also touched on the current instability
      of these economic foundations compared to when Hudson's book was first published.

  - title: Why America is at War with Iran
    url: https://michael-hudson.com/2025/06/why-america-is-at-war-with-iran/
    text: 'The Neocon logic for needing to defeat Iran and break it into ethnic parts
      Opponents of the war with Iran say that the war is not in American interests,
      seeing that Iran does not pose any visible threat to the United States. This appeal
      to reason misses the Neocon logic that has guided U.S. foreign policy for more
      than a half century, and which is now threatening to engulf the Middle East in
      the most violent war since Korea. That logic is so aggressive, so repugnant to
      most people, so much in violation of the basic principles of international law,
      the United Nations and the U.S. Constitution, that there is an understandable
      shyness in the authors of this strategy to spell out what is at stake. What is
      at stake is the U.S. attempt to control the Middle East and its oil as a buttress
      of U.S. economic power, and to prevent other countries from moving to create their
      own autonomy from the U.S.-centered neoliberal order administered by the IMF,
      World Bank and other international institutions to reinforce U.S. unipolar power.
      The 1970s saw much discussion about creating a New International Economic Order
      (NIEO). U.S. strategists saw this as a threat, and since my book Super Imperialism
      ironically was used as something like a textbook by the government, I was invited
      to comment on how I thought countries would break away from U.S. control. I was
      working at the Hudson Institute with Herman Kahn, and in 1974 or 1975 he brought
      me to sit in on a military strategy discussion of plans being made already at
      that time to possibly overthrow Iran and break it up into ethnic parts. Herman
      found the weakest spot to be Baluchistan, on Iran’s border with Pakistan. The
      Kurds, Tajiks and Turkic Azeris were others whose ethnicities were to be played
      off against each other, giving U.S. diplomacy a key potential client dictatorship
      to reshape both Iranian and Pakistani political orientation if need be. Three
      decades later, in 2003, General Wesley Clark pointed to Iran as being the capstone
      of seven countries that the United States needed to control in order to dominate
      the Middle East, starting with Iraq and Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia and Sudan,
      culminating in Iran. Fast forward to today Most of today’s discussion of the geopolitical
      dynamics of how the international economy is changing is understandably (and rightly)
      focusing on the attempt by the BRICS and other countries to escape from U.S. control
      by de-dollarizing their trade and investment. But the most active dynamic presently
      reshaping the international economy has been the attempts of Donald Trump’s whirlwind
      presidency since January to lock other countries into a U.S.-centered economy
      by agreeing not to focus their trade and investment on China and other states
      seeking their own autonomy from U.S. control (with trade with Russia already heavily
      sanctioned). As will be described below, the war in Iran likewise has as an aim
      blocking trade with China and Russia and countering moves away from the U.S.-centered
      neoliberal order. Trump, hoping in his own self-defeating way to rebuild U.S.
      industry, expected that countries would respond to his threat to create tariff
      chaos by reaching an agreement with America not to trade with China and indeed
      to accept U.S. trade and financial sanctions against it, Russia, Iran and other
      countries deemed to be a threat to the unipolar U.S. global order. Maintaining
      that order the U.S. objective in its current fight with Iran, as well as its fights
      with Russia and China – and Cuba, Venezuela and other countries seeking to restructure
      their economic policies to recover their independence. From the view of U.S. strategists,
      the rise of China poses an existential danger to U.S. unipolar control, both as
      a result of China’s industrial and trade dominance outstripping the U.S. economy
      and threatening its markets and the dollarized global financial system, and by
      China’s industrial socialism in providing a model that other countries might seek
      to join to emulate and/or join with to recover the national sovereignty that has
      been eroded in recent decades. U.S. Administrations and a host of U.S. Cold Warriors
      have framed the issue as being between democracy (defined as countries supporting
      U.S. policy as client regimes and oligarchies) and autocracy (countries seeking
      national self-reliance and protection from foreign trade and financial dependency).
      This framing of the international economy views not only China but any other country
      seeking national autonomy as an existential threat to U.S. unipolar domination.
      That attitude explains the U.S./NATO attack on Russia that has resulted in the
      Ukraine war of attrition, and most recently the U.S./Israeli war against Iran
      that is threatening to engulf the whole world in U.S.-backed war. The motivation
      for the attack on Iran has nothing to do with any attempt by Iran to protect its
      national sovereignty by developing an atom bomb. The basic problem is that the
      United States has taken the initiative in trying to pre-empt Iran and other countries
      from breaking away from dollar hegemony and U.S. unipolar control. Here’s how
      the neocons spell out the U.S. national interest in overthrowing the Iranian government
      and bringing about a regime change – not necessarily a secular democratic regime
      change, but perhaps an extension of the ISIS-Al Qaida Wahabi terrorists who have
      taken over Syria. With Iran broken up and its component parts turned into a set
      of client oligarchies, U.S. diplomacy can control all Near Eastern oil. And control
      of oil has been a cornerstone of U.S. international economic power for a century,
      thanks to U.S. oil companies operating internationally (not only as domestic U.S.
      producers of oil and gas). Control of Near Eastern oil also enables the dollar
      diplomacy that has seen Saudia Arabia and other OPEC countries invest their oil
      revenues into the U.S. economy by accumulating vast holdings of U.S. Treasury
      securities and private-sector investments. The United States holds OPEC countries
      as hostages through these investments in the U.S. economy (and in other Western
      economies), which can be expropriated much as the United States grabbed $300 billion
      of Russia’s monetary savings in the West in 2022. This largely explains why these
      countries are afraid to act in support the Palestinians or Iranians in today’s
      conflict. But Iran is not only the capstone to full control of the Near East and
      its oil and dollar holdings. Iran is a key link for China’s Belt and Road program
      for a New Silk Road of railway transport to the West. If the United States can
      overthrow the Iranian government, this interrupts the long transportation corridor
      that China already has constructed and hopes to extend further West. Iran also
      is a key to blocking Russian trade and development via the Caspian Sea and access
      to the south, bypassing the Suez Canal. And under U.S. control, an Iranian client
      regime could threaten Russia from its southern flank, bypassing the Suez Canal.
      To the Neocons, all this makes Iran a central pivot on which the self-proclaimed
      U.S. national interest is based – if you define that national interest as creating
      a coercive empire of client states observing dollar hegemony by adhering to the
      dollarized international financial system. I think that Trump’s warning to Tehran
      citizens to evacuate their city is just an attempt to stir up domestic panic as
      a prelude to a U.S. attempt to mobilize ethnic opposition as a means to break
      up Iran into component parts. That is similar to the U.S. hopes to break up Russia
      and China into regional ethnicities. That is the U.S. strategic hope for a new
      international order that remains under its command. The irony, of course, is that
      U.S. attempts to hold onto its fading economic empire continue to be self-defeating.
      The objective is to control other nations by threatening economic chaos. But it
      is this U.S. threat of chaos that is driving other nations to seek alternatives
      elsewhere. And an objective is not a strategy. The plan to use Netanyahu as America’s
      counterpart to Ukraine’s Zelensky, demanding U.S. intervention with his willingness
      to fight to the last Israeli, much as the U.S./NATO are fighting to the last Ukrainian,
      is a tactic that is quite obviously at the expense of strategy. It is a warning
      to the entire world to find an escape hatch. Like the U.S. trade and financial
      sanctions intended to keep other countries dependent on U.S. markets and a dollarized
      international financial system, the attempt to impose a military empire from central
      Europe to the Middle East is politically self-destructive. It is making the split
      the split that already is occurring between the U.S.-centered neoliberal order
      and the Global Majority irreversible on moral grounds as well as on the grounds
      of simple self-preservation and economic self-interest. Trump’s Republican budget
      plan and its vast increase in military spending The ease with which Iranian missiles
      have been able to penetrate Israel’s much-vaunted Iron Dome defense shows the
      folly of Trump’s pressure for an enormous trillion-dollar subsidy to the U.S.
      military-industrial complex for a similar Golden Dome boondoggle here in the United
      States. So far, the Iranians have used only their oldest and least effective missiles.
      The aim is to deplete Israel’s anti-missile defenses so that in a week or only
      a few days it will be unable to block a serious Iranian attack. Iran already demonstrated
      its ability to evade Israel’s air defenses a few months ago, just as during Trump’s
      previous presidency it showed how easily it could hit U.S. military bases. The
      U.S. military budget actually is much larger than is reported in the proposed
      bill before Congress to approve Trump’s trillion-dollar subsidy. Congress funds
      its military-industrial complex in two ways: The obvious way is by arms purchases
      paid for by Congress directly. Less acknowledged is MIC spending routed via U.S.
      foreign military aid to its allies – Ukraine, Israel, Europe, South Korea, Japan
      and other Asian countries to buy U.S. arms. This explains why the military burden
      is what normally accounts for the entire U.S. budget deficit and hence the rise
      in government debt (much of it self-financed via the Federal Reserve since 2008,
      to be sure). Unsurprisingly, the international community has been unable to prevent
      the U.S./Israeli war against Iran. The United Nations Security Council is blocked
      by the United States’ veto, and that of Britain and France, from taking measures
      against acts of aggression by the United States and its allies. The United Nations
      is now seen to have become toothless and irrelevant as a world organization able
      to enforce international law. (As Stalin remarked regarding Vatican opposition,
      “How many troops does the Pope have”?) And just as the World Bank and International
      Monetary Fund are instruments of U.S. foreign policy and control, so too are many
      other international organizations which are dominated by the United States and
      its allies, including (relevantly for today’s crisis in West Asia), the International
      Atomic Energy Agency that Iran has accused of having provided Israel targeting
      information for its attack on Iran’s nuclear scientists and sites. Breaking free
      of the U.S. unipolar order requires a full spectrum set of alternative international
      organizations independent of the United States, NATO and other client allies.

    text: 'Opponents of the war with Iran say that the war is not in American interests,
      seeing that Iran does not pose any visible threat to the United States.


      This appeal to reason misses the neoconservative logic that has guided U.S. foreign
      policy for more than a half century, and which is now threatening to engulf the
      Middle East in the most violent war since Korea.


      That logic is so aggressive, so repugnant to most people, so much in violation
      of the basic principles of international law, the United Nations, and the U.S.
      Constitution, that there is an understandable shyness in the authors of this strategy
      to spell out what is at stake.


      What is at stake is the U.S. attempt to control the Middle East and its oil as
      a buttress of U.S. economic power, and to prevent other countries from moving
      to create their own autonomy from the U.S.-centered neoliberal order administered
      by the IMF, World Bank, and other institutions to reinforce U.S. unipolar power.


      The 1970s saw much discussion about creating a New International Economic Order
      (NIEO). U.S. strategists saw this as a threat, and since my book Super Imperialism
      ironically was used as something like a textbook by the government, I was invited
      to comment on how I thought countries would break away from U.S. control.


      I was working at the Hudson Institute with Herman Kahn, and in 1974 or 1975, he
      brought me to sit in on a military strategy discussion of plans being made already
      at that time to possibly overthrow Iran and break it up into ethnic parts. Herman
      found the weakest spot to be Baluchistan, on Iran’s border with Pakistan. The
      Kurds, Tajiks, and Turkic Azeris were others whose ethnicities were to be played
      off against each other, giving U.S. diplomacy a key potential client dictatorship
      to reshape both Iranian and Pakistani political orientation if need be.


      Three decades later, in 2003, General Wesley Clark pointed to Iran as being the
      capstone of seven countries that the United States needed to control in order
      to dominate the Middle East, starting with Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia,
      and Sudan, culminating in Iran.


      The U.S. fight for unipolar control of the world


      Most of today’s discussion of the geopolitical dynamics of how the international
      economy is changing is understandably (and rightly) focusing on the attempt by
      BRICS and other countries to escape from U.S. control by de-dollarizing their
      trade and investment.


      But the most active dynamic presently reshaping the international economy has
      been the attempts of Donald Trump’s whirlwind presidency since January to lock
      other countries into a U.S.-centered economy, by agreeing not to focus their trade
      and investment on China and other states seeking autonomy from U.S. control. (Trade
      with Russia is already heavily sanctioned.)


      As will be described below, the war in Iran likewise has as an aim blocking trade
      with China and Russia and countering moves away from the U.S.-centered neoliberal
      order.


      Trump, hoping in his own self-defeating way to rebuild U.S. industry, expected
      that countries would respond to his threat to create tariff chaos by reaching
      an agreement with America not to trade with China, and indeed to accept U.S. trade
      and financial sanctions against it, Russia, Iran, and other countries deemed to
      be a threat to the unipolar U.S. global order.


      Maintaining that order is the U.S. objective in its current fight with Iran, as
      well as its fights with Russia and China – and Cuba, Venezuela, and other countries
      seeking to restructure their economic policies to recover their independence.


      From the view of U.S. strategists, the rise of China poses an existential danger
      to U.S. unipolar control, both as a result of China’s industrial and trade dominance
      outstripping the U.S. economy and threatening its markets and the dollarized global
      financial system, and by China’s industrial socialism providing a model that other
      countries might seek to emulate and/or join with to recover the national sovereignty
      that has been eroded in recent decades.


      U.S. administrations and a host of U.S. cold warriors have framed the issue as
      being between “democracy” (defined as countries supporting U.S. policy as client
      regimes and oligarchies) and “autocracy” (countries seeking national self-reliance
      and protection from foreign trade and financial dependency).


      This framing of the international economy views not only China but any other country
      seeking national autonomy as an existential threat to U.S. unipolar domination.
      That attitude explains the U.S./NATO attack on Russia that has resulted in the
      Ukraine war of attrition, and most recently the U.S./Israeli war against Iran
      that is threatening to engulf the whole world in U.S.-backed war.


      The motivation for the attack on Iran has nothing to do with any attempt by Iran
      to protect its national sovereignty by developing an atom bomb. The basic problem
      is that the United States has taken the initiative in trying to preempt Iran and
      other countries from breaking away from dollar hegemony and U.S. unipolar control.

      Iranian government and bringing about a regime change – not necessarily a secular
      democratic regime change, but perhaps an extension of the ISIS/Al-Qaida Wahhabi

      With Iran broken up and its component parts turned into a set of client oligarchies,
      U.S. diplomacy can control all Middle Eastern oil. And control of oil has been
      a cornerstone of U.S. international economic power for a century, thanks to U.S.
      oil companies operating internationally (not only as domestic U.S. producers of
      oil and gas) and remitting economic rents extracted from overseas to make a major
      contribution to the U.S. balance of payments.


      Control of Middle Eastern oil also enables the dollar diplomacy that has seen
      Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries invest their oil revenues into the U.S.
      economy by accumulating vast holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and private-sector
      investments.


      The United States holds OPEC countries hostage through these investments in the
      U.S. economy (and in other Western economies), which can be expropriated much
      as the United States grabbed $300 billion of Russia’s monetary savings in the
      West in 2022. This largely explains why these countries are afraid to act in support
      of the Palestinians or Iranians in today’s conflict.


      But Iran is not only the capstone to full control of the Near East and its oil
      and dollar holdings. Iran is a key link for China’s Belt and Road Initiative for
      a New Silk Road of railway transport to the West.

      long transportation corridor that China already has constructed and hopes to extend
      further west.

      and access to the south, bypassing the Suez Canal. And under U.S. control, an
      Iranian client regime could threaten Russia from its southern flank.

      an attempt to stir up domestic panic as a prelude to a U.S. attempt to mobilize
      ethnic opposition as a means to break up Iran into component parts. It is similar

      That is the U.S. strategic hope for a new international order that remains under
      its command.

      continue to be self-defeating.

      It is a warning to the entire world to find an escape hatch.


      Like the U.S. trade and financial sanctions intended to keep other countries dependent
      on U.S. markets and a dollarized international financial system, the attempt to
      impose a military empire from Central Europe to the Middle East is politically
      self-destructive.


      It is making the split that already is occurring between the U.S.-centered neoliberal
      order and the Global Majority irreversible on moral grounds, as well as on the
      grounds of simple self-preservation and economic self-interest.


      Trump’s Republican budget plan and its vast increase in military spending


      The ease with which Iranian missiles have been able to penetrate Israel’s much-vaunted
      Iron Dome defense shows the folly of Trump’s pressure for an enormous trillion-dollar
      subsidy to the U.S. military-industrial complex for a similar Golden Dome boondoggle
      here in the United States.


      So far, the Iranians have used only their oldest and least effective missiles.
      The aim is to deplete Israel’s anti-missile defenses so that in a few weeks it
      will be unable to block a serious Iranian attack.


      Iran already demonstrated its ability to evade Israel’s air defenses a few months

      hit U.S. military bases.


      The U.S. military budget actually is much larger than is reported in the proposed
      bill before Congress to approve Trump’s trillion-dollar subsidy.


      Congress funds its military-industrial complex (MIC) in two ways: The obvious
      way is by arms purchases paid for by Congress directly. Less acknowledged is MIC
      spending routed via U.S. foreign military aid to its allies – Ukraine, Israel,
      Europe, South Korea, Japan, and other Asian countries – to buy U.S. arms.


      This explains why the military burden is what normally accounts for the entire
      U.S. budget deficit and hence the rise in government debt (much of it self-financed
      via the Federal Reserve since 2008, to be sure).


      The need for alternative international organizations


      Unsurprisingly, the international community has been unable to prevent the U.S./Israeli
      war against Iran.


      The United Nations Security Council is blocked by the United States’ veto, and
      that of Britain and France, from taking measures against acts of aggression by
      the United States and its allies.


      The United Nations is now seen to have become toothless and irrelevant as a world
      organization able to enforce international law. (Its situation is much as Stalin
      remarked regarding Vatican opposition, “How many troops does the Pope have?”)


      Just as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are instruments of U.S.
      foreign policy and control, so too are many other international organizations
      which are dominated by the United States and its allies, including (relevantly
      for today’s crisis in West Asia) the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
      that Iran has accused of having provided Israel targeting information for its
      attack on Iranian nuclear scientists and sites.


      Breaking free of the U.S. unipolar order requires a full spectrum set of alternative
      international organizations independent of the United States, NATO, and other
      client allies.


      Trump’s attack on Iran


      The sound and fury of Trump’s missile attack on Iran’s most famous nuclear sites
      on June 21 turned out not to be the capstone of America’s conquest of the Middle
      East. But it did more than signify nothing.


      Trump must have listened to the military’s warnings that all game plans for conflict
      with Iran at this time showed the United States losing badly.


      His Trumpian solution was to brag on his social media account that he had won
      a great victory in stopping Iran’s march toward making an atom bomb.


      Iran for its part evidently was glad to cooperate with the public relations charade.
      The U.S. missiles seem to have landed on mutually agreed-upon sites that Iran
      had vacated for just such a diplomatic stand-down.


      Trump always announces any act as a great victory, and in a way it was, over the
      hopes and goading of his most ardent neoconservative advisors. The United States
      has deferred its hopes for conquest at this time.


      The fight is now to be limited to Iran and Israel. And Israel already has offered
      to stop hostilities if Iran does. Iran gave hope for an armistice once it has
      exacted due retaliation for Israeli assassinations and terrorist acts against
      civilians.


      Israel is the big loser, and its ability to serve as America’s proxy has been
      crippled. The devastation from Iranian rockets has left a reported one-third of
      Tel Aviv and much of Haifa in ruins.


      Israel has lost not only its key military and national security structures, but
      will lose much of its skilled population as it emigrates, taking its industry
      with it.


      By intervening on Israel’s side by supporting its genocide, the United States
      has turned most of the UN’s Global Majority against it.


      Washignton’s ill-thought backing of the reckless Netanyahu has catalyzed the drive
      by other countries to speed their way out of the U.S. diplomatic, economic, and
      military orbit.


      So America’s Oil War against Iran can now be added to the long list of wars that
      the United States has lost since the Korean and Vietnam wars, Afghanistan, Iraq,
      and the rest of its adventures leading up to its imminent loss in Ukraine. Its
      victories have been against Grenada and German industry – its own imperial “backyard,”
      so to speak.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the U.S. war with Iran is driven by
      neoconservative interests aiming to maintain control over the Middle East and
      its oil resources, countering the rise of countries seeking autonomy from U.S.
      dominance, rather than any genuine threat posed by Iran itself.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the U.S. strategy towards Iran, arguing
      that the war is driven by neoconservative logic aimed at maintaining American
      control over the Middle East and its oil resources, rather than addressing any
      real threat posed by Iran. It suggests that U.S. foreign policy seeks to prevent
      other nations from achieving autonomy from the U.S.-dominated neoliberal order,
      which is perceived as a threat to American economic power, particularly in light
      of rising powers like China. The author reflects on historical strategies to destabilize
      Iran and its potential fragmentation into client states, emphasizing that the
      U.S. military actions are less about democracy versus autocracy and more about
      preserving dollar hegemony. The article concludes that U.S. interventions have
      led to increasing resistance from other nations, undermining the U.S.'s global
      influence and highlighting the need for alternative international organizations
      to challenge U.S. dominance.

    text: '2025.06.12 – Dialogue Works NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody. Today is Thursday,
      June 12, 2025, and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson are back with
      us. Welcome back, Richard, Michael. RICHARD WOLFF: Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID:
      Let me start with what Tulsi Gabbard published yesterday, which is so important
      when it comes to her position in the Trump administration, in which we know she
      is the head of intelligence in the United States. Here is what she said. [clip
      start] Tulsi Gabbard says, “This isn’t some made-up science fiction story. This
      is the reality of what’s at stake and what we are facing now. Because, as we stand
      here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before, political
      elites and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear
      powers. Perhaps it’s because they are confident that they will have access to
      nuclear shelters for themselves and for their families that regular people won’t
      have access to. So it’s up to us, the people, to speak up and demand an end to
      this madness. We must reject this path to nuclear war and work toward a world
      where no one has to live in fear of a nuclear holocaust.” [clip end] NIMA ALKHORSHID:
      I’m going to start with you, Richard. When it comes to the situation with the
      foreign policy of the United States, we are in the Middle East. The situation
      is getting worse. With the case of Ukraine, the same. It doesn’t seem that we
      have any sort of solution. And with China, it’s getting worse as time goes by.
      But focusing on you, you’ve mentioned before coming up, you’ve mentioned the situation
      in the Middle East is some sort of stalemate. Your take on that on what’s going
      on there? RICHARD WOLFF: Okay, let me begin by responding, if I may, to Tulsi
      Gabbard. Making a speech, if you’re the American intelligence leader, about the
      dangers of nuclear war and atomic warfare, is an amazing thing to come from the
      mouth of the leader of the one country on earth that ever used nuclear weapons
      on another country. It is the absence of an apology. The absence of shame. The
      absence of a willingness to face what you did, and you want the rest of the world
      to step away from what? Nobody else did what you did. It’s extraordinary. It’s
      a level of self-delusion that is a single most danger to produce nuclear war,
      that kind of self-delusion. Anyway, to answer your question, the Middle East has
      been and is now a stalemate. And here’s what I mean. For much of the last century,
      the Middle East was the playground for foreign powers that invaded and took over
      in order to control oil. That was the issue. That was the goal. That was the program.
      Literally, a number of the countries there were created as countries. They weren’t
      countries when all of this started. They were created later. And the single dominant
      theme of their creation, of the literal formation out of a desert population of
      a quote-unquote nation, was designed and orchestrated in Europe and in North America,
      where these things were done. Now, several events have made this story no longer
      valid. Number one is the rising up of the Arab and related peoples in that part
      of the world, who have fought and overcome their colonial situations, at least
      politically, not quite economically, but politically. That’s one new factor. Number
      two, the overwhelming use of Israel by the West as its outpost, focusing everybody’s
      attention on the Arab-Israeli contradiction and conflict. Allowing the Western
      powers to continue to get from the Middle East what they needed so long as the
      Arab population was focused on Israel, which was merely the symbolic forerunner
      of what was really going on. And then finally, the new situation, the decline
      of the Western Empire, the United States, and the rise, especially of China, and
      secondarily now of Russia as China’s ally. Russia being right up against the Middle
      East, bordering some of the countries there and close to them in many other historical
      ways. So now you have a stalemate. There’s still enormous influence from the United
      States and Western Europe, focused still, by the way, on oil more than anything
      else, with a secondary support of Israel. But that is derivative about the oil
      anyway. And no one knows quite what to do. The Arabs are demanding a rising power
      and influence in the area, which their numbers alone support and justify. It is,
      after all, their part of the world by any reasonable understanding of how geography
      and populations work. The West is powerful and holding on, but the West is holding
      on to what is ultimately a declining situation for them. And that’s not even taking
      account of the fact that fossil fuels will be phased out eventually, even though
      one has to be struck by the ability of the West to continue to hold on to as much
      importance for oil as their economic investment requires them to do. Okay, nothing
      can change here now. This is… the contradictions are too many and too complicated.
      And you can see that by the inability of the world to do anything, confronted
      by what is the sharpest point of that contradiction, which is the Israeli bombing
      of the people of Gaza. Everyone in the world, the overwhelming majority, has a
      position on that. And the position is anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian. The votes
      in the United Nations show that. I mean, there are a number of votes, in which
      it’s the entire world on one side and Israel and the United States on the other.
      I mean, one could not have a more dramatic demonstration of a stalemate because
      the bombing goes on. Nothing is in a position to act definitively to stop it.
      So we have a war that’s now going on and on and on, and people are talking about
      removing an entire population. It’s extraordinary. And the second example is Iran.
      You can’t do anything. The Iranians have very powerful relationships, developed
      now over many years with both China and Russia. There’s even a formal defense,
      mutual defense agreement between Russia and Iran. If you attack Iran, where does
      that go? Israel would like to do it because Israel’s only hope in the long run
      is to draw the United States in much more than it is willing to go in there and
      support them. Otherwise, at some point, and I’m not the only one who says this,
      the United States will take a new look at Israel and do to Israel what it has
      done elsewhere when it isn’t anymore workable. Look at the noise being made over
      Ukraine. And the rest of Europe is supporting Ukraine despite America walking
      away. They’re not that; they don’t feel that way about Israel. There’ll be less
      opposition if the United States walks away from Israel. So these are incredible
      tensions, but they are contradictions in a sense that nobody dares move. And so
      when I hear, you know, the Israelis are considering invading Iran or bombing Iran
      or bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities. I have heard that for the last 10 or 20
      years. It’s a periodic theater for the mass media to get all excited and meetings
      to be held and conferences and the theater gets the personnel in the American
      embassy in Iraq to send their children out of the country. Come on. You know,
      what is this? What is another, we’re going to have another scare? Or, of course,
      it is possible that people that are desperate enough in these stalemate situations
      will do something really stupid because they’re desperate when people do stupid
      things. There is, for example, much information emerging that the internal political
      and legal difficulties of Mr. Netanyahu may be catching up to him. Will he then
      be provoked into doing something even he knows is stupid? Well, will the United
      States hide behind, I don’t know what, and claim that it doesn’t know about that?
      The way the United States didn’t know about the drone attacks on the Russian airplanes
      and on their fields, where they have to be by treaty out in the open and all of
      that. These are endless games. There’s no more reality to this than listening
      after a night of drone and missile attacks to the Ukrainian government, telling
      you how it shot down all of the missiles and the drones, even while the press
      is showing the burning buildings. Or for that matter, the Russians. I can’t verify
      either of them, but I can tell when what we’re being told is quickly manufactured
      spin, as we call it in the U.S. That’s what we’re subject to. It’s very hard to
      get beyond that because so much information is withheld and so much information
      is phonied intentionally that we’re left with a limit to what we can say. NIMA
      ALKHORSHID: Go ahead, Michael. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, about the military aspects,
      I can’t say anything that your other guests that you have on your show haven’t
      said much better because they’re on the spot there. What I can talk about is the
      economic point of view and the political view from the United States. And oil
      is the common denominator of U.S. diplomacy, both for Iran and for Russia. And
      it has been since World War II. A center point of U.S. international strategy
      has been to control the world’s oil supply because oil is the key to energy, and
      energy is necessary for GDP and for employment. And the United States aim is to
      say: if we can control the world’s oil supply, we can do two things. We can cut
      off oil being supplied to countries that don’t follow U.S. Cold War policy, and
      that will cause a depression in them. And also, oil because it’s produced in the
      United States as well as foreign countries, and because U.S. companies, along
      with England and the Seven Sisters, have long controlled most of the oil trade.
      Oil is the key to the financial standing of the West, to the balance of payments
      – a huge inflow. For the balance of payments, this has been able to fund America’s
      Cold War spending. So you have oil upsetting all of this. The question is: what
      happens when this involves war? In 1954, when England and America jointly overthrew
      the elected Iranian government of Mossadegh and installed the military dictatorship
      of the Shah, that was a kind of covert war that they can afford. The problem is:
      what do you do when actual military fighting is involved? And I think, regarding
      Tulsi Gabbard’s comment, the basic theme, the basic axiom of war is that atomic
      war is the only kind of fighting that a democracy can afford. It’s the only weapon
      that America has that is actually effective. It’s effective in blowing up the
      world, and there will be retaliation, and the U.S. will be wiped out. So it’s
      a kind of self-defeating weapon. But no democracy any longer can recruit an army
      to invade a country and take over. Vietnam ended that for the United States, and
      no European country is able to mount a military draft. Any government, any democracy
      that tried to impose a military draft, would immediately be voted out of power
      or somehow taken out of power. So you can’t actually mount your own army. America
      was able to attack Iraq and it was able to attack Libya. But these are wars against
      basically defenseless countries. I won’t say on the level of Grenada, they were
      a bit more than that. But if we’re talking about war with a major power, Russia
      or China or even Iran, America has no conventional warfare ability to destroy
      them or to beat them. That means that there is one alternative, and that’s to
      get a proxy army. And that’s exactly what the United States has been doing as
      an alternative to the domestic draft and the military war. Its main fight has
      always been against Russia since the Soviet Union. And its main proxy army has
      been Arab fanaticism, the Sunni Wahhabi al-Qaeda. That was America’s alternative
      under Jimmy Carter in Afghanistan to try to fight against the Russian alliance
      with Afghanistan. And Jimmy Carter said, well, at least the Arabs and Christians
      all worship God. Well, they worship in different ways. And so America founded
      al-Qaeda and set it up. It then extended al-Qaeda into the Near East, into Iraq,
      and into Syria, and it’s backed al-Qaeda in Syria, as you see now. And its other
      proxy army in the Near East has been, of course, Israel. And the agreement way
      back from the 1970s when I was working with the Hudson Institute was that Israel
      would act as America’s proxy army and intelligence service and general political
      satellite to prevent any independent development of Near Eastern countries going
      their own way and acting independently of U.S. policy. And as you’ve seen, I think
      for the last 20 years under George W. Bush in Iraq, you had al-Qaeda always working
      hand in glove with the Israelis, never attacking them. There’s been that difference.
      For the first time now, they’re head to head in Syria. And the question is: there’s
      a jockeying for position between the Israeli army in Syria moving eastward and
      the al-Qaeda group wanting to consolidate as much control as it has so that it
      can murder the Christians, murder the Shiites, and go on its fanatic killing philosophy.
      So that’s sort of the political alignment there. But even so, now, as Richard
      has just said, there’s a political stalemate. America can’t rely either on Israel
      or al-Qaeda to fight Iran. There is a stalemate there. And the question is: how
      is this going to be resolved? And I think it helps to look both at Iran and the
      situation with the fight of NATO against Russia in Ukraine to see that the alignment
      is much more than just that of the Trump administration and the politicians. On
      the one hand, you have Trump intervening, although Trump is the number one backer
      of Ukraine and started the Ukrainian escalation of war against Russia in his first
      term. He also wants to be the mediator and the honest broker acting completely
      dishonestly, fully in alliance with Ukraine against Russia. So you have his pretending
      to be the good cop to Ukraine’s bad cop. But in addition, while Trump and his
      administration have their position via Ukraine and Iran, you have Congress and
      you have Lindsey Graham from South Carolina. And no matter what agreement may
      be made between Trump and either Iran or Russia, you’ll have Congress pushing
      its own agenda and it’s virulently anti-Iran, pushing for war with Iran, and pushing
      for escalation of sanctions and war with Russia. But then, most important is the
      third factor, and that’s the deep state, the CIA and its partner, London’s MI6.
      And they’ve really been in charge of U.S. foreign policy against Russia and Iran
      for the last 50 years. And they’re both virulently anti-Russian. They have both
      together set up huge terrorist organizations, assassination groups, spying organizations,
      intelligence gathering, both in Iran and in Russia. And they are pressing for
      active war because they actually believe that the United States can win a war
      and they believe that America can win an atomic war. And I’ve sat in on discussions
      with policymakers and generals where they indeed have made that very claim. And
      I think that’s what Tulsa Gabbard was relating to when she said they think they
      can get into their bomb shelters. They really think that a preemptive strike would
      be able to dismantle Iran or Russia. This shows the amazing patience that Iran
      and Russia have shown in not making their own preemptive defensive strike, in
      the case of Iran, against Israel and U.S. military outposts in the Middle East,
      or for Russia against the NATO countries that are supplying Israel with weapons.
      Starmer in England, Macron in France, and now Merz in Germany. And I can say more
      later on. I’ll let the discussion continue, but that’s the alignment that we’re
      dealing with. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard? RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, I think that the
      stalemate will likely continue for all the reasons we’ve now kind of gone over,
      and that it will be resolved by the ongoing evolution of the world economy, which
      will be the more important shaper of what those people do than anything in their
      bloviating denunciations of one another. And let me give you an example. Yesterday,
      Xi Jinping, the head of the government in China, announced that the 53 countries
      of Africa will, as of some immediate and future time, be allowed to export to
      China with zero tariffs on any of them and on any product at any time. All right,
      that’s a milestone. Look at the meaning. The United States, after it deals with
      China and after it deals with Russia and South Korea and Japan and the other bigger
      economies that concern it, will turn its attention, who knows when, to Africa,
      upon whom the United States has hit enormous tariffs, 30%, 40%, and 50% on small
      African countries. You know that you have to shake your head in disbelief. So
      the United States is deeply threatening the economic viability of African countries
      by imposing enormous tariffs at the same time that China removes all tariffs for
      the Africans. For those who don’t know, China has been a more important trading
      partner for Africa for the last 15 years. It’s much more important for Africa
      to trade with China than it is for Africa to trade with the United States. And
      all that this shows is that the relationship is getting stronger and bigger and
      more important, both for China and for Africa. And the United States is simply
      becoming increasingly less relevant. No one should be surprised then when, a few
      days earlier, the American military general in charge of the Africa command makes
      comments suggesting that the Africa command of the American military is a failure.
      I don’t know exactly what that word means, but I get the message. And it’s not
      because the United States military didn’t do the right thing or the wrong thing;
      it’s the development that I’ve just described, say between Africa and China, that
      erodes it from underneath. No military question really needs to be asked. It’s
      already answered by the fact that everything is realigning in the world in such
      a way as to resolve all kinds of matters by the flow of economic development,
      regardless of what is done politically or militarily. I don’t want to overstate
      this; the military and the political are important and have their influence. But
      I think, in this case, the stalemates that we talk about militarily and politically
      will likely be resolved by an economic development that is no stalemate at all.
      And you could see that in the London meetings over the weekend between the United
      States and China, in which there’s lots of spinning, but a bottom line looks like
      the United States had to give in order to get something and didn’t come out with
      any kind of new world order that is any different from the one in which the United
      States is losing. And when Michael said quite correctly that the Vietnam War taught
      the United States the lesson of how dangerous it would be for the U.S. to try
      to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops from the American people, let’s remember
      the war was incredibly expensive. They made the mistake. The war came to an end
      because of the opposition at home and the United States lost the war. The Communist
      Party of Vietnam was the enemy, and the Communist Party of Vietnam runs that society
      politically now. They won, we lost, and we discovered that if you’re not careful,
      you lose the war at home, whether or not you’re doing better or worse on the battlefield
      over there. This was very, very powerful and has affected our military and is
      behind half of what goes on that they will never tell you about, because admitting
      even the admission that they lost the war in Vietnam is difficult for them, not
      for anyone else in the world, but for them. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, when you take
      into account the economic view, Richard is quite right. It’s not a stalemate.
      It’s not a stalemate in Africa. Partly, we’ve just seen the United States abolish
      all of its foreign aid to Africa, which has been actually a great help in fighting
      disease and fighting famine. America has essentially told Africa “no more help.”
      But I think the best illustration I can think of is what’s happening in Russia’s
      war with NATO. There have been a lot of the guests that you’ve had on your show,
      Nima, have talked about, you know, why is Putin going so slow? What is the pace
      of war? And it’s a war of attrition. It’s not trying to grab land. Putin is trying
      to save Russian lives. But there’s another, a non-military reason why Putin is
      going so slow, very gradually, very defensively, making sure that he minimizes
      the number of Russian soldiers killed while maximizing those of Ukraine. And that’s
      because while this war is going on, Europe is being torn apart politically, as
      Richard and I have spoken on your show. When the United States has recruited foreign
      armies, it’s recruited foreign economies. And just as it’s willing to fight to
      the last Ukrainian, it’s willing to fight to the last German in industrial employment.
      It’s convinced it has helped install leaders like the ones we mentioned earlier,
      like Merz in Germany, which is fully in favor of the war, despite what the German
      population wants. Essentially, NATO has hijacked the European Union by taking
      over the unelected von der Leyen and the Estonian, Kaja Kallas, to steer the EU
      in a diametrically opposite direction from what every test of voters has shown.
      The voters want peace, not war. They want low energy prices, not high energy prices
      as a result of the sanctions against Russia. They want the government to spend
      money on social programs, especially to subsidize the cost of heating their homes
      and getting electricity now that their energy prices have quadrupled. The dissatisfaction
      against Starmer’s Labor Party in England and the Christian Democrats in Germany
      and Macron’s party in France. All of these parties are being threatened by the
      nationalist parties on the right, from England to France to the German AFD and
      nationalist parties that are also coming to power. You just had that occur in
      Poland. You had that occur in Romania with Europe saying, we are no longer a democracy.
      As Mark Twain said, if voting really mattered, they wouldn’t let you do it. And
      when it began to threaten to matter in Romania, they said, well, we’re not going
      to let you do it. We’re going to appoint who gets to win. Just as the United States
      appointed a Venezuelan leader to be the recipient of Venezuela’s foreign gold
      reserves in absentia. Essentially, we’re having a breakdown of democracy that,
      of course, is leading to a nationalist reaction. I’m very disappointed that this
      nationalist reaction is all on the right, not on the left, but the important thing
      is that it is a reaction against the existing pro-NATO, pro-U.S., pro-Cold War
      interests. The longer that President Putin takes to very thoroughly follow his
      intentions that he’s been explaining in detail again and again for the last three
      years, the more Europe is going to be pulled apart while the German and European
      economies shrink and the Russian economy accelerates. Certainly, this is becoming
      more and more obvious, and the strains are arising. You’ve already seen the economic
      and political strains in Israel as a result of the war in Gaza. And any attempt
      to extend this war to Iran, from everything that your military experts have been
      saying on your show, Nima, would be that Iran can essentially destroy most of
      Israel and many American camps and military installations in the Near East, which
      is why the United States has just pulled back the families and non-essential soldiers
      in all of these military installations. So it looks like certainly either the
      State Department is trying to pull a stunt of saying, we’re really threatening
      to go to war. We’re pulling back all the non-essential people. Do you really want
      war, Iran? Either this is just a kind of threat, which is another weapon that
      the United States has, but it’s become another weapon of what Mao called a paper
      tiger. And I think Iran, Russia, and China are coming to think of America now
      as a paper tiger because the whole military strategy of the United States has
      proved to be inferior to that of the countries it’s attacking. In Ukraine, it
      was based on tanks. Well, tanks worked in World War II. Tanks worked in Iraq and
      the Near East against pretty defenseless armies. But tanks don’t work any longer
      on the battlefield against another actual landed army because you have drone warfare.
      The drones can defend themselves against tanks at a much lower price. The Air
      Force doesn’t seem to work. If there’s any attack on Iran, it has to be by American
      airplanes able to carry the bombs capable of fighting Iran. And Iran apparently
      has the Russian, and its own, air defense that makes the United States hesitant
      to trust the Israeli and U.S. Air Force in all of this. That’s what makes it seemingly
      a standoff. But then you have the wildcard, as Richard said, of somebody acting
      really stupidly, meaning ideologically or just on their own volition. And whether
      it’s someone as unstable as Donald Trump and his inexperienced cabinet, or whether
      it’s the deep state that says, yes, we’re probably going to lose, but we’re not
      going to lose if we go and have a war with Russia and Iran now as badly as we’ll
      lose in five years as we get weaker and weaker compared to their growing strength.
      So that’s the real problem that we’re dealing with. The U.S. military strategists
      and political strategists are, to the extent that they’re realistic, realizing
      that the U.S. military advantage that they have had based all of their foreign
      policy on since World War II is now gone. And how do you try to maintain your
      unipolar economic policy when your military policy is gone? When the cost of recruiting
      a client army, such as NATO or Israel or those of Arabs al-Qaeda and the Wahhabis,
      how are you going to do that when you’re steadily losing relative power to the
      countries that you have decided as your emissaries? They’re in a defensive position.
      America is in the offensive position. That’s really the issue. And the other trigger
      can be, of course, at what point will the defensive position say, we see an airplane
      taking off from the West. Maybe it’s coming to us. Let’s shoot it down. That’s
      probably going to be the next big crisis, whether it’s over the fight against
      Iran or the fight against Russia. It’s 50-50. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, before
      coming to you, here is what the NATO Secretary General said about the conflict
      with Russia. [clip starts] The reporter asks, “Do you agree with Kyiv that, to
      end this war, it’s going to require additional long-range strikes into Russia
      to take out its industrial capacity?” Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, responds,
      “Well, to end this war, we need Putin to come to the negotiating table and not
      with this historian, who is now popping up in Istanbul twice and again telling
      us about the history of Russia and Ukraine from whatever the 12th century, I don’t
      know what it was, and constantly restating what they stated already in 1922. You
      need a Russia, which is serious, that wants to negotiate and end the war. And
      to get there, it all, I think, starts, of course, with keeping Ukraine strong
      in the fight.” [clip ends] NIMA ALKHORSHID: We had, by the way, we had an article
      in the Financial Times. It somehow tries to picture the Ukrainian army in such
      a way that the latest attack on nuclear bombers of Russia was done by AI. That
      they don’t need manpower because they know Ukraine has the problem of manpower
      in the fight against Russia. They’re trying to change the rhetoric. They’re trying
      to keep Ukraine in this fight that they know is destroying Ukraine. Go ahead,
      Richard. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, I think there’s again the answer lies in being aware
      of the history. The very effort of that person on the clip to put away the historian,
      that’s not interesting except as a reflection of the need not to think historically
      about these questions because you don’t like where that thinking takes you. So
      let me do it and give you another way of understanding it. Ever since 1945, Europeans
      have been in awe of the United States. After all, the United States was where,
      in the end, they borrowed the money to fight World War I. The United States was
      the country that could produce military ships and planes and bombs in World War
      II that were what the Europeans relied on more and more as the war progressed.
      The irony, the historical irony, is that the United States was the industrial
      superpower of the first half of the 20th century and was therefore in a position
      to become the dominant empire because the Europeans fought a war which exhausted
      them, destroyed them, and created literally the market for American industry.
      Before the war, by the nature of economics, and after the war, by the nature of
      the war, as the Marshall Plan showed, the United States was in a position to lend
      them the money to use to buy the American industrial output without which there
      wouldn’t have been a reconstruction or it would have taken much, much longer.
      So here’s the reality. In Europe, after 1945, and up to this minute, every active
      politician learned if he or she didn’t know it before that the way to go up the
      career ladder in the governments of Europe was to be known, to befriend the United
      States. To be pro-American. To be eager to accommodate the superpower. And every
      politician who didn’t get that memorandum was pushed aside, often by the United
      States, who made it crystal clear: we don’t like this one. We don’t want that
      one. We’re not happy with this one. That’s how it worked. When you read now about
      the behavior of the woman American diplomat, whose name I forgot, who put Mr.
      Zelensky into power, that was not unusual that an American diplomat, an ambassador,
      or a…. NIMA ALKHORSHID: You’re talking about Victoria Nuland. RICHARD WOLFF: That’s
      right. Victoria Nuland. Thank you. She’s not unusual. She is not distinctive.
      There’s nothing interesting or exceptional about her, including dismissing the
      Europeans who cared about them. That’s what she’s famous for. But she only said
      out loud what everyone knew. Why am I telling you this? Because the leaders of
      Europe today, Starmer, Macron, and Merz, that’s who they are. They have built
      their careers. They have spent the last 30, 40, 50 years building a career around
      being the patsy for the United States. That’s who they know. That’s where their
      self-image comes from. They’re not going to turn against the United States because
      they’ve gotten to the position they have precisely because they were the most
      acceptable to the United States. No one should be surprised by this. Of course,
      that’s where they go. And if there is a moment when an unusual American leader
      like Trump questions what’s going on, it’s going to take some time before others
      who question like Trump, displace this generation of European leaders who are
      simply carrying out what they have developed. It reminds me of a famous cartoon
      I used to see in the movies. And there’s an image of a duck running off the edge
      of a cliff. And it gets to the edge and it keeps on running for another few minutes
      before it looks down and realizes there’s no cliff anymore and then it drops like
      a stone. You are going to see in Europe over the next months and years the steady,
      slow disappearance of the U.S. pandering European political elite. And they’re
      going to be replaced by people who see the world differently and who reject a
      future because it’s not looking very good for them. And then Mr. Merz is the ultimate.
      Because Mr. Merz not only made his political career by being a patsy, but he worked
      for Blackstone or BlackRock, one of the two leading investment houses, as the
      head of their German office. Okay, you can’t be more American than Mr. Merz. So
      he is, he’s the poster boy, and Macron isn’t different, and Starmer isn’t different.
      We’re watching the last of the Mohicans here, but it’s not a tribe in America,
      it’s a tribe in Europe. And getting together around Ukraine is like old home days.
      It’s these people once again being in their element, fighting the evil Russians
      on behalf of the Americans, standing up for democracy, and intoning all of the
      catechism of that kind of politics. And like the duck running off the edge, they
      can’t stand looking down because if they do, they will see that the United States,
      to whom they are showing their good obedience, isn’t there anymore, but has turned
      and left and is looking at them as if they were the patsies that they always were.
      There is no greater hatred than that of the master, who no longer leads the slave
      and needs to get rid of that slave and has to come up with an excuse and not understand
      how much the slave did for them. This is pathological politics that we are watching.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: I think Richard has summarized the European political dynamic
      quite well. I’m beginning to wonder how much Trump really is trying to set out
      a new position, vis-à-vis the Cold War. After all, it was he who broke the original
      agreement with Iran, and he who escalated the situation of the war between Russia
      and Ukraine. There’s one theory that I think some of the guests on Nima’s show
      have suggested: that what Trump is trying to do and what the American deep state
      is trying to do is even though they know they cannot win the war, even though
      they accept the principle that, yes, it’s a stalemate, at least they can use the
      stalemate to continue to drain Russia, drain Russia, and drain Russia, as long
      as America is not paying the expense, Europe is paying the expense, Israel is
      paying the expense, the Arab countries are paying the expense, as long as they
      can do that. But the whole idea is to somehow be enough of an annoyance to Russia,
      which is the highest level of victory they can have, an annoyance, and an external
      cost to say to Russia. Well, you know, we can stop all of this. You can come over
      to our side if you will agree to join us in sanctioning your natural enemy, China.
      I think that is the fantasy that the dream state has. I’m beginning to worry about
      Trump’s policy; it’s as if Trump is following all of this deep state fantasy that,
      yes, if we can just somehow pressure Russia enough, the fantasy was that number
      one, Russia’s growth would decline, the ruble would decline in price, not rise.
      The voters in Russia would turn against Putin’s United Russia Party, not support
      it, as populations do when they support their leader, when their country’s at
      war. Their whole fantasy was based on even though not winning, they could somehow
      persuade, they could hurt Russia enough that it would come over to their side
      to avoid the hurt and be willing to ultimately commit suicide, let the United
      States move into Ukraine, carve up Russia and destroy Russia, and then try to
      do the same against China. That’s the Cold War fantasy that the deep state has,
      and that the deep state’s trying to gain enough support for, from the crazies
      in Congress, from Schumer on the Democratic side to South Carolina in the Senate
      on the other side. I think that’s the real dynamic that they’re facing. And it’s
      a crazy dynamic, and it’s bound to fail. And as Richard just said, the master
      gets very angry when it sees itself losing. RICHARD WOLFF: Let me add that the
      missing element, Michael is right, the missing element here is having a significant
      part of your population, whether it be of your political leaders or of the society
      as a whole, who asks the obvious, which is if you keep doing what you’re doing
      to Russia, if it doesn’t seem to be draining them, turning them in on each other,
      upsetting the society, then maybe what you’re facing is what you should have imagined
      in the first place, that sometimes when you attack another country, you solidify
      it and unify it and mobilize it to be your enemy. And then you’ve made the mistake
      of losing because you have strengthened your own enemy. You have to ask that question.
      It looks like Russia has gotten exactly that. Mr. Putin gets enormous popular
      support from polling, including polling done by people that are not friendly to
      him. So we’re not stuck with only one kind of evidence. And look, Mr. Trump’s
      attack on the world by imposing tariffs on everybody makes the rest of the world
      very much able, no matter how sleazy their politicians might be, they’re all in
      a position now to do something that has more than a grain of truth, to blame whatever
      the economic problems are of their country on the United States. You have positioned
      yourself as the big bad herder. You’re the one who’s hurting their exports, their
      imports, their balance of payments, their gold holdings, whatever the hell it
      is. There is a logical link of that to the tariffs and all of that. Look, there’s
      a new leader of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce just announced. Okay, the new leader
      does what the old leader did. We like Trump. Oh, yes, tax cuts are wonderful.
      But you know, this stuff about tariffs? Awful. They don’t want these tariffs.
      And why is that important? Because the business community of America will go along
      with everything Michael just said about the American government as long as it
      doesn’t look like they’re going to lose. Because at that point, it’s not attractive
      anymore. Mr. Trump better be very, very careful. Running after the fantasy of
      the State Department, as he described it, as Michael just described it, is all
      well and good until it isn’t. And when it doesn’t work, when it’s beginning to
      cost, then the questions will be raised. My goodness. Just as now, the questions
      will be raised. Not by people who are against his policies on immigrants. They
      don’t care. They’re not against deporting. They don’t care. But if you can’t function
      in downtown Los Angeles, because of the policy, then they care. That they do not
      want. That’s disruptive to business, to commerce, to tourism. They don’t want
      any of that. And that’s a problem. And that’s a problem you should have understood
      you could be worsening by the very policies that you’re pursuing. There is no
      evidence that the Russians are facing a situation that would require them to do
      what the fantasy Michael just described would have them do: throw in the towel,
      give up the fight. Not at all. There’s nothing. There’s no evidence at all. The
      right wing is correct in this country that the Russians continue to fight the
      war and that absolutely nothing you have done to them has led them to come to
      the table. The only really interesting thing is if putting tanks where you hadn’t
      put them, putting F-16s where you hadn’t put them, whether raising the sanctions,
      by the way, the latest European sanction package is called package number 18.
      That’s because 17 previous ones did not work. That’s why you have more of that.
      But there’s an old joke. You keep doing the same thing, hoping for a different
      result-suggests that you’re not sane anymore. We are at a very dangerous point.
      There isn’t much left in the way of slack. And by the time they figure it out,
      which is another six months, most military experts think the war in Ukraine will
      be over within six months because the Russians will have finished the job. And
      we are in a very bizarre moment of this whole story. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the
      interesting thing, Richard, is that you and I can say these things on Nima’s show,
      and even the Chamber of Commerce can begin to show realism. But if you and I worked
      for the CIA or the State Department, they would say we’re not team players. We’re
      not on the team. We would be forced out, just like Ray McGovern describes his
      having been forced out by the CIA. That our voices are not heard within the U.S.
      deep state or within the government or within the leaders of the Democratic and
      the Republican Party. That’s the problem. They have thoroughly insulated themselves
      from reality. I guess you could say that’s the big picture wrapping all of what
      we’ve been discussing. RICHARD WOLFF: Yep. All I can tell you is every now and
      then, despite my having the label Marxist put on me, I am invited by a hedge fund
      in downtown Manhattan. And when I get there, I say always ask my first question:
      why are you having someone like me talk to you? And their answer, if they’re smart,
      and those are the ones that hire me to do it, they answer, well, we know what
      the other side thinks. We see it all day, every day. We need to understand what
      critics think. That’s what part of our job is. Of course, we invite people like
      you because, because quote, it would be stupid not to. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Exactly.
      Thank you so much, Richard and Michael, for being with us today. Great pleasure
      as always. RICHARD WOLFF: Thank you. Thank you to our team: Transcription: hudsearch

      Wolff and Michael Hudson to discuss significant geopolitical issues, particularly
      in light of Tulsi Gabbard's recent statements regarding nuclear threats. Gabbard,
      as the head of U.S. intelligence, warned that the world is closer to nuclear annihilation
      than ever, criticizing political elites for escalating tensions between nuclear
      powers while ensuring their own safety. Wolff responded by highlighting the gravity
      of Gabbard's remarks, emphasizing the ongoing crises in the Middle East, Ukraine,
      and relations with China, and suggesting that the situation has reached a stalemate
      without clear solutions.

    text: 'Quarterly Q & A June 13, 2025 Please support Michael’s work by becoming a
      Patreon supporter . KARL FITZGERALD: Michael, it’s so great to see you. We’re
      all so enthusiastic about this meeting, so we’re glad you got here. Okay, let’s
      get into it. MICHAEL HUDSON: We have seven minutes left to discuss the whole thing.
      KARL FITZGERALD: Michael, I thought we had two hours tonight! MICHAEL HUDSON:
      I know, I’m kidding. All right, let’s begin. KARL FITZGERALD: Welcome, everyone,
      to our quarterly Q & A session with Michael Hudson, who’s been analyzing the economic
      matrix for 55 years. Over a dozen books. A lot of support out there for his work.
      We love seeing all the comments on all the different YouTubes he’s involved in.
      Great to have our Patreon supporters here today to delve into the topics of the
      day from their perspectives. We really respect everyone’s support. The support
      and independent funding of Michael’s work is just so important. As we know, it’s
      getting harder and harder to get the word out. So, great! We can come together
      here and ask Michael the key questions of the time. We do have a bit of a different
      format today. We don’t have a separate Q&A question stream, so just put your questions
      in the chat. After a little while, we’ll get some people to come up on screen.
      So Michael, how are you reading the L.A. riots and what’s happening there? What
      sort of distraction agenda is going on in America at present? MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Well, they’re not riots at all. Just as in Ukraine, you have people rising up
      against the army recruiters that are going in and grabbing Ukrainians to send
      them to the front. Here, you have the immigration authorities coming. They’re
      going into Hispanic restaurants, they’re going into construction sites, they’re
      going into anywhere they think there may be Hispanics and just arresting whatever
      Hispanics, without looking at whether they’re citizens or not. Just being a Hispanic
      is grounds for being arrested and quickly deported before they can have a chance
      to say: Let me go home and get my passport (that I usually don’t carry out, if
      I’m going to have dinner). So Trump says: If you don’t agree with American policy,
      you’re a rioter, you’re a Marxist. It would be wonderful if there were all these
      Marxists in California. California and Marxism are about as antithetical as you
      can probably get on the ideological spectrum. So, a riot is simply not agreeing
      with what Trump said. And there are a number of quotes he’s been giving: I want
      everybody to agree with me. Or at his birthday parade this Saturday, he said:
      If there’s anybody with a sign or anything, they’ll be arrested. We don’t have
      any First Amendment anymore, guaranteeing the right of free speech. So if you
      want a right of free speech, and it doesn’t agree with Trump, you can be arrested.
      You remember, or you may not remember, what Mark Twain said: If elections really
      mattered, they wouldn’t let you do it. So basically, that’s the situation. Trump
      can do whatever he wants, and the Supreme Court can say: This is illegal under
      the Constitution. And Trump will say: What are you going to do about it? The Supreme
      Court doesn’t have an army. The Congress doesn’t have an army. He’s in control
      of the National Guard. And so he can send in the National Guard. I remember in
      the 1930s, my father convinced Floyd B. Olson, the governor of Minnesota, to call
      in the National Guard to protect the strikers in the great truckers strike, a
      general strike in Minneapolis. And the National Guard was called in by the governor
      — not the president, the governor — to protect the strikers and the demonstrators
      against the thugs that — I’m told — Walgreens and other trucking companies had
      all called in to try to bang up the strikers. So it’s possible that the National
      Guards can do some good, but that was during the Roosevelt era. Of course, by
      the time of the Vietnam War, the National Guard was called in to shoot students
      that demonstrated against the Vietnam War. And you had the shooting at Kent [State]
      University. The National Guard has basically turned into the personal army of
      the president, and there’s nothing that the government can do about it. And there’s
      nothing Congress is going to change about that. None of this is about economics.
      This is just in case there are non-Americans listening, and you don’t know the
      weird twists and turns of the American constitutional government and legal system.
      It’s all been very educational in the last few days. KARL FITZGERALD: Okay. There’s
      interest from Suneil Basu on when your new book will be published on the debt
      crusades. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the book’s all finished. It’s being proofread
      now, and the index is being made. The index, which is being made in Australia,
      will probably take about two months. Then it’ll take another month for the typesetting
      that’ll be done in Hong Kong. I’m looking for a better cover designer. What am
      I going to have for a cover? If I do have an illustration, I’d like it to be on
      the left-hand side. You’ll have a church, and somehow this church will be metamorphosing
      into a bank. Because in America, many of the banks look just like the old Greek
      temples, the same “temples of finance,” you could say. I’m thinking that there
      could be something like that, but there has to be room for the title too. Otherwise,
      it’s just the title. So, if any of you know of very good book designers, that
      would be appreciated. There’s also something else we’re looking for. As you know,
      I do a weekly broadcast on Nima’s show, “Dialogue Works,” with Rick Wolf. And
      a number of publishers — lefty publishers — have wanted to take our lectures and
      put them into a book — at least the best lectures — and publish them. But we need
      an editor, somebody who can go through– In the early, maybe ten or twenty shows,
      I would give sort of my usual zippy remarks, and then Richard would usually have
      a fifteen-minute set piece that he would do. And many of the set pieces would
      go way beyond the topic that Nima was asking about. So there has to be some way
      of paring down what both of us say, to get the essence of what we’re talking about,
      as we’re analyzing the whole geopolitical structure of the world and how it’s
      all changing. So, if anybody thinks they’d like to be a copy editor and have pretty
      free range in cutting, pasting, deciding what’s important, what should come out,
      how do you summarize, how do you boil down what was, let’s say, a fifty-minute
      interview (sometimes an hour or more), into ten or fifteen pages, we could have
      maybe twenty interviews. And I would probably publish it through ISLET because
      lefty publishers don’t have much distribution anywhere. And if you’re not going
      to have distribution, at least we have the internet to let people know that they
      can order it, through Amazon or the usual bookstores that take their 40% cut.
      KARL FITZGERALD: So, we are looking for a new book designer and an editor. So,
      crowdsourcing through our Patreon supporters here. Andrew McKeen asks about U.S.
      Treasury debt levels. “[They] seem to keep increasing beyond all expectations
      but don’t seem to cause significant economic disruptions. When does that stop
      being the case? When is the level of debt just too much? And, Michael, what are
      you seeing with the U.S. bond rate? How’s that influencing that exact story?”
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, today there are two problems. The pretended problem that
      the right-wingers — the Von Misesians and other people — are saying is: Oh, the
      debt is so high, the government can’t afford to pay it. And, somehow, the government
      will go broke and you’re not going to get the promised dollars of interest and
      principal that you invested. That’s just silly. The advantage of having debt in
      your own currency is you can always pay the debt. There’s no problem at all in
      getting repaid for your 10-year bond, 30-year bond, short-term 2-year Treasury
      security, in your own currency. The problem is if you’re a foreign investor in
      Treasury securities, if you’re a central bank, and you’ve been receiving all of
      your foreign reserves, basically, all of the money that America has been spending
      militarily over the whole world in excess of what it’s earning ends up in foreign
      central banks. So Germany, Europe, Saudi Arabia, Russia, China all end up holding
      U.S. Treasury bills. Well, what happens if they decide, as they’ve been deciding
      in the last month or so, they don’t want to spend their savings on lending to
      the United States, investing in government Treasury securities to finance the
      budget deficit that pays for the military deficit to go to war with them and fight
      against them? So they’re bailing out of the dollar. They’re de-dollarizing. That’s
      one of the central things that I’ve been saying. Well, the dollar’s gone down
      10% so far under Trump, and falling. So suppose you say: Oh, I’m going to buy
      10-year Treasury securities. They’ve been yielding 4.5% for the last couple of
      months. Well, what’s the point of investing in Treasury securities, getting your
      4.5% in dollars? That’s okay, but if the dollar goes down by 10%, then you end
      up losing 5.5% on your investment. So it’s not really something that is safe at
      all. This is the same problem with stablecoin. Stablecoin says: We’re investing
      every dollar that you put into the crypto stablecoin in Treasury securities. Well,
      that’s fine. That means that the holder of stablecoin gets a Treasury security,
      but he or she doesn’t get any of the interest payment on it. It’s the stablecoin
      or the other crypto company that organizes the crypto that says: Okay, you know,
      we’ve invested their money in stablecoin. We’re taking all of the interest for
      ourselves. We’re making billions and billions of dollars on this. Well, one problem
      is they also will get the capital gain, if the dollar goes up, or the capital
      loss, if the dollar goes down. So, suppose that you’ve invested in stablecoin
      and now all the investors say: Okay, we don’t want to be part of an international
      financial system whose purpose is to finance America’s military deficit and NATO’s
      war on the 85% global majority. So please give us our money back. Well, the stablecoin
      company [says]: Alright, we’ll sell all of the Treasury securities that we’ve
      invested your money safely in. But as they sell these securities, they’ll be getting
      much less dollar money than was put in because the interest rates will probably
      go up, meaning the price of these securities is going to fall as people cash into
      securities and make withdrawals. Even though it’s all safely invested in securities,
      the securities prices go up and down. And from 2008 to about 2022, you had the
      biggest bond market rally in history. You had interest rates going down all the
      way to 0.1%. So this means that a huge, huge increase in the price of people who
      held bonds that were paying 5%, maybe even 6% on government bonds. Well, now that
      the interest rates are going up again, you’re having the price of the bonds going
      down. So the problem is you can have a capital loss in your investment in Treasury
      securities, even though the government will pay you all of the interest and all
      of the principal that the bond says it’s going to pay. The market price of this
      bond is going to fall and you won’t get as much as you would have when interest
      rates were lower. That’s the problem. KARL FITZGERALD: And with yesterday’s inflation
      figures out, coming a little lower than were expected, how does inflation relate
      to the rising interest rate and the bond interplay? MICHAEL HUDSON: It doesn’t.
      That’s a myth. The pretense is that — and this is a pretense that’s been made
      since the 1750s — bondholders and bankers are just like everybody else. They’re
      sort of middle-class people just trying to make a living and they live off their
      bonds. And if they make money on bonds — the interest — they spend it on goods
      and services. Somehow, the money that you pay them, they spend back into the economy.
      Malachy Postlethwayt in 1752 had a whole argument about why England was running
      into trouble investing by borrowing from the Dutch. He said: When we borrow from
      the Dutch, we have to pay them debt service. And the Dutch don’t buy English goods
      and services at all. They don’t spend the money to England. In fact, they don’t
      spend their money on goods and services at all. What do bondholders do when they
      get more and more interest that goes up and up and up over time? (That is, the
      interest-bearing debt goes up and up over time.) Well, they use their interest
      receipts to make more loans and buy more bonds. Or, they buy luxury real estate,
      especially real estate in the biggest cities, the biggest cities specifically
      that are the big banking centers. So if, for instance, the Dutch did buy anything
      in England, they would buy nice, big, expensive properties in London. And in fact,
      the more money that England paid foreign investors, whether it was Dutch investors
      or others, the more international investors would buy in England, and the balance
      — between London and other countries that were not banking centers — was going
      to become more and more disproportionate. London would grow relatively to the
      other centers. And the other thing that Postlethwayt said, that the Dutch might
      spend money on (or English creditors, bondholders that bought British bonds)?
      They would spend money on goods and services — on luxuries, mainly Italian textiles
      — but not in England. I mean, England didn’t really make that many luxuries. So
      this whole myth that, somehow, when interest rates go up and debt goes up, it’s
      all recycled into the economy… And you have to keep the bondholders whole so that
      they don’t lose money off the fact that now that there’s a price inflation in
      goods and services — which they don’t buy — they would lose out. And your heart
      should bleed for them and say: We’ve got to make sure that if the prices for our
      goods and services go up, that the bondholders don’t lose money from this. We’ve
      got to cut back the money supply in order to keep the prices low, and impose austerity.
      And David Ricardo came out, by the time he was a bullionist in 1809 and 1810.
      Ricardo said that debtor countries should not have any paper money at all. Paper
      money just increases the ability to spend. They should have hard money. Silver
      and gold coinage should be all that they had so that they’d keep the prices low.
      And Ricardo’s aim was, of course, to prevent debtor countries from having enough
      government money to spend in subsidizing and developing their own industry and
      agriculture, so that they could do for themselves what England, France, and Germany
      were doing for themselves. So to answer your question, interest rates going up
      and down are simply an excuse for the Federal Reserve to impose austerity using
      “junk economics.” KARL FITZGERALD: Nice. And how much further can U.S. debt go?
      The “Big Beautiful Bill” pushing debts further up towards $40 trillion? Are bondholders
      going to keep buying this or de-dollarization? How much of a threat is this to
      America’s future? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it’s a Ponzi scheme that has worked quite
      well so far. A Ponzi scheme will work as long as there are enough new investors
      in the scheme to pay interest and dividends to the already subscribed investors.
      But you need to keep expanding and have more and more investors come in. Well,
      for government debt, the government is the subscriber to the Ponzi scheme of government
      and private credit. And the government can continue to extend money to the banking
      system, to the economy — more and more debt. The economy and the banks will borrow
      the interest to be paid. And as the volume of debt goes up, the volume of interest
      payments is going to go up, that the government has to pay, as well as rolling
      over the debt as maturities shorten, as the debt people only lend for a short-term
      period of time. So you’ll have the government basically monetizing it. And if
      you look at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve now has a negative net worth
      on its balance sheet because it’s been just subsidizing the banks and the large
      financial institutions, so that they are able to remain solvent in an economy
      that, basically, is insolvent. We don’t have enough money to pay the debts. So,
      what do you do if you don’t have enough money to pay the debts? You print more
      money. I would write down the debts, but obviously the government is not going
      to do that. So, we’re just going to wait for some crisis. And the likely crisis
      will be not a problem of the government stopping printing money as the federal
      debt rises. It’ll be foreign central banks de-dollarizing, isolating the United
      States economy, and saying: You know, we’re not interested in investing there
      anymore. We’re not interested in agreeing to the sanctions that the United States
      insists that we impose on Russia, China, and other countries. We’re willing to
      give up trade and investment with the United States to turn to parts of the world
      that are growing more rapidly, primarily in Asia. KARL FITZGERALD: Virginia Cotts
      asks: “What would be the effect of a Zero Interest Rate Policy, a permanent ZIRP?”
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, that’s what we had for quite a few years. Zero interest
      rates means that bank customers will borrow at zero interest, and they will buy
      a stock or a bond that’s yielding 4.5%. For instance, if I could borrow a million
      dollars at zero interest, I could buy a 10-year government Treasury bond that’s
      yielding 4.5%. On that million that I borrowed, I could make $45,000 a year on
      it. I could just keep borrowing cheap, and investing in bonds. Or I could invest
      in stocks that may pay dividends and capital gains together of, maybe, 9% or 10%.
      And I get to buy more and more assets, bonds and stock, or real estate — on credit
      — and hope that the asset that I buy will yield a higher return — not only interest,
      but capital gain — than the zero interest rate that I have to pay. So it guarantees
      that debtors can make a free lunch by borrowing, and also that there will be more
      and more financial institutions and individuals borrowing to bid up the price
      of assets. So you’re going to have asset price inflation for all of this. Despite
      all of the debt, you’re not going to have debt deflation because even though there’s
      more interest that has to be paid, you still can borrow cheaper than the nominal
      interest and capital gain prospect that stocks, bonds, or real estate provide.
      KARL FITZGERALD: Sunil asks another good question. “It appears that the U.K. is
      increasing its share of U.S. treasuries roughly at the same rate China is reducing
      them. Where is Britain getting the huge amount of money to do this?” MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Probably from offshore banking centers. Where is Britain getting the money to
      buy the U.S. Treasuries? KARL FITZGERALD: Yeah. MICHAEL HUDSON: I think it could
      be acting on behalf of other governments who are doing their transactions through
      the Bank of England, through England. I’d have to look at the overall balance-of-payment
      statistics to answer that. But it’s not really British money so much. Where is
      England getting the money? Its economy is in a mess right now. So it has to be
      foreign money going through England to the United States. And partly, maybe, it’s
      a lot of Europeans. If you’re a German, for instance, you realize that Germany’s
      been defeated financially by the sanctions on Russia. They’re called sanctions
      on Russia, but the American sanctions are really sanctions against Germany and
      Europe. It’s America essentially asserting its control over Europe, fighting to
      the last European business, until the last business, last industry, goes out of
      business. Just like we’re fighting for the last Ukrainian to pass away. So, I
      would imagine it’s European money via England. KARL FITZGERALD: There’s plenty
      of interesting plays going on there in the Treasury space. Who’s selling down
      their Treasuries more, Japan or China? MICHAEL HUDSON: China is worried that the
      United States is simply going to confiscate its U.S. dollar holdings, as the United
      States did for Russia. Since America says, China is our number one existential
      enemy, you really don’t want to keep all your savings in the hand of someone who
      says you’re their great enemy, and they’re going to — in two years — attack you
      and destroy you. So it’s understandable why they may not want to hold dollars.
      Japan, I think, is in somewhat of a squeeze right now. Right now, especially with
      the tariffs, Japan just isn’t obtaining the dollars from its foreign trade that
      it was obtaining before. And so it’s having to cover its balance-of-payments deficit
      by selling its savings in the form of Treasury securities. KARL FITZGERALD: Okay,
      so gently, gently. Matt Connors has a bit of a tongue twister here: “I know the
      long-term goal is to get out of this system. But in the meantime, would something
      like a functioning society bond, in the spirit of victory bonds during World War
      II, be a worthwhile political tool for a new party? A clumsy question, I know,
      but I want to end the argument that we need to keep floating bonds with none of
      the money raised going to real social needs.” And I suppose a way to reflect on
      that question is the Canadian use of community bonds, where they have community
      bonds that are used to raise finance for community housing, for example. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Communities cannot create money. They can accumulate assets and repay
      debts, but only a national government can create money. So a community bond is
      sort of like a credit union account, or a savings bank and a savings and loan
      association. They’re not banks and they’re not part of the money creation process.
      They’re on the sidelines. KARL FITZGERALD: Switching gears, Jonathan Becnel asks:
      “What assistance can Marxist political organizations in America help you, Doc
      Hudson, spread your economic message of an alternative GDP, that you suggested
      in our last Patreon meet-up.” MICHAEL HUDSON: I’ve had almost no connection with
      any Marxist party in my life. They’re completely uninterested in finance. I grew
      up in a Marxist family. I knew many Marxists. None of them had any interest or
      understanding of finance. And as far as I could tell, none of them read Volumes
      Two or Three of Capital. So they didn’t have any idea what Marx wrote about debt
      and finance and rent theory. And this is not only the case in America and Europe,
      it’s the case in China. I haven’t found much receptivity in China to my talking
      about land rent, or economic rent, or value theory, or the tendency of finance
      capital to grow exponentially to the point where there is a crisis — and to essentially
      act in a predatory and parasitic manner. So, Marxism has really very little to
      say about what I talk about. And the only reason that I’m considered a “Marxist”
      is I’m a classical economist. And my whole focus in all the work that I do is
      value and price theory. From the Physiocrats through Adam Smith to John Stuart
      Mill, the whole of classical economics unfolding reached its pinnacle, really,
      in Marxist value theory. And it’s very detailed. Like the other economists before
      him, he said that the excess of market price over cost value is economic rent.
      How do you explain the fact that prices are in excess of the actual cost of production
      to the landowner, or to the banker, or to the monopolist, or to the miner? And
      this is what Adam Smith, Ricardo, the Physiocrats, were all about. And the classical
      economists were essentially the theoreticians of the emergence of industrial capitalism.
      They said: What do we need for Britain to become the workshop of the world, to
      become an industrial country? Well, they all agreed that you have to cut the cost
      of production so that you can undersell your rivals. And Marx pointed out that
      the ideal of industrial capitalism is to get rid of all the unnecessary costs.
      The unnecessary costs were economic rent that, as John Stuart Mill said, landlords
      make in their sleep, without playing any productive service at all. So, the objective
      of all of the classical economists was to get free of economic rent. Starting
      with land rent, you get rid of the hereditary landlord class. How do you do it?
      Either you tax the land rent away, or you socialize the land. You make it a public
      utility. Same thing with natural resources. They’re the national patrimony. You
      don’t let them be privatized. You let miners and developers, even oil companies,
      come in and they get a return on their capital investment to mine the ores, or
      the minerals, or the oil, but they don’t get a value for what nature provides
      for nothing. This should belong to the public domain. Same thing with natural
      monopolies, railroads, communications, education, health care. The American school
      of the late 19th century said that the governments should provide these services
      on a subsidized basis, not to make a profit. You don’t want any rent extraction
      to exist so that you support a class that gets income without playing a productive
      role. Well, by the late 19th century, the landlords, and the bankers, and the
      monopolists, fought back. And they said that there’s no such thing as economic
      rent, that everybody plays a role. The landlord plays a productive role. He decides:
      Who am I going to rent to, and how much am I going to charge, and how am I going
      to keep repairing the building? The banker gets to create money on a keyboard.
      (It was paper and pen, originally.) They decide: Who am I going to lend this money
      to? Basically. But basically, there’s no cost of production for a rent-yielding
      purpose. So, the whole idea was to minimize this entire cost. Now, tell me what
      your question is again, and I’ll get to the point. Oh, about Marxism. Marx refined
      the idea. All of the classical economists from Adam Smith on, Ricardo, had the
      labor theory of value, and said: Well, ultimately, how do we decide what’s the
      cost of production, as opposed to non-production costs? Well, it can all ultimately
      be reduced to labor. And Marx said: Quite right, but what kind of labor are you
      referring to? Are you referring to the cost of labor to the industrial capitalist,
      or the price of this labor when the capitalist sells the products of the factory
      that employs this labor at a markup, namely, his profit? This is surplus value.
      Now, when Marx used the word surplus value, he didn’t say “rent.” He said: It’s
      true that the industrialist sells a product for more than it costs, but he’s not
      like a landlord, or a banker, or a monopolist. He doesn’t make money in his sleep.
      The industrial capitalist actually plays a productive role. And so, the profit
      and the surplus value that the industrial capitalist makes is an element of value.
      And that should be included in the economy’s measure of product. What should not
      be included in the economy’s product would be economic rent: the land rent, the
      natural resource rent, the monopoly rent, and the financial returns from the banking
      privilege. All rent is a return to some kind of political privilege, or other,
      and this is not part of the production process. And Marx, more than his predecessors,
      was very clear in dividing the economy into two parts: the production economy
      that we’re all familiar with, and what he called the “circulation economy.” He
      meant the financial real estate sector — what I call the FIRE sector: Finance,
      Insurance, and Real Estate, plus monopolies. Now, suppose you translated this
      value theory into national income, or GDP accounts. The GDP being gross national
      product would include what’s actually produced by industry, agriculture: actual
      output. But the anti-classical school, which basically was a reaction against
      classical rent theory, said: Well, there’s no such thing as rent, and so there’s
      no rentier class. And so there’s no return to rentier products. So it’s all part
      of GDP. It’s all part of the product: The landlord creates a product, the banker
      creates a product, the miner creates a product, the monopolist creates a product.
      And so, if you follow the classical value theory, then you’d have the GDP of the
      United States being maybe only, order of magnitude, half as large as it actually
      is. Because at least half of what is counted as national income and product is
      the returns to the finance, insurance, and real estate sector, and the various
      monopolies. Whereas in China — that does not have an independent financial class
      that makes money financially — China has essentially industrialized the financial
      system and creates money through the Bank of China for what it considers to be
      actual production, not speculation. So China has a much higher proportion of what
      the United Nations consider to be GDP than the United States, that has all of
      this rentier exploitation, and what Marx called unnecessary costs of production,
      and what Mill said [was] income that they make in their sleep. So that’s the difference.
      And you can imagine that this is exactly why the vested interests do not want
      to follow classical value theory. And since Marx was the last great classical
      economist — there were also Thorstein Veblen, he came later, there were others
      — but it was Marx. If Adam Smith were alive today, he would be called a Marxist.
      If John Stuart Mill were alive today, he would be called a Marxist. Anybody would
      be called a Marxist who says there’s such a thing as economic rent and it’s unearned
      income, because that’s what Marx said, like all the other classical economists.
      So, the whole history of economic thought has been dropped from the academic curriculum
      so that people won’t really know what Adam Smith said, what Ricardo said, what
      Mill said. They were supposed to be free-market economists, but the whole meaning
      of a free market has been turned inside out. When the classical economists talked
      about a free market, they meant a market free from economic rent, and from the
      rentier class. Now, the anti-classical reaction says: No, no! A free market is
      a libertarian market. It’s the freedom for rentiers not to be regulated by government,
      not to have their rent taxed away. It’s the freedom to be able to become a rentier
      at society’s expense. That’s basically the inversion of classical economics. And
      today, almost all classical economics is considered to be part of Marxism. And
      in that sense, because I’m a classical economist, I’m considered to be a Marxist.
      KARL FITZGERALD: And so neoliberalism is really eating the eyes out of classical
      economics because so few people actually understand what you’re talking about
      that they can get away with it. When I hear Michael of talk about the alternative
      GDP discussion, that’s what happens after decisions are made. It’s far better
      to think strategically and work on tax reform and get in front of those decisions,
      so that we can target these rentier incomes and actually make a difference. It
      feels, for me, frustrating when people talk about the need for the World Happiness
      Index, or some other form of GDP measure: It’s too late by then. The problem’s
      already occurred. Let’s get stuck into the tax reform. And that’s what the classical
      economists were on to. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, happy… I never liked the whole idea
      of happiness, it’s silly. I remember I must have been about 22 years old, and
      I was invited to a party, and they were passing drinks around. The hostess came
      over to me and said: Are you happy? And I thought, gee, it’s a philosophical question:
      What is happiness? And she said: No, no, do you want a refill on your whiskey?
      I mean, that’s my idea as far as I can understand happiness. I’m not a philosopher.
      KARL FITZGERALD: Yeah. Okay. Why don’t we open it up? Karl Sanchez, you got a
      question there. Do you just want to ask it? Come on screen. MICHAEL HUDSON: There
      you are. KARL SANCHEZ: I’ve got to figure out what I wrote here now. Oh, yeah.
      What did Marx specifically write that pissed off the capitalists and the rentiers?
      Why did they wage war on Marx/Marxism? MICHAEL HUDSON: They were waging war not
      against Marx himself, but against the whole of classical economics. They were
      waging war against Adam Smith, against John Stuart Mill, against Ricardo. They
      were waging war on the concept that some people did not earn the money and the
      wealth that they had. That some was unearned. It was an unnecessary cost of production.
      The money that you paid them wasn’t for them playing a productive role. And the
      parasites said: We are not parasites. We are part of the host itself. And that’s
      the point that I made in Killing the Host, that they wanted to be considered productive.
      That’s what they didn’t like about Marxism. Quite apart from the fact that — before
      Marx, the value theorists who developed the theory of value and price (that price
      is the excess of rent over cost value) — these were basically bourgeois. They
      were capitalists. They were not trying to develop: How do we make industrial capitalism
      more efficient? They made it ‘more efficient’ by minimizing the amount of wages
      that they had to pay their labor force. And to Ricardo and the other classical
      economists, you minimize what you have to pay your labor by making their food
      cheaper, by making their basic needs cheaper, so that you didn’t have to pay them
      enough money to pay agricultural landlords for high-priced food, housing landlords
      for high-priced housing. You didn’t have to pay any of that. But what Marx said
      was: Let’s look at this from the point of view of the workers. Do they really
      need the capitalists to be the major investors? You’re already having government
      investment in public infrastructure, government investment in America, the Erie
      Canal, the railroad. Private investment is not as cost-efficient as public investment.
      So, to them, the fact that the whole tendency of classical economics was to evolve
      into socialism. And the opponents of socialism, mainly the rentier class (the
      rent-extracting class), didn’t want to see governments get strong enough so that
      they could tax the land. They said: We don’t want a strong government. If we can
      keep governments weak, they won’t be able to tax the land and we can defeat them.
      They won’t be able to regulate banking and keep us honest. They won’t be able
      to regulate rents and keep the price of housing from being extortionate on housing
      people. They won’t be able to have antitrust legislation to prevent monopolies
      from exploiting people. So, essentially, these were opponents of governments strong
      enough to actually implement classical political economy. KARL SANCHEZ: Okay,
      so you have the rentiers, we’ll go ahead and call them that. Now, the main argument
      that I recall against communism was that they’ll take your property from you.
      That’s what was said to America back in the Red Scare after World War I: The communists
      will take your property from you. You’ll lose all your property to them. They’ll
      confiscate everything you own. Now, I don’t think there’s a shred of truth to
      that because, as I understand it, you can go ahead and keep your property. It’s
      just a matter of now it’s going to get taxed. You’re not going to be able to go
      ahead and keep the excess that you earn from that property. MICHAEL HUDSON: That’s
      right. The Marxists and the classical economists said: You don’t have to take
      their property. You just have to collect the economic rent that the property has.
      Same thing, look at Russia today. You don’t have to actually take back the property
      that the kleptocrats have registered in their own name, from the oil industry,
      all of the other assets that they stole in the 1990s. All you have to do is collect
      the rents from these properties. You can leave them with the property. The key
      is the income from this property. KARL SANCHEZ: So the big lie back in the Red
      Scare in post-World War I was that the communists will take your property. That
      was the big lie that was said. Was it ever really backed up by any particular
      empirical evidence? I don’t recall ever reading anything in my history quests
      that showed any of that. It was just, you know, that’s what the narrative was.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, while that was going on, think of Lenin. He had the New
      Economic Policy, the NEP. And he certainly left the property in the hands of the
      bourgeoisie, but he didn’t permit them to make an income that was exploitative.
      And, of course, this occurred much more in China under Deng. Deng said: A white
      cat, black cat, what difference does it make as long as it catches mice? He let
      one hundred flowers bloom. He let individual enterprises develop and they can
      get rich. And if you got super rich, like Jack Ma and other billionaires, you’d
      say: Okay, you can’t get that rich. We are going to have some kind of progressive
      wealth tax. And even if we don’t legislate a wealth tax or a rent tax, we’re not
      going to permit billionaires getting much more than we think is morally right.
      But we’ll leave you with the property. You just can’t become a billionaire from
      it. KARL SANCHEZ: Okay, that covers the question that I had pretty much about
      wanting to pin the tail on a donkey, with regards to the whole narrative scheme
      that communism is evil, and all that. So, essentially, it was a big lie from the
      get-go, and all too many people swallowed it. MICHAEL HUDSON: Remember, they were
      saying that government is evil, Adam Smith is evil, John Stuart Mill is evil.
      What they called “communism” was everything that was considered industrial capitalism
      a century earlier. KARL SANCHEZ: Right. So in your investigations, did you uncover
      anything that was specifically publicly stated like that? Did you ever find out
      anything that was specifically publicly stated in that manner? Papers written
      or speeches given? MICHAEL HUDSON: No, Marx did not write– KARL SANCHEZ: No, any
      of the reactionaries, in what they said? MICHAEL HUDSON: What you do have is their
      alternative explanation of price. You had the English saying, well, there’s no
      such thing as rent creating an excess of price over value. The consumer is king,
      and consumer utility is what explains the high price. It has nothing to do with
      cost of production, nothing to do with economic rent. It’s just if consumers want
      something, it’s going to be a high price, relative to the cost of production.
      And they didn’t distinguish the cost of production between necessary and unnecessary
      costs, between profits and rent. You had the Austrian school, also, that tried
      to imagine that there could be an idealistic economy without government at all,
      when essentially the capitalist sector could do whatever it wanted. Like it did
      in Vienna, murdering the communists. The communists were accused of violence.
      What Marx did say is that the rentier class is going to fight with violence to
      prevent economic reform. Look at the Paris Commune in 1871, I think, around that
      time of the Prussian-French War. Marx saw that it was the classes that did not
      have to work for their income and actually create their own product that were
      fighting to keep their privilege. That somehow the classes that actually did work
      — the industrialists and labor — did not fight with the violence that the rentiers
      fought back: the Austrian school, and the right-wingers in the United States —
      the followers of anti-rent theory of John Bates Clark, and the anti-classical
      reaction that I described in Killing the Host. KARL FITZGERALD: Interesting. Michael,
      information flows are one of the big criticisms under the communist system. They
      don’t rely on the pricing mechanism to allocate resources. Have you seen any improvements
      in socialist/Marxist thinking on how those information flows can be improved to
      better reflect genuine price? MICHAEL HUDSON: That gets into computers and things,
      and I’m a techno-peasant, so not my department. KARL FITZGERALD: Okay, let’s move
      on to Steve Reed, who asked a good question, and good to hear from you, Steve:
      “I’d love to know the historical countries or places where money creation was
      done by the ruler for the good of the people, and not private debt-based.” MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, all money is debt, and some kinds of debt are accepted as money.
      So if you’re talking about money creation, you have to talk about credit and debt
      creation. And that goes way beyond money itself. And if you talk about money without
      credit and debt, then it’s as if you’re talking about commodity money instead
      of money as a legal institution, as Aristotle pointed out. And as I describe in
      my history of the Bronze Age […and Forgive Them Their Debts], and Temples of Enterprise
      and Creating Economic Order, and the other books that I’ve talked about antiquity.
      And the book that I will be publishing, that Karl mentioned at the very beginning
      on the history of the banking sector’s political alignment from the Crusades to
      World War I, is all about the transformation of money away from commodity money,
      to government debt serving as money, starting with the Bank of England. KARL FITZGERALD:
      Yeah, it’s going to be fascinating to see that book come to life, Michael. Really
      looking forward to that one. Kimberly Mims from our excellent transcription team
      has a bit of a long question, but let’s get into this: “A new generation of Americans
      is talking about feeling, character, role, story at work and at play. Hollywood
      film, theater and performance art are coming together. The other day, Norman Finkelstein
      compared Rosa Luxemburg and her cohort unfavorably to today’s left. The point,
      someone has scored a generational win against labor as a classical European enlightenment
      project. Can it be reversed or moved productively forward?” MICHAEL HUDSON: Could
      you paraphrase that? KARL FITZGERALD: I’d love to. I think she’s talking about
      identity politics working against labor and how can the left move forward from
      that? MICHAEL HUDSON: There we go. You’ve explained it all. The Democratic Party
      is the most anti-labor party. It’s the hardline Wall Street party. And its idea
      is how do we get voters to stop talking about economic issues? And so their solution
      is identity politics. First of all, during the 60s and 70s, there was ethnic politics.
      The Democratic Party was divided into organizations of Greek-American, Italian-Americans,
      Irish-Americans — they worked through various ethnicities to get that. Then it
      gradually became increasingly racial equality politics. And then finally, the
      great breakthrough was under Clinton and the really hardline anti-labor strategists
      who said: Let’s bring in the LGBTQ. And so you can have every different, every
      kind of identity — Irish, Italian, black, white, LGBTQ — every identity except
      being a wage-earner. And if you can just keep distracting people so that it’s
      every identity except the one common denominator of being a wage-earner, then
      they’re not going to see what an enemy of all of them the Democratic Party is
      — and its support of Wall Street, its support of war, its support of the military-industrial
      complex, its support of the landlord and financial class. It wants to make itself
      invisible by having people talk about something other than its identity and their
      identity, which are opposite. KARL FITZGERALD: Dena Lebowitz has another long
      question. Let’s see where we go with this one: “We’ve read that one explanation
      of the whole U.S. deportation of tens of thousands of refugees and immigrants
      is part of a program planning to remove people currently working low-paid jobs
      and to replace them with children, as well as to replace them with almost rightless
      H2A visa workers. The point of this, according to various sources, is to create
      a large, extremely vulnerable sub-class of workers, unlikely to fight back, to
      disempower workers altogether. “Also, Bukele is apparently in bed with the gangs
      and wants as many gang members shipped to him ASAP because their prosecution through
      the U.S. courts will expose this. Any thoughts on this? Please speak on how different
      sectors within the elites are fighting.” How is this likely to play out? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Again, if you could translate that question into something more specific,
      I don’t know what the connection is. KARL FITZGERALD: I’m seeing from Australia
      a fake battle between labor and capital being set up so that rentiers can continue
      carrying on as usual, and the immigrant deportation thing is the giant distraction–
      And Michael, please tell me what’s happening with special economic zones. I want
      to hear the analysis of what Trump’s doing through the “Big Beautiful Bill.” What
      tax carve-outs is he putting in there for the rentiers? Those special economic
      zones– MICHAEL HUDSON: To me, it looks like just old-fashioned American racism.
      White people hate people who aren’t white. They hate the Indians. They hate the
      Blacks. They hate the Native Americans. They hate each other’s ethnicities. That’s
      what Western civilization – that’s what Christianity is all about. The Western
      religions are hate religions, and the population is brought up to hate. That’s
      what made Roman Christianity different from every other religion. And I go into
      this in my book on the Crusades. I explain why it was that the Roman church —
      the papacy — became so authoritarian, in order to reform an utterly corrupt Roman
      papacy. The first crusade was supposed to liberate Jerusalem, but Jerusalem didn’t
      need liberation. There was already a Christian church there. There was a Jewish
      church there. There were Islamic churches there because the Muslims were in charge.
      The Muslims were tolerant of all the different religions, all the way from the
      Middle East to Spain, and Sicily, that was very largely Muslim. Charlemagne, around
      the eighth century of our era, decided to declare — and his forebears declared
      — war on the Saxons in northern Germany and tried to kill them because their religion
      was based around sacred trees. There was this intolerance that was characteristic
      of Western civilization that had not characterized other civilizations all the
      way back through antiquity. You remember Persia, when Persia conquered Babylonia,
      they left the Babylonians to follow their own religion: You can do whatever you
      want, as long as you pay taxes and tribute. They were all tolerant of the Jews.
      There was no anti-Semitism. It was the Catholic Church that really introduced
      anti-Semitism, just as it introduced the anti-Muslim, anti-Islamic spirit: There
      can only be one God and one church, and that’s us. It was all a kind of power
      play, and that feeling of religion that if you’re not part of our group, you’re
      not going to heaven, you’re the devil. This either-or polarization thinking, politically,
      and ethnically, and racially, and religiously, every other way, is a distinct
      feature of Western civilization in the modern era. It just didn’t occur before.
      And in America, it’s really the worst of all because of America’s history of slavery
      in the South. But what began simply as race hatred and a hatred of Indians, Native
      Americans just as much, became a hatred of the new immigrant influx — the Central
      Europeans, Central European Jews, the Italian immigrants, the Irish immigrants
      (especially the Irish). They were all really prejudiced against. All this is distinctly
      American. I think that Trump simply wants to get elected and he’s appealing to
      this rotten American identity politics and racism, quite different from the Democratic
      Party’s identity politics, in just a demagogic manner. KARL FITZGERALD: But Michael,
      when it comes to racism, don’t you think that the original sin was indigenous
      people around the world inherently understanding the value of the earth? And that
      was something that must be despised and deterred at all fronts. And so that’s
      where the genocide originally began– MICHAEL HUDSON: Yeah, that was the cover
      story. They really wanted to just to get rid of the domestic population. I mean,
      all they really wanted was gold. And all they wanted was the metal: the silver
      and the gold. But again, there was a hatred of the other. There was a hatred for
      people who were not yet Christianized. And even after you’d be Christianized —
      if the Jews would convert to Christianity (the Marranos) — they were held again
      with some degree of hatred. I mean, all of that was a by-product of the Catholic
      Inquisition. You know, the Americans are still singing popular songs about that.
      Do any of you remember the movie The Singing Nun with Debbie Reynolds? There was
      that tune, “Dominique?” It’s about the Dominicans killing and torturing the Cathars
      of France for saying that their Christianity thought that, yes, there is a heaven
      and hell, and the hell is here on earth, and it’s run by the Church. So they all
      had to be killed. And that was the Inquisition. I mean, to think that that can
      be a popular song by the Church, and they make funny movies about, you know, happily
      singing about the Dominicans, is quite something. I think that there were later
      comedies about Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor of Spain, by comedians. But that
      was meant to be black comedy, not really serious ditties. KARL FITZGERALD: What
      about the role of art in previous times, helping the everyday person to understand
      the role of the rentiers? You mentioned Mark Twain earlier. There was a long tradition
      of artists who understood the power of monopoly and helped to break that down
      through poetry, music, theater, and the like. Where do you take your leads from
      on that side? MICHAEL HUDSON: There was a big anti-monopoly movement. It was all
      untracked, unfortunately, by someone who hated classical economics — Henry George
      — who essentially said there’s no such thing as economic rent, which is ironic.
      KARL FITZGERALD: Come on! He did not say that!? MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes, he did. He
      wrote this awful book, Progress and Poverty, when he said: I agree with the attack
      on classical value theory that says rent is the excess of price over cost value.
      That’s not it at all! Rent is the price, is what the British say it is. It’s all
      consumer utility. The consumer is really a king. He expelled anyone who talked
      about classical economics. Anyone who talked about Marxism he expelled from his
      group. Nowhere, in any of his writing, do you have any discussion of classical
      value and price theory. He said: I’m the person who invented the fight against
      rent. He was a narcissist and he really took the side of the opponents of economic
      rent. He was a libertarian and said: You must not have a government strong enough
      to tax landlords because a strong government is the enemy. I’m a libertarian.
      You need a small government. So he crippled the whole idea of fighting against
      economic rent by being a socialist. He declared war on socialists. He was a right-winger
      and spent his life fighting against socialism, expelling the socialists. He wrote
      a wonderful book on the Irish land question that made a reputation. Then he wrote
      Progress in Poverty. It was a very popular journalism book. But he was a journalist,
      not an economist. And so the socialists and the labor groups of New York City
      said: Well, we really want to have a chance to take over New York City. And they
      nominated Henry George to be mayor. And George said: Only if I can write the political
      program. They had read Progress and Poverty. They were under the illusion that
      he wanted to essentially get rid of economic rent and the power of landlords.
      Well, the first thing George did was get rid of all of the rent controls. He said:
      All you have to do is tax rent, and you won’t need rent controls anymore. He got
      rid of every socialist, every element of the platform, except tax the land, without
      looking at the economy as an economic system. And basically, he very quickly dragged
      his followers to fall off the right wing of the political spectrum. And so the
      combination of saying a small government — we don’t need big governments because
      that’s socialist. We don’t need the value theory of Adam Smith and John Stuart
      Mill and Marx. That’s socialist. He was all by himself and ended up completely
      being isolated. And when there was a revival of Henry George followers in the
      United States in the 1920s, they were all right-wing libertarian anti-socialists,
      exactly the kind of people that you and Karl described earlier: the right-wing
      anti-socialists. So that sort of helped untrack the fight against land rent in
      the United States. And you had, during the 1890s, Marxists and followers of George
      going around the country debating each other. And these were published by a Marxist
      publisher in Chicago, Charles Kerr and Company. And the debates were really wonderful.
      They spelled out the difference between socialism and the classical economists,
      on the one hand, and the Georgist followers, on the other. And all of this was
      spelled out. And they kept saying: Well, why don’t you followers of Henry George
      become socialists and support a government strong enough so that we can, first
      of all impose rent control, take away rents, then we can begin to get tax out
      of the landlords, tax all of this? George would have no part of it. So, the socialists
      said: Okay. You go your way, we’ll go our way. We’re going to talk about labor
      issues and social democratic reforms, you know, what labor needs, what government
      reforms for the poor need. You can handle the economic rent. But we’re all in
      favor of taxing land. You don’t want to work with us. So, goodbye. KARL FITZGERALD:
      So, Michael, I don’t know how you got from arts to your beating up on Henry George,
      one of my heroes. But yeah, it’s perfectly acceptable for there to be a diversity
      of tactics. We know that there is a strong libertarian movement in America at
      present. So, why not speak to them about the economic efficiencies that taxing
      land and monopoly can create, and reducing the dead-weight costs– MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Because they’re crazy people. There’s no point in talking to a crazy person. KARL
      FITZGERALD: You could say that about plenty of socialists as well. How do you
      find the radical center and be able to speak to both left and right at once? And
      that is the beauty of being able to talk about the lowest dead-weight costs when
      you do tax land and monopoly. So, that’s how I speak to government here in Australia,
      and that’s how I’ve changed three taxes. Henry George did come up with a really
      powerful economic formula: production minus rent equals wages plus interest. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Ah, that’s it! I forgot to say George was a big promoter of the banks.
      He was a defender of the rentier class. He was the defender of the financial class.
      Of course! That’s what I should have said right away. If you look at his awful
      chapter in Progress and Poverty, he calls profits interest. He wanted industry
      to be financialized. He was basically the apostle of financial doom. That’s exactly
      it. Imagine, interest, celebrating interest… KARL FITZGERALD: Certainly that chapter
      was not his best effort, and it would have been much more advisable if he’d taken
      Flürscheim’s much wiser approach to interest. But switching back to the– MICHAEL
      HUDSON: I want to interrupt. The reason that you and other Australians have an
      appreciation of George is because of Michael Flürscheim, who came to Australia
      and had originally been an associate of George because he saw the need to tax
      the land as part of the overall reform of the rentier class. But he also saw the
      role of finance very clearly and was a wonderful popularizer. His Clue to the
      Economic Labyrinth, I think, was published in Perth initially. At least the copy
      that I bought, it was published in the 1890s. And it was Flürscheim that sponsored
      these ideas in Australia. Flürscheim had tried to popularize George. There was
      a big land tenure conference in France, in Paris. And he brought Henry George
      to Paris and George got very embarrassed. He was unable to be the center of attention
      because other people were talking about Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and socialism.
      And so, Flürscheim said, George just stayed in his hotel room all alone, and went
      with his wife throughout Paris. He was too ashamed to show himself in public for
      being so economically illiterate and unable to be part of the discussion with
      people who actually talked about economics, not just journalistic sloganeering.
      KARL FITZGERALD: Andrew McKeen says: “I thought if you tax the economic rent properly,
      you don’t need a big government. And Michael, I would love to hear you talk more
      about it.” MICHAEL HUDSON: Karl, the entire thrust of the 19th century classical
      economists was to tax the land. They failed. They thought that this was what classical
      economics was all about. Of course, they wanted to tax all forms of economic rent,
      monopoly rent, and finance, but it was all trying to free industrial capitalism
      from the landlord class. It failed. KARL FITZGERALD: We understand that. So let’s
      talk strategically. Imagine, you’re, what, 84? We’ve got to get this wisdom out
      of you. If we are to have a strong government so that they can take on monopoly,
      and we also have a pricing system that’s reflective of production plus a small
      return to capital — reasonable return — where is the role for big government?
      Do we have an army of lawyers, like Matt Stoller has sitting in every court case,
      government versus big monopoly? Where is the resourcing of government dedicated
      towards, to keep monopoly in check? MICHAEL HUDSON: I see the problem. How do
      you get from here to there? Of course, what you describe is just exactly what
      would be ideal. Of course, we’d like what you describe. Of course, it would be
      how you want to end up. The problem is that, as I said, and as we were talking
      about with Karl Sanchez, the rentiers fight back violently. And it looks like
      the only countries that have been able to prevent a rentier class from taking
      over, — either the landlords or, in the modern world, the bankers — have been
      through revolutionary form. First, the Russian Revolution, and then the Chinese
      Revolution. You needed a revolution, and the Chinese Revolution got rid of the
      landlords, and got rid of the financial bankers. And so the government, of course,
      had land as a public utility. And, of course, had money and credit creation and
      banking as a public utility. But you needed to get from here to there. And it
      looks like, because of the willingness and ability of the rentiers, being the
      vested interests, after all, to use their power as vested interests to control
      the army — as Trump is controlling the National Guard, as we discussed. I think
      Marx said the end of capitalism will not be a pretty sight. Well, that’s the problem.
      How do you get from here to there? Now, that was the problem with what Henry George
      said. How to get from here to there? He would have had to work with a socialist
      movement to essentially overpower the landlord class. KARL FITZGERALD: Let’s get
      to the point now. Let’s get to the argument now. We’ve identified that people
      would prefer in a way to focus on identity politics rather than understand the
      pricing structure and rentier behavior. The people at the forefront of this pressure
      of high land price, high banking costs, high taxation, are small business. So,
      I said at the last gathering that if we’re going to get anywhere, we have to find
      a way to split the right wing, to reveal what in Australia are called the classical
      liberals. Probably the wrong terminology in America, but these are people who
      respect the market system but know something is wrong, and recognize that if we
      pull the power of big business backwards, we get a fairer society where we can
      walk the streets without worrying about being robbed. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, that’s
      exactly what I’m trying to do, Karl. And now I realize what the problem is. If
      you just say the enemy is the landlord, then you don’t realize, well, who’s protecting
      the landlord? The protector of the landlord is the financial class because in
      today’s society, you no longer have a hereditary landed aristocracy that lives
      off its hereditary ground rent as the legacy of what their forebears had conquered.
      Anybody can obtain housing or buy a commercial office building. But in order to
      afford a home or an office building, you have to take out a mortgage. The result
      is that the land rent is used to pay interest. Rent is for paying interest. And
      the leadership of the fight against critics of rentiers are the banks. The banks
      are protecting the landlord class because 80% of bank loans in the U.S., England,
      and other countries, are mortgage loans. And of course, the banks are going to
      protect their number one customer, the real estate sector, just as they protect
      their other customers in the monopoly business. So it’s the banks that have become
      the central planner and the controller of fiscal policy. That’s also a theme of
      my book on the politics of international banking from the Crusades to World War
      I. So, you have to realize that, yes, landlords collecting rent are bad, but let’s
      go after their big protectors, the banks. You have to attack the banks. And if
      you celebrate interest, and say, I’m all for interest — like George did — then
      poof! You’ve crippled your vocabulary. You’ve crippled your way of thinking about
      how to create a political movement to explain what I’ve been trying to do for
      the last, really for all my life, to explain how it’s the financial sector that
      is the protector of the rest of the rentier sectors altogether, because rents
      are for paying interest. KARL FITZGERALD: Yeah, well, how does it play out today
      with the Koch brothers, the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025? Are they really
      bankers behind that, or is it other, you know, the conglomeration of rent-seekers
      that have driven this agenda that’s now created this immigration paranoia distracting
      from what AI has just told me the “Big Beautiful Bill” is expanding in terms of
      tax deductions? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the Koch brothers made their money in rent-seeking.
      Especially their big fortune, I think — I’m told — was stealing oil from the Native
      American Indian reservations. And they were about to be prosecuted under the Clinton
      administration, when you had the Clinton affair, with the dress and all, coming
      out. And the deal was, okay, we’re not going to impeach. The Republicans agreed
      not to impeach Clinton, if Clinton agreed not to prosecute the Koch brothers for
      their steals. So, the Koch brothers realized that you can’t really come out and
      say, I’m going to have a political party that is all in favor of economic rent,
      because you don’t even want people to think in terms of economic rent. You try
      to get a populist cause by appealing to the lowest common denominator. And as
      you just pointed out, the lowest common denominator is anti-immigrant racism.
      And the Koch brothers and these other right-wing institutions are part of the
      whole matrix of fighting against thinking about how to create a government and
      a society without a rentier class. KARL FITZGERALD: So the “Big Beautiful Bill”
      has enhanced tax breaks for real estate investors, including 100% bonus depreciation
      restored; the Section 199A deductions extended for real estate investment trusts;
      and estate and gift tax exemptions increased from $15 million per individual,
      or $30 million per couple, indexed to inflation. Alongside of that, the SALT deduction
      cap has been raised to $40,000 to give relief to property owners in high-tax states.
      Additionally, the special economic opportunity zones have been expanded with a
      limit of 25% of eligible low-income tracts per state. My understanding of the
      special economic zone is, if you invest in a community, you get a 50% capital
      gains tax deduction if you leave the investment there for a decade. So, yeah,
      these are the things, Michael. I would love to hear American– MICHAEL HUDSON:
      I’m glad you brought up Karl Marx again. This is very important. It was Marx who
      created the theory of depreciation as an element of value. Prior to Marx, the
      classical economists only considered income as a component of value, the return
      to capital. And Marx said the value of an industrial product is not only the return
      to capital, it’s the actual original capital investment itself. And he introduced
      the concept of depreciation into value theory, or what now is called EBITDA: Earnings
      Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Well, what has happened
      is that the real estate sector — and I’ve written quite a bit about this, and
      I think you were alluding to that in your lead-in — they pretend that real estate
      depreciates, and they pretend that buildings depreciate. And all of the American
      statistics follow this false, misleading economics that pretend that they increase
      in the market price. The market price of real estate is the increase in the construction
      cost of a building. Every time a real estate property is sold, the new owner of
      the property — if it’s a rental property, homeowners are not allowed to charge
      depreciation, but commercial investors are — they’re allowed to start depreciating
      the building at a higher and higher and higher level. And what you and I know
      is really land rent is somehow included into the price of the building. That whole
      twist to give free money to the landlords was developed by the head of the Schalkenbach
      Foundation and the Henry George School, C. Lowell Harriss, that basically supported
      all that. It was a Georgist who thought, well, in order to have a land tax, we
      got to get mayors on our side. Who finances mayors’ campaigns? The real estate
      interests. So, if we can back the real estate interests, we can get the mayors
      to support Henry George. And here, if we give them a whole giveaway with free
      depreciation, look at what we’ve done. They’ll support Henry George. As long as
      he supports the landlords, they’ll support him back. This was the craziness that
      I encountered. When you say 100% depreciation… Imagine, if you buy a building,
      you begin depreciating the whole building right away, not at twenty years, or
      seventy. The depreciation tax write-off that you do not have to pay income tax
      on because it’s not considered income? It makes real estate tax-free. It makes
      any kind of monopoly tax-free, if you can somehow depreciate the monopoly privilege.
      And so the concept of depreciation has been turned into a way of making rentier,
      rent-yielding properties tax-exempt. That is the twist. I know that’s very technical.
      I’ve written about it. I think I have all my charts on that in The Bubble and
      Beyond, and I’ve described it more briefly in Killing the Host, and the other
      articles that I’ve published. The articles that I’ve written with Dirk Bezemer
      have all the statistics on this depreciation rip-off. KARL FITZGERALD: That’s
      why Trump calls depreciation a beautiful thing– MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes, it’s why
      he didn’t have to pay income tax. If you’re a landlord, because of depreciation,
      you don’t have to pay tax on land rent. That’s the irony. Look at how economic
      orthodoxy has been inverted from the time of the 18th century Physiocrats and
      Adam Smith to the 19th century classical economists who wanted to tax the land.
      And now the orthodoxy makes land rent tax-exempt. That’s the inversion of economics.
      And it’s only by studying this inversion and by studying value and price theory
      and analyzing its components (EBITDA) and the twists and turns it’s taken, that
      you can somehow educate a political movement to understand the rip-off that’s
      been pulled. Most people don’t understand that rent-seeking is a rip-off. And
      even Milton Friedman, and even Margaret Thatcher’s advisors, recognized, yes,
      there is such a thing as economic rent, they never really followed it up and said
      that is today the most important economic concept, just as it was in classical
      value theory. KARL FITZGERALD: Yep, I think that’ll be the title of this episode:
      “Rent-Seeking is a Rip-off.” Nicely said. But behind that, a whole depreciation
      play is really the drive to downvalue the value of land, of the earth. And so
      property valuers have been encouraged to overestimate the building valuation,
      and underestimate the land. And that’s maxed the depreciation write-offs, but
      it’s also helped delegitimize an understanding of how location, location as the
      number one real estate strategy was also the number one taxation base for government,
      back when Adam Smith was writing about it. That was the understood trajectory:
      We were heading that way to remove these feudal overlords from our lives, once
      and for all. And we could do it in a way that was more efficient than what tariffs,
      and the like, could deliver. So yeah, what’s your latest take on tariffs? Where
      are we sitting on TACO Trump? And can we just call him Dickie Don now, Dictator
      Don? MICHAEL HUDSON: I should say that one of the tragedies of the socialist revolution
      is that it has not applied the land tax. The Soviet Union got rid of landlords
      and so they got rid of the concept of economic rent. And they didn’t take into
      account the rent of location, and how important that was. And certainly the Westerners
      who bought real estate in Russia found that. And China has not taken in the rent
      of location as a means of preventing the increased rent of location in the form
      of land price that became the real-estate bubble. I’ve had the most difficulty
      of introducing the concept of economic rent to socialists. Marxists don’t accept
      it, and governments that consider themselves to be Marxists have a resistance
      to thinking of the concept of economic rent. That’s how far they’ve moved away
      from Volumes Two and Three of Capital and the classical economic tradition on
      which Marx was based. KARL FITZGERALD: Matt Connor says: “Two hours of Hudson
      equals three hours of future reading to keep up.” Good point there. MICHAEL HUDSON:
      It helped that I got very annoyed that I had to wait a half-hour to get on, and
      my annoyance gave me enough energy to go through all of this. Isn’t that ironic?
      MATT CONNOR: Yeah, and that’s three hundred hours, not three hours. And that’s
      an understatement, for sure. KARL FITZGERALD: Yeah, well, get into it, Matt. There’s
      so much interesting reading out there that Michael brings to light. Karl Sanchez
      says: “The ‘Big Beautiful Bill:’ The big whopper in that is the oil depletion
      allowance.” Michael, what about that one? MICHAEL HUDSON: Ah, the oil depletion
      allowance. It was all based on replacement costs that the oil companies were able
      to charge. It’s not depreciation, but amortization. Once you deplete an oil well
      — remember, the oil company’s investment in the oil industry is to make derricks
      to pump the oil, and refineries, but they don’t have to pay for the creation of
      the oil in the ground. That’s created by nature. So, they come in, they dig an
      oil well, they empty it out, and then they say: Well, we need to replace what
      we’ve used up. We’ve depreciated what we bought. (And this depreciation was supposed
      to be only for industrial investment, like refineries and oil rigs.) Now, we need
      to replace this oil and because of inflation because of the increasing scarcity
      of oil in some places, we get to say: Here is what we get to take as a tax deduction
      to buy the same amount, a field yielding the same amount, of oil — at double the
      price. And this amortization we get to charge off against our income because we’re
      using it all up for the replacement cost. The oil industry was tax-exempt ever
      since the 1920s. As soon as America passed the income tax law in 1913, the cost
      accountants got together in the 1920s and began finding all of these loopholes
      to make sure that the rent-extracting sectors didn’t have to pay an income tax.
      And when I went to work for Continental Oil, one of the first things they wanted
      me to do was say: What’s the justification for the depletion allowance? And I
      was drawing a parallel between that and industrial depletion and depreciation.
      They didn’t want to hear that at all. They just wanted to understand that I knew
      what depletion was for all of that. This is arcane. This is a topic — depreciation,
      rent — these are not taught in academic economics courses. So you can go all the
      way through a Ph.D., as I did at NYU [New York University] — without there being
      any mention of things like depreciation, depletion, EBITDA, or the balance of
      payments, or any of the nitty-gritty of how society is actually put together and
      works — in a gimmicked way, using all sorts of rhetorical pretense, to pretend
      that the economy works in a different way than it really does. KARL FITZGERALD:
      Yeah, one of our most prestigious universities here has a brand new lecture theatre
      called the Centre for Market Design. It’s all about how to set up– MICHAEL HUDSON:
      I’ve been talking for almost two hours. KARL FITZGERALD: Okay, let’s finish off
      with China. You’ve talked about them favorably a few times. They’ve also had the
      potential to introduce a land, or property tax — I think it was about three years
      ago — in their five-year plan, and they shied away from it. And for me, that was
      demonstrative of just how powerful landed interests are, even in China. What are
      you hearing now? MICHAEL HUDSON: What you call the land interest is the financial
      interest. If they’d begin taxing the land and imposing a land tax on top of the
      mortgage interest that buyers already pay, there’d be huge defaults on property.
      In order to have a land tax, you have to get rid of the financial debt attached
      to the land, and attached to real estate. And as long as you leave the financial
      claims for debt payment collateralized by the land as the basis of your financial
      system, introducing a land tax would cause a bank crisis. That’s the problem.
      It’s the same problem in the United States. That’s the problem in every country.
      That’s why, if you do support a land tax, you have to confront the fact that right
      now the land rent is already committed to be paying interest to the banks, and
      that the banks would become insolvent if the owners of property had to pay for
      the land rent and pay for the mortgage interest that is a capitalization of this
      land rent. KARL FITZGERALD: And also, that growth in land price is the basis for
      money supply growth as well. So that is where they work hand in hand. And that’s
      why, Michael, we need to work on some policy documents on how we can actually
      tease out this knowledge of yours and work that into a framework that– MICHAEL
      HUDSON: I would need a whole team, a statistical team, that I can walk through
      the statistics. You really need a think tank of economists who are trained in
      this, such as does not exist at the present time. KARL FITZGERALD: Yes. Mr. Sanchez
      says: “Land as a public utility would eliminate the need for a land tax.” Do you
      think that’s true, Michael? MICHAEL HUDSON: If it’s a public utility owned by
      the government, and the government collected the tax on it. The Chinese government
      technically owns all the land, I guess, like the Queen of England — now the King
      of England — is supposed to own the British land. Not ownership, but it has to
      be the tax base. And if the tax base is already fully committed to pay the banks,
      you need to restructure the financial system. You need a debt write-down. Without
      writing off the debt, without a debt write-down, you cannot have room to introduce
      a land tax. KARL FITZGERALD: Well, just to let you know, here in my state, there
      have been three land-related charges, and there has not been a crash. But there
      has been a disparity, a growing widening between the price of land in Sydney,
      and the price of land in Melbourne. It traditionally is about $200,000 difference,
      and now it’s a $412,000 difference in 18 months of these new policies that I helped
      implement. So it can happen. But, you know, on a macro scale, it’s fascinating
      to have these discussions as always, Michael. So thanks, once again, for forging
      ahead. We really look forward to the new book on the debt crusades. Is there any
      little teaser you can leave us with that may shine a different light on how we’re
      perceiving some of the tensions around the world? MICHAEL HUDSON: No, I want to
      focus on what we’ve said. This is really important. A price value and rent is
      what an analysis is all about. That’s the focus of everything that I do. So I’m
      looking forward to the transcript of this. KARL FITZGERALD: Yes, we’ve got to
      get this one up. The last one hasn’t gone up yet. And these sessions are deep.
      We get to dive into areas of your amazing mind that we don’t often hear from.
      So thanks, everyone, for joining us here. Thanks, Patreon supporters, for being
      patient. Great to see you all. And hopefully, we can get more of you up on screen
      next time. Thank you, Michael. MICHAEL HUDSON: Good discussion. VIRGINIA COTTS:

    one_sentence_summary: In a quarterly Q&A session, Karl Fitzgerald welcomes economist
      Michael Hudson, who humorously notes the limited time for discussion, while emphasizing
      the importance of support for Hudson's independent work and engagement with his
      audience.
    paragraph_summary: In a quarterly Q&A session on June 13, 2025, economist Michael
      Hudson engaged with attendees, discussing pressing social issues, particularly
      the recent unrest in Los Angeles. Host Karl Fitzgerald emphasized the importance
      of supporting Hudson's work through platforms like Patreon, highlighting the challenges
      of disseminating independent economic analysis. Hudson expressed his views on
      the situation in L.A., suggesting that the unrest is not merely riots but a response
      to aggressive immigration enforcement targeting Hispanic communities, akin to
      the situation in Ukraine with army recruiters. The format of the session encouraged
      participants to submit questions via chat, fostering an interactive dialogue on
      current events.

    text: 'Dialogue Works NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody. Today is Thursday, June 5,
      2025, and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson are back with us. Welcome.
      RICHARD WOLFF: Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Let’s get started with Lindsey
      Graham and his latest visit to Ukraine. Not only Lindsey Graham, Blumenthal, and
      Mike Pompeo as well, they went to Ukraine. Here is what Lindsey Graham said: LINDSEY
      GRAHAM: Russia said that Ukraine doesn’t have good cards. Well, Russia is much
      bigger and has a lot more people. I get that. But the world has a lot of cards
      against Russia. And one of those cards that we have is about to be played in the
      United States Senate. In America, you have more than one person at the card table.
      We have three branches of government, and the House and the Senate are poised
      to act. What would change our mind? If Russia came to the table, agreed to a ceasefire,
      and earnestly. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, one of those cards that he’s talking
      about is 500% secondary tariffs on Russian energy, which we know would influence
      China, India, and eventually Europe. Your take? RICHARD WOLFF: Well, Lindsey Graham
      has been a bloviating senator all his career. This is all theater. He has been
      all theater. He is all theater. He has gathered together the many other members
      of both houses who, like him, are thespians at heart and politicians only secondarily.
      This is showmanship. That’s all. It’s something that he has decided will improve
      his standing down there in the American South, where he comes from and where he
      gets elected by people who approve that kind of theater, even as their actual
      situations decline. We are no longer living in the world that appreciates that
      theater. What he doesn’t understand as he invokes the world is that in view of
      the world, the very behavior he proposes is considered the actions of a rogue
      nation, a nation that is willing to threaten, disrupt global trade for the whole
      world. This is not admirable. This has nothing to do with bringing cards to a
      table. This is bullying behavior, and it is doubly offensive because the bully
      isn’t in charge anymore. The Chinese know and the Russians know, having spent
      the last 15 years building themselves up, growing their economies much faster
      than the United States, and much faster than the United States and its G7 allies,
      that they now have in their BRICS alliance people from whom they can buy, people
      to whom they can sell, and those people are more than half the population of the
      world and have shown in the Ukraine war that they can absorb whatever it is that
      the United States and Western Europe wish to do in interfering with the trade
      of Russia. When Russia couldn’t sell its oil and gas to the Europeans, did they
      collapse the way the Europeans promised? No. Did the ruble disappear the way the
      Europeans promised? No. Did the levying of much more than a big tariff, a literal
      embargo? We’re not going to buy your oil and gas. We’re not going to let you use
      our SWIFT international payments system. We’re going to seize $300 billion of
      assets back in your currency that you have kept in Western institutions. And so
      all of these things, which in total are a bigger effort against Russia than what
      Mr. Lindsey Graham now proposes, they all failed. So I got news for Mr. Graham.
      His proposal, if it were adopted, will not only fail to hold back Russia and China
      in the way all the previous sanctions and limits and tariffs have failed, but
      will enhance the already badly damaged reputation of the United States. And I
      mean, enhance it as a rogue, as the biggest single threat to global trade and
      global economic development in the world, which for the United States is a very
      bad sort of self-destructive behavior. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, Richard, you call
      America a rogue nation. Madeleine Albright called America the exceptional nation.
      And that’s America’s strength being a rogue nation. Think of it as a rogue nation,
      not with atom bombs, which it won’t use, but with the ability to create chaos.
      And what Graham is threatening is we can create chaos in Europe and other countries
      by imposing this enormous tariff on countries that trade, that obtain their gas
      from Europe instead of from us. And we can impose similar chaos on countries that
      trade with China and its companies, Huawei. I think there’s already threats against
      that. Companies that use China’s international payment system to avoid the U.S.
      dollar. The aim of this chaos is to create an entirely new world order whose rules
      are the reverse of the economic order that America created in 1945 when it was
      the world’s leading creditor nation and also the world’s leading industrial power
      after in the wreckage of World War II. Now, the situation is just the reverse.
      The United States is the world’s major debtor nation, mainly to other governments,
      and it’s also a deindustrialized nation, the most trade-dependent nation of all.
      And so, what the Republican administration, with the full support of the Democrats,
      is trying to do is: how can we make a virtue of all of this? How can we somehow
      use our ability to create chaos to threaten other countries with these huge sanctions,
      denying them access to the American market, denying them military protection,
      such as the United States had offered in World War II, and instead making them
      prone to fighting with Russia, as we’ve seen over the attacks by Ukraine on Russia
      with full backing of Britain’s MI6 and Macron and German’s support? So, what Lindsay
      Graham was doing was bragging about America’s strength in the ability to confront
      other nations with what the United States can do to smash the whole international
      set of rules if they don’t adopt the new rules that the Trump administration is
      trying to impose. RICHARD WOLFF: Well, let me respond. Maybe we disagree here.
      I agree with what you’re saying. Everything makes perfect sense to me, but I see
      it in a context that this is the behavior of a desperate government going down,
      and in the language I learned as a kid, trying to take everybody down with it.
      Or using whatever you might call the last card, if we’re going to stay with that
      metaphor, the last card they can imagine playing because they’ve run out of all
      the other cards that they used to have available. They don’t have it available.
      The irony is the nuclear weapons they built up, they can’t use, and the rest of
      the weapons they don’t have anymore. And so they’re stuck with this sort of situation.
      I see it in that, and I don’t think it can work. I think it’s desperate not only
      because it is so disruptive and it is so chaotic and it is so risky, but it’s
      also desperate because I don’t think the conditions are there. And I think that
      more and more of the world sees that. And, you know, for this kind of a major
      bluff to work, you can’t be seen as bluffing. And I think what the world sees
      here is bluffing. And that when he does it one day and undoes it the next day,
      the notion that this could be bluffing becomes a virtual certainty. He wants to
      get some concessions so that he looks like he’s dominant in some way. And so,
      by yelling 500% and actually settling later for 10%, he can make some claim that
      he got something and he looks better for the evening television. But, you know,
      that only works for a while until everybody realizes that’s what you’re doing.
      And that’s what we have now. You know, the signs that are accumulating that we
      may have both stagnation starting in the second half of this year and inflation
      getting going in the second half of this year. Well, you know, those are signs
      that this is a very risky line of action. And you have to ask the logical question:
      why would you be doing this? And after we make the cracks that the whole world
      is making, that he’s unstable or he’s looking to make money or he’s looking to
      get attention, all of which have their grains of truth, you still have to ask
      the question, why in this way would this man act at this point? And there, I think,
      the desperation of the American empire’s decline is the answer. MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Well, let’s talk about this bluff then. There’s method behind the madness. And
      they actually have a plan. It’s a mad plan. You’re right. Other countries can
      see through it. But let’s walk through exactly what their plan is, because they’ve
      spelled it out in detail. And it’s worth going over, I think. When Trump and Rubio
      acknowledge that we’re entering a multipolar world, I think what they mean is
      that Europe, Asia, other continents are now all on their own in the sense of every
      country for itself. And to Trump, that means the United States is going to act
      for itself, in its own interest, to try to be the winner. And what its interest
      is, is actually creating a new world order in which other countries somehow can
      be locked into dependency on the United States—even though we’re no longer a creditor
      nation, even though we’re no longer a trade surplus country, and even though we’re
      making other countries militarily endangered, not protecting them anymore. I think
      that Trump’s strategy is to save the U.S. economy and its foreign policy from
      having to bear the loss of its financial and trade dominance that led it to create
      the post-1945 order in its own interest. That order lasted 80 years, and it’s
      now changing. And they actually have a plan, and they’ve outlined the plan for
      what they want to do. And I think, of course, it’s a bluff—but let’s go over exactly
      why it’s going to fail. Instead of the United States offering financial support,
      it’s now demanding that the rest of the world support its own financial position
      and even its domestic reckless budget deficit. And other countries are supposed
      to oppose China and Russia by joining a new Cold War—to prevent China, Russia,
      and the BRICS countries from shaping a new world economic order. That’s the guiding
      strategy. And I think the first aim of the global majority that the United States
      is opposing is to avoid the use of the U.S. dollar, as you pointed out, for their
      mutual trade and investment, and as a vehicle for saving their foreign exchange
      reserves in the form of holding Treasury securities and lending to the United
      States government. This balance of payments aspect of the current crisis is, I
      think—certainly to me—the key. The United States doesn’t have atom bombs, but
      as I said, it does have the trump card—and Trump’s ability to create chaos. And
      as the old joke goes: if you owe the bank ten thousand dollars and you can’t pay,
      then you’re in trouble. But if you owe the bank 10,000,000, or a hundred million,
      or a billion dollars—then the bank’s in trouble. Foreign central banks are holding
      U.S. securities and those of its federal agencies. They have a problem: how can
      they secure the value of all the savings they’ve mounted up since 1971, since
      the U.S. went off gold? All of the world’s central bank savings are already in
      U.S. dollars. The United States owes them so much money that it’s now using its
      debtor power—instead of its creditor power—as a means to control them by threatening
      chaos. Trump is trying to fight to create a new illusion that somehow will give
      the illusion of solvency—if other countries agree to new worlds. Well, the fact
      is, the United States could pay other countries if it were willing to follow the
      policies that it and the IMF have demanded of Global South countries for the last
      80 years. Namely, you pay your debts by selling off your public infrastructure,
      selling off your raw material rights, increasing taxes on income and wealth so
      that this money will not be available to consumers to buy imports. That’s how
      you generate a balance of payments surplus to pay your creditors. Well, the United
      States has a double standard and again says, “We’re the exceptional country.”
      It’s not going to do what the old economic order forced the Global South countries
      to do. The United States could roll back its military spending—which has long
      been the major component of its balance of payments deficits ever since the Korean
      War in 1950. It could cut back its new foreign investment. And it could begin
      selling off its existing investments in Europe, Asia, and other countries to pay
      its creditors. That’s exactly what the IMF and the United States insist that Argentina
      and other debtor countries must do. But the United States is refusing to do these
      things, and that’s what makes it an outlaw country when it comes to the rules
      of traditional financial debt settlement. It’s using its strength as a debtor—no
      longer as a creditor—and that’s what’s turned the world upside down. And it’s
      used this to somehow be able to create a moral order in which it can convince
      at least its satellite rulers—people like Merz and Macron and Starmer—to continue
      to sacrifice their economies to support this new U.S. economic order. RICHARD
      WOLFF: Okay, but let me respond by saying I don’t think he can do these things
      domestically or internationally. That may be the plan, that may be the method
      in the madness. I understand that argument, but I don’t think it’s doable. And
      I think the desperation is again visible in coming up with a plan like that for
      which the world is no longer willing to be treated that way. And I think he’s
      learning it at every turn. The Chinese are not bending. No matter what, you know,
      let’s remember he had tariffs a few weeks ago in the neighborhood of 140 or whatever
      it was percent. And that made no difference at all. You know, he just had a meeting
      with Xi Jinping, if I understand, yesterday, a telephone call having spent the
      last 10 days asking for one. That’s not the behavior of somebody who is terrorized
      by what you’re proposing or what you’re threatening. The Chinese took the time
      and the care to produce an economic miracle, which includes an alliance that is
      crucial to them precisely because it creates enough of a world market for them
      to buy from and sell to that the United States’ abilities that we won’t let you
      here. Okay, don’t. I want to remind people over the last week if I’m not mistaken,
      all the leaders of Europe were on their knees cutting deals with the Chinese.
      They’re desperate too, and they are the ones because of their subordination, their
      inability to act independently from the United States anywhere is now hobbling
      them. They are learning that the cost of being subordinate to the United States
      can be very high. They have been writing nicely for several decades; they were
      able to be social democratic to their own working class because the United States
      saved them from spending money on defense. But the United States can’t do it for
      the reasons Michael just summarized. The United States is throwing the Europeans
      right under the bus. We’re not doing this anymore. You’re going to have to do
      it for yourself. Yes, but we can’t do that and be the social democratic societies
      we were developed over history to be. And if you make us impose austerity, then
      you will see that the “menchamps?” in France and their equivalents everywhere
      else will take power in Europe because they can ride your inability. The Germans,
      we are spending $80 billion on defense. Oh, really? How’s that going to play in
      their own country? Not well. Mr. Merz has a very thin majority. Mr. Macron has
      no majority. And Starmer has pissed away the little bit of bump he got because
      the conservatives were so awful. They now face the reality that another Trump-like
      figure, Farage, may become their next lead. I mean, these are societies in advanced
      levels of decay. So I don’t think the United States can do most of what it is
      they’re threatening to do. I don’t see it. I don’t see them able to get the rest
      of the world to go along with this desperate effort now that they’re a debtor
      nation, now that the rest of the world has caught up or exceeded them. They’re
      not in a position to dictate and they don’t understand it. They have the biggest
      military. They are very rich. It’s very hard for them, as it was for the British
      before them, to understand that they are now going back to what they were: a small,
      offshore, wet island off of Europe. That’s the British Empire’s resting place.
      And the United States is going on its path to a decline from its peak. And all
      you have is a desperate leadership that wants, on the one hand, to pander to the
      public awareness by pretending the decline of the empire isn’t happening, while
      at the same time taking these extraordinarily desperate, chaotic, disruptive steps
      in a final, last effort to do what isn’t anymore available to them to do. And
      this is a recipe for real trouble, mostly here at home. MICHAEL HUDSON: Richard,
      you’re elaborating my points. Of course, I agree with that. What I’m doing is
      explaining: if you look at exactly what the U.S. plan is in detail, you see exactly
      why it won’t work. Of course, it won’t work. And when you look at the details,
      there actually is a plan, and it is so crazy that it won’t work. And that’s what
      I want to explain exactly why it won’t work. For instance, we mentioned, I think,
      last week, Treasury Secretary Bessent’s proposal that foreign countries stretch
      out the maturity of their Treasury IOUs for 100 years. That’s pretty illiquid.
      That’s like saying we can’t pay within my lifetime or the lifetime of my children.
      It’s pie in the sky. In other words, you lend us the money, write it all off.
      You can pretend that it’s money. You can pretend that it has value. Let’s have
      a pretend new economic order. That’s what the American policy rests on. Pretense,
      of course, not the real thing. It’s the pretense of every Ponzi scheme dynamics,
      where debts grow and grow and grow, and all it requires new entrants into the
      scheme. More and more foreign central banks will hold the dollars. More and more
      countries will invest their trade surpluses and balance of payment surpluses in
      the dollar to somehow give the illusion of solvency, but it’s not going to exist.
      Well, what the plan of Bessent and the Treasury wants is that other countries
      are going to commit their accumulated international savings, all of what they’ve
      saved since 1971, to back U.S. unipolar military and foreign policy hegemony.
      And this foreign support aims at the United States to pursue this massively polarizing
      tax shift from financial wealth onto labor and industry. That’s the Republican
      plan. Huge tax cuts for the wealthiest, 10% of the population, all the rest of
      the population, labor, industry, agriculture, has its taxes go up. So the foreign
      central banks and the dollar-based international order, they’re enablers to America’s
      attempt to maintain its unipolar control of world diplomacy behind the Cold War
      that Lindsey Graham and others are trying to back. So far, Trump has not criticized
      Lindsey Graham. Other people are. Well, this solution of somehow saying U.S. Treasury
      bills are never to be paid. They’re a sort of permanent floating debt. At the
      same time, Treasury and Trump are telling its allies that to be able to pay down
      its debts, if you really want us to pay them down, then you have to enable us
      to export to you and earn the money. That means that, sure, you can enable us
      to pay you by letting American industry replace your industry. Your German car
      companies and technology companies can relocate to the United States. And if you
      relocate here, we can export and then we’ll be able to export to you. Your industry
      is going to have to be wound down, which, of course, it will be if you can’t get
      Russian energy anymore and have to depend on our energy, you know, move to the
      United States, where everything’s less expensive. Well, the whole idea that somehow
      the United States can use its deindustrialization as a weapon, it reflects a false
      line that it’s taken in development really since the 1990s. The United States
      is trying to say we can maintain our trade supremacy by focusing on monopoly goods,
      information technology, military technology, and social media platforms. And these
      were considered the high value-added industries. And the idea was the United States
      says, well, we don’t need blue-collar manufacturing. We don’t need labor-intensive
      industries. And in fact, shifting and offshoring our employment to Asia is going
      to help hold down our domestic wage levels and all of that. Well, all of a sudden,
      something very strange has happened. All of a sudden, if you look at what is happening
      with China today, amazingly enough, the United States has become dependent on
      low-wage industrial economies. All of this industry that is outsourced to China
      and other countries is now threatened with being blocked by Trump’s tariffs. And
      the United States doesn’t have the ability to produce these goods itself, even
      to the point of making screws to screw down the keyboards of the iPhones that
      are made by Apple. So nobody expected the United States to become more dependent
      on low-wage industries that instead of where China and other countries have almost
      caught up with the information technology, with the dollar transfer systems, not
      needing the dollar, not needing the SWIFT, with all of these things. And this
      has turned the whole traditional idea of international advantage upside down.
      The United States can’t reindustrialize to somehow earn the money to pay off its
      foreign debts because the Chinese economist Liu Feng has pointed out that industrialization
      requires having the whole broad spectrum of industry, including the sectors that
      the United States has looked down on, like textiles. And even what the United
      States considered low-wage industries before, all of a sudden China is robotizing
      all of these. And so now you’re having products that were made by low-wage manual
      labor made by robot factories. The United States hasn’t developed anything like
      this. The United States, all of a sudden, finds itself dependent on the smallest
      things that are key for its supply chains, as you and I have discussed before
      on Nima’s (show). These supply chains for screws, for steel, for various inputs,
      not to mention the rare earths and everything, which China is not going to reduce
      its national security limits. So the United States has a skewed pattern of production.
      It’s focused on the internet and information technology, but it doesn’t have the
      most basic industries that are needed to earn the money to somehow move its trade
      into a surplus to pay off its debt. So the trade problem is hand in hand with
      the insolvency problem. And the fact is that other countries are broke. And here’s
      what faces other countries. Here’s the choice. Are they going to say, okay, we’ve
      been sucking – we’ve followed a blind alley that we’ve put all of our savings
      in the United States. Are we going to just accept the loss and go and create and
      join the global majority in a new restructuring of their economies? Or are we
      going to say we can’t afford the disruption of a year, a two-year or three years,
      and we’re going to have to remain dependent on the United States because, otherwise,
      the value of our foreign exchange reserves is essentially blocked. Our ability
      to trade with China and Russia is blocked. And we’re locked into a dependency
      on trade with the United States that has to be a deepening and deepening loss
      for us because the United States plan, when you look at it, is so fallacious in
      its assumptions, so badly structured, that, of course, it won’t work. That’s really
      the political choice that’s facing Europe and the whole rest of the world. RICHARD
      WOLFF: Let me add a couple, if I can, Nima and Michael. In recent days, looking
      at literature about the automobile industry, I came across a number of comments
      in which people who are not involved in the kind of conversation we’re having,
      whose focus is much more narrowly concentrated on the international automobile
      business, are projecting, several of them, that the relocation of the automobile
      industry will, in fact, not be to the United States, but to China. Why? Because
      of what Michael just said. They have all of the components, including the rare
      earths, which are crucial for those batteries without which the electric vehicle
      doesn’t function. And if you are going to move to the United States, and if the
      United States isn’t going to be able to get them from China, you’re moving to
      your own destruction. You cannot do that. You’d be much better advised to build
      your automobile, your Volkswagen, or your Peugeot, or your Fiat in China, where
      you can be sure of access to the rare earths without which you can’t build a car
      anyway. So that’s one thing. Here’s another one: the history of monopoly in capitalism.
      Let’s remember what it is: it’s when the producer of something can capture the
      market in the sense of becoming the only mono seller, poly, mono poly, the only
      seller. Why? Because then you can not only make the profit built into the surplus
      you get from your worker, but you can jack up the price above cost and get what’s
      called a monopoly revenue on top of it. But the very existence of that, for example,
      in the high-tech industry in Silicon Valley, and this is the history of capitalism:
      the minute you get a monopoly revenue, you become the object of envy and competition
      from everybody else because you’re getting outlandish rates of return. And so
      the flow of capital is to try to get a piece of that, since it’s much more profitable
      than to staying in the competitive areas of the economy. So now we have DeepSeek,
      we have the Chinese who have demonstrated that when you have tried to copy, you
      can do it. Huawei can produce the relevant chips. So can the other companies.
      If the United States is developing a strategy that has the quality of depending
      on the monopoly position that its high-tech industries have achieved for a while,
      then I’ve got news for them. You’re going to lose it. The monopolists always do.
      General Motors and Ford once had a monopoly. They don’t anymore. And you’re not
      going to keep that monopoly here, which means your strategy, which assumes a certain
      monopoly position, is a strategy built on sand that is ebbing away. The Chinese
      are working on that too. And by the way, not only the Chinese, but others. And
      so this is not only risky for all the reasons we’ve adduced, but it’s risky in
      terms of where the actualities of international capitalist competition lie. The
      Chinese have a dominant position in rare earths and crucial industries, not just
      the automobile industry, air traffic, airplanes, defense, those are also requiring
      rare earths. Now, will the United States make an effort to get new sources? Sure,
      they will. May they succeed? They may. But we are now, the more and more we talk,
      the more and more, hopefully, you’re all picking up on the conditions, the many,
      many conditions that suggest that the strategy being pursued now is, well, it
      is so risky that I believe the word desperation captures it. MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes,
      it’s desperate, and that’s why I’m trying to spell out what its strategy is so
      you can see just in detail how desperate it is. And it gets worse and worse. I
      think you could say for the last two centuries, most of America’s technological
      innovation, maybe not most, but much, has been from immigrants, from individuals,
      scholars, scientists, technical labor fleeing the fight for freedom in their own
      country to come to the United States. Well, the United States, I think there are
      250,000 Chinese students in the United States. And now the United States is acting
      to block these students. Well, China has been complaining, as other countries
      before it have, about the brain drain. They’re saying, well, you know, we have
      these, we’ve spent all the effort in raising these students, sending them to school
      in China. And now they’re going to the United States for graduate studies, studying
      the STEM curriculum. And now they’re deciding to work for American companies being
      trained there. And so we’re losing a lot of our own technical labor because look
      at the American high-tech industries that are developed largely by Chinese labor.
      Well, Trump has said, we don’t want any more brain drain from China. We want to
      send the Chinese back to China so that they will be able to work to help develop
      Chinese technology, not American technology. And not only that, but the one key,
      most apart from foreign brain drain to the United States developing technology,
      is government-subsidized research and development. Everything from the Manhattan
      Project for the Atom bomb to so much development has been government subsidy to
      universities to develop pharmaceuticals, technology, internet technology that
      the government then gives to the private sector is a gift to create the monopoly
      from this vast government spending, government-subsidized technology. This is
      all being cut back from Harvard to other universities. That’s what Elon Musk did.
      Don’t subsidize government research and development. Concentrate research and
      development in China and Asia, not in the United States. We’re not going to be
      doing that anymore. And the reason is that many people, many of the scientists
      who wanted to develop technology, also want peace instead of war. And if any of
      them say we’re for peace for any war, well, all of a sudden that is caused, I
      won’t get into the Zionist problem, but the students who are expressing political
      views other than the U.S. official foreign policy are being blocked from the United
      States, sent back to their countries. So the United States has cut off the two
      major sources of what was providing us technological advantage: immigration and
      government subsidy of university research and development. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah,
      I would like to stress that and also to take it a step back into the very economic
      structure. The Chinese version of modern economy is about 50% private capitalist
      enterprise, both Chinese and foreign, and 50% government-owned and operated enterprises.
      That’s what they mean when they say they’ve got socialism with Chinese characteristics.
      The Soviet Union was much more government. The United States and Britain are much
      more private. The Chinese is a hybrid that is different and has to be highly controlled
      from above because you’ve got these two horses that don’t run in the same way
      in the same direction. But the genius of what they’ve done, which explains why
      they’ve been growing two to three times faster than the U.S. for every one of
      the last 30 years, is because whatever the private profit motivation cannot accomplish
      because of its limits, the government can. The other half can make the investments
      that aren’t governed by a short-run profit calculus. And the irony of what Michael
      just said is that in the United States, a modest, too small version of that was
      the government subsidizing the university to do some of that long-range, not-profit-dominated
      research. The idiocy of what’s being done to cut back the government support to
      get rid of the immigrants who are often the driving force of much of it. That
      is a concession to the backlash of 30 years of globalization and neoliberalism.
      The liberals are every bit as responsible for that, the Democrats, as the Republicans.
      They were all cheerleaders for globalization, for liberalization, for automation
      and relocating jobs and all of the rest of it. And now they see the backlash that
      puts a guy in power who has to do all of the things necessary to hold on to his
      demagogic base. So, yes, of course, he has to tell a dozen countries in Africa
      that they’re not welcome to send anybody to the United States. This is grotesque
      to deport immigrants. What are you doing? 10 million in a country of 330 million
      makes no difference. It’s irrelevant. What are you doing? You’re pandering, of
      course, but the pandering, without which he can’t be president, is going to have
      and is having real negative, self-destructive economic effects. And I have noticed
      in the last few days that, whether it’s from Goldman Sachs or Bank of America
      or Ray Dalio or Jamie Diamond, there is a growing chorus of very big businessmen
      who are saying, uh-oh, this is spinning, from their perspective, out of control.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you made the very important point that China’s government
      is shaping its technology. And the United States is a more centralized planning
      economy than China, but it’s been planned by the financial sector for its own
      financial purposes. And China never had a financial sector because when Mao’s
      revolution occurred, they didn’t have a financial sector and the government had
      to itself provide the money and credit policy. And the credit system is designed
      to finance tangible capital investment in research, development, industry, factories,
      machinery, education, and infrastructure, as opposed to the United States. My
      friend Karlos Sanchez has his Karloff’s gymnasium, where he’s been publishing
      reports by the Chinese officials explaining exactly what makes their planning
      so different. And they point out that in the 1930s, all the way to the 1960s,
      when I went to school, we all had to read Gardner and Mean’s reports on the separation
      in the United States between financial ownership of industry and management. Finance
      would, the financial sector would finance industry, but leave the corporate leadership
      to CEOs who were engineers or marketing specialists, not financial specialists.
      But all this began to change in the 1980s. And all of a sudden, the financiers
      made themselves the managers of companies instead of the industrial managers.
      Instead of having the purpose of the companies to increase market share, to increase
      output, to increase production, the purpose was simply to make wealth by financial
      means, as we’ve spoken before, by stock buybacks, by paying out dividends, by
      increasing the price of stocks instead of lowering the price of production for
      what they’re doing. And you had financial capitalism replace the dynamic of industrial
      capitalism. And so the Chinese call this industrial socialism. It’s not really
      industrial capitalism that evolved into finance capitalism. It’s government supportive
      industry not to make profits and economic rents for the 10% and the 1%, but for
      the entire economy to benefit. That’s what makes socialism different. from capitalism
      ultimately. And in the 19th century, as we’ve said, everybody expected industrial
      capitalism to evolve into socialism. That’s not what happened. And instead, it’s
      been China and its fellow socialist economies that have picked up this idea of
      using industry, agriculture, and most of all, money and credit creation to increase
      the productivity and living standards of the economy, not to centralize wealth
      in the hands of the 1% and 10%. That’s really the conflict of economic systems
      that is behind this whole new Cold War between the United States and Europe on
      the one hand and China, Russia, Iran, and the BRICS countries on the other. All
      of this attempt to somehow maintain U.S. hegemony with this crazy gerrymandered
      logic of finance and trade chaos that I’ve mentioned. It’s all to somehow maintain
      the finance capital system as part of the Cold War against the industrial socialism
      that really was, I think, it’s the destiny of civilization to go in that direction.
      The United States is not part of that direction in which the rest of civilization
      is going in. RICHARD WOLFF: If I could, Nima, I want to pick up on this last point
      of Michael, because I think basically it’s more important than anything else we’ve
      said. Here is the crucial thing that Michael just did. He connected the dilemmas
      of the United States relative to what is going on in this case in China, not to
      the ‘Chinese want to be the next empire’ or the ‘Chinese want to replace the Americans
      as the hegemony.’ None of that. What he did was to link the different positions
      and, therefore, the different prospects of the United States, on the one hand,
      and China on the other, to the organization of their economic systems. In his
      case, he stressed the difference between the industrial and financial sectors,
      let’s call them, of the economy. I would argue, just to expand it, that’s what
      ought to be the discussion. Why did the Chinese grow two to three times faster
      than the United States? Why have they caught up technologically? Why have they
      made the best electric car at a time when the electric car is going to be the
      means of transportation for the next 50 years, etc. Then we get to the question:
      what can a society do that has a 50-50 split between public and private enterprise,
      that has one governed by the profit motive and the other one by a different set
      of notions and calculations? Wow. But we can’t do that in this country because
      that questions the capitalist system that we have, puts it immediately in second
      place, having to justify why in the world would you hold on to a society that
      has organized its industry and its finance in the way we have, given that there’s
      another way that has worked much better. That is so frightening as the proper
      question that we have to get rid of it. We have to make this a struggle of personalities,
      of the Communist Party against it, irrelevant. The fundamental question is: how
      did you organize your economy to get this result? And if it weren’t an ideologically
      unbearable question, it would be the one we would all be discussing now. That’s
      the irony of all of this. MICHAEL HUDSON: What has made China so different is
      why did America deindustrialize? And it deindustrialized because of financialization.
      And China has avoided financialization because it doesn’t have the financial interests.
      And when you had the Secretary of the Treasury Bessent a week ago saying China
      has to not only open its markets, what we really want is China has to let in American
      banking. Let us finance your industry. Well, you know that China is not going
      to do that because if you let American finance banking do to China what it did
      to the American economy, it’s going to hell. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, and absolutely.
      You know, there’s an old saying that capitalists, capitalism will disappear because
      the capitalists will be selling to their executioners the rope with which to be
      then executed. Starting in the 1970s, when large numbers of American capitalists
      saw the opportunity for a quick profit by relocating their businesses into China,
      they sat down and the Chinese said, “We will give you cheap labor and we will
      give you access to our market, which is growing much faster than yours. And in
      exchange, we want your technology.” When that deal was struck, voluntarily, by
      American big business, you had the beginnings of the process, whose conclusion
      we are now discussing. MICHAEL HUDSON: That is basically our theme for the last
      half year that we’ve been saying. And of course, the United States is now trying
      to convince China to sell us the rope to hang it militarily by the rare earths
      that are key for our military armaments against it, which is why China says you’re
      blocking us on national security grounds. We’re going to show you national security
      grounds. Well, let’s see where the American economy is in six months, as you said
      earlier. Let’s just see what happens. Where are we going to be? RICHARD WOLFF:
      I think we’re going to see a lot of it much sooner than six months. I really do
      believe the pre-tariff inventories have now been exhausted. The tariffs are going
      to show up in reduced imports. Already, this last month’s balance of trade is
      sharply different from the previous years in one variable: declining imports.
      Okay, if you attach a tariff, that’s what you get. And they haven’t even hit yet
      in many cases. So, you’re also seeing the greed of our capitalists, who know that
      in a world full of discussions of tariffs, they can raise their prices and claim
      it has to do with tariffs, and no one will know. And they thereby escape blame
      for raising their prices to make more profits. And when you, and they have also,
      as you remember, the dollar has shrunken eight or nine percent since Mr. Bush
      took office. So, you have the diminishing value of the dollar and the tariff.
      You’re really hitting the American imports with a one-two punch that’s going to
      show up starting now. MICHAEL HUDSON: I’m saying, okay, we’re going along with
      you. You know, we’ll accept all of your tariffs. You know, we’re not going to
      bargain with you. We’re not going to argue. We’re just going to, you impose your
      tariffs. Let’s see what economy breaks first. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah. Let me just
      put one of our audience have he has some sort of comment on here is what he said.
      He said, “Nima, please ask Professor Hudson and Wolff to teach an economic curriculum
      online. He would be willing to pay for that.” Yeah. RICHARD WOLFF: Well, let me
      say in response that I have thought about that. I’ve thought about that because
      we, Michael and Nima and I have thought about doing something with the transcripts
      of these programs now for over a year. And I have thought that, given the reaction
      I see to what we do here, that in effect, Nima is taking us through a kind of
      course in economics in which a series of related questions are posed each time,
      and that as the statistical reality unfolds in front of us, and I look at some
      different reports from those that Michael looks at, we are able to come together
      and enrich one another’s grasp of what’s going on, and it becomes a course in
      the immediate economic reality that we’re all living through. So, I mean, I appreciate
      that you see that too. It’s one more voice pushing us to think about that. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: There is a common denominator between Richards and my intellectual and
      political backgrounds. RICHARD WOLFF: Yes, yes. And it has to do with the initials
      K and M. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you so much, Richard and Michael, for being with
      us today. Great pleasure, as always. RICHARD WOLFF: Same here. See you soon. NIMA

      of 500% secondary tariffs on Russian energy. Wolff criticized Graham's statements
      as mere political theater, suggesting that such rhetoric is more about showmanship
      aimed at boosting Graham's popularity in the South than about effective policy.
      He argued that the proposed actions could be viewed internationally as the behavior
      of a rogue nation, undermining global trade and failing to address the real issues
      at hand.

    text: 'NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi everybody. Today is Thursday, May 29, 2025 and our friends
      Richard Wolf and Michael Watson are back with us. Welcome back. RICHARD WOLFF:
      Glad to be back. Thank you. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, let’s get started with you.
      How is the current global fracture between the Western economies and the global
      majority similar to the industrial capitalist revolution in 18th and 19th century
      Europe? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, before explaining that, I should give a little prefatory
      note. Both Richard and I are classical economists. We follow the value theory
      that was developed by Adam Smith, Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, and others—those
      whose analyses led up to Marx. The problem is that the modern economic curriculum
      doesn’t talk about the value theory, the price theory, and the rent theory that
      classical economists developed. The only people talking about this are Marxists.
      So it’s ironic that we’re both classical economists but we’re called Marxists.
      We identify ourselves with Marxists because Marx wrote the first history of economic
      thought, his Theories of Surplus Value, where he talks about how the classical
      analyses of the Physiocrats, Smith and the others—their value theory and their
      price theory—all led up to the problems he discussed in Capital. He devoted Volume
      One to his additions to their theories, but Volume Two and Volume Three describe
      the rent theory, the financial theory, and the real estate theory that led up
      to all of this. It may surprise a lot of viewers to know that we believe in the
      classical free market. But what the classical economists meant by a free market
      was something free of the vested interests carving out incomes for themselves
      that had nothing to do with the production process and are barriers to the success
      of industrial capitalism. It was the role of classical political economy to develop
      value and price theory as a tool to isolate economic rent—unearned income—which
      was the task of industrial capitalism to end in order to make Britain the workshop
      of the world, and in order to enable France, Germany, and industrial powers to
      become the industrial powers they became. The classical industrial strategy was
      based on classical economics and political economy. That’s what made industrial
      capitalism itself so revolutionary in clearing away the vestiges of feudalism.
      And that’s, in a way, what the BRICS countries are facing today in trying to develop
      their own plan for their own markets. This is to free themselves from the legacy
      of colonialism and from the U.S. centered neoliberalism that has dominated government
      policy all throughout the world and is imposed by the World Bank, the International
      Monetary Fund, and the economic mainstream. So our position is that the BRICS
      countries are facing a problem that’s very similar to that faced by Europe’s industrial
      capitalist countries in the late 18th century as it was understood by the French
      Physiocrats and Adam Smith (who was influenced by them)— through to the end of
      the 19th century. Britain, France, Germany, and others had to cope with the vested
      interests carried over from feudalism. Today, the BRICS countries have to confront
      a similar legacy—this legacy of colonialism and foreign investment and client
      oligarchies who have ownership of their raw materials resources, their land, their
      privatized public utilities. These are all burdens on them preventing them from
      developing in a way that, for instance, enabled China’s growth to be so successful.
      So what we want to talk about is this, which is going to be the political issue
      that is driving the BRICS countries over the next few years. It took an entire
      century for industrial capitalism to try to clear the vested interests of real
      estate, banking, and monopolies. And in the end, it failed. There was an anti-classical
      reaction that we’re still living with today. We want to describe how the BRICS
      countries can follow this value, price, and rent theory to free themselves from
      unearned income, from all these classes, foreign investors and domestic rent seekers
      that have nothing to do with the production process and are blocking them from
      devoting their fiscal revenues, their government revenues, their foreign exchange
      earnings, and their foreign trade to industrializing. Maybe I should let Richard
      say a few things here. RICHARD WOLFF: Before I do, I want to take my hat off to
      Michael, not by way of mutual celebration, but because this is a very important
      thing to have figured out. What the BRICS nations and China are doing now is analogous
      to, has lots of parallels with, what the initial Western European break from feudalism
      was all about. They are trying to achieve for themselves a comparable breakthrough
      with the improvements in income and so on that went with that. The people who
      made the revolution back in the 18th and 19th century in Europe now occupy the
      opposite or the reverse position. They are the new feudal lords against whom they
      revolted but which they have now become. And the Global South has taken over the
      historically progressive and dynamic moment. Notice I’m not talking about socialism
      yet. That’s another issue. Socialism is the recognition that even what they’re
      doing isn’t going to get them what they hope it will. You know, Marx looked around
      in the middle of the 19th century and said, ‘I love the slogan of the French Revolution:
      “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity”. And I love what the American Revolution added
      to that—democracy.’ And I understand that the leaders of the revolt against feudalism
      promised that, alongside the end of lord and serf, replacing that with employer
      and employee, there would come, as a fantastic social benefit, liberty, equality,
      fraternity, and democracy. But I have to tell you, said Marx, writing in the London
      of Charles Dickens, that we don’t have liberty, equality, fraternity, and democracy.
      What capitalism promised, it could not deliver. And that has been true ever since.
      And so Marx’s project, if you allow me to say such a thing, was to answer the
      question, “Why did capitalism fail to deliver on the liberty, equality, fraternity,
      and democracy it promised?” That’s not to question the sincerity of the promise.
      It was sincere. Robespierre meant it. Thomas Jefferson, in his way, meant it.
      But they couldn’t do it. They couldn’t get it done. And Marx’s answer, which makes
      him so important, is that capitalism itself is the barrier to realizing liberty,
      equality, and don’t look elsewhere. Don’t look outside. It’s right inside. There’s
      something that capitalism preserves that prevents it from overcoming the autocracy,
      the slavery, all the rest of it, of previous history. And that is the fact that
      there’s something frighteningly similar between master and slave on the one hand,
      lord and serf on the other hand, and on that famous third hand, employer and employee.
      You’ve kept that dichotomy. And in the retaining of that dichotomy, a minority
      at the top, a vast majority at the bottom, you have precluded liberty and democracy.
      You’ve created a hundred years or two hundred years of honest, good, well-meaning
      people trying to overcome inequality and all the rest of it, unable to succeed
      because they haven’t absorbed Marx’s lesson. If you want liberty, equality, fraternity,
      and democracy, you’ve got to get rid of capitalism. Otherwise, you’re foredoomed.
      You will fail as we have. Every time you read about Elon Musk, you’re staring
      failure right in the face. Okay? So what Michael has done is focus us even more
      beyond that. He’s helped us to identify landlords—because I really want to go
      through it a little bit—landlords, monopolists, and bankers. Now, what role did
      they play that had to be overcome? Well, the answer is given by the reaction that
      happened once classical economics really hit its stride. And that’s what we call
      the neoclassical revolution, dating around 1870 and 1880, when in Europe you have
      an explosion of socialism that questions capitalism and that uses Marx’s version
      of the labor theory of value to make its case to say that the world is divided
      between the proletariat that produces a surplus and the capitalists who take it
      and use it to reproduce that situation, that way of organizing the economy. That’s
      why the workers are forever without resources and in trouble. And, you know, the
      answer is always that the capitalists have cornered the surplus and are using
      it to keep the surplus, which is not surprising—or shouldn’t surprise anyone.
      And so one of the ways that this is done is by creating these special classes
      of people. And that’s where the beauty of the analogy with feudalism comes in.
      The landlords! Marx was at his humorous best when he simply taught us—you know,
      the working class has always understood: Why are we paying landlords a rent? They
      didn’t create the land. They had nothing to do with producing the land. And you
      know, if we stopped paying them, that wouldn’t mean the land disappeared. The
      land is there. That’s what we need. We don’t need the landlord. Paying him simply
      removes a part of the value created by workers from being available to develop
      their economy and instead supports an extravagant lifestyle for people who are
      effectively parasites on the system. Monopolists are doing the same thing. They
      are getting a payment for what they sell beyond what it costs to produce. They
      shouldn’t be getting that money. That money is then withdrawn by them for whatever
      it is they think they would like to do, but it’s no longer available to the workers
      and their industrial capitalists who presumably would use it otherwise. And the
      same is true of the bankers. The working class has often been confused between
      the industrial capitalist who takes the surplus from them and the moneyed capitalist
      who sits and watches the whole process and collects his interest. But the rent,
      the monopoly price, and the interest are deductions of a surplus produced by the
      workers that could be used otherwise. And the revolt of classical economics was
      to show that. The counter-revolution of neoclassical economics was to obliterate
      that understanding, to make everything a question of supply and demand. If there’s
      a demand for it, well, then it must be valuable. The capitalist demands workers.
      See, they’re valuable. The banker demands interest. It must be valuable. There
      we go. We have fudged away the surplus. We have fudged away everything the labor
      theory of value helped us to see. And the neoclassicals double the horror because
      they’re proud of not paying attention to the labor theory of value. For them,
      this is an achievement of greater theoretical precision. Whereas for us, it’s
      the obvious effort of a system that is no longer dynamically moving society forward,
      but is now entrenching parasitical elements that will be a problem for our societies
      as long as we allow them to exist. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the key word that Richard
      has used again and again in what he’s just said is “value”. Marx pointed out that
      what made industrial capitalism so revolutionary was that it wanted to strip away
      from the economy all of the claims on income that didn’t reflect value, which
      was defined as a necessary cost of production. It was ultimately resolved by the
      cost of labor, according to Ricardo. But the fact is, if you were looking at,
      say, what makes monopoly rent, it’s the charge over and above the necessary cost
      of production that the monopolists face. Although capitalism was revolutionary
      in wanting to get rid of the landlord class, it recognized that rent was always
      going to exist. Some land is on a site that is more valuable than others. That’s
      what makes the same houses in some neighborhoods much more expensive than others.
      And that’s because there may be parks, there may be nearness to transportation,
      there may be museums, there may be all the things that public spending adds. Well,
      capitalism was revolutionary in wanting to get rid of all of the unnecessary costs
      of production—what Marx called the “false” class of production—and of economic
      rent to the landlords. The rent is going to exist, but that should be the tax
      base. And if rent is a tax base, then you’re not going to have to tax labor and
      industry. As long as the landlords controlled the governments of Europe, which
      they’d done ever since feudalism, they were going to avoid paying taxes themselves
      and they were going to force labor and industry to pay the taxes. The industrialists
      said: “if we have to pay our wage earners enough money for them to be able to
      pay economic rent to the landlords and monopoly rent to the monopolists and then
      run into debt and pay interest to the banks, then we’re not going to be able to
      be competitive internationally”. Britain cannot be the workshop of the world as
      long as it doesn’t have political reform to end the landlord’s control of the
      government and its tax system. All of that was revolutionary. The idea of industrial
      capitalism was to streamline the cost of production. And it turned out that doing
      this was a precondition for a free market, that is, a market free from economic
      rent, to begin to evolve. And, as Richard has just explained, this would solve
      the aims of the Industrial Revolution for the industrial class but didn’t address
      the problems for the vast majority of the population that was increasingly the
      wage-earning class, along with the agricultural class. Marx believed that once
      you had freed markets and economies from the power of the rent seekers, they would
      naturally evolve into socialism. So while socialism went beyond capitalism, it
      was capitalism that Marx saw as evolving into socialism. This evolution, Marx
      said, was going to begin with the government supplying the means of production
      for all sorts of basic services, such as public utilities, communications—all
      the things that Europe certainly started by keeping in the public domain—the post
      office, transportation, all of these basic services. The Europeans, and the Americans
      following them, realized that if you leave these services in private hands, then
      the private owners are going to charge monopoly rents over and above profits.
      They’re going to become exploitative. And so industrial capitalism needed an active
      role of government to replace the monopolies that had been created during the
      medieval period largely to provide governments and kings with the money to pay
      bankers for the foreign debts that they ran up to finance their wars. Banking
      was basically aimed at arranging war financing and government financing. Banking
      did not play a role in the early Industrial Revolution. Bankers didn’t help finance
      the steam engine and the mechanization of production. That was done by the industrial
      capitalists. They wanted government support for this industrialization. They,
      of course, didn’t want to have to raise the wages they paid but they realized
      that labor needed high wages in order to be productive, in order to become industrial
      labor. And the high wages took the form, very largely, of cutting the cost of
      living by these governments playing the role of receiving the land rent, so that
      it didn’t have to tax labor. So labor didn’t have to pay landlords and wouldn’t
      have to pay monopoly prices. The whole idea was to streamline the means of production.
      And that was what the economists meant by a free market. Well, what Richard has
      just said, there was a counter-revolution against this and when people like Frederick
      Hayek and Margaret Thatcher talked about the free market—with something called
      The Adam Smith Institute-it meant a market free for rent seekers, for landlords,
      for monopolists, free of any government regulation to prevent rent interests.
      And so industrial capitalism in the 20th century, accelerating in the 1980s, became
      the antithesis of the revolution that industrial capitalism sought to create.
      Well, how are the BRICS going to cope with this? What they need to realize is
      that although industrial capitalism failed in the West, they have to ask how they
      can proceed in a way that it succeeds in what they’re doing? How do they free
      themselves? Well, take the issue of land rent, natural resource rent. Foreign
      investors play the role in the BRICS countries and the global south that Europe’s
      hereditary aristocracy did in Europe. They invaded, they took control of the natural
      resources and revenue. And while Britain, France, and America were all for getting
      rid of economic rent in their own economies, when they established colonies and
      tried to economically to take over what became the Global South countries – that
      was all about rent seeking. They wanted to grab the natural resources and get
      all of the natural resource rent, which was just like land rent, as Ricardo described
      in Chapter Two of his On the Principles of Political Economy . These principles
      were developed right after the Napoleonic Wars ended as an outline of what Britain
      had to do to now get rid of the Corn Laws, get rid of agricultural protectionism,
      get rid of the power of landlords over the government, and to have parliamentary
      reform to essentially support industrial capitalism against these vested interests.
      Well, the classical economists had a solution. Even if foreign investors retain
      foreign ownership of the natural resources, governments have the ability to pass
      a tax on economic rent, on unearned income, as distinct from wage income and industrial
      profits. Marx considered industrial profit an element of value because the industrial
      capitalists did play a role in production. The industrialists organized production,
      developed markets, did all sorts of things in order to compete with rivals abroad
      and to create markets for themselves throughout the world. But in order to continue
      to compete, in order to become really competitive, whether it was against their
      will or not, industrial capitalism had to evolve into socialism. Not only did
      Marx think that, but everybody in the late 19th century thought that they were
      going to see socialism of one form or another. There was, as we said before in
      the earlier shows while Richard was in France, there was Catholic socialism, Christian
      socialism, non-Marxist socialism. There were all forms, but there was a general
      idea that you needed a mixed economy, an increasingly active government public
      sector alongside private production in order to prevent the monopolists, the landlords,
      and the bankers from the rent-seeking that would have prevented industrial economies
      from being productive. Well, the same with what the BRICS countries would need.
      I didn’t mention banking before, but the BRICS countries would need to do what
      China has done: have banking create money and credit. Not simply to make profits
      by taking over industrial companies and creating monopolies as the mother of trusts,
      and then backing those opposing land taxation because they want landlords to make
      enough money in order to pay the government interest on the mortgage credit that
      enables new buyers of the land. Well, the key move that China has made and that
      the BRICS countries need to emulate is keeping banking as a public monopoly, a
      public creation of money and credit so that it will be used to finance actual
      industrial and agricultural and government infrastructure investment, not predatory
      behavior of the banks of Europe. Well, this fight was fought out in Germany in
      the 19th century, but the banks fought back. At any rate, these classical concepts
      of value, price, and rent, and the use of value theory to define economic rent
      as unearned income that economies need to get rid of is a precondition, not only
      for capitalism, but of socialism as well. That’s what makes that essentially the
      task of the BRICS economies today, I think. RICHARD WOLFF: And look, not understanding
      this-if I could add, Nima—not understanding this leads you into the following
      conundrum. The denunciation in the West of China is precisely that the Chinese
      are doing, for example with their credit system, what Michael just described.
      They are not allowing it to function as though it were in some way equivalent
      to the way it functions in industrial capitalism. It’s not going to be privately
      owned. It’s not going to be driven by some narrow definition of whatever you call
      profit and maximizing-none of that. It’s going to solve the social problem, which
      for them has been, not being the poorest country on earth, but becoming a decent,
      modern, middle-income country, which they have accomplished in one generation.
      Nobody has ever done that before. But the denunciation is a double irony. It misses
      their success, and it guarantees the failure of the West, because it can’t do
      that. It—the West—has no way to mobilize its resources in a comparably focused
      way on economic growth. And so it will lag behind, leading to all the troubles.
      We read this morning in the press that the United States government has decided
      there are yet other kinds of equipment it will not allow American companies to
      sell to China. It’s not going to stop the process. It misunderstands the structural
      issue. It will be as big a failure as going to war in Ukraine has proved to be,
      or the war in Vietnam proved to be, or the war in Iraq proved to be. You’re not
      thinking clearly, not because you aren’t smart, but because you took out that
      labor theory of value, which was developed—again, because Michael said it, and
      so few people understand it-it was developed not by Karl Marx, but by Adam Smith
      and David Ricardo and there were other precursors beyond that. Marx took it in
      a different direction, for sure. But he owed it to them, which was a debt he acknowledged
      in those books that Michael referred to in The Theories of Surplus Value, where
      he says over and over again what an important breakthrough it was when Smith and
      Ricardo got their hands on that labor theory of value. And what Michael is saying
      is that we have to read the history of economics differently because it’s crucial
      to getting ourselves straightened out where we are today. My debt, a little different
      from Michael’s, my debt is to a French philosopher named Louis Althusser, whose
      most important publication, virtually unknown in the United States, is a book
      in French called Lire le Capital, which translates into English as Reading Capital.
      And he meant by “Capital”, the book. He comes as a philosopher and says, “What
      is this book doing?”  What is the problem this book addresses? What is the project?
      He says it in his own language, which is a philosopher’s. He was a professor of
      philosophy. What his language is, is different. But what he reaches is a conclusion
      charmingly parallel to what Michael opened us up to today with that rendition.
      He says, look at what they’re trying to do. Oh!—and then he opens up. If you read
      this stuff in Althusser and then you go back and you say you had that Eureka moment,
      that’s what this book is about. It’s not about this or that detail. It’s about
      a different way of understanding what’s going on. By the way, if you want to know
      why Marx’s Capital isn’t taught in the United States, it’s because it’s a different
      way of understanding what’s going on. And it’s very important for this system
      not to have that publicly discussed, publicly explored, or criticized. That’s
      all fine. Find shortcomings in it. There are plenty of them there. This is not
      a loyalty game. This is a game of saying what kind of society would enable the
      achievement of scientific breakthroughs which it then buries. What kind of a bizarre
      society must we be living in to do that? It’s not something to be proud of. It’s
      something to scratch your head and wonder why. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, Adam Smith
      today would be called a Marxist because he urged changing around the tax system
      to tax the landlords and not labor and capital. Remember, he accused businessmen
      of seeking monopolies. And if you want to prevent that, well, with anti-monopoly
      legislation, that’s called Marxist. Every reform that the classical economists
      urged in order to free markets is called Marxist today. So what are Richard and
      I to do? The only students who are being taught economics are being taught economics
      by Marxist professors. That’s the only exposure that they get to what Adam Smith,
      John Stuart Mill, Ricardo, and even Thomas Malthus actually were talking about.
      The whole strategy of industrial capitalism was summarized by Marx and that’s
      the strategy we’ve been discussing and is very embarrassing to the rent seekers
      who say, “no, no, no, don’t say that landlords don’t earn their money”. It’s true
      that landlords don’t just receive rent in their sleep, as John Stuart Mill said.
      They play an active role. They decide who to rent to. And they pay lobbyists to
      help the government understand that rent is productive. That’s why our GDP accounts
      and our national income accounts count rent as a contribution to product. But
      it’s not a product. Marx is very clear. He distinguished the production economy,
      product and consumption, from the unproductive economy, the circulation economy.
      That’s the same thing that other economists who criticized monopolies, the German
      reformers who industrialized banking, wanted to prevent— banking playing an unproductive
      role. But what happened after World War I is that instead of what Marx expected
      and what he described in Volume 3 of Capital, instead of banking being industrialized,
      industry was financialized. And that became a counter-revolution in the sense
      of being against the revolution in value, price, and rent theory that had guided
      industrial capitalism. That’s the way of thinking. If you think of price as the
      unnecessary excess of economic rent over value as the necessary cost of production,
      that leads you to strip away all of the special privileges that landlords have,
      that monopolists have, and that other rent-seeking people have. You have a free
      market in the classical sense of Adam Smith and Marx and Richard and me, not the
      Hayek theory that, well, if you want freedom then get rid of government. Industrial
      capitalism led to a government strong enough to tax away economic rent, strong
      enough to take monopolies into the public domain to produce basic needs and basic
      services as public services to be subsidized and provided freely—like education,
      instead of having to charge for it, like transportation, like medical care and
      public health. Well, all of these were conservative policies in the 19th century.
      Benjamin Disraeli said health, health is everything. Disraeli and the classical
      economists would not support Obamacare and the enormous overhead of health care
      in the United States. This is what really distinguishes the kind of economic reform
      that industrialism promised but failed to achieve because it failed to prevent
      this intellectual counter-revolution that was sponsored by the political counter-revolution
      of the landlords, bankers, and monopolists fighting back against the industrialists’
      idea of a low-price, efficiently run economy. And so it was left to socialist
      China to streamline this, and we’ve seen the difference in practice. RICHARD WOLFF:
      Let me show you how this works out, folks. The most successful investor in the
      United States over the last half a century is a man named Warren Buffett. He recently
      retired. He is an elderly gentleman now, a billionaire, etc. And he was always
      asked one question throughout his career: why are you so successful? Why, in his
      Berkshire Hathaway corporation, did he assemble the right shares of stock at the
      right time to become a multi-billionaire, blah, blah, blah. He never hesitated
      to answer. His answer—yes, in the language of economics that he’s used to— he
      said, “I always focus my investment as follows. I look for a company”. And now—in
      his language—that has a dominant position in its market’. Okay, that’s a nice
      way of saying “a monopolist”, somebody who’s in a position to jack the price of
      whatever it is they produce way above what it costs, and to then parcel out that
      wonderful revenue to whoever made it possible. That’s what he did. So he invested,
      based on a hunger for monopoly in modern capitalism. And he made a lot of money
      because he bet correctly that those companies in a position to dominate a market,
      that is to charge more than the cost of reproducing whatever it is, is where you
      want to be to collect the money in the way this capitalism runs. Wow. That’s why
      he’s big in banking. He’s big in insurance. He’s big in all those things—railroads
      that have an effective monopoly on where they run. Those are the things he’s made
      a ton of his money on. It’s an illustration of what Michael is trying to say.
      And a society that does that is siphoning wealth away from economic development
      to sustaining these special groups. And that’s what Adam Smith and Ricardo hated
      about the feudal landlords. They siphoned away wealth emerging out of feudalism
      that couldn’t be used to develop the English or French economies because it was
      being spent in the frivolous consumption craziness of that period of French history.
      I just came back from France. If you travel along the Loire River, which is not
      so far from Paris, you can see the extraordinary mansions and chateaus that were
      built with this enormous surplus that was taken away from industrial production
      in order to produce one grand household after another. along the river as it runs
      from the middle of the country to the Atlantic Ocean. It’s extraordinary the insights
      you get from this. And then the irony of China one more time. By being excluded
      from the West, by being told you’re a communist country, so you’re the poorest
      country on earth. We’re not going to help you, and you’re going to stay the poorest
      country on earth because you’re not joining in the capitalist growth system. That
      was literally told to them in the late 40s and early 50s. Being excluded was the
      best thing that ever happened to them. By being forced not to rely on the West,
      they were able to limit—not totally, by the way, only limit, for they have their
      problems too—but they were able to limit the loss of all of that wealth from the
      job of economic development. They kept it there. And that has made all the difference.
      Nothing will change in that process. We will continue to see the GDP of China
      grow two to three times faster than that of the U.S. which has been the case in
      every one of the last 30 years. Which is a stunning achievement, which any serious
      economics profession would make its number one object. If Adam Smith’s great book
      The Wealth of Nations wanted to account for why the wealth of one nation was a
      hell of a lot more than the wealth of another, that would be the issue today.
      Why is the wealth of China exploding relative to that of every place else? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, one thing that China had that the industrial nations of Europe didn’t
      have was a strong enough government to prevent an independent oligarchy, a financial
      oligarchy, and its associated landlord oligarchy and monopolist oligarchy from
      developing. The reason was that when China had a revolution, they got rid of the
      financial class. The financial class and the landlord class all fled to Taiwan
      or left the country, or essentially was socialized out of existence. That didn’t
      happen in the West and that was the failure. The Western economies, by the late
      19th century, by the time of the Austrian school, the American school, and the
      whole right counter-revolution against government said, “We don’t want a strong
      government. Government is the oppressor.” Well, what they meant was that government
      is blocking the landlord class, the monopolist class, and the financial class.
      But they convinced the population. And today, the so-called free market advocacy
      that you’re having in the United States with Donald Trump, Musk, and the Republicans,
      joined by the Democrats, is that government bureaucracies are less efficient than
      private monopolists and private capitalists. Well, they’re not really capitalists
      in the sense of industrial capitalists, as it was understood in the 19th century.
      They are essentially financial managers who’ve taken over industry and taken over
      government to steer government along financialized lines. It was the banking interests
      that backed the real estate interests in opposing a real estate tax. And they’ve
      done this because they know that, all right, there’s still land rent being paid,
      but it’s not being paid to landlords anymore. It’s being paid to banks in the
      sense that anyone who borrows money to buy a home has to pay the land rent and
      that’s most of the value of real estate homes and commercial buildings today going
      to the banks. And if you look down, who are the recipients of economic rent today?
      It turns out that it’s the banking and the financial sector. And so what we’re
      in is something that neither Marx nor other socialists before Lenin recognized.
      We’re in a financial capitalist society today, not an industrial capitalist society.
      Marx expected industrial capitalism to evolve into socialism, but it was hijacked
      by the rentier interest turning it into finance capitalism. That is what has led
      to deindustrialization of the United States and Western Europe. And that is essentially
      the object lesson that I think the BRICS countries need to look at, to say, what
      is it that we want to avoid? We want to avoid foreign investors and private owners,
      whether they’re domestic oligarchy, client oligarchy, or foreign investors, from
      taking our natural resource rent. Natural resources are created by nature for
      free. There’s no cost of production and therefore no value. And to try to benefit
      from—if you’re making a mine—from more than the capital expenditures that you’re
      creating in digging an oil well and creating a mine, then you’re getting all of
      this natural resource rent. That’s unnatural. That can be taxed away and that
      would enable the BRICS governments to have the money to build their own domestic
      infrastructure, to replace the privatized infrastructure, to create an economy
      that is a streamlined economy and is based on the economics of production. It
      would be used to raise living standards, to raise productivity, to raise education,
      to lower the cost of living and create what was the original capitalist promise.
      And it became the socialist promise that was fought against by the anti-industrial
      revolution that occurred, as Richard said, in the late 19th and early 20th century
      and essentially replaced industrial capitalism altogether in the wake of World
      War I. RICHARD WOLFF: I could conclude this conversation and go back to Adam Smith.
      He warned us—and by the way, Marx repeated it later—he warned us that if you leave
      the capitalist structure the way it is, the way the capitalists think and function,
      they will make that transition that we have criticized. They will make the move
      from being an industrial capitalism focused on earning a profit by producing something,
      to looking for the monopoly position in which you can make money while you’re
      sleeping. It’s much less arduous. You become, instead of the living organism making
      the wealth, you become the parasite that sits and simply consumes the wealth and
      loses interest in it. The ultimate guarantee? Here’s the irony, the ultimate guarantee
      is what the early capitalist imagined, a capitalism driven by competition to make
      the most surplus and plow it back into the business to grow. But that image is
      undercut by the employer-employee relationship. That was Marx’s brilliance. What
      he called the relations of production in the end go from being a means to grow
      wealth to becoming a fetter, holding back the growth of wealth. So, what would
      be the guarantee that you wouldn’t move from appropriating the surplus to a parasite?
      The answer is: get rid of the contradiction between the employer and the employee,
      their interests are not the same. It’s the employees’ understanding of what Marx
      taught them. If they become their own employer, then they can be sure not to take
      it in that wasteful social direction. And having the workers become themselves
      the employer, that’s socialism. That’s why Marx-not as some mystical predictor
      of the future. Marx didn’t believe, you know, predicting the future like something
      that the people in the amusement park do. That’s not a serious business. None
      of us knows what the future is. That’s why we call it the future. When Marx talked
      like that, he was working out the logic of the system. The guarantor of socialism
      is that the internal contradictions of capitalism that he spent his life trying
      to figure out precluded not just the delivery of liberty, equality, and fraternity,
      it precluded the perpetuation of the capitalist system itself. And when he figured
      that out, he bequeathed to the rest of us a notion not only of how capitalism
      works, but how and why it will pass out of existence, at which point one of its
      products, Marxism, will disappear too. I mean, who achieves such insight? You
      know, that’s what Althusser in France, what he marvels at. Look at this. This
      is an analysis which can account for the passing of the object of the analysis
      and then of the analysis too. It’s extraordinary. And it really underscores what
      Michael and I have said, the problem that he said we face. We’re trying to explain
      to our fellow economists what it is they are missing. But being educated the way
      they have, they can’t hear us. So we are yelling, we’re speaking in a situation
      where there’s just frustration all around. But then again, maybe we shouldn’t
      complain. Because if I learn anything from my fellow Americans every day in the
      street, we’re all wondering what the hell is going on because none of the old
      rules seem to be in place. Each day’s headlines are more bizarre than the ones
      before. Anyway, I have to go, so my apologies. I am very glad to be back in this
      conversation. I learn a lot from what we are trying to puzzle through here. So
      I look forward very much to doing it again next week. MICHAEL HUDSON: See you
      soon. Thank you, Richard. There’s a reason why economists don’t hear us, and that
      is that we are not on the mainstream media or on television. We are not asked
      to comment in polite company. We’re on Nima’s show and often others. This is basically
      our vehicle. And what we’re getting back to is what Richard said. He said that
      Adam Smith forcast what would happen if the industrial hope of getting rid of
      the landlord class and its economic rent didn’t work. It was Ricardo, who was
      the bank spokesman in Parliament in Britain, who gave an even more dramatic description,
      saying that, as the population increased and demand for housing and agricultural
      land and real estate increased, then more and more of the national income would
      be used to pay the landlords until the entire economic surplus over and above
      bare subsistence would be paid to the landlord class and that would mean the end
      of industrial capitalism. Next week, I can read you the passage from what Ricardo
      said so dramatically. But in fact, what Ricardo didn’t criticize, of course, was
      the financial class because he was a lobbyist for the banking class of England.
      And what we’ve been discussing on this show for the last more than six months
      is how more and more of the national income of the United States and Europe has
      been paid as debt service to the financial sector, up and up. Every recovery since
      World War II has started from a higher and higher debt level. And now almost all
      of the income of over and above subsistence for more and more of the wage earners
      is paid to the banks as interest, credit card interest—mostly mortgage interest
      if they have a home. But otherwise it is in the form of economic rent that the
      buyers of real estate who borrowed the money from the banks to obtain land rent,
      and have essentially paid as interest. That’s interest on their automobile debt,
      on their personal loans that they’ve had to take out in order to break even because
      they’re not paid enough money in their wages to pay for the basic cost of living.
      So the destiny that Adam Smith and Ricardo warned would occur if you don’t tax
      away economic rent— and they were thinking of the landlords—is actually now being
      taken by the banking sector that plays the role today that landlords played in
      the 19th century. So as you read the economics of Marx and John Stuart Mill and
      the other economists, then you can realize, ah, yes, now it’s the bankers that
      are the main recipients. And as the main rent recipients, they oppose taxing economic
      rent and using it as a tax base. They advocate tax on labor and industry, not
      on our client real estate interests, not on our client monopoly interests. And
      that is what has essentially deindustrialized the United States. The task of the
      BRICS countries is: how do we avoid this? How do we avoid the power of the international
      financial institutions, the World Bank, the IMF, and the American National Endowment
      for Democracy engaging in regime change to prevent us from taking steps to achieve
      a streamlined economy in which the economic surplus is used to increase production,
      increase employment, build more factories, and improve agriculture, and raise
      the standard of living and labor so better educated, better clothed, better housed
      labor can undersell the labor of the pauper countries. The pauper labor countries
      have become the United States, Germany, and Europe, which were supposed to be
      the leading industrial countries. It’s American and German and European labor
      that is now being pauperized by finance, along with real estate and along with
      the monopoly rent-seeking interests. It is distinct from China and other Asian
      countries that are trying to reinvent the wheel. What I think Richard and I have
      tried to do is provide them with the concepts of value, price, and rent that would
      guide their policy in freeing society from the rent. That implies a government
      strong enough to do this. And it’s the object of finance capitalism to prevent
      a strong government able to do this and to capture the government to make it strong
      on behalf of the financial sector, on behalf of the rent seekers—exactly what
      Britain, France, and other European countries spent a century trying to reform.
      All of this actually culminated in a constitutional crisis in England in 1909,
      1910, when the British Parliament actually passed the land tax and the House of
      Lords rejected it. The crisis lasted a year, and Britain passed a rule saying
      that never again could the House of Lords reject a revenue act by the House of
      Commons. Well, by the time it passed, the world was on the way to World War I.
      National emergencies and all of that wiped out this whole drive to free economies
      from rent and create a free market, classical economic style. It was replaced
      with a free market in the sense of being free for the rentiers to prevent governments
      from blocking their takeover and grinding economies to a halt. That was the laws
      of motion that occurred. Marx, in his introduction to Capital, said, my job is
      describing the laws of motion of capitalism. Well, the laws of motion today are
      not the same laws of motion that Marx described way back then. He was overly optimistic
      as to what he hoped industrial capitalism would end up doing. We’re trying to
      refocus attention on these laws of motion to guide the policy that we would like
      to see the BRICS countries apply because we don’t see much of a prospect of it
      being applied in the United States and Europe, where the neoliberals have taken
      a stranglehold on government and used it for the exact opposite purpose that the
      original and classical economists and industrialists of Europe and America had
      hoped to see. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Great, Michael. We’re going to continue these discussions
      that are so much important, in my opinion, when it comes to the BRICS and the
      future of BRICS and the Global South and what they can learn from the United States,
      from the Western economy, from what you’ve been mentioning in the various sessions
      that you’re talking on, here on this podcast. Thank you so much, Michael. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, we’ve got to thank you for sponsoring us and giving us this arena
      to introduce these concepts that we’re not able to introduce to the academic curriculum
      in these countries. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you. See you soon, Michael. See you
      next week. MICHAEL HUDSON: Bye-bye. Photo by Tanya Barrow on Unsplash The post

    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion on May 29, 2025, Nima Alkhorshid, Richard
      Wolff, and Michael Hudson explore the parallels between the current global divide
      between Western economies and the global majority and the industrial capitalist
      revolution of 18th and 19th century Europe, while emphasizing their identification
      with classical economic theories despite being labeled as Marxists.
    paragraph_summary: In a discussion led by Nima Alkhorshid with Richard Wolff and
      Michael Hudson, the conversation explores the parallels between the current global
      divide between Western economies and the global majority and the industrial capitalist
      revolution of 18th and 19th century Europe. Hudson, identifying as a classical
      economist alongside Wolff, critiques the modern economic curriculum for neglecting
      classical value, price, and rent theories, which were foundational to economic
      thought and later influenced Marx. They argue that the classical notion of a free
      market is one devoid of unearned income and vested interests that hinder industrial
      capitalism's success, highlighting the ongoing relevance of these theories in
      understanding contemporary economic issues.

    text: "\uFEFF 2025.05.21 GLENN DIESEN: Hi everyone and welcome. I am very pleased\
      \ today to be joined by Professor Michael Hudson, a very prominent economist and\
      \ also author of some of the truly great books on political economy. So, thank\
      \ you for being back on the program. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, thanks for having me,\
      \ Glenn. GLENN DIESEN: Well, what is interesting with Trump is he comes off as\
      \ a peace president, at least in his campaigns. That is, he condemned the Forever\
      \ Wars in the Middle East and, to his credit, he was one of the few who were able\
      \ to criticize the Iraq War and still stay alive. He also provoked NATO for provoking\
      \ the war in Ukraine, which suggests that, you know, we recognize our own fault,\
      \ at least as a path to compromise and peace. On the other hand, often one can’t\
      \ help but notice that the criticism is defined by them being very expensive.\
      \ It begs the question whether or not he is a man of peace, or if he simply wants\
      \ a better return on investment. Again, if you go through his different speeches,\
      \ all the way back to the 1980s, he keeps making the point: We help to protect\
      \ the world. It costs us too much money. They should pay us. So do you see this,\
      \ what do you read into this? Do you think he’s merely, do you think he wants\
      \ to reduce the empire, or simply get a better return on investment? MICHAEL HUDSON:\
      \ Well, Trump’s plan for peace is really very simple. He wanted a cease-fire on\
      \ terms that Russia would surrender virtually to NATO. It would stop fighting.\
      \ Germany and England and France would move their troops in. The Ukrainians would\
      \ continue to attack, and set up missiles already to attack Moscow, and essentially\
      \ escalate the war and seize Ukraine. Russia would lose. He has a similar peace\
      \ plan for Gaza. As he said, kill them all. Then there will be peace. There won’t\
      \ be anyone to fight anymore. And his idea for peace with Iran was similarly simple.\
      \ No enrichment. Let the inspectors in. So they will know everywhere where you\
      \ have a potential military or enrichment site so that the Americans and Israelis\
      \ can bomb them and destroy you and bring a regime change. His idea for peace\
      \ is the most aggressive plan that any American president would dare have come.\
      \ But he knows that most voters in the United States are against the war in Gaza.\
      \ Most voters are against the war in Ukraine. And so his idea of peace is: “We’ll\
      \ just defeat all the enemies and we’ll have peace.” That’s pretty crude, but\
      \ that’s it in a nutshell. His plan to make America great again is similarly simplistic.\
      \ I hesitate to say what his actual plan is because if I try to make sense out\
      \ of it, you’ll see that it doesn’t make sense. And you’ll think that I’m not\
      \ making sense. So, if you can ask particular aspects of the plan that you see,\
      \ then I will discuss them and why they will either work, or not work, or how\
      \ they will work. GLENN DIESEN: Well, you brought up an interesting one. We don’t\
      \ have to go into that one, on the Middle East, which is kind of interesting because\
      \ if you want peace or profit, then, of course, ethnically cleansing all of Gaza,\
      \ and make it a Middle Eastern Riviera, it obviously puts the economics over anything\
      \ that can be considered just peace. But I thought perhaps we could focus on the\
      \ deal the United States is making with Ukraine. That is the minerals deal. I\
      \ guess the premise of the thing, which is now signed, of course, is that Ukraine\
      \ signs over control over a lot of its, or half of its, natural resources. And\
      \ this would make American and Ukrainian interest inseparable now. And this would\
      \ ensure that America would always be there for Ukraine. This is the security\
      \ guarantee Ukraine really needs. How do you read into this? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well,\
      \ the idea of actually getting Ukrainian resources — and Trump has mentioned specifically\
      \ rare earth — was a fantasy from the beginning, as all of the scientists and\
      \ economists have noted. His idea was that if you can take the number one resource\
      \ that he said: “We want this Zaporozhye [Zaporizhzhia] atomic plant to be under\
      \ American direction.” Well, that will simply control who gets the electricity.\
      \ Obviously, the electricity would be sent westward to Ukraine, not eastward to\
      \ Russia, and the plant would be used, basically, as a monopoly. Regarding rare\
      \ earth, the mining of the rare earth is so expensive that there is no economic\
      \ benefit for having rare earth. The only advantage, the so-called miners would\
      \ be American troops masquerading as if they were miners. I think if there’s anything\
      \ to be grabbed in Ukraine, the Ukraine that’s left after Russia finishes its\
      \ military operations, it’s the land itself. And already the Oakland Institute\
      \ here in America have outlined how many American investors have been buying up\
      \ Ukrainian farmland. So, basically the Ukrainian economy that’s left is already\
      \ going to be owned largely by foreigners, not by Ukrainians. So the whole idea\
      \ is a surrender. And the way in which Trump has organized this economic consortium\
      \ to invest and divide up the profits is Ukraine puts up the resources and presumably\
      \ spends some of the money to develop. The Americans will spend money, but the\
      \ American contribution is counted to include all of the value of arms that the\
      \ United States sends to Ukraine. These are the vastly overpriced arms for American\
      \ aircraft, missiles, and tanks. And the cost of these armaments that America\
      \ is sending is so large that, basically, Ukraine will not have very much share\
      \ in any profits that the agriculture, or mining, or other resources have. And\
      \ Zelinsky himself — when the plan was first announced — said that this is Ukraine’s\
      \ patrimony. It has to be used to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine. And he\
      \ gave almost an eloquent denunciation of why this wouldn’t work. So I think this\
      \ was all a fantasy to begin with. Trump likes to indulge in fantasies, especially\
      \ where he somehow has a part of all of this benefit. One can imagine part of\
      \ the investment being a new hotel in Kiev, Trump Hotel. It seems such a distraction\
      \ that it hardly plays a role in what’s really happening in the world. GLENN DIESEN:\
      \ Yeah, it is strange, the things that grab the news, for example, Trump getting\
      \ a new plane on this trip to the Middle East. But some of them are quite significant\
      \ in terms of the [?] pointed out the transactional approach, that is, the Europeans\
      \ are also discovering if you agree to buy a lot of American energy or weapons\
      \ or something that well, it gives good sales to the United States, then it’s\
      \ easier to win over Trump, and you get more favorable impacts on foreign policy.\
      \ But at some point, it also appears to push back and alienate some countries.\
      \ That is, Japan, for example. I have never seen Japan since the war grow a backbone\
      \ against the United States, to actually stand up. The language they’ve used now\
      \ is quite different, in terms of saying that they don’t want to be extorted by\
      \ the United States. Again, being a bit confused as well, I think, about the U.S.\
      \ approach that is asking the Japanese, “What are you willing to give us?” What\
      \ do you make of this transactional economic relationship — if not extractive\
      \ — and how does this affect the partnerships? Because one could also, of course,\
      \ extend this to Taiwan, to some extent. MICHAEL HUDSON: Trump has explained what\
      \ he means by a transaction. He said, “America has to win and get the better of\
      \ any transaction.” He’s promised not to have any transaction in which the United\
      \ States doesn’t win, and its adversaries — the whole rest of the world — lose.\
      \ This is his negotiating tactic and how he got rich all along, usually by double-crossing\
      \ his allies, his suppliers, his contractors, and, of course, his banks, whom\
      \ he didn’t pay. His transaction approach is a very aggressive approach to other\
      \ countries. In the case of Japan, he’s pretty much locked in the 25% tariffs\
      \ against Japanese auto exports. This means that Nissan and Toyota, other countries\
      \ are not going to be able to make the car exports that they have before. This\
      \ puts the Japanese car companies in trouble. I think Japan all along — from my\
      \ experience dealing with CEOs of Japanese companies — has always had a Plan B\
      \ for what to do if the relationship with the United States doesn’t work. And\
      \ Plan B has always been, well, if it doesn’t work for the U.S., we’ll turn to\
      \ China. I think Japan has actually begun to pursue talks. I would assume that\
      \ they’ve been talking to the Chinese and said, “Well, if we’re not able to export\
      \ our cars to the United States anymore, obviously we’re being blocked from our\
      \ exports. We do have a lot of dollars. Supposedly reorient our economy to yours?\
      \ Is there any way that Chinese aims and Japanese aims can dovetail?” I think\
      \ Japan does have, one of its companies has, an auto plant in China. They may\
      \ very well be talking about some kind of trade realignment. I have no idea, but\
      \ I know that that has been the Japanese approach many years ago when I was there.\
      \ And I would assume pure geo-economic self-interest is going to lead them to\
      \ think, well, if we’re locked out of the U.S. market, where are we going to go?\
      \ And where is the most logical place for them to go? Neighboring Asia. So I think\
      \ they’re thinking of that. Their explicit threat was, “Well, we are the largest\
      \ holders of U.S. Treasury securities.” And as you’ve noticed yesterday the Treasury\
      \ securities on 30-year bonds almost hit 5%. That’s been unprecedented for many\
      \ decades. When Trump says “we” — meaning the Royal “We” (Trump) — intend to drive\
      \ the dollar down, thinking that this will make American industrial exports more\
      \ competitive with a devaluation, somehow this tells investors, well, if you hold\
      \ U.S. Treasury securities — and they’ve already gone down 5% or 6% since Trump\
      \ took place — if they go down another 6%, that means any interest that you get\
      \ on the U.S. bonds is going to be wiped out in your own currency terms by the\
      \ depreciation of the dollar. This is not a way of attracting foreign investment\
      \ into the dollar. There always is a desire for safety, but there’s also a desire\
      \ for income. And basically, Trump is telling other countries, “Well, you’re not\
      \ going to be able to make income, in your terms, off the dollar, but there will\
      \ be safety here because one of the demands that we are making on our tariff laws\
      \ and our bilateral negotiations is we’re going to blacklist any country that\
      \ joins the BRICS or any other group that seeks to have an alternative to the\
      \ dollar.” So this is part of his overall aggressive system. It’s as if Trump\
      \ has declared an economic war and a financial war on other countries, to go along\
      \ with the de facto monetary war that he’s been promoting under the guise of the\
      \ label of peace — war for peace, or like we call it, the Defense Department,\
      \ not the War Department anymore. That’s really the fantasy. So I think that not\
      \ only Japan, but also Korea… I think the Japanese have been talking to Korea\
      \ that has a similar problem in its automobile exports to the United States. And\
      \ same thing with their computers and electronics. What can we do with electronics?\
      \ What can we do to cope with this U.S. trade aggression? And who knows what they’re\
      \ trying to come up with. But I think they’re looking for an alternative, and\
      \ when you begin to look, you usually find a way. GLENN DIESEN: Yeah, I’m somewhat\
      \ skeptical of the decisions that have been made since ‘Liberation Day,’ when\
      \ he was liberating the U.S. from, well, God knows. But it is curious though,\
      \ because often it’s pointed out that the dollar, it’s the cleanest of all the\
      \ shirts in the hamper, suggesting, yes, the dollar’s full of flaws, but there’s\
      \ no good alternatives. But in this effort to weaken the dollar to make American\
      \ industry more competitive for exports, obviously it must have been predictable\
      \ that this would undermine the standing of the U.S. as the reserve currency —\
      \ because you want a strong dollar, if you want that as a reserve currency, but\
      \ you want it weak at the same time to have this export-driven economy. But does\
      \ this strategy, weakening the dollar — in other words, making your shirt more\
      \ dirty — does that success depend upon making the rest of the shirts in the hamper\
      \ even dirtier, by threatening the BRICS? I’m sorry, there was maybe too many\
      \ analogies, but is it possible for the U.S. to weaken its dollar without eliminating\
      \ alternatives? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you use the word “predictable.” You can\
      \ predict it, and I can predict it, but suppose you’re working within the Trump\
      \ administration in the Treasury or the State Department. If you were to make\
      \ the predictions within the Trump administration of the sort that you and I make,\
      \ you would be told that you’re not on the team. “This is not a prediction that\
      \ is helpful for us. Could you rethink your prediction?” Or if you say the U.S.\
      \ is going to lose, the boss will say, “Is there some reason that you want the\
      \ U.S. to lose? Do you have some prejudice leading you to want the U.S. to lose?\
      \ Why would you look at ways in which the U.S. could lose? You’ve got to get on\
      \ our team.” So, even if somebody could think to themselves, and go through the\
      \ logic that you and I, and your other guests, have been describing on your program,\
      \ this is not a plan for job advancement within the U.S. administrative bureaucracy.\
      \ So, Trump has emerged as such a bully, with such vindictiveness against people\
      \ who criticize him, that there isn’t really an alternative voice by people saying,\
      \ “Well, what if this doesn’t work?” Or: “What are the possible shortcomings?\
      \ What could go wrong with all of this?” So, I think much of what is happening\
      \ is, to use the words that the New York Times begins almost every article with,\
      \ “Nobody could have expected…,” “To everyone’s surprise…” To their tunnel-visioned\
      \ reporters: Who possibly could have expected the tariff plan and the economic\
      \ plan and the budget plan to go so wrong? Well, it does go wrong, and it shouldn’t\
      \ have been hard to see, if you take into account other countries acting in their\
      \ own self-interest in response to what the Trump administration and the Americans\
      \ do. But the Americans… it’s as if everything Trump does is thinking, well, here’s\
      \ what we will do — and other countries really don’t have a chance to respond\
      \ because if they do, we’ll just impose sanctions on them, punishing rules — we’ll\
      \ hurt them in one way or another. That’s the only thing that Trump and the U.S.\
      \ foreign policy, in general, have to offer: “We will hurt other countries that\
      \ take steps that do not conform to the American policy of unipolar control that\
      \ we want.” And I guess that’s called hubris. GLENN DIESEN: Yeah, I always make\
      \ the point that this is such a temporary strategy because you can, of course,\
      \ threaten someone not to diversify away from dependence on you. But again, when\
      \ the weapon you use to threaten is their dependence on you over time, it’s a\
      \ little bit like BRICS, you know. If BRICS de-dollarizes, America will punish\
      \ all the members of BRICS. But, of course, you don’t want to be too dependent\
      \ on the United States. So, I think this was already from the 90s predicted as\
      \ how unipolarity, or global primacy, would end. That is, the more the declining\
      \ hegemon would be required to use its administrative control over the international\
      \ economy more aggressively to prevent the rise of competing centers of power.\
      \ But when the declining hegemon uses — or abuses — its privileged position in\
      \ the international system, it would only create incentives for the rest of the\
      \ world to begin to diversify away from the declining hegemon, and even collectively\
      \ balance it. So this is why I always thought it would be a good idea for the\
      \ United States to accommodate, in some way, to have a preferable position in\
      \ a more multipolar economic system. But those hopes, of course, they’re long\
      \ gone by now, I think. But it would have been much more beneficial, I think.\
      \ Once you develop an adversarial relationship between the U.S. and China, the\
      \ US loses, China loses, and eventually the world loses as well. But on that topic\
      \ of China, it doesn’t seem like everything is only Trump on this issue. That\
      \ is, a lot of the policies of Trump, of course– MICHAEL HUDSON: Before you ask\
      \ the China policies… I want to comment on what you just said. Here’s the problem.\
      \ Trump really believes that other countries are individually dependent on the\
      \ United States and, as he says, desperate to make a deal. He said that Russia’s\
      \ economy is falling apart because of the efforts of war, it’s in a stalemate\
      \ and it’s desperate to make a deal to rescue Putin from this strain. This was\
      \ the theory that the Rand Corporation wrote up at the beginning of the NATO war\
      \ against Russia a few years ago. And Trump really believes that the war has depleted\
      \ Russia and it’s desperate for a deal. Before he renegotiated the tariffs with\
      \ China, he said China is desperate to make a deal with us. Look at the unemployment\
      \ that its exporters are having, now that we’ve closed the U.S. market to its\
      \ toys and dolls, and all of the other things that he talked about for China.\
      \ It’s as if he thinks it’s desperate, whereas China’s growing way ahead and the\
      \ American economy is shrinking. And the same thing with Europe and the global\
      \ south countries. He believes that other countries need the U.S. market and they\
      \ do not have an alternative. This is like Margaret Thatcher used to say: “There\
      \ is no alternative.” Well, of course there’s an alternative and they’re looking\
      \ for it. You mentioned de-dollarization briefly. I think right now it’s very\
      \ hard for Japan, China, and other countries, to actually begin reducing the dollars\
      \ that they already have. It looks like they’ve held their dollar holdings fairly\
      \ rapidly. However, they are not going to accumulate any more dollars. That has\
      \ tapered off and the new balance-of-payment surpluses that they’re making, they\
      \ are not recycling to the U.S. Treasury. They’re either buying gold, or they’re\
      \ investing in each other, in one way or another, making loans or currency swaps.\
      \ But it is obvious that, while they say, well, we’ve been on the hook in the\
      \ past because we did need the U.S. economy, but it doesn’t look now like the\
      \ U..S economy is going to be growing very much and offering either trade opportunities\
      \ or investment opportunities. So, what do we need dollars for except to hold\
      \ our savings? And if we hold our savings in them, the value of dollar-denominated\
      \ savings in euros, or yen, or other currencies, is going to be down. So, it’s\
      \ not only that other countries do not need the U.S. market, they see that there\
      \ isn’t any there, there. There isn’t any U.S. market to have hopes of developing.\
      \ That applies not only to China, but to Russia, the BRICS, Europe, to all the\
      \ other countries. I think they’re all in a similar reaction: How are we going\
      \ to replace our former dependence on the United States now that essentially we\
      \ don’t have the U.S. market or the U.S. economy as an investment vehicle anymore?\
      \ How do we go it alone? GLENN DIESEN: It’s the bubbles which form, in terms of\
      \ no criticism of the economic decisions. It’s something deeply concerning though,\
      \ but this goes a little bit outside the realm of economics. I notice the same.\
      \ China obviously can diversify away from the United States, they can’t be able\
      \ to pressure them. Then you’re often told, “Well, that’s what the Chinese want\
      \ you to think, so you’re supporting them.” Same with the Russian side, arguing\
      \ they can diversify with our sanctions. We can’t diversify from them. That’s\
      \ what Putin says. As if your loyalty depends on joining their delusions about\
      \ where the economic power lies. I very much agree that Trump, to a large extent,\
      \ launched this economic war under his first presidency. But it’s also true that\
      \ Biden really doubled down in terms of banning the chips, which again, was sort\
      \ of a clear signal to China, that we’re prepared to try to destroy your economy,\
      \ we won’t accept your further growth. This is quite dramatic. Again, the message\
      \ hasn’t been lost on the Chinese. I know Trump tries to balance it off now: “I\
      \ love China,” you know, before he goes on bashing them. But this is only what\
      \ Trump has said. How much do people overestimate in the U.S. how much the world\
      \ dislikes China? Because it seems that it’s often treated as USSR 2.0. But again,\
      \ the way I hear often Washington speak about China, I don’t hear this language\
      \ anywhere else, even in Europe, which tends to repeat whatever Washington says\
      \ on the Chinese issue. They’re much more soft-spoken. To what extent, do you\
      \ think, the U.S. overestimates or assumes that the world shares all their hatred\
      \ of China? Maybe hatred is not the right word, but this distaste for China. MICHAEL\
      \ HUDSON: Well, when you say what does the U.S. think, it at all depends who you’re\
      \ talking to. Suppose you’re talking to NVIDIA, the chip maker, you can see that\
      \ the attempt by Biden to block NVIDIA’s export of chips to China has led NVIDIA’s\
      \ leader Huang to say, “Well, we’ve just been deprived of one-third of our market,\
      \ which is in China. If we do not have the Chinese market to sell our chips to,\
      \ because they’re being blocked, two things will happen. Number one, they will\
      \ develop their own chips. That’s the effect of sanctions. When you sanction a\
      \ country, it doesn’t just suffer and go without your sanctioning. It always develops\
      \ its own attempt to be self-reliant in whatever is sanctioned against. Russia,\
      \ when it was sanctioned against agriculture, developed its own vegetables and\
      \ dairy industry. China’s doing the same. China was forewarned years ago about\
      \ the Biden strategy, which — you’re right — Trump is continuing and China already\
      \ took steps to begin developing independence for its own key industries. Also,\
      \ how do they themselves achieve a monopoly power of control that, if anything,\
      \ it’s the United States and other countries that are dependent on China for rare\
      \ earth magnet materials, for all sorts of electronics and chips, and all the\
      \ things that we’re reading about. The administration, as we discussed earlier\
      \ in the show, imagines: We will take an action, and other countries, China does\
      \ not have a response. But, of course, China has a response. Number one, it is\
      \ trying to redirect its exports to other countries. It may not be exporting dolls\
      \ or toys to the United States, but it has labor in assembly lines. You can see\
      \ that the party leaders and the industrialists are thinking, what can we use\
      \ this labor for if not to make handicraft and industrial exports to the United\
      \ States? Well, they’ll see what other countries need for their development. And\
      \ they want to develop the internal market. One of the problems that China had\
      \ with its internal market was when you provide more money to the wage-earners,\
      \ either they save it up for their retirement, meaning supporting their families,\
      \ when their families get older. Or they bought cars. The first thing that a family\
      \ would do to increase its economic status through consumption was to buy a car.\
      \ So, China seems to have, if anything, too many cars. It’s very difficult to\
      \ drive a car in Beijing, or other Chinese cities. China’s response was to say,\
      \ “All right, we’re going to develop such a good public transportation system\
      \ that people will not need cars.” They have a wonderful subway system, and, of\
      \ course, they have the high-speed trains among cities. They’re trying to provide\
      \ an alternative for that. But China’s trying to think, “What can we give our\
      \ own population, with all this labor, that they need? If not our own population,\
      \ populations in our neighboring countries have to do.” They are planning to retool\
      \ their factories in accordance with whatever trade arrangements they can make\
      \ with neighboring countries, with the global south countries, and other countries.\
      \ They have enough dollar reserves and other foreign reserves available that they\
      \ can afford to take an interruption in their trade balance and other investment\
      \ balances. They can afford the time to just wait out the nine months — or I guess\
      \ it’s three months now that Trump has said he’s going to negotiate with other\
      \ countries trade deals, where any trade deal he makes with any country, starting\
      \ with England a week ago, is the country has to agree not to trade and invest\
      \ with China. The country has to agree to join the American alliance and try to\
      \ isolate the Chinese economy. Well, what this means for England and Europe is\
      \ they isolate themselves from contact with the Chinese economy, and they give\
      \ up the most rapidly growing market in the world East Asia in order to tie their\
      \ trade and investment future with the shrinking market of the United States and\
      \ its European and other satellite economies. This is a deal that is not in the\
      \ interest of most of the European population, but it may be in the personal political\
      \ interest of leaders like Starmer in England who owe their position to the American\
      \ meddling in the English and the European political processes to promote the\
      \ leaders that support a unipolar American world, not independence for their own\
      \ countries and their own voters. GLENN DIESEN: I think this effort to pressure\
      \ countries into a new bloc politics, that is, us versus them, it so strongly\
      \ goes against the interests of all countries though, because real opportunities,\
      \ when you have many centers of power, as you see from countries across the world,\
      \ their aspiration is to diversify their economic dependencies so they don’t become\
      \ excessively dependent on the U.S. So, if they fall into this U.S… “Agreed, we’ll\
      \ cut ourselves off from the Chinese, depend only on the U.S.,” then these countries\
      \ will be owned by the United States. As you said, during the Cold War, it would\
      \ be one thing if you were linked to the undisputable dominant economy. But these\
      \ days, as you said, to link yourself to the losing horse and cut yourself off\
      \ from the rest of the world is not ideal. I guess this also where China has some\
      \ advantage because it’s also not imposing ultimatums on countries. China hasn’t\
      \ really told any country that either you’re in a trading relationship with us\
      \ or America, you can’t choose. It just seems as if this would be a losing bet.\
      \ Is it the assumption that they’re living still in the past, still the 70s or\
      \ 80s? It’s evidently where this comes from. It was my last question, about the\
      \ actual alternative which might appear. Often BRICS is presented as the main\
      \ institution which could facilitate a different economic architecture. Of course,\
      \ it has its problems — a common currency, I don’t see as possible, for example.\
      \ What do you see in the potential of BRICS? Or do you think it’s already had\
      \ its day in the sun? MICHAEL HUDSON: The distinguishing feature of what Trump\
      \ has done in the last few months is irreversible. “He has now changed the world\
      \ in a way that it cannot go back. I don’t think Trump realized this. His mode\
      \ of negotiation was to make a big threat: “We’re going to do this. The threat\
      \ is to cause chaos in other countries, trade and investment.” Then he said, “Well,\
      \ that’s what I’m asking. Let’s hit somewhere in the middle. Let’s compromise.\
      \ We’ll work back from there.” His threats are meant to frighten people into:\
      \ “What are we going to do?” Then they’ll feel, “Oh, at least we made Trump back\
      \ down.” When he knows that the demands he’s making at the very beginning are\
      \ the opening position. That’s how real estate dealers deal: “We’ll offer a low\
      \ price for the building. You want a high price.” And then they settle in the\
      \ middle. That’s not how international diplomacy works. Other countries have realized\
      \ that Trump is actually quite serious in imposing chaos on other countries if\
      \ they don’t surrender their policy, basically. They now realize that they must\
      \ have an alternative, that they’re not going to be able to go back to the world\
      \ as it was a few months ago before ‘Liberation Day.’ Reversibility has led them\
      \ to talk together. I’ve talked to quite a few people associated with the BRICS\
      \ movement. The problem is, what is their program going to be? You need to have\
      \ a strategy. How are you going to reorganize your trade and investment? They\
      \ really don’t have a doctrine like classical political economy in the 19th century.\
      \ Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, was all a plan: How do we develop England, Britain,\
      \ as an industrial power? Well, we have to get rid of the landlord class. Well,\
      \ we have to get rid of monopolies. The Germans said, “Well, we have to move banking\
      \ away from usury-type banking. We have to use banking to industrialize the economy.”\
      \ Classical economics was their plan forward. The BRICS don’t have a similar doctrine\
      \ of how to go forward in trade. One problem, I’m told, is that most of the economists\
      \ they hire to come up with a trade and investment plan, are American-trained\
      \ economists, who are not trained in terms of an alternative to neoliberalism!\
      \ That’s what American academic economics is all about these days. It is itself\
      \ sort of tunnel-visioned. And there’s been nothing so far by the BRICS countries\
      \ that is a whole doctrine of how are they going to develop. Not even an analysis\
      \ of what made China able to grow so fast and modernize its economy and raise\
      \ its living standards, so fast. Well, the key, to me, that China has done is\
      \ it’s followed the original strategy of industrial capitalism in creating a mixed\
      \ economy, a public-private economy. And the role of the public sector was to\
      \ prevent monopolies from increasing prices and making the economy less competitive.\
      \ And they did this by keeping transportation, communications, education in the\
      \ public domain, and as the American economists explained in the 1890s, the role\
      \ of public investment is a fourth factor of production. But it doesn’t aim at\
      \ making a profit. The purpose of public investment in infrastructure is to provide\
      \ its services either freely, or at least on a subsidized basis, or at cost. You\
      \ don’t want to privatize natural monopolies, like transportation and communication,\
      \ because if you do, the private owners are going to charge monopoly rents and\
      \ they’re going to load down these monopolies with private sector costs that governments\
      \ don’t have and they’re going to charge such high prices that your economy, if\
      \ it’s privatized, is going to end up like Margaret Thatcher’s England. Instead\
      \ of like the United States was in the late 19th and early 20th century with a\
      \ wonderful infrastructure supplying services at low prices that enabled American\
      \ industry to undersell other countries because American industrial employers\
      \ did not have to pay their labor force enough money to afford buying monopoly\
      \ goods, or paying high housing rents as they do today, or having to pay high\
      \ debt service as they do today. Well, I haven’t seen any BRICS discussion about\
      \ what is it that made the United States, Germany, other countries, right down\
      \ the China, so much more economically efficient that they got rid of the economic\
      \ overhead. And the answer, if you’re a classical economist, is they freed their\
      \ economies from economic rent. They tried to free them from land rent, they freed\
      \ them from monopoly rent, and they freed them from the financial overhead of\
      \ credit. China has kept its money creation and banking system basically in public\
      \ hands. And that means that China does not have a domestic financial sector that\
      \ makes its money by financial means instead of by funding, creating money to\
      \ actually finance direct investment in everything, from real estate to railroads\
      \ to other infrastructure. Well, this is what Germany did in the late 19th century.\
      \ In many ways it’s what the United States did. There’s been no discussion of\
      \ why the industrial leaders of the world a century ago became so successful that\
      \ they turned their industrial trade surplus into a financial surplus to become\
      \ the leading creditor nations, as well as the leading industrial nations. There’s\
      \ been no discussion of value and price theory that was the key to classical economics.\
      \ Price was the excess of charges over and above value, and the difference was\
      \ rent. Rent was in addition to the cost of production. Land rent was made by\
      \ landlords in their sleep, as John Stuart Mill said. The same thing with financial\
      \ investors: they collect interest in their sleep. The objective of China that\
      \ calls itself “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” you could say it’s industrial\
      \ capitalism with Chinese characteristics. And that is because industrial capitalism\
      \ from Britain to Germany to the United States was evolving into socialism. The\
      \ public investment that Europe and the United States made in infrastructure is\
      \ what today would be called socialized transportation, socialized education,\
      \ socialized whatever you’re doing. And the idea of this socialized public investment\
      \ was required by the industrial capitalists because it lowered their wages cost,\
      \ it lowered their cost-to-production, and it created a low-cost economy and low-priced\
      \ economy because it was a rent-free economy enabling them to undersell other\
      \ countries. Well, I don’t see any movement among the BRICS countries to say,\
      \ well, we can’t really develop if we have an American- and European-owned banking\
      \ interest that seeks to make financial profits from our industrialization. We\
      \ want the financial returns to be recycled into new tangible investment to increase\
      \ capital formation, factories and education and public services and living standards,\
      \ just like the West did, and just like China’s done. I haven’t seen any statement\
      \ like that, and that’s because I think the economists in the BRICS have not studied\
      \ classical economics. There was a counter-revolution, a century ago, against\
      \ classical economics led in America by John Bates Clark and in Europe by the\
      \ Austrians, British utility theorists, saying, there’s no such thing as economic\
      \ rent. Everybody deserves whatever income and wealth they have. There’s no unearned\
      \ income. The landlord plays a productive role. If you look at the American gross\
      \ domestic product statistics, most of America’s GDP isn’t really product at all.\
      \ It includes interest charges, including late fees. That’s considered as a profit,\
      \ if you’re behind in your payments to a bank and you’re charged a late fee, and\
      \ end up paying 29%. That’s a profit. Land rent is considered a productive service.\
      \ Monopoly rents are included as production. The whole idea of how do we make\
      \ our GDP grow, if you’re a BRICS country and you don’t make a distinction within\
      \ GDP — what’s really a product and what is not a product — then you’re not going\
      \ to have the guidelines that the Chinese followed, and before them, the American\
      \ industrialists, the German industrialists, the French and everyone else. That’s\
      \ the problem. They’re trying to reinvent the wheel without realizing that a lot\
      \ of the theoretical work was already done in the 19th century with the original\
      \ emergence of industrial capitalism and classic economics as its doctrine to\
      \ guide how to become a competitive industrial nation. That kind of discussion,\
      \ I don’t see happening today. GLENN DIESEN: It’s something I was missing too.\
      \ I was hoping for more of an economic discussion within BRICS about to what extent,\

    one_sentence_summary: In a discussion between Glenn Diesen and economist Michael
      Hudson, they explore the complexities of Donald Trump's stance on foreign policy,
      highlighting his criticism of perpetual wars and NATO's role in the Ukraine conflict,
      while questioning whether his motivations are genuinely rooted in peace or driven
      by financial considerations.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent discussion, economist Michael Hudson and host Glenn
      Diesen examined Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy, particularly his self-portrayal
      as a peace president. While Trump has criticized prolonged military engagements,
      such as the Iraq War and NATO's role in the Ukraine conflict, Hudson suggests
      that Trump's motivations may not be rooted in a genuine desire for peace but rather
      in seeking a better financial return on military investments. Hudson argues that
      Trump's proposed peace plans often involve terms that favor NATO and escalate
      conflicts, such as suggesting that Russia surrender or advocating for extreme
      measures in Gaza and Iran. This raises questions about whether Trump truly aims
      to reduce U.S. military involvement or simply wants to reshape it for economic
      gain.

    text: 'Dialogue Works: 2025.05.15 NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody. Today is Thursday,
      May 15, 2025, and our friend Michael Hudson is back with us. Welcome back, Michael.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Good to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, let’s talk about what’s
      going on between the United States and the United Kingdom. In your opinion, how
      is Britain being used by the United States today in a similar way to its role
      in 1944 during the creation of the IMF and World Bank? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it’s
      pretty much exactly the same role. In 1944, the United States was planning, how
      do we create a post-war order that benefits itself? And its number one aim was
      to dissolve the British Empire and the French Empire by making rules that benefited
      the United States. For instance, the end of empire preference and basing the financial
      system on gold and especially countering John Maynard Keynes, who saw the problems
      that were going to develop over the next 50 years. He said that the problem is
      going to be that the United States is going to be a creditor country. It’s going
      to get other countries in debt to itself. They’re going to like England, especially.
      And we want a kind of rules that if there’s one country that continues to run
      surpluses and in other countries that run deficits, we have to say, okay, America
      is not letting England earn the dollars to pay the debts that the United States
      has forced it into with the British loan in 1944. And I’ve described all that
      in Super Imperialism and there were wonderful debates in the House of Lords and
      the House of Commons. And they basically, the tenor of their comments was, we
      don’t have any choice. We’re completely dependent on the United States. We just
      have to knuckle under. And so Keynes’s rules were turned down and England agreed
      to rules that became the post-war economic order benefiting the United States
      in creating the IMF and the World Bank along lines that benefited itself at the
      expense of other countries. Well, what the United States then did was go to continental
      Europe and say, well, look, we’ve done this with England. That’s the prototype.
      There was an inertia and England was always the first to sell out Europe and other
      countries to surrender to the United States. And the US would take its surrender
      and use that negotiation to set the rules that other countries were supposed to
      join. Well, that’s just what happened in the last few days. The United States
      went to England and made it, it agreed, without mentioning China specifically,
      it agreed on trade rules that were national security rules, meaning anything that
      China exported to England that could be national security, like cloth that could
      be used for army uniforms, anything that would be banned. And basically, Trump
      had already announced pretty much what he was going to do on Liberation Day on
      April 2nd. He said, we’re going to impose these tariffs on other countries. He
      didn’t say this is going to create chaos there, but we’re going to give him a
      choice. What he said was, of course, we can roll the tariffs back down if they
      give givebacks. And the givebacks were what American policies were they going
      to accept. And the acceptance were pretty much exactly what England has just agreed
      to. So it’s obvious that Trump did not really expect this whole tariff issue to
      be about tariffs. He made it very clear the tariff issue is about forcing other
      countries to join our Cold War against Russia and China, especially China, for
      all of that. And that is basically what these rules are about. And the same thing
      you have Germany now joining England under Mr. Merz. So the problem for other
      countries is, are they going to avoid this short-term crisis, this short-term
      disruption in their trade that Trump has caused by reorienting their trade away
      from Russia, away from China, and away from their allies in East Asia? Or are
      they going to decide, well, the U.S. economy is shrinking, and it’s shrinking
      especially, we can discuss that, because of the actions that Trump has taken,
      he’s guaranteed we’re moving into a recession here. If other countries surrender
      to him and agree to his terms to tie their trade and investment to a shrinking
      U.S. economy, then they’re going to have to sacrifice not trading with Russia,
      China, and the global majority that’s growing instead of shrinking. Well, the
      whole problem for other countries is, what do we mean when we say another country?
      We usually mean what their leaders are going to say, and Starmer in England and
      Merz in Germany really do not represent what their voters want. And we know that
      because of all of the protests by the voters against Starmer, the Labour Party
      is now at the lowest ebb that it’s ever pulled before. And same thing for the
      Christian Democrats in Germany, the Germans don’t want Merz and the anti-Russian
      re-militarization that he wants, but the United States has promoted people like
      Starmer and Merz to be the heads of their countries. So you have a strange condition
      that the leaders of countries that America deals with first are representing U.S.
      interests or being willing to go along. They believe that their personal careers
      will continue to be linked to the United States, just as the U.S. was promoting
      them from the very beginning along U.S. ideological and political lines. So that’s
      basically what’s happening. Other countries are being asked to sacrifice themselves
      to the U.S. economy. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, you mentioned the national security
      of the United States. How do you see the strategic goal behind the United States
      invoking national security clauses in trade negotiations, particularly in relation
      to China? MICHAEL HUDSON: National security means anything that you want it to.
      It’s a portmanteau word, as linguists say. It can mean anything can be national
      security. You see the United States wanting to close down Harvard and other universities
      on the grounds of national security that its students protest against war and
      genocide. That’s a national security threat. You see him arresting immigrants
      on the grounds that it’s national security. Anything can be national security.
      So all the United States has to say is X, Y, or Z trade with Russia or China threatens
      our national security because China wants to export something that we want to
      export instead. Or China wants to import something from Europe like etching machinery
      for computer chips that it can use militarily. And so essentially it means that
      the United States has completely arbitrary dictatorship in deciding what other
      countries can do. It means that we now are aiming at a centrally planned economy
      planned by the U.S. military and the deep state in preparation for escalating
      cold war against Russia and China. That’s what it means. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael,
      what choice do countries face between aligning with the United States and turning
      toward China, China’s more dynamic market, if we can put it that way? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, if they’re not allowed to trade with China, what can they do? They’re
      not able to earn enough foreign trade returns to remain solvent. And the main
      victims in all of this are the global south countries in particular. They’re already
      having difficulty paying their foreign debts. They’re falling into arrears. The
      bonds of Latin American and other global south countries are falling in price
      because they’re really risky. And so here’s basically the problem. And there’s
      a solution that they have. The problem is that if they increase their taxes to
      somehow throw their currency on the foreign exchange market to try to raise the
      dollars to pay the bondholders that hold dollar-denominated debts, then they’re
      not going to have enough money for the governments to invest in domestic infrastructure
      or to promote just social programs. They will have to do to themselves what Trump
      and Musk and the Republicans are doing to the United States, cutting back social
      programs, cutting back research and development, squeezing out the economy by
      imposing austerity to pay the bondholders. And in other words, countries and their
      leaders, or elected leaders, are going to have to put the interest of foreign
      countries over their own national interest. Well, that’s a loss of sovereignty.
      You’d think that the definition of sovereignty is to permit sovereign countries
      to decide how to run their own tax and monetary system to promote their own economic
      development. But if they’re prevented from doing this now, then what to do? Well,
      what Trump has done is given them a godsend in all of this. There was already
      talk about, are we going to be back in the situation we were in the 1980s, after
      Mexico defaulted on its Tesobonos, and you had the Latin American countries declaring
      insolvency. You then had the Brady plan come in and wrote down their debts to
      something that was payable, but it was a lost decade for Latin America. And the
      International Monetary Fund, basically an arm of the U.S. military, used its loan
      capacity to support right-wing leaders supported by the United States and to withdraw
      support from countries with leaders who U.S. foreign policy did not find congenial
      to American foreign policy. So the countries can now say, well, there was an implicit
      moral contract in international trade, and this was exactly what Keynes had spoken
      about in 1944. Keynes had been one of the, probably the leading economists during
      the German reparations debate, saying that if the allies insist in getting reparations
      debts to pay the United States, the United States has to permit Germany to earn
      the money by exporting to the United States. But the United States Congress said,
      well, wait a minute, we don’t want the debtors to earn money to pay us by competing
      with U.S. industry. So they passed a law about trade with countries with depreciating
      currencies, meaning a floating tariff that would go up to erase any currency advantage
      that Germany or other allied debtors had trying to raise the money to export to
      pay their foreign debts. Well, Keynes said, you have to wipe out the Versailles
      reparations debts and the inter-allied debts that were supposed to be paid out
      of German reparations to the United States for arms that the allies fought before
      America had entered World War I. Well, the same moral argument that was discussed
      all during the 1920s has just reappeared today. Global South countries can say,
      Trump’s tariffs have prevented us from earning the money to earn the dollars to
      pay the bondholders that have U.S. dollars. We can’t pay them, so we’re going
      to need exactly what happened to the world in 1931 when there was a moratorium
      on German reparations and inter-allied debts or in the 1980s when you had the
      Brady plans come in. They have an opportunity to suspend debt payments, and what
      that’s going to do is force the United States to make a choice. You’re going to
      have the bondholders do what they tried to do to Argentina in the last few decades.
      They’ll say, well, if you default on a foreign debt, we get to treat you like
      we treated Venezuela or Argentina or Iran. We get to grab whatever assets you
      have here. We can grab, if you have government investments in the United States,
      we can grab them. We can grab your gold. We can grab your military ships when
      they travel abroad as the Americans tried to grab an Argentinian ship when it
      visited a friendly African port. So, other countries literally will face a force
      majeure of the U.S. trying to grab their assets in the same way that the United
      States and Europe grabbed Russia’s $300 billion of assets. What can they do? All
      they can do is join together and say, well, if you grab, this is morally wrong,
      and you have not let us write the rules of international finance and international
      trade in a way that benefit us, not you. You, the United States, changed the rules
      in 1971 away from gold. You’re changing the rules today under President Trump
      unilaterally. But you’re 1% of the population, or 15% when you add all Europe
      and everyone in. We’re going to have to create a whole alternative economic order.
      And if you grab our assets, we get to grab all of your foreign investments in
      our countries. And finally, we’ll just sort of leave existing assets in place,
      and every country gets to keep what assets are in their own country. The U.S.
      gets to grab foreign assets of debtor countries that it’s prevented from paying
      their debts. The global swath and global maturity will together take control of
      America’s mining investments abroad, oil investments abroad, any assets they have
      abroad. They will take US banks under their own national control and turn them
      into public utilities, much like China’s central bank. You’ll have the opportunity,
      tailor-made, to create their own monetary order. Well, all you need for this is
      an idea of what will this order look like. They have to actually have a plan.
      That’s the only thing that’s missing right now. They need a plan, and they need
      the reality that they can call America’s bluff. They can say, okay, you know,
      we’re not going to sign an agreement like the agreement that England signed and
      that Germany is going to sign as a surrender. We’re going to say, okay, we’re
      going to say, okay, leave your 80% tariffs on Bangladesh and other countries,
      leave your 40% tariffs on us. We can’t pay, we’re now maybe at the BRICS meeting
      that’s coming up next month, we’re going to lay out the plans for a new international
      economic order, such as we actually have wanted to do ever since the Bandung Conference
      in Indonesia in 1974 of non-aligned countries and its sequence conferences. So
      you can have these non-aligned countries align with each other in mutual aid now
      that they have enough variety, enough of a full-spectrum range of production and
      money among themselves that they can afford to go it alone. They could never afford
      to go it alone before, but now they can. So all they have to do is realize their
      position of strength. Well, everyone realizes this except economists who said,
      well, you have to conform to the market and the market is just what America has
      designed. The market isn’t natural. It’s designed in the United States for the
      United States to benefit the United States at your expense or, as Donald Trump
      says, to make us winners and you losers. So the question is, how are we going
      to get the global majority to actually act on this wonderful opportunity and create
      this new international economic order that is independent and finally gets rid
      of the fact that debts cannot be paid without sacrificing their own growth so
      that you finally leave countries with their own natural resources free of American
      owners that do not pay taxes on these? And to use these natural resources, land
      rents, monopoly rents, monopoly rents from the public utilities and infrastructure
      that American companies have bought. They can now use all of these economic rents
      to finance their own capital investment and begin to develop along the same lines
      that America, Germany, other countries developed in the 19th century, for their
      industrial takeoff. That’s the potential. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, with what
      you’ve said, considering all the information that you’ve given to us, do you believe
      that Trump’s plan is not actually to re-industrialize the United States, but rather
      to dismantle it? MICHAEL HUDSON: That’s the effect of what he’s doing. The fact
      is, there’s no way that the United States can re-industrialize for a number of
      reasons. There are preconditions that you need to re-industrialize. The most obvious
      thing you need in America to re-industrialize, you need labor. But there’s America
      doesn’t have the labor force to work in industry because nobody wants to work
      in industry, because the pay rates are so low for very hard factory work jobs,
      blue-collar labor, that it’s only 35 cents an hour more than being a waiter or
      a service industry person or a stacker in an Amazon warehouse. So, white people
      don’t want to work in manual labor. In the past, this manual labor was done very
      largely by immigrants. But Trump doesn’t want immigrants, so you have the immigrant
      labor not available to do this. In the past, there was a black labor who moved
      up from the south to become the industrial labor and the unionized labor. But
      in order to work in industry, you actually need some kind of training. And that’s
      why, for many years, America had a highly developed vocational school system,
      just as Germany did during its industrial takeoff. Very, very good training of
      workmen and industrialists and factory jobs. But that has not been the case in
      the United States. We’ve shifted away from science and engineering and mathematics
      and industrialization generally into more, I’m not sure how to characterize what
      they’re studying, but it’s not industrial. So, you’ve had this class war in the
      United States against unionized labor, mainly industrial labor, by offshoring.
      And that offshoring of industry has indeed led to very little demand for industrial
      labor. So, hardly by surprise, there isn’t an industrial labor force anymore.
      Well, the other thing you need, suppose you had this labor, you need raw materials
      like steel and aluminum, because almost any manufactured good is made out of steel
      and aluminum. Well, what Trump has done is the reverse of what protective tariffs
      are supposed to do. The whole strategy of Britain, of the United States, was we
      want to import low priced raw materials from other countries, and we want them
      all to compete with each other, supplying us with crops and metals and mineral
      products. And then we will monopolize ourselves industrial production, and that’s
      where the value added is. So, our labor can exchange for much more labor of raw
      materials that produce these countries. Well, what Trump has done is essentially
      going to the few unions that are left, like the steel workers. And he said, “You
      know, I want union votes.” He trotted out a steel worker who said, “This is a
      wonderful tariff.” You know, we’re certainly going to vote for Trump. But the
      rest of industry, what Trump’s tariff means is that American manufacturers are
      going to have to pay much more of a world — there’s a common world price for all
      raw materials, but Americans are going to have to pay more than their European
      or Asian counterparts because of Trump’s tariff. So he’s already broken the most
      basic rule of tariff policy. Well, another thing you’re going to need is you’re
      going to need machinery. And most of the machinery. And most of the machinery
      that is used in the United States right down to nuts and bolts and screws. I used
      to know the CEO of a company that made screws and fasteners. And she finally closed
      down her company because she said, “No, we can’t afford to make them anymore.
      Other countries are making them. And imagine there are no more screws made in
      the United States. They’re all imported.” Well, imagine if all of a sudden, with
      the trade barriers, America’s dependent on foreign countries for things that should
      be very easy to make, like screws, but which American industry says, “Well, there’s
      no monopoly profit from high technology and patent rates on all of this.” Trump’s
      plan is to make American exports based on a particular kind of industry. Either
      it’s the computer industry, information technology, or it’s arms, monopolized
      exports that other countries do not produce and are blocked from producing for
      one reason or another. And he hopes that somehow he can get these huge monopoly
      products, prices on selected US sectors and essentially get a free lunch from
      other countries, not producing them. Well, as your other commentators have pointed
      out in the fighting in Ukraine, and elsewhere, the American arms don’t seem to
      work very well. And other countries, even though Trump has just negotiated an
      enormous arms sale to Saudi Arabia, this does not mean that these arms are really
      going to work. I think this is a political idea. And basically, Saudi Arabia’s
      agreed to be a good customer for the US, so that the United States will protect
      its interests and put its Wahhabi terrorists in charge of Syria, so that Saudi
      Arabia can spread Islamic terrorism. and its particular brand of Islam and protect
      it against Iranian or more civilized forms of Islam. So trade doesn’t depend on
      actual usefulness of process anymore. And just in the last few weeks, we’ve seen
      other reasons why America can’t can’t industrialize. Trump has waged war on America’s
      leading universities. He’s said, we’re closing down all research funding for technology,
      for pharmaceuticals, for biology, for everything at universities that permit its
      students to say, we’re against war, and we’re against genocide. That is a threat
      to American security, because genocide is us. War is us. That’s a threat if they’re
      doing that. So he’s essentially trying even to take away the tax exemption of
      Harvard as sort of the first big giant to knock down so he can take over essentially,
      it used to be called fascism, take over the curriculum that Harvard’s allowed
      to teach. It really can’t teach Islamic studies, Near Eastern studies. It’s a
      total control. And not only is the money for university research cuts back, but
      also Trump has deterred foreign students from attending universities. Well, foreign
      students, especially from China and other Asian countries, India, were their profit
      centers because they were the students who paid full tuition of anywhere from
      50,000 to 90,000 a semester for their studies. Well, now they’re not going to
      be coming anymore. You’re going to have a drastic reduction in their coming. They’re
      afraid to come because what if they were to say, we’re against the war? Well,
      out you go. Your student visa is canceled. You don’t get to show up for your final
      tests. And not only that are the students blocked, but so are the graduates. The
      feeling is that many of the students who came to the United States from abroad
      and wanting to specialize in engineering and science and technology stayed in
      the United States. And so the United States had other countries pre-educate and
      all the costs of raising children growing up through college age. And then it
      got the benefit of their coming here. That’s what’s made America so rich ever
      since the early 19th century, the immigration of skilled labor. And Trump is now
      his war on the universities and war on anyone advocating peace is losing this
      whole benefit that the United States has had. So Trump is actually his so-called
      tariff policy and the givebacks that he’s announced saying that these tariffs
      are to help us re-industrialize. That’s just a cover story. They’re not going
      to help America industrialize. What Trump really wanted to do was he imagined
      that somehow other countries were going to surrender to the United States. They
      would continue to export just what they’re exporting now, but they would drastically
      reduce the price of what they charge for their exports. Trump said Americans won’t
      pay the cost of tariffs. Foreign countries will pay the cost of tariffs. Well,
      that was just silly. Of course, Americans have to pay the price of tariffs. Other
      countries are not going to sacrifice because there’s no profit for them. Profits
      are often 10 to 15%. If tariffs are higher than that, you cannot produce export
      goods at a profit. They’ll have to find another market. Well, where are they going
      to find another market if they have to sign a contract with the U.S. saying we’re
      not going to trade with Russia or China for all of this? You can see the noose
      that Trump is tightening around the U.S. economy and the whole Cold War neocon
      plan for everything. There’s very little that they can do. Well, what are other
      countries going to do for all this? They’re not going to export and that means
      that there’s not going to be anywhere near the vast amount of tariff revenue that
      Trump promised would be. Same thing with Elon Musk’s cutbacks of government spending
      at Doge. Many of these are marginal and fictitious. He’s really gone after cultural
      spending on Medicare payments. Payments for the low income classes are basically
      scratched. But there’s not going to be anywhere enough income to make up for the
      tax cuts that the Republicans are now putting this week before Congress renewing
      all of the tax cuts that Trump put before and then some. So the result is everybody
      who’s done a budget analysis sees the American budget is going to go up and up
      and up. And today, the 10-year Treasury bond, the yield is over 4.5%. When the
      bond prices yield go up, the prices go down. People are saying, wait a minute,
      do we really want a 10-year, not to mention a 30-year Treasury bond, if there’s
      such a large budget deficit and so little production taking place, this is going
      to be inflationary. Do we really want to invest our savings? And this includes
      foreign central bank savings and foreign government savings. Do we want to invest
      in the debt of a country whose prices are going to go up and we won’t call it
      hyperinflation, but the price increase will go up, the exchange rate of the dollars
      we have will go down. And Trump has said, we want the exchange rates to go down.
      10%, 20%. Well, I think it was 10% in the Plaza Accords with Japan, way back,
      back in those days. And if you’re losing 10% of your money, and the interest rate
      is only like 4%, you’ve lost two and a half years of interest. And the principal
      value of all of this. So what is the attraction of the United States as an investment
      market and of the dollar as an international reserve currency for foreign central
      banks and means for saving? All of Trump’s actions and its sort of nutty economics
      that really don’t work at all when you do the math and just project the statistical
      trends, you can see that the economy is in a real non-investable for foreign countries.
      So this should act as a kind of catalyst to force them to say, if we don’t act
      together, we’re all going to hang separately, if we don’t hang together, as I
      think the American revolutionists put it. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, Donald Trump
      is threatening to ban Chinese built ships, a large strategy of economic isolation
      and possible self sabotage. How is that in his mind? How is that going to benefit
      the United States? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, an awful lot of trade is in ships done
      in China. The tax rules and the regulatory rules for US ships are so high that
      there are hardly any US ships around. And China and along with, I think, South
      Korea and Japan have developed shipbuilding and created their own market. But
      if you ban Chinese ships from American markets, well, ships often go from one
      country to another. And that means that the whole set of countries that the ships
      go to somehow will be blocked from trade if he does that. So this is another.
      It’s a non-tariff barrier that in many ways is even more of a deal blocker. By
      the way, Trump also is insisting in Panama that American ships do not have to
      pay any fees at all. And Panama had just said American ships have to pay larger
      fees because they’re so big that they require special attention. Trump has insisted
      they have to pay nothing, increasing shipping for all other countries. So not
      only do you have tariff barriers, the whole cost of transportation and foreign
      trade has gone up. Well, in the last few days, the United States has approached
      South Korea and Japan and said, let’s say we need to have a three country agreement
      in building ships. And we’ll call them U.S., You’ll build them, but we’ll put
      a U.S. flag on them so that we can essentially build them. And the question is
      whether South Korea and Japan will do this. Well, I think in the last show we
      discussed Japan that already is thinking, do we really want to tie our future
      to the United States now that it’s blocked our exports? Do we want to think of
      reorienting with China? So the question is if shipping to the United States in
      ships that are not U.S. ships or ships that are either Chinese or have traded
      with China, then that trade is simply stopped. Well, you can see that the trade
      is not really going to stop. It’ll just be redirected away from the United States.
      So once again, Trump in trying to isolate China is ending up isolating himself.
      And the reason he’s gone to South Korea and Japan is somebody told him, you know,
      it takes 10 years to just build a port that is capable of building a ship. They’re
      gigantic for ships. You have to set up a whole system. You have to create an enormous
      forward planning and expensive shipbuilding industry. China, South Korea and Japan
      have already invested the sunk costs in all of these. But now these costs for
      the United States are enormous, especially because we’ve just deported a major
      source of American construction labor. So you can just look at how every act that
      he’s done trying to isolate China has just isolated the United States and cut
      itself off from other countries. Throwing the decision onto other countries about,
      well, now that we have to trade with ourselves, what are the terms and conditions
      and institutions that we’re going to base our own trade with? Well, they’ll need
      a new international monetary fund, a new World Bank, and ultimately a new United
      Nations. Well, speaking of the United Nations, another thing that Trump has cut
      back is health spending. Drastic cutbacks, there’s health and weather. They’ve
      cut back the weather forecasting here. Just when global warming has gone way up
      and extreme weather has increased, stuff threatening American cities. You have
      landslides here. You have flooding every night on the news. All the coping with
      bad weather, that’s cut back and is causing devastation. And these areas on sea
      level is where you’d make the shipping. You’re not going to build shipping in
      the middle of Indiana. You have to build it on the ocean, and that’s exactly where
      you have the rising sea levels. And regarding sea levels, Trump has also pulled
      the United States out of all of the environmental agreements for global warming.
      And also, the Americans are getting very sick. They’ve cut back all of the reporting
      now on COVID and other diseases. There’s no more weekly or monthly reporting on
      the spread of COVID, the tests from the water supply of COVID. So the Americans
      are getting sicker. The lifespan of Americans are going down while almost all
      other countries are going up. Just to add to the problems that every action that
      Trump has taken worsens conditions, certainly for the 90% of the economy. And
      the 90% of the economy is basically responsible for the production in the economy.
      The 10% are rentiers. They live on their stocks and bonds and real estate rents.
      NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, before wrapping up this session, a very important question
      right now when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine to the Middle East. And whenever
      we’re talking about it, it’s the SWIFT system that the United States is using.
      And when they put sanctions on other countries like Russia and Iran, they cannot
      use it. Here is the question, in my opinion. The main question right now for the
      United States and the Trump administration would be, is the attempt to monopolize
      information technology and platforms like SWIFT a sustainable strategy for maintaining
      the United States global influence? MICHAEL HUDSON: Ever since Marco Polo visited
      China and some Catholic priests brought back silkworms to the West, it’s been
      almost impossible for any country to monopolize any technology. The Italian fashion
      designers and Italian technologists were driven out of Italy by essentially the
      dictatorship and the inquisition. The French industrialists were driven out again
      by the Catholic inquisition there to other countries. It’s not possible to prevent
      a technology from developing. And also because technology itself is evolving very
      rapidly and to evolve, you need research and development that in a financialized
      economy like the United States, you’re not going to back research and development
      because that takes development takes time. It takes a couple of years to develop
      something. And if you’re a chief financial officer of a technology company, you’re
      paid by according to how much money you make on the stock of your company. So
      you use your profits for stock buybacks or to pay out dividends to increase the
      stock price, not for research and development. Well, countries that are not financialized,
      like China, don’t have that problem. Countries that do not have a financial class
      that has taken over industry and financialized it to make money financially instead
      of industrially are obviously have an advantage in their developing new technology.
      And that’s why almost weekly now we’re having reports of new Chinese breakthroughs
      and computers and others. In the last month, China’s announced this new kind of
      a block chain system for payments that are made in its currency and currency of
      friendly countries in order to break free of SWIFT. So once you try to protect
      the technology, what you do is force other countries to not only duplicate it,
      but usually because it’s later now than it was when America developed it. Usually
      they’re able to improve it this time around and get an advantage. And so every
      kind of sanction has helped other countries develop their own self-reliance in
      this technology, just as we’ve discussed in the case of Russia and numerous occasions
      on your show before. And that’s exactly what’s happening now. China’s spending
      the money on development, other countries, South Korea, Japan, other countries
      are doing this. The United States hoped somehow that it could have its investment
      banks buy control of these foreign countries industry or buy them out and consolidate
      them into the American parent companies. countries because a lot of this research
      and development is funded by governments there, just as it is here. The governments
      are not willing to let these industries that they funded be sold out to the American
      bankers and turned over to the United States to monopolize at the expense of their
      own domestic economies. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you so much, Michael, for being
      with us today. Great pleasure as always. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it’s really good
      to be here. I wonder. I hope other countries can solve the problems that we’ve
      discussed. I think we’ve shown what’s needed to solve them. I guess that’s for
      future shows. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah, exactly. MICHAEL HUDSON: Thank you. NIMA

    paragraph_summary: In a discussion on May 15, 2025, economist Michael Hudson compares
      the current relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom to their
      historical dynamic during the establishment of the IMF and World Bank in 1944.
      He argues that the U.S. is using Britain in a similar manner today, aiming to
      create a global economic order that primarily benefits American interests while
      undermining British sovereignty. Hudson highlights that, just as in the past,
      the U.S. is imposing financial rules that keep other countries, particularly the
      U.K., in debt and dependent on American economic power. He references John Maynard
      Keynes' concerns about the U.S. becoming a creditor nation and the detrimental
      effects of the post-war economic framework that favored American dominance, illustrating
      a continuity in the U.S.-U.K. relationship over decades.

    text: 'Transcription – 2025.05.22 Michael Hudson: The Secret Pact That Set Off a
      Global Economic FIRESTORM! NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody. Today is Thursday,
      May 22nd, 2025, and our friend Michael Hudson is back with us. Welcome back, Michael.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Good to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, I want to start with
      a (not) new way that the United States is trying to deal with the conflict in
      Ukraine. Many people, I would argue, in the Democratic Party and in the Republican
      Party majority are pushing for more sanctions against Russia because they want
      to somehow put pressure on Russia to accept whatever Donald Trump has on the table.
      Here is what Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, said in terms of the
      sanctions by the Trump administration: [clip start] SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I think
      we will see what happens when both sides get to the table. President Trump has
      made it very clear, that if President Putin does not negotiate in good faith,
      that the United States will not hesitate to up the Russia sanctions, along with
      our European partners. What I can tell you is the sanctions were very ineffective
      during the Biden administration, because they kept them low, because they were
      afraid of pushing up domestic oil prices. [clip end] NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah. The
      sanctions were so weak during the Biden administration. Your take on that, Michael?
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the first error in what they’re saying: These are not anti-Russian
      sanctions. The sanctions are against Europe and against American allies. They’re
      telling Europe, “You must not buy in the cheapest market. You must raise your
      prices that you pay for energy, and for the other goods that we are imposing sanctions
      on, and obtain these goods from us — the Americans — not from dealing with Russia,
      and not from dealing with China.” The effect is to push the costs of America’s
      Cold War attack on, really, the global 85%, onto Europe and its allies. Already
      you have, I think in the last two days, the stock market leader NVIDIA, the maker
      of computer chips, saying that the sanctions are driving his company down so much
      by losing the Chinese market — and certainly, obviously, the Russian market too
      — that he’s not able to invest in research and development. He’s moving his offices
      to Asia. He’s starting a Shanghai office. So the sanctions are also against American
      producers. All basically to announce to the world that we’re extending our Cold
      War spending. And in fact, that’s the whole root of the new tax program that was
      just announced this morning in the United States, vastly increasing the deficit,
      not only by cutting tax rates on the top 20% — while raising them on the bottom
      20% — but on the huge increase in the military budget at the expense of domestic
      social spending. The American is going on a war economy. And Trump, in effect,
      has said, “This is my war. This is my class war. It’s not the Biden war. It’s
      my war against Russia with these sanctions. It’s my war against China. It’s my
      war against Gaza. It’s my war that we’re planning against Iran. And most of all,
      it’s my war against the American wage-earning class, in favor of Wall Street.”
      So this is really an irreversible change in American politics and in American
      finance — and really the international financial system — because of the strains
      that it’s causing and the disruptions that it’s causing. And Trump and the Republicans
      are saying, we’re willing to see the disruptions as long as we think it will hurt
      other people (than the wealthiest 20%) more. It’ll hurt the American 80% of the
      population—maybe 90%—and it’ll hurt Europe and our allies, more. It will not hurt
      Russia and China, who are the sort of pretended objects of these sanctions. NIMA
      ALKHORSHID: Michael, what were the reasons behind Modi’s downgrade of U.S. Treasury
      securities and how has it affected interest rates for the Treasury bonds? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, the downgrade basically was ideological, not economic. The effect,
      of course, was to create a panic. And now you’ve had, in the last few days, the
      yield on 10-year Treasury bonds going for 4.5%. Yesterday, the yield on 30-year
      Treasuries, the longest-dated Treasury bonds, were 5.04%. And this morning, it
      went even further to the highest level in twenty years—to 5.15%. This is basically
      a crisis level. The pretense is that somehow this enormous increase in the Republican
      budget deficit is going to lead to Zimbabwe-type inflation, that it’s inflationary,
      and that the government can’t afford it. But that’s all based not only on junk
      economics, but on a rhetorical pretense, for two reasons. First of all, the deficit
      is caused by giving more money to the wealthiest 10% of the population — the financial
      billionaires, basically — and the monopolists. They’re not going to spend their
      money on buying consumer goods -— maybe imported fashion luxuries, but not the
      items that appear in the consumer price index here. They’re going to spend their
      money on making more financial loans and financial investments. That’s deflationary,
      not inflationary. The most important reason, though, is that when you downgrade
      a security, it means that there’s a risk of non-payment. There’s a payment risk,
      a solvency risk. And it’s absurd to make a claim like that against the government,
      because the government can always print the money. That’s how it paid for the
      Civil War—with the Greenbacks. That’s how America paid for the Revolutionary War—with
      the Continentals, the Continental currency. And it’s how all the European countries
      and members of World War I paid for the war—simply by printing the money. That’s
      what they do in an emergency. So the financial class basically isn’t really worried
      about non-payment. The problem is something else. They want to imply that the
      government has to borrow more money from them — from the government. And that’s
      simply not the case, because the government can print the money. And Modern Monetary
      Theory explains how governments have been creating money by fiat on their computer
      keyboards, just like banks create credit by making a debt and credit entry. The
      government and the Federal Reserve make a debt and credit entry. I’m not going
      to go through all the details on this show. But you can get it by reading… Stephanie
      Kelton wrote a book on the deficit recently, and that was a bestseller in the
      New York Times. And she has — the MMTers have — their own blogs. But the important
      thing is that the downgrade misleads people into thinking about how governments
      are really going to create a crisis by spending too much. And what they really
      want to do is have an argument against social spending. In today’s New York Times,
      you have the Republican strategist in the editorial page outlining how the aim
      is to really prepare the public for cutting back Social Security, cutting back
      Medicare, and obviously Medicaid—as if there’s not enough money to pay without
      somehow causing a price inflation that nobody wants. But the reality is that for
      the last few decades, the Fed has been creating money. That’s what quantitative
      easing was about. And Stephanie’s book, “The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory
      and the Birth of the People’s Economy,” explains all of this. But the most important
      point is that the financial sector is afraid. They’re not afraid of nonpayment.
      They knew that the government can pay the debts. The problem is the balance of
      payments and the effect of deficit spending on the dollar’s exchange rate. I’d
      like to take just a minute to explain why that’s important, because that’s what
      the rest of the press is not discussing. Foreign investors aren’t selling U.S.
      Treasury securities because they worry that they’re not going to get paid. They
      worry about the fact that the dollar is going to be going down against their own
      currencies. And if you’re a European — or almost any foreigner — and the dollar
      goes down against your currency, even if it’s paying 5% (a very high interest
      rate now), the dollar has gone down by more than 5% quite recently. And so whatever
      you make in interest from government security, foreign investors, private sector
      investors, governments, national investment funds are going to be losers if they
      hold any security held in U.S. dollars. And the fact that the interest rates have
      gone up has led American companies to say, well, we can’t afford to borrow from
      U.S. banks anymore, these high rates. We’re going to borrow in Europe. And so
      they’re going to Europe to borrow. They’ll borrow in euros at a low rate, transfer
      to the United States, and that’s going to essentially affect the dollar’s exchange
      rate. Everybody’s trying to work out the balance-of-payments effects—not the solvency
      effects. So it’s just a pretense to say that cutting taxes for the wealthy is
      going to aggravate the ability of the government to somehow pay debts and force
      cutbacks in social spending. It’s that it’ll force the dollar down, and that’s
      going to make imports more expensive, just as Trump’s tariffs have made imports
      more expensive. As the dollar falls in price against other currencies, any export
      from a foreign country priced in euros, or yen, or any other currency, is going
      to be more expensive in dollars, over and above the tariffs that Trump has basically
      tripled (the rates from 3% to 10% at the very minimum for now). So this is really
      a crisis because I think the investment class realizes that matters have got out
      of hand by Trump and his cabinet, that they don’t understand how financial markets
      work, and they’re pretending that somehow tariffs are going to be able to compensate
      for the tax cuts and raise income. Whereas, as we’ve discussed before, they’re
      not going to do that at all. The dollar is going to continue to fall in price.
      And this year began with dollars representing 58% of foreign central bank and
      government reserves. That’s down from 70% in 1999. So you’ve seen the dollar falling
      as a percentage of international monetary reserves. The amount actually has not
      fallen. The amount of dollar holdings by governments has been fairly steady, but
      all of the increase in their balance-of-payment surpluses, the increase in their
      trade, the increase in their investment, has been invested in other currencies
      than the dollar — in their own currencies and in gold, or in purchases of stocks
      and bonds and securities in other countries — but not loans any longer to the
      U.S. Treasury. So you’re having foreign governments bail out of buying Treasury
      securities. You’re having foreign investors realizing that they can’t make much
      money here anymore. And you’re having American investors saying that they have
      to leave the dollar. And they’re frightened over what the future is. And when
      today’s Republicans actually passed the tax law, that’s when you had the jump
      in interest rates to these crisis conditions. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, you mean
      that the United States government deficit spending is somehow impacting the dollar’s
      exchange rate? MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes. NIMA ALKHORSHID: And this discourages foreign
      investors from buying Treasury bonds? MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Do
      they really know what they’re doing right now? Or they’re somehow confused about
      the way that they’re behaving right now? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the risk is a foreign
      exchange risk, not the repayment risk. That’s the point that I’m making. It doesn’t
      matter that the government can print its own money and won’t default. The attractiveness
      of the U.S. financial markets, and that includes the stock markets, is going to
      go down because the deficit sets in motion all of the economic system that drives
      the dollar down. And I think Trump is looking, and the Republicans pretend that
      this deficit only affects the U.S. budget and U.S. income. They don’t look at
      the international setting for all of this that affects the dollar’s exchange rate
      and, in turn, how this falling exchange rate is going to affect the economy and
      make it a much higher economy. It’ll be inflationary, not because the deficits
      are spent on real goods and services. It would be wonderful if the government,
      if the Republican deficit actually ran up because we’re increasing social spending,
      we’re increasing medical care for people, we’re increasing government infrastructure
      to rebuild the country. That would all pay for itself and be productive. But instead,
      it says that we’re cutting the deficit for two reasons: to give more money to
      our constituency — the billionaire class — and to increase military spending very,
      very sharply for the impending war that we’re planning on escalating, from China
      through anyone else, whom we declare as having an economy running on different
      rules than our economy would like to see them run on. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael,
      in your view, what trends are observable in the composition of the global foreign
      exchange reserves since 1999? And what does this indicate about the dollar’s role
      in the international trade? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, we’ve seen countries turn to
      gold. That’s why the gold prices have gone up so rapidly. Just imagine, last year
      it was maybe $2,200. Now it’s $3,400. This is a 50% rise, in just half a year
      or so, of the price of gold as an asset. That’s an enormous increase. It’s a structural
      increase, and it looks like an irreversible increase. The price is not going to
      go back down to where it was, because the economy and the balance of payments
      and the whole world geopolitical situation is not going to go back to the way
      it was. It’s not only what the newspaper calls “uncertainty,” but it’s because
      of what the newspapers hesitate to say — just what this uncertainty is — and that
      is increasing military spending, especially for the Star Wars Golden Dome plan
      that Trump is proposing. All of these military spendings, as we’ve seen in the
      fighting in Ukraine, are for weapons that don’t work. It’s all unnecessary. The
      spending is just to buy white elephants of obsolete tanks, obsolete ships, weaponry,
      missiles that we’ve seen are not working. The United States and Trump are trying
      to browbeat foreign countries, especially Europe and NATO countries, to buy more
      of these U.S. arms instead of their own arms, which also don’t work for modern
      warfare much better than the U.S. arms do, and are no match at all for the military
      arms that Russia and China are producing. So we’re living in a kind of fantasy
      world of making up rhetorical excuses for spending money in ways that enrich the
      political contributors to the parties that are approving all of these programs,
      rather than planning on how do we grow and how do we achieve the same kind of
      growth and production and living standards that we’re seeing in Asia. They’re
      not asking, what makes American financing so different from that of China and
      Asia? That’s sort of not a topic discussed in polite company. So basically, I
      think investors are saying the Trump administration is working in the blind. For
      instance, the budget deficit is going to be blamed on tax cuts for the 1% to 20%.
      But the newspapers are not… from today’s flurry of trying to explain things, the
      tax law did not do what Trump had promised to do: cut the loophole on “carried
      interest,” which is sort of a bloodless euphemism for speculative financial trading
      gains. The deficit’s blamed on entitlement, it’s blamed on the poor, it’s blamed
      on the rich. And the margin today of the vote was only one vote — 215 to 214.
      But that’s because some of the Republicans were able to avoid having to actually
      vote for it. Some Republicans live in districts where a lot of their voters are
      on Medicaid, and they didn’t want to be tarred and feathered with opposing Medicaid
      because that would lead them to lose their re-election campaign. Especially the
      Republicans in New York. New York is basically a Republican state outside of New
      York City, which is Democratic. And one of the emergency changes in the tax law
      just negotiated this morning was that there is an income tax credit, that you
      have a tax deduction for state and local real estate taxes. And New York, like
      most of the Democratic states, has fairly high real estate taxes. Well, the original
      offer by the Republicans was: “Okay. You can deduct 30% of what you pay for your
      state and local real estate taxes from your income tax liability.” They raised
      that to a 40% exemption. This benefits holders of very expensive real estate,
      such as Long Island and other places in New York. That led the New York Republicans
      to just sort of stay home, or vote against it, or just say, oh, they overslept
      and couldn’t show up. Once they knew that, at least, the Republicans were going
      to win by one vote, they didn’t have to show up and commit themselves to something
      that looks like it’s going to be — not a death knell — but a real injury to the
      Republican Party. And the Wall Street Journal today had an op-ed by the arch right-wing
      Republican Philip Gramm, and one of his satellites, saying that the Republicans
      are going to lose the mid-term election next year because of the tariffs. Because
      of this, how are they going to defend themselves? Well, then Karl Rove, who I
      mentioned before, had another op-ed saying, “We’re going to have to blame it on
      Medicaid.” And we’re going to say, “Oh, what’s wrong with Medicaid? A lot of people
      who get it are not white people. They’re immigrants. We have to say, do you want
      immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, to be able to get Medicaid, instead
      of just restricting it to American citizens, that this is fraud? Why would we
      want to give Medicaid to immigrants?” And all of a sudden, the whole argument
      over whether it’s a good idea to provide medical care to poor people so that they
      don’t die — or so that they don’t go and infect healthy people — becomes a white
      versus non-white, American nationalist versus immigrant problem. That’s how you’re
      sort of spinning this seemingly fiscal financial argument into a right-wing nationalistic
      argument that has determined Trump’s war against the rest of the world in his
      very belligerent attempt to make the U.S. look like Margaret Thatcher’s England.
      NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, how does Trump’s tax legislation affect U.S. public
      debt, and the debt-to-GDP ratio, and the annual deficits? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well,
      it increases the public debt by a few trillion dollars, because if you spend more
      than you tax, then it’s a debt. Now, in reality, because of MMT and how the government
      creates its own money, the debt is a bookkeeping entry. The government owes money
      to itself. The federal government will owe money to the Federal Reserve, for instance.
      This creates money. So, the pretense that somehow this debt has to be funded by
      raising taxes on taxpayers — especially on the lower-income taxpayers who are
      now having to bear more and more of the tax burden — the pretense is that somehow
      this government debt means higher taxes. It doesn’t really mean that, but it does
      increase debt-to-GDP. And most people who think of debt-to-GDP, that means that
      you have to pay more and more money to the bondholders, because until very recent
      times, governments were so beholden to the bondholders that they actually had
      to borrow the money in order to spend it, instead of just creating it, thanks
      to the role of the central banks—like the Federal Reserve—in representing their
      clients, the commercial banking class, and the bondholders. Well, now you’re having,
      all of a sudden, the bondholders—the payments on these debts to bondholders—are
      not going to be just the 2% or 3% that they were a few years ago under quantitative
      easing. Now they’re over 5%. And that has two effects. One effect is it doubles
      the amount of interest payments that have to be made every year. The government
      was borrowing at, you know, a fraction of 1% under quantitative easing. That’s
      a gigantic increase to 5%. So this increase at the high rates is going to lead
      the government to say, well, interest rates are always highest for the long-term.
      And it’s lower and lower for the short-term. If the rate on 30-year Treasury bonds
      is 5.15%, it’s about 4.6% for 10-year Treasuries. And it’s down, you know, to
      around 4% for the short-term borrowing. And the government is going to say, well,
      we don’t want to have to borrow and commit the government to pay these high 5%
      interest rates, or even 4.5%. Let’s borrow short-term. Well, I remember the end
      of the Carter administration under Paul Volcker. The interest rates had been rising
      throughout the 1970s. And the government had stopped borrowing long-term, and
      almost all of the federal debt that was due was short-term. And it all had to
      be rolled over almost every year. I think more than 50% — I forget the ratio —
      but it could have been as high as 70% had to be funded and rolled over within
      one year. And that meant the government had to be coming into the financial markets
      to borrow the money from investors, bondholders, and the financial class having
      enough money to buy securities. And that’s what essentially caused this huge increase
      in interest rates that led to Carter losing the election so drastically to Ronald
      Reagan. So yes, a high debt-to-GDP ratio, high debt-to-income means that more
      and more government spending has to be spent on debt service—not on the real economy,
      not on production and consumption, and on the economy of the 90% of the population—but
      just on the end of the financial sector. It’s a transfer of income from the real
      economy to the financial sector — from wage earners to financial investors. NIMA
      ALKHORSHID: Michael, it seems that somehow the Republican Party is divided in
      two camps. One of them is the MAGA populists and the other one is plutocratic
      interests. And what do they want? When it comes to the U.S. budget, what is the
      division between the two parts of the Republican Party? MICHAEL HUDSON: They’re
      both plutocratic, especially the populists. The populists that were fighting for
      the last few days in Washington, the populist Republicans, said the budget is
      not harsh enough. The populists were saying there’s not enough cutback in Medicaid
      spending. You’re still giving money for nursing homes to have more nurses. You’re
      giving money for home visits to sick people. You’ve got to cut back even more.
      So the populists are different, using a different rhetoric to get exactly the
      same right-wing policies that the plutocrats want. And in fact, as Donald Trump
      has shown, you can’t be more of a plutocrat than Donald Trump. And how did he
      get elected? With a populist rhetoric claiming to represent the white working
      class instead of the financial class. So populism is just rhetoric. It’s not really
      the substance. NIMA ALKHORSHID: How does your analysis compare the current global
      economic realignment led by the global majority to the historical transition from
      feudalism to industrial capitalism? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you’d think that this
      would be a warning to them, a warning to say we have two models before us. We
      have what we’ll call the Chinese model because it’s the most successful model.
      And that’s the model that, although they call it “socialism with Chinese characteristics,”
      it’s really industrial “capitalism with Chinese characteristics.” It’s the mixed
      economy, just as the United States and Germany and other industrial nations had
      a program of industrial capitalism. The industrialists wanted the government to
      provide as many basic needs and services — at a subsidized price — as possible,
      for basic services like transportation, communications, education. They didn’t
      want these services to be high-priced because, otherwise, they’d have to pay their
      employees higher wages to afford these higher prices. And so it was the industrial
      classes that promoted what basically was called socialism. You could have called
      it socialized infrastructure, socialized medicine, or whatever. That was an industrial
      idea. And the guidance for all of how Europe and America developed their industry
      was classical economics. That’s the economics of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill.
      It was the same line of economics that culminated in Marx, who was a classical
      economist. And the root of their theory was Value Theory. And you don’t hear about
      that whole discussion that guided industrial capitalism throughout the 19th century.
      It has disappeared from discussion. And the theory of value was really a theory
      of prices and rent. The Value Theory, especially as David Ricardo refined it right
      after the Napoleonic Wars, was: the economic rent is the excess of market price
      over the actual cost of production. The business plan of industrial capitalism
      was to keep prices low by not including unearned income. And the whole fight throughout
      the 19th century in Europe was against the legacy of feudalism, which took the
      form of economic rent, primarily to the landlord class. And so the plan of Adam
      Smith (that he took over from the French Physiocrats), of Ricardo, and especially
      John Stuart Mill; and the first line of the Communist Manifesto was: You want
      to tax land rent. You don’t want this hereditary landlord class that inherited
      its lands from the warlords who conquered England and other countries to be able
      to make wage-earners, and businesses, have to pay rent to support them to make
      money in their sleep. So the idea was to reduce prices to the actual cost value.
      That was the plan of capitalism. Same thing with monopoly rents. During the feudal
      epoch and Middle Ages, kings had gone into debt — to wage their wars — to bankers.
      And in order to pay interest on their debts, when Parliament would not give them
      the taxes to raise to pay them, they created foreign trade monopolies. England
      had a wool monopoly that it established in the 14th century. Other countries created
      monopolies. All of these monopolies had survived into the 19th century. And again,
      the industrialists said, if our economy has not only a landlord class, but a monopoly
      class, where the monopolies are owned largely by financial investors (monopolies
      are financial privileges, basically, to charge high prices without any competition),
      then the industrialists said, we’re going to have a high-[cost] economy. How can
      England become the workshop of the world if we still have a financial class and
      a monopoly class and a landlord class that makes money in their sleep? The ideal
      of capitalism was to get rid of all of these unnecessary costs of production,
      all of the unearned income that resulted from prices in excess of cost value.
      So what the labor theory of value was really about… it was simply, well, ultimately,
      the cost of everything is basically labor. So let’s just look at what the actual
      minimum social cost of production is. That’s what we want in order to make our
      economies so low-priced that other economies (the raw materials exporters, the
      ‘backward’ countries, then called the Third World countries, now called the Global
      South) with all of their landlord class, all of their monopolies, and all of their
      residue of European colonialism (which was very much like Europe’s; Europe inherited
      feudalism, the rest of the world inherited the colonialist excesses)… That difference
      is what made the industrial nations more competitive. Now, what the BRICS countries,
      to answer your question, would say: How do we achieve the same kind of take-off
      that made England, Germany, and America the industrial leaders of the world? We’ll
      do what they did. We will cut back the payments to the rentiers. Well, who are
      the rentiers in these BRICS countries? Well, a lot of them are foreign investors,
      who concentrated on raw materials, rent, mining profits. The subsoil resources,
      as Ricardo pointed out, are just like land. The oil industry, the mining industry,
      is able to charge prices much more than the cost of actual production. That’s
      what makes them so profitable. Well, foreigners control these sectors throughout
      many BRICS countries. And so do many of the elites of the BRICS countries—they
      are largely the rentier class. The elites of the BRICS countries are very much
      in the same position that British landlords were in relative to the industrial
      class. So the question is: How are the BRICS countries going to free their economies
      from these rent charges — these rentier incomes of land rent, natural resource
      rent, creditor payments to creditors and to banks? Well, what did China do? China
      had a revolution. And it took a revolution. And after the revolution, it didn’t
      have a financial class to lend money to governments anymore. So, it did something
      that went beyond what Europe and the United States did in their industrial take-off.
      China made money creation and credit extension not only a public utility, but
      an arm of the Treasury. It didn’t have a central bank to represent domestic banks
      and financial bondholders, as in Europe and America. China was in charge of creating
      its own money and credit. And what did it do? It created money in order to finance
      tangible investment in capital formation, in factories, to produce goods and services,
      in housing (maybe a little too much in housing), and in huge public infrastructure,
      such as its low-cost domestic subway and urban transportation, and its long-distance
      hyper-speed trains. Now, how are you going to get the BRICS countries to say,
      well, we want to create our money not really for our bankers to spend in flight
      capital and moving their money out of our countries into safe havens abroad? How
      are we going to prevent our elites from benefiting from regressive taxation (that
      they don’t have to pay taxes and the foreign investors don’t have to pay taxes
      because of the way that we’ve written the tax code), and only our wage earners
      have to pay taxes? How can they possibly industrialize without emulating the same
      kind of policies that were the result of applying the value, price, and rent theory
      that was developed by the classical economists? Well, one of the problems is that
      by the time I was going to school in the 1960s, the only people — the only groups
      — that were talking about classical economics and Value Theory were the Marxists,
      because there was a counter-revolution at the end of the 19th century and the
      beginning of the 20th century. The rentiers fought back. There was an anti-classical
      school saying that there’s no such thing as economic rent. Everybody earns whatever
      they can get. And they essentially drove out the classical economists. They replaced
      them. It was by Austrian theory in Europe, by utilitarian theory and supply and
      demand in England, and by the economics of John Bates Clark in the United States,
      all in the late 19th century. And by the time that World War I ended, there was
      no more classical economics really being taught. Everything was restructured to
      say there’s no such thing as economic rent. And that was because England, America,
      Germany — the industrial nations — had used their classical economic policies
      to achieve such a head start that they didn’t need protection anymore. They were
      able to, all of a sudden, pull up the ladder to prevent other countries from developing
      in their same way and becoming rivals. And they themselves became the rentier
      economies. And it was as if they were rolling the clock slowly back towards feudalism
      and its rentier classes, very much so. You had only the Marxists talking about
      this. And now if people talk about value, they still use the word labor theory
      of value, as if somehow this is a class war of labor. But that wasn’t how Marx
      used it at all. Marx simply said the historical role of industrial capitalism
      is to cut costs, to create a free market. And a free market was a market free
      from rent extractors—not free for extractors. Well, this counter-revolution that
      I talked about in the 20th century became so successful that — I think, as we’ve
      talked before on your show — if you look at the modern GDP analysis, the modern
      national income analysis, the gross domestic product includes economic rent as
      a product. Landlords play an economic role in production by deciding just who
      to rent to and how much to charge. And banks play a productive role—not only in
      charging interest and earning it, but in charging late fees. That’s called providing
      a financial service. I’ve mentioned this before. And monopolies. We know that
      there are a lot of monopolies in the United States. That’s what all the hearings
      are about now, with Alphabet and Facebook and all of the others. All of their
      income is counted as a product. But if you make income in your sleep without working—if
      it’s a purely rentier charge, a rent-seeking charge—that’s not a product. That’s
      a transfer of income from the productive sector of production and consumption
      to the rent-seeking classes. Now, the reason I’m bringing this up for the BRICS
      countries is, if they want to develop their economies to become as successful
      along the lines that China has done, they will have to say, well, what is the
      product that we want to produce and that we want the government to encourage to
      produce? Well, the product is production. The product is not economic rent for
      the privileged real estate classes, mineral companies, oil companies, monopolies,
      and the domestic banks. It’s the production, because that is the only way that
      we can increase our productivity. And to do that, they have to increase the living
      standards of our laboring class. That’s really what’s at issue. Now, domestically,
      how are you going to get all of the BRICS countries to acknowledge how the industrial
      nations got wealthy in the first place? How are you going to lead governments
      that still have been put in place, first of all, by centuries of European colonialism,
      and then by American imperialism backing, interfering with local politics by overthrowing
      leaders who are not dictators, following the American foreign policy? How are
      you going to replace the ruling classes that were put in place by the Europeans
      and Americans with classes that actually represent their populations as a whole?
      Can this be done simply by reasoning with them? Does it take a revolution? What
      does it take? Well, there can’t even be a revolution unless you have a political
      doctrine and ideology to have a revolution about. And I don’t see in the BRICS
      countries, or even in China, an exposition of the ideology that made industrial
      capitalism so productive in the first place, from England, Germany, France, and
      the United States, on. I’m told that most of the economists hired by the BRICS
      countries actually are trained in America. Even if they’re abroad, they’re trained
      in the American neoliberal economics. You can’t have a BRICS economic revolution
      run by neoliberals, or by government officials trained in the neoliberal way of
      thinking, that does not include the concept of economic rent as unearned income.
      Now, this may seem to be very academic, but I think that the most important thing
      that I have to comment on and to offer the BRICS countries is: You’ve got to look
      at this economic history and how you think of the economy as being divided between
      producers and rent-seekers. Marx used the phrase: There’s the sphere of production
      and the sphere of circulation. By the sphere of circulation, he meant the sphere
      of privilege — the financial sector and the property rights sector, property being
      real estate monopolies and the privilege of banks creating their own credit. Have
      I explained it clearly? NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, I was wondering what’s going
      on right now in the central banks of the global south countries. And when it comes
      to the dollar, to the decline of the dollar’s value since Donald Trump took office,
      and are they really thinking about non-dollar currencies or investing in gold?
      What’s going on in the mind of these countries, in your opinion right now? MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, there’s a difference between the mind of these countries and the
      central banks. The BRICs cannot develop until they get rid of their central banks.
      The role of central banks is to oppose the role of the Treasury. Central banks
      have as their clients the commercial banking system and the bondholders. They
      represent the financial sector. That was exactly why the Federal Reserve was created
      in the United States—to replace the Treasury that was not very efficient in 1913.
      And this is a quantum leap too far for most countries to take. If you’re a central
      banker, you have to be trained in neoliberalism assumption — that finance is the
      most productive sector; finance is where the money is made; finance is where wealth
      is made, and therefore finance is the most productive sector, not industry. The
      role of central banks is to de-industrialize the country, and siphon the income
      and wealth into the hands of a non-industrial rentier class. So, when you say,
      how does that central bank think? How can we fight against living standards? How
      can we make sure that we represent our financial interests, and the bankers, and
      the bondholders, altogether? And what that means is: How can we support the United
      States as having some vehicle in which we can keep our national savings? Even
      countries like Norway — that has a national wealth fund, not a central bank —
      but how are they going to keep the savings? Well, there’s a lot of protest in
      Norway. I was brought over to be a consultant to the government on this some years
      ago. Much of their investment is in American monopolies because that’s what yields
      the most money. If you want to make money, first of all, you want to put it in
      drug dealing—that’s the most profitable thing. But governments don’t do that unless
      they’re part of the deep state — the CIA or the intelligence services. So you
      want to make money, you go where the money is. Just like bank robbers rob banks
      because that’s where the money is, investors make money by investing in monopolies
      and private capital and in the big American information technology stocks, which
      are monopolies. And that’s why they’re charged with being monopolies by the European
      governments and the American governments. That’s where you want to put your money
      if your objective is to make money financially. So that’s the problem. Central
      banks want to be able to make money and returns for their government financially,
      not by direct investment in creating new factories, farms, infrastructure, and
      means of production. That’s not their mentality. They’d say, that’s not the central
      bank’s problem, that’s the problem for the Treasury to do domestically. Our job
      is to make money. And because we’re not going to save domestically, we have a
      balance of payment surplus. What country are we going to put the money in? Most
      of them have in the past looked for the U.S. dollar. But now, because of what
      we talked about earlier in the flight out of the dollar, they’re thinking, where
      are we going to put the money? Well, the euros represent only 20% of world monetary
      reserves, and Europe is pretty much a dead zone. We don’t see it rising because
      of the sanctions that America has just imposed upon it to prevent Europe’s trade
      with Russia and China, or Iran or other countries like that. So the central bankers
      really have a problem. Where is a safe haven? They are talking about: how can
      we sort of avoid the issue? Maybe we can hold each other’s currencies? They’d
      like to hold the currency of a strong country, like China, but the problem is
      China has no reason to give them a market to invest. If China would let them invest
      in its own securities, it would have to say, well, we’re going to run into debt
      for the government so that we can give you bonds, a market for bonds, that you
      can hold, denominated in Chinese RMBs. They’re not going to do that. In fact,
      they just had a huge stock auction in Hong Kong. They didn’t let American investors
      be part of this new initial public offering that they just offered in Hong Kong.
      So they don’t need dollars. They don’t need American investments, or Global South
      investments, or investments from any other country coming into their economies
      because they have enough already. They would like their own citizens, their own
      savers, to be able to buy stocks in their own companies. But they have no reason
      to provide financial vehicles for other countries to benefit from China’s remarkable
      industrial take-off. So again, the central banks have a dilemma. There’s nowhere
      that is safe any longer. There’s been a long cycle since 1945. There’ve been a
      lot of little business cycles, but each one has risen higher and higher and higher.
      And America, Europe—countries throughout the world—have reached the maximum debt-servicing
      capacity that they have. It’s not simply debt-to-GDP—that doesn’t really matter
      because a lot of that’s just bookkeeping. It’s really the debt relative to wage
      earners’ income, debt relative to corporate income, debt relative to state and
      local financial income. The debt has become so heavy that other countries that
      remain part of this whole geopolitical system that America put in place in 1945—it’s
      run its course. It’s a dead end. And yet, the BRICS countries have not come up
      with an alternative. How do you have a revolution and a new policy without defining
      what the alternative policy is? And that is what is lacking. But that’s what your
      show is all about. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you so much, Michael, for being with
      us today. Great pleasure as always. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I’m glad we were able

    paragraph_summary: In a discussion on May 22, 2025, Michael Hudson critiques the
      U.S. government's approach to the conflict in Ukraine, particularly under the
      Trump administration's proposed sanctions against Russia. He argues that these
      sanctions are not genuinely aimed at Russia but rather serve to harm European
      nations and American allies by forcing them to pay higher prices for energy and
      goods, effectively transferring the economic burden of U.S. Cold War strategies
      onto them. Hudson highlights that the previous sanctions during the Biden administration
      were ineffective due to their low intensity, primarily to avoid increasing domestic
      oil prices. He suggests that the current strategy is detrimental to global economic
      stability, as evidenced by recent stock market fluctuations.

    text: 'Transcription – 2025.05.01 – Dialogue Works NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody.
      Today is Thursday, May 1st, 2025, and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson
      are here. Welcome back. RICHARD WOLFF: Glad to be here. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard,
      what’s the importance of today? And you mentioned before coming on live, and I
      think you have something to say for all of us. RICHARD WOLFF: Yes. Well, May Day,
      the 1st of May each year, has traditionally been for many, many, many years, a
      day devoted to celebrating the rights and the struggles, and the losses and the
      gains of the working class around the world. In many countries, there will be
      parades and demonstrations in the major cities and beyond in which labor unions,
      political parties associated with the working class show their strength, make
      their demands, celebrate their achievements. It’s a working day, working-class
      holiday, if you like. It began back in 1886, if my memory is correct, here in
      the United States, in Chicago, in particular, when there was a major struggle
      and a demonstration, classic struggle of the working class. In that case, demanding
      an eight-hour workday rather than the ten or twelve hours that had become the
      norm. Because capitalism, as Marx explained so beautifully in Volume One of Capital,
      has a very great interest in making the length of the working day as long as physically
      and emotionally possible. He did the analysis to show why that is a profit-maximizing
      activity on the part of the ruling class. And there were workers pushed back,
      and workers struggled. And it took them a long time. You know, there’s a century
      in England called the struggle for the ten-hour day to get it down to ten. Well,
      this struggle in Chicago wanted to get it down further to eight. And in the course
      of that demonstration, somebody (it was never really shown who), started shooting.
      And the police started shooting. And when the dust cleared, several people had
      been shot. And there was an attempt by the local authorities to blame “anarchists.”
      That was the term of denunciation in those days. And the so-called anarchists
      were arrested and tried and found guilty – some of them – and executed. And it
      became a holiday to memorialize both the struggle and the repression and the sacrifices
      that had been made. And the real irony of the story is that even though it begins
      in a moment of intense class struggle of the United States, the post-World War
      II Cold War made it necessary for the United States Congress to not allow to change
      the date at which you celebrate workers from May 1st to the first Monday in September,
      what we call Labor Day here in the United States, on a different date. And it
      has been largely neglected, more and more over recent years. For example, when
      I was young, there was always a parade wherever I happened to live on Labor Day.
      Nowadays, in most of the cities of this country, nothing happens on Labor Day.
      The movement here, the labor movement, even the organized labor movement, doesn’t
      have the personnel, the time, the space, the money to carry on that particular
      tradition. So it tells you something about the United States, relative to the
      rest of the world, to know a little bit about the May 1st holiday, both here and
      abroad. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, do you want to add something? MICHAEL HUDSON:
      I have nothing to add to that. Of course, when I grew up, many of my friends would
      go on demonstrations on May Day, but that was in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
      And it’s just sort of evaporated now. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Jumping into what’s going
      on right now, and the new deal, the mineral deal between the United States and
      Ukraine. What is the way that Donald Trump sees the situation with Ukraine? [clip
      start] DONALD TRUMP: The real number is about $350 billion. That’s unthinkable.
      And we had no security. We had no nothing. We were just pouring money there, unsecured
      money, putting it in banks, and anybody could have taken it out. You know, anybody
      over there. It was their decision. I’ve never seen anything like it. Europe, on
      the other hand, which it’s obviously that whole situation is much more important
      to Europe because we have an ocean in between. But Europe gave about $100 billion.
      It’s a lot of money. It’s a big sacrifice they made also. But they gave much less
      than we did. And their money is secured, totally secured by deposits in banks.
      The deposits are largely Russian deposits. That’s what Europe did. But their money
      is secured. So they gave $100 billion totally secured. We gave money like it’s
      throwing it out the window. And it was done by Biden. And this is Biden’s war.
      This isn’t Trump’s war. I’m trying to get out. And more than the money, they’re
      losing about 5,000 young Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, mostly. There’s
      some people also being killed in towns where missiles should not have been shot,
      small cities and towns. But we are trying to save the lives of about 5,000 (young,
      mostly soldiers) that are losing their lives a week. I see satellite photos. Probably
      one of his satellites, come to think of it. But I see satellite photos every week
      of fields with arms and heads and legs scattered all over. It’s a violent, violent,
      horrible situation. And more important than the money, I want to save the lives
      of people from other countries that are dying so stupidly, so needlessly. And
      they’re dying. But I said, what are we doing? How did we get into this war? It
      would have never happened if I were president. [clip end] NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard,
      what do you want to say? RICHARD WOLFF: Well, I’m always blown away by watching
      that man, I must say. It’s rather stunning. He clearly makes all of this up as
      he goes along. Unlike the rest of us, he doesn’t seem to be constrained by checking
      whether the fact is the fact, whether what he heard from this one or that one
      is consistent with what other, you know. None of those things that worry the rest
      of us seem to annoy this fellow. You know, we put in $350 billion. Detail: Most
      of that money was spent by the United States government on United States corporations
      and individuals. That’s where most of that money always goes. It goes to large
      corporations who have nice contracts with the Defense Department and who pick
      up the money. It’s American money funding the American economy by means of the
      war over there. It’s not money somehow gone. And then to say that Europeans spent
      only 100 billion, which is secured. It’s secured by the deposits of Russia that
      are illegal. The Europeans, by the way, have not in fact touched them because
      legally they have been told by their own lawyers that they can’t do that. They
      have to attach the interest earned on that deposit, but not the deposits themselves.
      And so, it’s not correct to say they’re “secured.” They’re very insecure. And
      then finally, he’s making a deal because he’s so upset by death? Well, a few miles
      away, I can show him much more horrific pictures of dead people and dead children
      in Gaza. Doesn’t seem to bother him at all. But the ones in Ukraine, these are
      really kind of… what in the world are we talking about? And then you ask us, which
      is fine, to talk about the new agreement. I mean, the agreement is between the
      United States that has no claim on Ukraine at all. And the Ukraine government
      that, you know, was out of power by its own constitution many months ago. Mr.
      Zelensky, he’s not a constitutional government. He has no right to sign anything
      unless he has an election. He hasn’t had an election. None of this mattered. This
      is all political theater here. The British having a deal with Zelensky, possibly
      including the same rare earths. No one knows what the value of all of that is.
      I mean, this is posturing. And the reason is because the parties involved cannot
      come to an agreement. They’ve been trying for three months. And since Mr. Trump
      took office, I want to remind people he promised he could and would bring the
      Ukraine war to an end in a day. Okay, here we are. One hundred-plus days later.
      And he hasn’t done it. It’s not entirely his fault. I get that. But I mean, either
      you boast or you don’t. If you can’t get it done, don’t boast that you will. If
      you do boast, you’ve got to do a little more than was done here. The best guess
      I have, and certainly this is the majority view of the press in Europe that I
      look at, is that the United States has made the decision to walk away from this
      conflict; that whatever efforts it made between the opposition of the Russians
      and the opposition of the Ukrainians, the United States is not going to force
      it on the two of them. Between you and me, that’s because it couldn’t. But in
      any case, it isn’t going to try, and it therefore is going to walk away. And it
      will, of course, blame the Ukrainians and the Russians, because Mr. Trump always
      blames somebody else for whatever it is that goes wrong. And the American people
      will be treated to this theater again. And the great question, which has been
      the great question all along, is how many Americans will, for how long, accept
      and tolerate what is going on? That’s the only issue. The rest of it is details.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the devil’s in the details. And I think that if you look
      at the details, Trump has just made the war his war, with an exclamation point.
      I think he realized that the terms that he had defended Ukraine against Russia
      were not acceptable to Russia. Russia made it very clear from the beginning what
      its terms were. And Trump realized that his attempt to make a peace agreement
      with a ceasefire, enabling Ukraine to rearm against Russia and enabling the Europeans,
      NATO people, to move their arms into Russia, was such a no-go that the whole fantasy
      that Trump had that he could sweet-talk Putin into making an agreement, in the
      belief that somehow Russia had to do it, is over. So what is this deal that was
      signed? I spent a little time reading the Financial Times and the other columns.
      It’s not about rare earths. That’s the cover story. It’s not really even about
      minerals. It’s about the Americans protecting any investment they make with anti-aircraft
      missiles. And the missiles, of course, can go all the way into Russia. So what
      seems to be a U.S. plan to try to develop rare earths and lithium deposits, most
      of which are in the Russian zone, really is only a cover story for the rest of
      the agreement. That’s often how the United States makes an agreement. There will
      be something at the very end saying, “and other purposes,” or an opener. And the
      agreement means that the actual military solution will be on the battlefield.
      There’s not going to be a negotiated agreement because Ukraine won’t negotiate
      with Russia. Then any negotiated agreement would mean that Russia gives up the
      territories that it already has to some future agreement. But also, there are
      many devils in the details. Now, if somehow Trump is not able to get for his backers,
      such as Blackstone – and by the way, the imminent German Prime Chancellor is going
      to head, worked for Blackstone before and is virulently anti-Russian. The German
      new military foreign minister is more anti-Russian than Annalena Baerbock was.
      This agreement is a step towards an escalation of the Russian war. There’s no
      attempt at peace. And it looks like you’re going to have Germany and England come
      into the war, and America is going to continue to provide defense for Ukraine.
      And that defense takes the form of guiding Ukrainian missiles, Ukrainian drones,
      Ukrainian attacks. So the United States has just recommitted itself to Ukraine.
      And by claiming that somehow this is going to benefit America, this is how Trump
      has rationalized with Congress the fact that this new Trump war is much more economically
      in America’s favor than Biden was able to make. And it’s a very aggressive act.
      America’s essentially joined Germany, England, and NATO in making a deal whose
      details are designed to prevent any kind of a negotiated peace, and leave the
      aftermath for after Russia conquers the rest of Ukraine, once the rainy season
      finishes and the ground is hard enough that the tanks can go in. This is to set
      up the war. And the war is not only about Ukraine. Most of the Russian military
      build-up has been aimed to defend itself against the Baltic attacks on Russia.
      The Baltics are trying to prevent Russian access to the sea, to get to the ocean.
      They’re planning on creating problems for Kaliningrad right in the middle of Lithuania.
      It looks to me like there’s just been a set-up for a large military escalation.
      NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, here is what the Kyiv Post reported. Right after the
      deal being signed by the two parties, the Trump administration had agreed to the
      first arms export to Ukraine for $50 million. And he tries to say that this war
      is Biden’s war, it’s not mine. But we know that he was supporting, before Biden
      came into office, he was supporting Ukraine. He was sending a lot of weapons to
      Ukraine. He’s bragging about that. Why is he just removing himself from the scene
      that it’s all on Biden and I have nothing to do with Ukraine? RICHARD WOLFF: Well,
      I mean, this is consistent with his behavior. I mean, Michael and I may disagree
      a little bit. I understand what Michael just said. That is certainly one possible
      understanding of what’s going on. I see the logic of his argument. I think Mr.
      Trump is torn. And I’m not surprised. If you remember, Mr. Biden, for example,
      ran a campaign against Mr. Trump, clearly implying on many occasions that his
      war against China had to be rethought. And yet when he came in, Mr. Biden kept
      most of the tariffs against China and indeed raised the number of them, outdoing
      Mr. Trump on the very issue where he implied that he would not have done what
      Mr. Trump did, or outright criticized him for it. All we’re seeing now is the
      same thing. Mr. Trump would like to be, and this seems to me clear, he would like
      to be the president who ended Biden’s war and saved the United States, the money
      and the blah, blah, blah, and the loss of face and the failure in the war that,
      you know, is what Ukraine is. It’s a lost war. He would like that. On the other
      hand, he gets an enormous amount of pushback and not just from the Democratic
      Party, but from that part of the Republican Party that always went along with
      the Cold War, that always went along with the demonization of Putin. Look at the
      speeches of that strange man, the senator, you know, from North Carolina. It’s
      just a bizarre expression. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Lindsey Graham? RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah,
      Lindsey Graham. Sorry, I blocked his name out for obvious reasons. Anyway, the
      situation means that he wobbles back and forth. He would like to drop Mr. Zelensky
      in the toilet. He’s made enough statements to that. He called him a dictator,
      called him unelected. He did things that people in that position do not do unless
      they’d just as soon see that person disappear. Right? And everybody who’s critical
      has noted that he’s more friendly to Putin than he is to Zelensky. And that seems
      to me to be the case. But then when he’s frustrated, when it turns out he cannot
      get from Zelensky what he wants, and he can’t force it. Not in a position to do
      that, partly because the Europeans are taking a different position, and partly
      because they are furious at him for creating the vulnerability that the European
      leaders now have. They are all alone out there in this Ukraine war. They’re all
      alone having hitched their entire careers to being patsies for the United States.
      And now the United States leaves them out there hanging. They are, they’re in
      trouble and they’re worried about their political futures as they should be. So
      he’s got a lot of counter to himself. Much of it’s his own doing. But in making
      it impossible, he can’t end the war. He can’t go against the Russians as much
      as he wants to, or would like to. He can’t go against Zelensky and force it. He’s
      stuck. And so he wobbles. And I think he wobbles one day in the direction of Michael’s
      interpretation. And he wobbles the next day more in the direction of what I’m
      saying or others are saying. And we don’t know where he’s going to end up because
      he doesn’t. He doesn’t know. You know, maybe Mr. Putin will come up with some
      solution that he can then buy into. But at this point, he’s exhausted. You know,
      he sent over a team, which as best one can see – between the old general, whose
      name I’ve also blocked out, and his ally, Witkoff, the real estate dealer in New
      York – Witkoff is tilting in one direction, the old general in another direction.
      And he’s listening to this. And he doesn’t know which way to go. He’s not even
      interested that much. He would like this albatross off his back. And he can’t
      get it. And therefore, he wobbles. And he hopes something will happen. And he
      gets upset when the Russians send missiles into Ukraine. And he gets upset if
      the Ukrainians send their missiles until someone tells him that it was the American
      advisors over there who actually sent the missile. And then he gets upset that
      he didn’t know that. There is a tendency to think, because of our ideological
      society, that what the government is doing is a careful, worked-out, logical,
      organized plan of action. It isn’t. It is a more than even normal, and normally
      it isn’t. But with Trump, it’s especially chaotic, partly because he doesn’t want
      anyone who could threaten him. He wants the freedom to do whatever he wants. He
      reasons correctly that he has been able to become the president on that basis.
      Why should he change? So he’s not going to change. He’s going to do it the way
      it strikes him at the moment. Look at what he’s done with the tariffs. I’ll use
      them as an example. He has around him economic advisors. I know some of them.
      They have explained to him the following simple economic truth: Investment of
      money is something handled by employers. Employers are 3% of the population of
      the United States. The rest of us, 97%, are not employers. Okay? So, the advisors
      tell him that the single most important determinant of investment is the probability
      of it being profitable. If it’s profitable and there’s a good probability of it,
      you make an investment. If it’s profitable but it’s too uncertain, you hold back.
      If Mr. Trump raises a tariff one day, lowers it the next day, exempt somebody
      from it one day, exempt someone else the next day. What you’re doing is teaching
      the world that it is uncertain, any profitability calculus you make, which means
      they’re going to hold back, which means you’re going to have a recession. This
      is not good. The problem is Mr. Trump wants to be the focus of attention. He wants
      Mary Barra of General Motors to call up and say, I can’t make any plan with General
      Motors. It’s going to hurt our plant, our factories in Michigan, in Kentucky,
      in Tennessee. And that’s going to hurt your base, Mr. Trump. And they’re going
      to blame you, Mr. Trump, unless you give me an exemption from these tariffs, Mr.
      Trump. He loves that the heads of General Motors call him up, that they want to
      talk to him, that they want to plead, that they offer to support him, in God knows
      what ways, to get the lack of uncertainty resolved for them. And he gives that
      to them. He wants them to call him again next week or next month, which they will.
      You know why? Because he’s changed what he had to say from Monday to Thursday.
      This contradiction between his role as president – the unknowable, the great saver
      of the country, whose magical powers of making a deal will bring – he loves this.
      But you can’t run a government like that if investment is in the hands of a tiny
      group of people who live and die every day, like you, me, and Michael do, reading
      the headlines to try to get a sense of what’s going on. I’m not responsible for
      billions of dollars of investment. I’m not responsible for all the jobs. But Mary
      Barra at General Motors, or the people running Ford, or any of the others, are.
      Look, orders three weeks ago were collapsing in China for consumer goods. Last
      week, a lot of Chinese companies happily announced they’re back in production.
      Why? Because the head of Walmart, and the head of Target, and the head of a couple
      of other companies had a meeting with Mr. Trump, and he told them he would adjust
      the tariffs so that they wouldn’t miss out on the shipments of goods from China,
      which are crucial for the Christmas selling season in retail America, which is
      the most important part of the year for these companies. He is changing and shifting
      one minute to the next. You can’t know that’s what he wants, and no one around
      him, including the economic advisors that I know who have told him what I’ve just
      said, can get to first base with him. He’s gonna do it the way he feels like.
      When you saw an incompetent Biden stay in the office and refuse to step down,
      you should have noticed the president can do that. He can do it for months, and
      he can do it at the expense of his political party. That’s the way American individualism
      always works. It will, in the end, undo the country that celebrates it as its
      extraordinary strength. It’s Hegel again. That individualism will make you strong
      in some circumstances and make you collapse in others. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I
      want to start by getting back to the original question, and the point that you
      made about Ukraine. I think that Trump said the following: “We’re going to continue
      Biden’s war. It will be my war, but we’re going to make money off it.” But that’s
      the twist that he’s done. He said it’s okay to keep fighting the war if we can
      make money. The mineral steal is a fig leaf to pretend that we can make money
      that conceals the military build-up and the renewed American pressure on Russia.
      I think that, as you pointed out in your beginning remark, you said there’s the
      problem between Kellogg, who is a pro-Biden, anti-Russian general, who had a fantasy
      idea that Russia needed, that Russia was weakening, that Russia was about to collapse
      economically, and that Russia would accept whatever proposal Trump made. And there
      was Witkoff, who actually was visiting with Russia and was reality-based. Trump
      didn’t like the reality-based description by Witkoff. He liked the fantasy that
      Kellogg had, the anti-Russian fantasy that, yes, America can come out on top of
      Russia. That’s what Trump always believes. We have to be the winner. And the deal
      on developing resources, is so open-ended that he hopes nobody will get to the
      military protection of the resources, meaning that whatever deal that England
      has made and that NATO countries, European countries, have made, the American
      deal supersedes all that; and that it’s not the NATO countries, Europe, that’s
      going to have any role to play, it’s the Americans. And, one of the aspects of
      the deal that Trump emphasized was that no country that has dealt with Russia
      and broken the American sanctions in Russia can have any economic deal made with
      Ukraine for the resources. This is the Cold War with an exclamation point. Trump
      has just gone much more hardline than even the Biden Democrats had wanted to do.
      This is a really serious saying that, well, Russia didn’t surrender, so now we’re
      going to show you, Russia. Now we’re going to have the really heavy war. You think
      you can beat Ukraine? And that it’s all over? And that you’re going to be able
      to conquer it? Well, wait till you see what we’re going to do now. So I think
      that what Trump has done is really much more than just wishy-washy. He’s made
      a step-change in the whole system towards war. I don’t know what I can say. I’ll
      leave it to Nima to ask what he wants to talk about the tariff issue. NIMA ALKHORSHID:
      Yeah. By the way, what’s going on in Europe is so important. Richard and Michael.
      Right now, the Financial Times reported that the European Union prepares Plan
      B, should Trump walk away from Ukraine. What’s going on in Ukraine? It seems that
      on one hand, there’s so much concern about Donald Trump leaving the war in Ukraine.
      On the other hand, if he lets the American companies go to Russia, what would
      be the future of Europe? What is this huge loss on the part of Europe? Because
      they’re losing Russia, on one hand, they’re not getting cheap energy from Russia.
      And the United States, which was the main party in this conflict in Ukraine, is
      leaving the scene, and they’re trying to repair their relationship with Russia.
      How do you see, Richard, the way that the European Union or European countries
      are seeing the conflict in Ukraine? RICHARD WOLFF: In my judgment, the Europeans
      are in a state for which the only word I can think of is desperation. They are
      finished. Europe is the fall guy in all of this. The world is shaping up as a
      declining empire of the G7 on the one hand, led by the United States, and the
      rising empire of China, allied with the BRICS. The Chinese have been working for
      fifteen years to develop the BRICS as a serious alliance, and they’ve done a very
      good job. The United States-G7 has just been dealt a death blow by the United
      States turning on literally every one of those countries. Canada, maybe not Japan,
      but even there’s the first-time rumblings of a dissent from their subordination
      to the United States. And the Europeans are, of course, upset in different ways.
      The only thing holding Europe together now, the only thing, is the terrible fear
      each of them has about the other one cutting a deal with the United States to
      end up being the favored one. You could watch Maloney trying to make that Italy.
      You can watch Starmer desperate to figure out how to avoid the United States shifting
      to Italy rather than using Britain as the lap dog that it has done for all these
      years. They can’t get together, and without that they can’t do anything about
      their situation. They can make whatever plans they want. It doesn’t matter. Michael
      may be right about General Kellogg. I mean, we do have to remember that if you’re
      a person raised in the Cold War, which all of us more or less have been – or the
      legacy of it – then you think of Russia as this enormous event. But if you’re
      an economist, you know that the GDP of the United States is in the neighborhood
      of $25, $27, $28 trillion, and the GDP of Russia is in the neighborhood of $3
      or $4 trillion. This is an elephant and a mouse. And so, of course, in the minds
      of the general from the elephant country, there is the notion we can always exhaust
      Russia. We did get rid of the Soviet Union by exhausting it in an arms race it
      could not afford, in a take-over in Afghanistan, which it could not afford, in
      the cutting-back of their consumer society, which they could politically not afford.
      So we’re going to do it again. They’re going to do it again, this time with sanctions.
      And so, sure, the mechanisms shift. Russia is a nuclear danger. That has to be
      taken. But what they’re not considering is the biggest mistake of all: Russia
      has the BRICS. That’s how they dealt with the energy problem. They could stop
      selling oil and gas – not 100%, but the bulk of it – to Europe, and sell it to
      China and India. I don’t want to make it too simple, but it isn’t all that complicated.
      And they’re not going to be able to force the Russians into any of their fantasies.
      I want to remind you, Russia was supposed to collapse. Putin was supposed to be
      kicked out. The ruble was supposed to disintegrate. None of that happened. None
      of it. Not even a little. And by the way, they never speak about it. It’s as if
      that history never happened. It’s up to us as critics to remind them of the total
      nonsense of their strategic thinking that they shared with us. Look, it’s possible
      that the British will read the agreement that Michael has been talking about,
      the way Michael has, and understand it to be a maneuver rendering the deal they
      made with Zelensky null and void. What are they then going to do? This is another
      declaration of war, like imposing tariffs on their aluminum and steel, and all
      the rest of it. They are being told that as the American empire struggles to slow
      down its own decline, sacrificing Europe is perfectly okay. So, look, they didn’t
      react to the election two days ago in Canada, in which a political party that
      was far behind in the polls turned Mr. Trump into a winning strategy. The man
      running for them, the old Bank of England director, gave the middle finger to
      Mr. Trump. That was his whole campaign. And he won. And he won by plenty. Even
      in Quebec, with their own native son, French-speaking fellow, they couldn’t get
      off the ground. Quebecois voted against Trump. This is a sign. If it can happen
      in Canada, what’s going to happen in the elections coming up in Europe when candidates
      begin to smell the opportunities of running a campaign against Trump? If you’re
      going to run against Trump, you’re going to get a lot of votes. And if you force
      Mr. Starmer or Mr. Macron or the Germans to be the pro-Trump? Uh-oh, that’s very
      dangerous for them. They must know that. And so you see, they don’t know what
      to do. They can’t back away from Ukraine because they’ve made their whole career.
      They can’t really back away from Trump because that’s their whole life. That’s
      who they are. That’s why they’re in power. They ran against neoliberal globalization
      to get into power. In other words, it was the American plan for the world that
      gave them their chance. They can’t betray that now. They wouldn’t know where to
      go. They couldn’t speak about it. But there will be politicians. There already
      are politicians in all those countries, inside their parties, and on the left
      – both – who are going to make life very difficult for them in the years ahead.
      And that’s no matter what happens in the Ukraine. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the problem
      is how do they escape from this fantasy that Richard has explained? And he’s quite
      right to bring it up. The fantasy was a paper written, I think, by a Hudson Institute
      neocon, who actually said the Russian economy is about to collapse if only we
      can make it spend enough on the military, that it’ll be a replay of the Soviet
      Union collapsing under the military. That was explicit. It was said that there
      will be a regime change. If we fight against Russia, the Russian people will want
      to overthrow Putin, and we’ll have the regime change. We can have another Boris
      Yeltsin there. That was explicitly the plan, and there was no plan B. They were
      stuck into it. And that’s been the plan for the last few years. And that’s the
      plan that the current European leaders are committed to. Remember that Europe
      is a democracy. And a democracy means you don’t let voters vote for parties that
      are not considered pro-American. Because democracy means Cold War. Democracy means
      NATO. Democracy means military spending. And military spending means class war,
      that if Germany spends the 700 or 800 billion euros on rearming, that money is
      no longer going to be available for social spending. Military Keynesianism essentially
      means the end of social democracy, the end of social spending. That’s why Germany
      cannot let the Alternativ für Deutschland Party, which is the equivalent of what
      we’ve just seen in Canada, win, because that wouldn’t be democratic. That wouldn’t
      be pro-NATO. That would be Putin’s puppet. And yet the AfD has been increasing
      its popularity week after week after week. So, as the European voters are voting
      against the war, and in England you’re having Starmer going way, way down – for
      tying himself to Trump – each week and month. And you’re having the third party,
      that had been the anti-Euro party, gaining votes. So you’re having the European
      voters doing just exactly what the Canadian voters did. And yet you have the European
      Constitution is such a rotten creation of CIA lawyers that the European Constitution
      has placed power not in who the voters vote for domestically, but in the EU leadership
      where they have, as we have, as we’ve said before, von der Leyen leading, and
      the crazy Estonian lady beating for war. I think Richard did begin by mentioning
      the GDP. Something very important there. It is not simply that the GDP of China
      and Asia and the BRICS are going up. It’s that the GDP is going up. And the American
      GDP is going down. And you’re going to see that in the statistical reports that
      are coming out, for an obvious reason. Given the fact that trade with China and
      other countries is interrupted, this means that companies are drawing down their
      inventories, if they’re not able to get goods from China. They have a lot of inventories
      that we’ve saved up, including inventories of rare earths that we have a one-month
      supply in America. If you look at the components of the GDP, inventories are a
      very major indication. It used to be back in the 1960s, when I was an economist,
      all of the economists and the newspapers, the press, would look not only at GDP,
      they’d look at the composition of the GDP, what elements are going up, what elements
      are going down. And inventories are always very, very important. Well, right now,
      as America is drawing down its inventories, instead of importing from China, that
      counts as a decline in GDP. And you can be sure that the GDP figures are going
      to go down. It still bewilders me as to why the stock market is going up in all
      of this. And that’s going up, apparently, because of NASDAQ, primarily, because
      of the technology monopoly. And I don’t see how this will be very helpful. Regarding
      the inventories, Trump had his Marie Antoinette moment yesterday. He said, “So,
      we don’t export the dolls from China we used to. So, now girls are only going
      to have two dolls to play with, not twenty.” I wonder what percentile he’s referring
      to that has twenty dolls, instead of others. I mean, that was essentially his
      version of “let them eat cake.” That is imagining that everybody is already, the
      Americans are so affluent that somehow they already have enough. They don’t need
      the imports from China. But you’re seeing that the imports from China won’t come.
      And I don’t see China giving into the United States, although there was some hint
      that spurred the stock market to go up this morning, that somehow China was going
      to look for a rapprochement. I don’t see that at all. I think China realizes that
      when Trump says China’s our number one enemy, all of our economy, all of our war
      is geared towards hurting China, that he means it. And that the negotiations that
      he’s planning on making over the next three months with other countries, to free
      themselves from these enormous tariffs America has done, is all conditional upon
      their getting these countries not to trade with China, or with Russia. And as
      Richard said, there’s some fear among some countries: Well, who’s going to give
      in to Trump first? Are they going to take our position? But basically, I don’t
      think there’s that much of a problem. The choice is between: Are you going to
      shift your trade arrangements to countries that are growing and that make steady
      agreements that are firm and not subject to the kind of change that Trump has?
      Or are you going to tie your trade to an economy that is shrinking, that is blocking
      trade, and that whatever agreement you think you’ve made for the next three months
      will be subject to the kind of change that is happening every single week in the
      United States. So I think that the changes that Trump has made is not simply something
      that can be reversed, something that, okay, that deal wasn’t made. We made a big
      ask, but we always make a big ask, so that we can back down and settle in the
      midpoint, which is what we wanted from the beginning anyway. And I don’t think
      that’s going to work anymore. I don’t think people are going to settle for the
      midpoint. They’re going to reject the whole kind of negotiation that’s been taking
      place in trade. And I think they’ve already realized there’s going to be a change
      in trade patterns. I think India is very critical in all this, especially with
      the problems with Pakistan that they’re having. And the Americans have been trying
      to ally with India on this. It’s one of the countries caught in the middle. Turkey
      is caught in the middle. These are the flashpoints, I think, that you have to
      look at. RICHARD WOLFF: If I could add something about Europe. The reason – I’m
      going to state it bluntly – the reason that the Europeans lined up and gung-ho
      to help Zelensky and Ukraine is because they have to show their people that they
      are not the puppets of Mr. Trump. All of the people of Europe hate Mr. Trump now.
      They understand that the tariffs and everything else, plus what he says, is a
      denigration of Europe, a willingness to throw them under the bus, to utilize trade
      deals with them, to squeeze them every which way he thinks is appropriate, to
      snatch Greenland, if he can, to take over the Panama Canal, to make Canada the
      fifty– These are all assaults on everything that the Europeans– These politicians
      are desperate. They have to show that they are not the puppets of Mr. Trump, because
      they are, and they always have been. And the way to do that is to be very strong
      on something that looks like a disagreement with Mr. Trump. And Ukraine was the
      only option. So, we are going to stand firm with Ukraine. We are going to send
      our troops. A silly joke. They don’t have the troops. The Russians would make
      short shrift of them. It’s silly. But it is the desperate behavior of politicians
      who know that given Mr. Trump’s assault on them, and given their pro-American
      credentials developed over a lifetime, they’re going down. And this is a life
      raft, this Ukraine. So, yeah, they will spend the money. They will change the
      rules of Europe so that the European Union can borrow money. The Germans had to
      do that as part of their rearmament program. What is this? This is desperate behavior.
      They can’t commit Germany for the next eight years. This government may not last
      eight months. And everything they do can be undone by the next one. So the reality
      is that this is, again, political theater in a desperate situation. Here’s another
      dimension. When Mr. Trump disrupts global trade by putting a tariff on everybody,
      it is well understood that this changes all of the global supply chains. We don’t
      know where the ships are going to go. We don’t know which ship is going to be
      empty on one step of its route, so it can’t go from here to there, because even
      if it had to carry a freight to go there, it doesn’t have a comparable freight
      to come back, because of the– So, if you’re involved with a globalized supply
      chain, you are in trouble. You’re going to have multiple tariff effects added
      on to one another, and you’re going to have extreme uncertainty. China and the
      BRICS is where the manufacturing supply chain moved to over the last forty years.
      They need the international supply routes least of all. People misunderstand.
      Do they depend on exports? Yes, to a remarkable extent. Does that vulnerabilize
      them to supply chain problems? Yes, to some extent. But the irony is, most of
      the manufacturing in the world needs inputs from far away. China does not. China
      has internalized all of that to a remarkable extent. That offsets their dependence
      on global supply chains. But for Europe and America, nothing offsets it. They
      have denuded themselves of the components of the supply chain. They are totally
      vulnerable. American automobile Mary Barra of General Motors and the fellow at
      the head of Ford have been busily explaining, both to the press and to the Congress,
      the complicated supply chains that their car production is dependent on. That’s
      why they have to be involved in all of it. Even for the cars made in America,
      their dependence on supply chains is what we’ve been doing for the last half-century.
      Meanwhile, China has been gathering into itself and even more into its BRICS allies,
      so they’re not vulnerable in the same way. Nobody seems to be able to put that
      together. And what that means is when you do it, you end up with the following
      remarkable guess that this disruption of the world economy is more costly to the
      West and America than it is to China. China is in a better position to cope with
      this than we are. And we’re doing it. This is like having a duel with a skilled
      swordsperson, and you never touched one. And when the duel is arranged, they ask
      you, what weapons do you choose? And you choose swords. And that’s crazy because
      the other guy is an expert. This tariff game of Trump has to be the act of a person
      who never either thought it through, or who never listened to the advisors who
      explain to him, here’s the cost if you do that. And there again, you’re watching–
      Whoa. Whoa. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it’s political theater, but it’s political theater
      with the real-world consequences that you’ve pointed out. And these consequences
      are irreversible. And that’s the point. Once he’s done what he’s done, once he
      has done the tariff policy and shifted his war policy, this cannot be rolled back.
      You can’t say, oh, I made a mistake, I’m going back, as Trump has done with the
      tariffs. He can roll back the tariffs for the automobiles with Canada and say,
      well, we’re going to permit the Canadian auto parts to be imported without a tariff
      so that the supply chain will not be interrupted. But it’s all about the supply
      chain. He may fix it with the tariffs. He may fix other supply chains with– For
      instance, he said we won’t bother with having Apple lose its supply chains for
      its iPhones, they can all trade. He can try to then have walk-backs of individual
      parts, but he can’t walk back the entire deal. And there are so many supply chains
      besides the big Apple chain and the big automobile tariff chain that there’s going
      to be disruptions. And that’s why yesterday, two days ago, UPS said, well, we’re
      laying off 20,000 delivery people because the ships are not landing in the ports
      full of goods to be downloaded and distributed now. There’s been the huge government
      supply chains of officials that have been fired under Musk that are playing critical
      roles. They’ve been putting all of the medical test animals to death because he’s
      canceled the research into medicine that have been using animals. So all of these,
      all of these supply, not only a supply chain is interrupted, that leads to layoffs
      of labor. That leads to unemployment. It means claims for unemployment insurance.
      It means that there’s an enormous shrinkage within the labor force. And even if
      the Dow Jones average and the stock market’s going up, the labor market is going
      down. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, I would like to add, I looked into it the last couple
      of days. As of May 1st, if the statistics are correct, about 120,000 federal employees
      have been fired. And another unknown number of thousands have either taken a voluntary
      buyout, that’s not included in the 120,000 fired, or have been “placed on administrative
      leave.” And that, it is explained, that’s not in the 120,000. So those are x,
      I don’t know the number, I couldn’t find it, x-thousand beyond. All right. Every
      agency has a minimum of ten percent. Some of the larger agencies, the largest
      single agency of the federal government is the veterans administration. They’re
      scheduled for a fifteen percent cut. That’s 70,000 workers. And already they’re
      announcing cutbacks. The most recent one announced today is this program – it’s
      a little program, but it gives you an idea of what Michael was pointing to. It’s
      a little program that helps veterans who fall behind in their mortgage payments
      and so therefore are at threat of foreclosure from the banks. There used to be
      a government program that would step in and help them, either take over the mortgage
      – which I believe they did – or refinance one, etc. All of that’s being cut back,
      which now threatens – and listen to these numbers – which now threatens tens of
      thousands of veterans currently behind in their mortgage payments. They’re going
      to lose their homes, which puts burdens on mental health facilities, physical
      health facilities, communities where veterans are concentrated like Southern California,
      and so on and so on. None of this is being dealt– It’s as if there’s no problem.
      You know what kind of society functions like this? The kinds of societies we used
      to say, wrongly, but we used to call Third World countries, places where there’s
      a capital city or two, where you get kind of Western standards of living, and
      then a vast ocean around them of desperate poverty, where there’s no transportation
      and no health care and no education system that most people can afford. You’re
      watching the end of an empire when the people at the top hold on to the great
      wealth that the empire gave them, that they don’t want to lose, understandably.
      So they push the burden off onto those who can’t help themselves. So a country
      that gives Elon Musk $300 billion of personal wealth will not help a veteran who
      can’t find a mortgage for three months. I mean, do you need more than that? And
      you know, if this is correct, then the only real question is how long the American
      people will tolerate what we are living through. And if I were at the top, that’s
      what I’d be worrying about. And that’s probably a clue as to why I’m not at the
      top. MICHAEL HUDSON: If only the Americans had a choice. And there really isn’t
      a choice. The Democrats are saying, well, we’re not Trump. But they are Trump.
      They’re the same policy as Trump. Trump’s doing to the working class what the
      Democrats dreamed of doing but couldn’t do, basically. So there really isn’t an
      alternative here. As we’ve said before, do we need a third party? We need some
      solution that is not on the spectrum right now. I don’t know what that solution
      will be, but it’s going to be not the Republicans and not the Democrats. That’s
      what’s open. What on earth is going to be the solution? I don’t see a solution.
      I see just a continual shrinkage of the similar party, no matter which party or
      which president is in power. I don’t see a change in this policy. I think that
      the military is going to be gaining with the war in Ukraine and against China
      and against the Baltics here, as it is in Germany. But that’s not going to be
      the economy. The stock market isn’t the economy. The economy is going to be left
      just in the way that you described, Richard. It’s going to be a mess. And the
      voters are not going to have much to say about it. RICHARD WOLFF: No. And one
      of the reasons we have been talking, and I believe it’s the correct thing, we’ve
      been talking about a declining empire as a larger context for much of the particulars.
      I think it is very, very significant that it’s only people like us who talk like
      that. If you listen to Republicans or the Democrats, not a word. Everything is
      reduced to this detail or that. They won’t cut the veterans as badly as the Republicans
      do. They won’t. That’s it. We are Trump light. You know, you don’t want to drink
      Pepsi, drink Pepsi light. You don’t want Trump, vote– That’s what they did in
      Canada. That’s what they are going to be doing in Europe in the elections to come.
      At least I think so. That’s what’s certainly worrying the leading politicians
      there. But no one said– You know, Biden didn’t say a word about a declining empire.
      Trump didn’t say a word. And Kamala Harris didn’t say a word. None of them can
      even entertain a larger context. For them, there is no contextual problem. The
      larger everything is, okay. It’s just we have to adjust our, minor navigation–
      It’s the attempt of people who are fundamentally supports of the status quo: a
      little this, a little that, center left, center right. Mr. Trump gained office
      by suggesting he wasn’t part of that broader consensus, but he was, and he’s proving
      it to us now. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah. Thank you so much, Richard and Michael for
      being with us today. Great pleasure as always. RICHARD WOLFF: Same here. Talk
      to you soon. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Talk to you soon. Bye-bye. Bye-bye Thank you. Photo

      of May Day as a global celebration of the working class's rights, struggles, and
      achievements, rooted in its historical origins from the labor movement in the
      United States.
    paragraph_summary: On May 1, 2025, Nima Alkhorchid hosts Richard Wolff and Michael
      Hudson to discuss the significance of May Day, a day historically dedicated to
      honoring the struggles and rights of the working class worldwide. Wolff explains
      that May Day originated from a pivotal labor demonstration in Chicago in 1886,
      where workers fought for an eight-hour workday against the prevailing ten- to
      twelve-hour workdays imposed by capitalism, which seeks to maximize profits by
      extending working hours. The day has since evolved into a global celebration marked
      by parades and demonstrations led by labor unions and political parties advocating
      for workers' rights, reflecting on both the achievements and ongoing challenges
      faced by the working class.

      Today is Thursday, May 1st, 2025, and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Alton
      and Mark Dydas. Welcome back, Richard. Nice. Glad to be here. Yeah. Richard, today,
      what’s the importance of today? And you mentioned before coming on live, and I
      think you have something to say for all of us. RICHARD WOLFF: Yes. Well, May Day,
      the 1st of May each year, has traditionally been for many, many, many years a
      day devoted to celebrating the rights and the struggles and the losses and the
      gains of the working class around the world. In many countries, there will be
      parades and demonstrations in the major cities and beyond in which labor unions,
      political parties associated with the working class show their strength, make
      their demands, celebrate their achievements. It’s a working day, working class
      holiday, if you like. It began back in 1886, if my memory is correct, here in
      the United States, in Chicago in particular, when there was a major struggle and
      a demonstration, classic struggle of the working class, in that case, demanding
      an eight-hour workday rather than the 10 or 12 hours that had become the norm.
      Because capitalism, as Marx explained so beautifully in Volume 1 of Capital, has
      a very great interest in making the length of the working day as long as physically
      and emotionally possible. He did the analysis to show why that is a profit-maximizing
      activity on the part of the ruling class. And there were workers pushed back and
      workers struggled. And it took them a long time. You know, there’s a century in
      England called the struggle for the 10-hour day to get it down to 10. Well, this
      struggle in Chicago wanted to get it down further to eight. And in the course
      of that demonstration, somebody, it was never really shown who, started shooting.
      And the police started shooting. And when the dust cleared, several people had
      been shot. And there was an attempt by the local authorities to blame “anarchists.”
      That was the term of denunciation in those days. And the so-called anarchists
      were arrested and tried and found guilty, some of them, and executed. And it became
      a holiday to memorialize both the struggle and the repression and the sacrifices
      that had been made. And the real irony of the story is that even though it begins
      in a moment of intense class struggle of the United States, the post-World War
      II Cold War made it necessary for the United States Congress to not allow to change
      the date at which you celebrate workers from May 1st to the first Monday in September,
      what we call Labor Day here in the United States, on a different date. And it
      has been largely neglected more and more over recent years. For example, when
      I was young, there was always a parade wherever I happened to live on Labor Day.
      Nowadays, in most of the cities of this country, nothing happens on Labor Day.
      The movement here, the labor movement, even the organized labor movement, doesn’t
      have the personnel, the time, the space, the money to carry on that particular
      tradition. So it tells you something about the United States relative to the rest
      of the world to know a little bit  about the May 1st holiday, both here and abroad.
      NIMA ALKHORSHID: Michael, do you want to add something? MICHAEL HUDSON: I have
      nothing to add to that. Of course, when I grew up, many of my friends would go
      on demonstrations on May Day, but that was in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
      And it’s just sort of evaporated now. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah. Jumping into the
      what’s going on right now, and with the new deal, the mineral deal between the
      United States and Ukraine, what is the way that Donald Trump sees the situation
      with Ukraine? [clip start] DONALD TRUMP: The real number is about $350 billion.
      That’s unthinkable. And we had no security. We had no nothing. We were just pouring
      money there, unsecured money, putting it in banks, and anybody could have taken
      it out. You know, anybody over there. It was their decision. I’ve never seen anything
      like it. Europe, on the other hand, which it’s obviously that whole situation
      is much more important to Europe because we have an ocean in between. But Europe
      gave about $100 billion. It’s a lot of money. It’s a big sacrifice they made also.
      But they gave much less than we did. And their money is secured, totally secured
      by deposits in banks. The deposits are largely Russian deposits. That’s what Europe
      did. But their money is secured. So they gave $100 billion totally secured. We
      gave money like it’s throwing it out the window. And it was done by Biden. And
      this is Biden’s war. This isn’t Trump’s war. I’m trying to get out. And more than
      the money, they’re losing about 5,000 young Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week,
      mostly. There’s some people also being killed in towns where missiles should not
      have been shot, small cities and towns. But we are trying to save the lives of
      about 5,000 young, mostly soldiers that are losing their lives a week. I see satellite
      photos. Probably one of his satellites come to think of it. But I see satellite
      photos every week of fields with arms and heads and legs scattered all over. It’s
      a violent, violent, horrible situation. And more important than the money, I want
      to save the lives of people from other countries that are dying so stupidly, so
      needlessly. And they’re dying. But I said, what are we doing? How did we get into
      this war? It would have never happened if I were president. [clip end] NIMA ALKHORSHID:
      Richard, what do you want to say? RICHARD WOLFF: Well, I’m always blown away by
      watching that man, I must say. It’s rather stunning. He clearly makes all of this
      up as he goes along. Unlike the rest of us, he doesn’t seem to be constrained
      by checking whether the fact is the fact, whether what he heard from this one
      or that one is consistent with what other, you know, none of those things that
      worry the rest of us seem to annoy this fellow. You know, we put in $350 billion.
      Detail. Most of that money was spent by the United States government on United
      States corporations and individuals. That’s where most of that money always goes.
      It goes to large corporations that have nice contracts with the defense department
      and will pick up the money. It’s American money funding the American economy by
      means of the war over there. It’s not money “somehow gone.” And then to say that
      Europeans spent only 100 billion, which is secured. It’s secured by the deposits
      of Russia that are illegal. The Europeans, by the way, have not in fact touched
      them because legally they have been told by their own lawyers that they can’t
      do that. They have to attach the interest earned on that deposit, but not the
      deposits themselves. And so, it’s not correct to say they’re secured. They’re
      very insecure. And then finally, he’s making a deal because he’s so upset by death.
      Well, a few miles away, I can show him much more horrific pictures of dead people
      and dead children in Gaza that doesn’t seem to bother him at all. But the ones
      in Ukraine, these are really kind of, what in the world are we talking about?
      And then you ask us, which is fine, to talk about the new agreement. I mean, the
      agreement is between the United States that has no claim on Ukraine at all. And
      the Ukraine government that, you know, was out of power by its own constitution
      many months ago. Mr. Zelensky, he’s not a constitutional government. He has no
      right to sign anything unless he has an election. He hasn’t had an election. None
      of this mattered. This is all political theater here. The British having a deal
      with Zelensky, possibly including the same rare earths. No one knows what the
      value of all of that is. I mean, this is posturing. And the reason is because
      the parties involved cannot come to an agreement. They’ve been trying for three
      months. And since Mr. Trump took office, I want to remind people he promised he
      could and would bring the Ukraine war to an end in a day. Okay, here we are 100-plus
      days later. And he hasn’t done it. It’s not entirely his fault. I get that. But
      I mean, either you boast or you don’t, if you can’t get it done, don’t boast that
      you will. If you do boast, you got to do a little more than was done here. The
      best guess I have, and certainly this is the majority view of the press in Europe
      that I look at, is that the United States has made the decision to walk away from
      this conflict. That whatever efforts it made between the opposition of the Russians
      and the opposition of the Ukrainians, the United States is not going to force
      it on the two of them, between you and me. That’s because it couldn’t. But in
      any case, it isn’t going to try, and it therefore is going to walk away. And it
      will, of course, blame the Ukrainians and the Russians, because Mr. Trump always
      blames somebody else for whatever it is that goes wrong. And the American people
      will be treated to this theater again. And the great question, which has been
      the great question all along, is how many Americans will, for how long, accept
      and tolerate what is going on? That’s the only issue. The rest of it is details.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the devil’s in the details. And I think that if you look
      at the details, Trump has just made the war his war with an exclamation point.
      I think he realized that the terms that he had defended Ukraine against Russia
      were not acceptable to Russia. Russia made it very clear from the beginning what
      its terms were. And Trump realized that his attempt to make a peace agreement
      with a ceasefire, enabling Ukraine to rearm against Russia and enabling the Europeans,
      NATO people, to move their arms into Russia, was such a no-go that the whole fantasy
      that Trump had that he could sweet talk Putin into making an agreement, in the
      belief that somehow Russia had to do it, is over. So if you look at what is this
      deal that was signed? I spent a little time reading the Financial Times and the
      other columns. It’s not about rare earths. That’s the cover story. It’s not really
      even about minerals. It’s about the Americans protecting any investment they make
      with anti-aircraft missiles. And the missiles, of course, can go all the way into
      Russia. So what seems to be a U.S. plan to try to develop rare earths and lithium
      deposits, most of which are in the Russian zone, really is only a cover story
      for the rest of the agreement. That’s often how the United States makes an agreement.
      There will be something at the very end saying, “And other purposes,” or an opener.
      And the agreement means that the actual military solution will be on the battlefield.
      There’s not going to be a negotiated agreement because Ukraine won’t negotiate
      with Russia. Then any negotiated agreement would mean that Russia gives up the
      territories that it already has to some future agreement. But also, there are
      many devils in the details that now, if somehow Trump is not able to get for his
      backers, such as Blackstone. And by the way, the imminent German Prime Chancellor
      is going to head work for Blackstone before and is virulently anti-Russian. The
      German new military foreign minister is more anti-Russian than Annalena Baerbock
      was. This agreement is a step towards an escalation of the Russian war. There’s
      no attempt at peace. And it looks like you’re going to have Germany and England
      come into the war, and America is going to continue to provide defense for Ukraine.
      And that defense takes the form of guiding Ukrainian missiles, Ukrainian drones,
      Ukrainian attacks. So the United States has just recommitted itself to Ukraine.
      And by claiming that somehow this is going to benefit America, this is how Trump
      has rationalized with Congress the fact that this new Trump war is much more economically
      in America’s favor than Biden was able to make. And it’s a very aggressive act.
      America’s essentially joined Germany, England, and NATO in making a deal whose
      details are designed to prevent any kind of a negotiated peace, and leave the
      aftermath for after Russia conquers the rest of Ukraine. Once the rainy season
      finishes and the ground is hard enough that the tanks can go in, this is to set
      up the war. And the war is not only about Ukraine. Most of the Russian military
      buildup has been aimed to defend itself against the Baltic attacks on Russia.
      The Baltics are trying to prevent Russian access to the sea to get to the ocean.
      They’re planning on creating problems for Kaliningrad right in the middle of Lithuania.
      It looks to me like there’s just been a set-up for a large military escalation.
      NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, here is what the Kyiv Post reported. Right after the
      deal being signed by the two parties, the Trump administration had agreed to the
      first armed export to Ukraine for $50 million. And he tries to say that this war
      is Biden’s war, it’s not mine. But we know that he was supporting, before Biden
      came into office, he was supporting Ukraine. He was sending a lot of weapons to
      Ukraine. He’s bragging about that. Why is he just removing himself from the scene
      that it’s all on Biden and I have nothing to do with Ukraine? RICHARD WOLFF: Well,
      I mean, this isn’t consistent with his behavior. I mean, Michael and I may disagree
      a little bit. I understand what Michael just said. That is certainly one possible
      understanding of what’s going on. I see the logic of his argument. I think Mr.
      Trump is torn. And I’m not surprised. If you remember, Mr. Biden, for example,
      ran a campaign against Mr. Trump, clearly implying on many occasions that his
      war against China had to be rethought. And yet when he came in, Mr. Biden kept
      most of the tariffs against China and indeed raised the number of them outdoing
      Mr. Trump on the very issue where he implied that he would not have done what
      Mr. Trump did or outright criticized him for it. All we’re seeing now is the same
      thing. Mr. Trump would like to be, and this seems to me clear, he would like to
      be the president who ended Biden’s war and saved the United States, the money
      and the blah, blah, blah, and the loss of face and the failure in the war that,
      that, you know, is what Ukraine is. It’s a lost war. He would like that. On the
      other hand, he gets an enormous amount of pushback and not just from the Democratic
      Party, but from that part of the Republican Party that always went along with
      the Cold War, that always went along with the demonization of Putin. Look at the
      speech, the speeches of that strange man, the senator, you know, from North Carolina.
      It’s just a bizarre expression. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Lindsey Graham? RICHARD WOLFF:
      Yeah, Lindsey Graham. Sorry, I blocked his name out for obvious reasons. Anyway,
      the, the, the situation means that he wobbles back and forth. He would like to
      drop Mr. Zelensky in the toilet. He’s made enough statements to that. He called
      him a dictator, called him unelected. He did things that people in that position
      do not do unless they’re just as soon see that person disappear. Right? And everybody
      who’s critical has noted that he’s more friendly to Putin than he is to, to, uh,
      Zelensky. And that seems to me to be the case. But then when he’s frustrated,
      when it turns out he cannot get from Zelensky what he wants and he can’t force
      it, not in a position to do that, partly because the Europeans are taking a different
      position and partly because they are furious at him for creating the vulnerability
      that the European leaders now have. They are all alone out there in this Ukraine
      war. They’re all alone having hitched their entire careers to being patsies for
      the United States. And now the United States leaves them out there hanging. They
      are, they’re in trouble and they’re worried about their political futures as they
      should be. So he’s got a lot of counter to himself. Much of it’s his own doing.
      But in making it impossible, he can’t end the war. He can’t go against the Russians
      as much as he wants to or would like to. He can’t go against Zelensky and force
      it. He’s stuck. And so he wobbles. And I think he wobbles one day in the direction
      of Michael’s interpretation. And he wobbles the next day more in the direction
      of what I’m saying or others are saying. And we don’t know where he’s going to
      end up because he doesn’t. He doesn’t know, you know, maybe Mr. Putin will come
      up with some solution that he can then buy into. But at this point, he’s exhausted.
      You know, he sent over a team, which as best one can see, between the old general,
      whose name I’ve also blocked out, and his ally, Witkoff, the real estate dealer
      in New York. Witkoff is tilting in one direction, the old general in another direction.
      And he’s listening to this. And he doesn’t know which way to go. He’s not even
      interested that much. He would like this albatross off his back. And he can’t
      get it. And therefore, he wobbles. And he hopes something will happen. And he
      gets upset when the Russians send missiles into Ukraine. And he gets upset if
      the Ukrainians send their missiles until someone tells him that it was the American
      advisors over there who actually sent the missile. And then he gets upset that
      he didn’t know that. There is a tendency to think, because of our ideological
      society, that what the government is doing is a careful, worked out, logical,
      organized plan of action. It isn’t. It is a more than even normal, and normally
      it isn’t. But with Trump, it’s especially chaotic, partly because he doesn’t want
      anyone who could threaten him. He wants the freedom to do whatever he wants. He
      reasons correctly that he has been able to become the president on that basis.
      Why should he change? So he’s not going to change. He’s going to do it the way
      it strikes him at the moment. Look at what he’s done with the tariffs. I’ll use
      him as an example. He has around him economic advisors. I know some of them. They
      have explained to him the following simple economic truth. Investment of money
      is something handled by employers. Employers are 3% of the population of the United
      States. The rest of us, 97%, are not employers. Okay? So the advisors tell him
      that the single most important determinant of investment is the probability of
      it being profitable. If it’s profitable and there’s a good probability of it,
      you make an investment. If it’s profitable but it’s too uncertain, you hold back.
      If Mr. Trump raises a tariff one day, lowers it the next day, exempt somebody
      from it one day, exempt someone else the next day. What you’re doing is teaching
      the world that it is uncertain, any profitability calculus you make, which means
      they’re going to hold back, which means you’re going to have a recession. This
      is not good. The problem is Mr. Trump wants to be the focus of attention. He wants
      Mary Barra of General Motors to call up and say, I can’t make any plan with General
      Motors. It’s going to hurt our plant, our factories in Michigan, in Kentucky,
      in Tennessee. And that’s going to hurt your base, Mr. Trump. And they’re going
      to blame you, Mr. Trump, unless you give me an exemption from these tariffs, Mr.
      Trump. He loves that the heads of General Motors call him up, that they want to
      talk to him, that they want to plead, that they offer to support him in God knows
      what ways to get the lack of uncertainty resolved for them. And he gives that
      to them. He wants them to call him again next week or next month, which they will.
      You know why? Because he’s changed what he had to say from Monday to Thursday.
      This contradiction between his role as president, the unknowable, the great saver
      of the country, whose magical powers of making a deal will bring, he loves this.
      But you can’t run a government like that if investment is in the hands of a tiny
      group of people who live and die every day, like you, me, and Michael do, reading
      the headlines to try to get a sense of what’s going on. I’m not responsible for
      billions of dollars of investment. I’m not responsible for all the jobs. But Mary
      Barra at General Motors, or the people running Ford, or any of the others are.
      Look, orders three weeks ago were collapsing in China for consumer goods. Last
      week, a lot of Chinese companies happily announced they’re back in production.
      Why? Because the head of Walmart, and the head of Target, and the head of a couple
      of other companies had a meeting with Mr. Trump, and he told them he would adjust
      the tariffs so that they wouldn’t miss out on the shipments of goods from China,
      which are crucial for the Christmas selling season in retail America, which is
      the most important part of the year for these companies. He is changing and shifting
      one minute to the next. You can’t know that’s what he wants, and no one around
      him, including the economic advisors that I know who have told him what I’ve just
      said, can get to first base with him. He’s gonna do it the way he feels like.
      When you saw an incompetent Biden stay in the office and refuse to step down,
      you should have noticed the president can do that. He can do it for months, and
      he can do it at the expense of his political party. That’s the way American individualism
      always works. It will, in the end, undo the country that celebrates it as its
      extraordinary strength. It’s Hegel again. That individualism will make you strong
      in some circumstances and make you collapse in others. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I
      want to start by getting back to the original question and the point that you
      made about Ukraine. I think that Trump said the following: “We’re going to continue
      Biden’s war. It will be my war, but we’re going to make money off it.” But that’s
      the twist that he’s done. He said it’s okay to keep fighting the war if we can
      make money. The mineral steal is a fig leaf to pretend that we can make money
      that conceals the military buildup and the renewed American pressure on Russia.
      I think that, as you pointed out in your beginning remark, you said there’s the
      problem between Kellogg, who is a pro-Biden, anti-Russian general, who had a fantasy
      idea that Russia needed, that Russia was weakening, that Russia was about to collapse
      economically, and that Russia would accept whatever proposal Trump made. And there
      was Vitkoff, who actually was visiting with Russia and was reality-based. Trump
      didn’t like the reality-based description by Vitkoff. He liked the fantasy that
      Kellogg had, the anti-Russian fantasy that, yes, America can come out on top of
      Russia. That’s what Trump always believes. We have to be the winner. And the deal
      on developing resources, is so open-ended that he hopes nobody will get to the
      military protection of the resources, meaning that whatever deal that England
      has made and that NATO countries, European countries have made, the American deal
      supersedes all that, and that it’s not the NATO countries, Europe that’s going
      to have any role to play. It’s the Americans. And one of the aspects of the deal
      that Trump emphasized was that no country that has dealt with Russia and broken
      the American sanctions in Russia can have any economic deal made with Ukraine
      for the resources. This is the Cold War with an exclamation point. Trump has just
      gone much more hard line than even the Biden Democrats had wanted to do. This
      is a really serious saying that, well, Russia didn’t surrender, so now we’re going
      to show you Russia. Now we’re going to have the really heavy war. You think you
      can beat Ukraine? And that it’s all over? And that you’re going to be able to
      conquer it? Well, wait till you see what we’re going to do now. So I think that
      what Trump has done is really much more than just wishy-washy. He’s made a step-change
      in the whole system towards war. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah. By the way, what’s going
      on in Europe is so much important. Richard and Michael, right now, Financial Times
      reported that the European Union prepares Plan B should Trump walk away from Ukraine.
      What’s going on in Ukraine? It seems that on one hand, there’s so much concern
      about Donald Trump leaving the war in Ukraine. On the other hand, if he lets the
      American companies go to Russia, and what would be the future of Europe? What
      is this huge loss on the part of Europe? Because they’re losing Russia. On one
      hand, they’re not getting cheap energy from Russia. And the United States, which
      was the main party in this conflict in Ukraine, is leaving the scene. And they’re
      trying to repair their sort of relationship with Russia. How do you see, Richard,
      the way that the European Union or European countries are seeing the conflict
      in Ukraine? RICHARD WOLFF: In my judgment, the Europeans are in a state for which
      the only word I can think of is desperation. They are finished. Europe is the
      fall guy in all of this. The world is shaping up as a declining empire of the
      G7 on the one hand, led by the United States, and the rising empire of China allied
      with the BRICS. The Chinese have been working for 15 years to develop the BRICS
      as a serious alliance, and they’ve done a very good job. The United States G7
      has just been dealt a death blow by the United States turning on literally every
      one of those countries. Canada, maybe not Japan, but even there’s the first time
      rumblings of a dissent from their subordination to the United States. And the
      Europeans are, of course, upset in different ways. The only thing holding Europe
      together now, the only thing, is the terrible fear each of them has about the
      other one cutting a deal with the United States to end up being the favored one.
      You could watch Maloney trying to make that Italy. You can watch Starmer desperate
      to figure out how to avoid the United States shifting to Italy rather than using
      Britain as the lap dog that it has done for all these years. They can’t get together,
      and without that they can’t do anything about their situation. They can make whatever
      plans they want. It doesn’t matter. Michael may be right about General Kellogg.
      I mean, we do have to remember that if you’re a person raised in the Cold War,
      which all of us more or less have been, or the legacy of it, then you think of
      Russia as this enormous event. But if you’re an economist, you know that the GDP
      of the United States is in the neighborhood of $25, $27, $28 trillion, and the
      GDP of Russia is in the neighborhood of $3 or $4 trillion. This is an elephant
      and a mouse. And so, of course, in the minds of the general from the elephant
      country, there is the notion we can always exhaust Russia. We did get rid of the
      Soviet Union by exhausting it in an arms race it could not afford, in a takeover
      in Afghanistan, which it could not afford, in the cutting back of their consumer
      society, which they could politically not afford. So we’re not going to do it
      again. They’re going to do it again, this time with sanctions. And so, sure, the
      mechanisms shift. Russia is a nuclear danger. That has to be taken. But what they’re
      not considering is the biggest mistake of all, Russia has the BRICS. That’s how
      they dealt with the energy problem. They could stop selling oil and gas, not 100%,
      but the bulk of it, to Europe, and sell it to China and India. I don’t want to
      make it too simple, but it isn’t all that complicated. And they’re not going to
      be able to force the Russians into any of their fantasies. I want to remind you,
      Russia was supposed to collapse. Putin was supposed to be kicked out. The ruble
      was supposed to disintegrate. None of that happened. None of it. Not even a little.
      And by the way, they never speak about it. It’s as if that history never happened.
      It’s up to us as critics to remind them of the total nonsense of their strategic
      thinking that they shared with us. Look, it’s possible that the British will read
      the agreement that Michael has been talking about, the way Michael has, and understand
      it to be a maneuver rendering the deal they made with Zelensky null and void.
      What are they then going to do? This is another declaration of war, like imposing
      tariffs on their aluminum and steel and all the rest of it. They are being told
      that as the American empire struggles to slow down its own decline, sacrificing
      Europe is perfectly okay. So, look, they didn’t react to the election two days
      ago in Canada, in which a political party that was far behind in the polls turned
      Mr. Trump into a winning strategy. The man running for them, the old Bank of England
      director, gave the middle finger to Mr. Trump. That was his whole campaign. And
      he won. And he won by plenty. Even in Quebec, with their own native son, French-speaking
      fellow, they couldn’t get off the ground. Quebecois voted against Trump. This
      is a sign. If it can happen in Canada, what’s going to happen in the elections
      coming up in Europe when candidates begin to smell the opportunities of running
      a campaign against Trump? If you’re going to run against Trump, you’re going to
      get a lot of votes. And if you force Mr. Starmer or Mr. Macron or the Germans
      to be the pro-Trump, uh-oh, that’s very dangerous for them. They must know that.
      And so you see, they don’t know what to do. They can’t back away from Ukraine
      because they’ve made that their whole career. They can’t really back away from
      Trump because that’s their whole life. That’s who they are. That’s why they’re
      in power. They ran against neoliberal globalization to get into power. In other
      words, it was the American plan for the world that gave them their chance. They
      can’t betray that now. They wouldn’t know where to go. They couldn’t speak about
      it. But there will be politicians. There already are politicians in all those
      countries, inside their parties and on the left, both, who are going to make life
      very difficult for them in the years ahead. And that’s no matter what happens
      in the Ukraine. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the problem is how do they escape from this
      fantasy that Richard has explained? And he’s quite right to bring it up. The fantasy
      was a paper written, I think, by a Hudson Institute neocon, who, that actually
      said the Russian economy is about to collapse. If only we can make it spend enough
      on the military that it’ll be a replay of the Soviet Union collapsing under the
      military. That was explicit. It was said that there will be a regime change. If
      we fight against Russia, the Russian people will want to overthrow Putin and we’ll
      have the regime change. We can have another Boris Yeltsin there. That was explicitly
      the plan. And there was no plan B. They were stuck into it. And that’s been the
      plan for the last few years. And that’s the plan that the current European leaders
      are committed to. Remember that Europe is a democracy. And a democracy means you
      don’t let parties, voters vote for parties that are not considered pro-American.
      Because democracy means Cold War. Democracy means NATO. Democracy means military
      spending. And military spending means class war. That if Germany spends the 700
      or 800 billion euros on re-arming, that money is no longer going to be available
      for social spending. Military Keynesianism essentially means the end of social
      democracy, the end of social spending. That’s why Germany cannot let the Alternative
      for Deutschland Party, which is the equivalent of what we’ve just seen in Canada,
      win. Because that wouldn’t be democratic. That wouldn’t be pro-NATO. That would
      be Putin’s puppet. And yet the AFD has been increasing its popularity week after
      week after week. So as the European voters are voting against the war and in England,
      you’re having Starmer going way, way down for tying himself to Trump each week
      and month. And you’re having the third party, that had been the anti-Euro party,
      gaining votes. So you’re having the European voters doing just exactly what the
      Canadian voters did. And yet you have the European Constitution is such a rotten
      creation of CIA lawyers that the European Constitution has placed power not in
      who the voters vote for domestically, but in the EU leadership where they have,
      as we have, as we’ve said before, von der Leyen leading and the crazy Estonian
      lady beating for war. I think Richard did begin by mentioning the GDP. Something
      very important there is not simply that the GDP of China and Asia and the BRICS
      are going up. It’s that the GDP of the United States is larger. And the American
      GDP is going down. And you’re going to see that in the statistical reports that
      are coming out for an obvious reason. Given the fact that trade with China and
      other countries is interrupted, this means that companies are drawing down their
      inventories if they’re not able to get goods from China. They have a lot of inventories
      that we’ve saved up, including inventories of rare earths that we have a one-month
      supply in America. If you look at the components of the GDP, inventories are a
      very major indication. It used to be back in the 1960s, when I was an economist,
      all of the economists and the newspapers and the press would look not only at
      GDP, they’d look at the composition of the GDP, what elements are going up, what
      elements are going down. And inventories are always very, very important. Well,
      right now, as America is drawing down its inventories, instead of importing from
      China, that counts as a decline in GDP. And you can be sure that the GDP figures
      are going to go down. It still bewilders me as to why the stock market is going
      up in all of this. And that’s going up, apparently, because of NASDAQ, primarily,
      because of the technology monopoly. And I don’t see how this will be very helpful.
      Regarding the inventories, Trump had his Marie Antoinette moment yesterday. He
      said, “So, we don’t export the dolls from China we used to. So, now girls are
      only going to have two dolls to play with, not 20.” I wonder what percentile he’s
      referring to that has 20 dolls instead of others. I mean, that was essentially
      his version of “let them eat cake.” That is imagining that everybody is already,
      the Americans are so affluent that somehow they already have enough. They don’t
      need the imports from China. But you’re seeing that the imports from China won’t
      come. And I don’t see China giving into the United States, although there was
      some hint that spurred the stock market to go up this morning that somehow China
      was going to look for a rapprochement. I don’t see that at all. I think China
      realizes that when Trump says China’s our number one enemy, all of our economy,
      all of our war is geared towards hurting China, that he means it. And that the
      negotiations that he’s planning on making over the next three months with other
      countries to free themselves from these enormous tariffs America has done is all
      conditional upon their getting these countries not to trade with China or with
      Russia. And as Richard said, there’s some fear among some countries, well, who’s
      going to give in to Trump first? Are they going to take our position? But basically,
      I don’t think there’s that much of a problem. The choices between are you going
      to shift your trade arrangements to countries that are growing and that make steady
      agreements that are firm and not subject to the kind of change that Trump has?
      Or are you going to tie your trade to an economy that is shrinking, that is blocking
      trade, and that whatever agreement you think you’ve made for the next three months
      will be subject to the kind of change that is happening every single week in the
      United States. So I think that the changes that Trump has made is not simply something
      that can be reversed, something that, okay, that deal wasn’t made. We made a big
      ask, but we always make a big ask so that we can back down and settle in the midpoint,
      which is what we wanted from the beginning anyway. And I don’t think that’s going
      to work anymore. I don’t think people are going to settle for the midpoint. They’re
      going to reject the whole kind of negotiation that’s been taking place in trade.
      And I think they’ve already realized there’s going to be a change in trade patterns.
      I think India is very critical in all this, especially with the problems with
      Pakistan that they’re having. And the Americans have been trying to ally with
      India on this. It’s one of the countries caught in the middle. Turkey is caught
      in the middle. These are the flashpoints, I think, that you have to look at. RICHARD
      WOLFF: If I could add something about Europe. The reason, I’m going to state it
      bluntly, the reason that the Europeans lined up and were gung-ho to help Zelensky
      and Ukraine is because they have to show their people that they are not the puppets
      of Mr. Trump. All of the people of Europe hate Mr. Trump now. They understand
      that the tariffs and everything else, plus what he says, is a denigration of Europe,
      a willingness to throw them under the bus, to utilize trade deals with them, to
      squeeze them every which way he thinks is appropriate, to snatch Greenland, if
      he can, to take over the Panama Canal, to make Canada the fifth. These are all
      assaults on everything that the Europeans [stand for]. These politicians are desperate.
      They have to show that they are not the puppets of Mr. Trump, because they are,
      and they always have been. And the way to do that is to be very strong on something
      that looks like a disagreement with Mr. Trump. And Ukraine was the only option.
      So we are going to stand firm with Ukraine. We are going to send our troops. A
      silly joke. They don’t have the troops. The Russians would make short shrift of
      them. It’s silly. But it is the desperate behavior of politicians who know that
      given Mr. Trump’s assault on them, and given their pro-American credentials developed
      over a lifetime, they’re going down. And this is a life raft, this Ukraine. So
      yeah, they will spend the money. They will change the rules of Europe so that
      the European Union can borrow money. The Germans had to do that as part of their
      rearmament program. What is this? This is desperate behavior. They can’t commit
      Germany for the next eight years. This government may not last eight months. And
      everything they do can be undone by the next one. So the reality is that this
      is, again, political theater in a desperate situation. Here’s another dimension.
      When Mr. Trump disrupts global trade by putting a tariff on everybody, it is well
      understood that this changes all of the global supply chains. We don’t know where
      the ships are going to go. We don’t know which ship is going to be empty on one
      step of its route, so it can’t go from here to there, because even if it had to
      carry a freight to go there, it doesn’t have a comparable freight to come back.
      So if you’re involved with a globalized supply chain, you are in trouble. You’re
      going to have multiple tariff effects added on to one another, and you’re going
      to have extreme uncertainty. China and the BRICS is where the manufacturing supply
      chain moved to over the last 40 years. They need the international supply routes
      least of all. People misunderstand. Do they depend on exports? Yes, to a remarkable
      extent. Does that vulnerabilize them to supply chain problems? Yes, to some extent.
      But the irony is, most of the manufacturing in the world needs inputs from far
      away. China does not. China has internalized all of that to a remarkable extent.
      That offsets their dependence on global supply chains. But for Europe and America,
      nothing offsets it. They have denuded themselves of the components of the supply
      chain. They are totally vulnerable. American automobile Mary Barra of General
      Motors and the fellow at the head of Ford have been busily explaining, both to
      the press and to the Congress, the complicated supply chains that their car production
      is dependent on. That’s why they have to be involved in all of it. Even for the
      cars made in America, their dependence on supply chains is what we’ve been doing
      for the last half-century. Meanwhile, China has been gathering into itself and
      even more into its BRICS allies, so they’re not vulnerable in the same way. Nobody
      seems to be able to put that together. And what that means is when you do it,
      you end up with the following remarkable guess that this disruption of the world
      economy is more costly to the West and America than it is to China. China is in
      a better position to cope with this than we are. And we’re doing it. This is like
      having a duel with a skilled swords person. And you never touched one. And when
      the duel is arranged, they ask you, what weapons do you choose? And you choose
      swords. And that’s crazy because the other guy is an expert. This tariff game
      of Trump has to be the act of a person who never either thought it through or
      who never listened to the advisors who explain to him, here’s the cost if you
      do that. And there again, you’re watching. Whoa. Whoa. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it’s
      political theater, but it’s political theater with the real-world consequences
      that you’ve pointed out. And these consequences are irreversible. And that’s the
      point, that once he’s done what he’s done, once he has done the tariff policy
      and shifted his war policy, this cannot be rolled back. You can’t say, oh, I made
      a mistake. I’m going back as Trump has done with the tariffs. He can roll back
      the tariffs for the automobiles with Canada and say, well, we’re going to permit
      the Canadian auto parts to be imported without a tariff so that the supply chain
      will not be interrupted. But it’s all about the supply chain. He may fix it with
      the tariffs. He may fix other supply chains with, for instance, he said we won’t
      bother with having Apple lose its supply chains for its iPhones. That’s going
      to be, they can all trade. He can try to then have walkbacks of individual parts,
      but he can’t walk back the entire deal. And there are so many supply chains besides
      the big Apple chain and the big automobile tariff chain that there’s going to
      be disruptions. And that’s why yesterday, two days ago, UPS said, well, we’re
      laying off 20,000 delivery people because the ships are not landing in the ports
      full of goods to be downloaded and distributed now. There’s been the huge government
      supply chains of officials that have been fired under Musk that are playing critical
      roles. They’ve been putting all of the medical test animals to death because he’s
      canceled the research into medicine that have been using animals. So all of these,
      all of these supply items, not only a supply chain is interrupted, that leads
      to layoffs of labor. That leads to unemployment. It means claims for unemployment
      insurance. It means that there’s an enormous shrinkage within the labor force.
      And even if the Dow Jones average and the stock market’s going up, the labor market
      is going down. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, I would like to add, I looked into it the
      last couple of days. As of May 1st, if the statistics are correct, about 120,000
      federal employees have been fired. And another unknown number of thousands have
      either taken a voluntary buyout, that’s not included in the 120,000 fired, or
      have been placed, I quote, placed on administrative leave. And that it is explained
      that’s not in the 120,000. So those are x, I don’t know the number, I couldn’t
      find it, x thousand beyond, all right. Every agency has a minimum of 10 percent.
      Some of the larger agencies, the largest single agency of the federal government
      is the veterans administration. They’re scheduled for a 15 percent cut. That’s
      70,000 workers. And already they’re announcing cutbacks. The most recent one announced
      today is this program. It’s a little program, but it gives you an idea of what
      Michael was pointing to. It’s a little program that helps veterans who fall behind
      in their mortgage payments and so therefore are at threat of foreclosure from
      the banks. There used to be a government program that would step in and help them
      either take over the mortgage, which I believe they did, or refinance one, etc.
      All of that’s being cut back, and listen to these numbers, which now threatens
      tens of thousands of veterans currently behind in their mortgage payments. They’re
      going to lose their homes, which puts burdens on mental health facilities, physical
      health facilities, communities where veterans are concentrated like Southern California,
      and so on and so on. None of this is being dealt. It’s as if there’s no problem.
      You know what kind of society functions like this? The kinds of societies we used
      to say wrongly, but we used to call Third World countries places where there’s
      a capital city or two where you get kind of Western standards of living and then
      a vast ocean around them of desperate poverty where there’s no transportation
      and no health care and no education system that most people can afford. You’re
      watching the end of an empire when the people at the top hold on to the great
      wealth that the empire gave them that they don’t want to lose, understandably.
      So they push the burden off onto those who can’t help themselves. So a country
      that gives Elon Musk $300 billion of personal wealth will not help a veteran who
      can’t find a mortgage for three months. I mean, do you need more than that? And
      you know, if this is correct, then the only real question is how long the American
      people will tolerate what we are living through. And if I were at the top, that’s
      what I’d be worrying about. And that’s probably a clue as to why I’m not at the
      top. MICHAEL HUDSON: If only the Americans had a choice. And there really isn’t
      a choice. The Democrats are saying, well, we’re not Trump. But they are Trump.
      They’re the same policy as Trump. Trump’s doing to the working class what the
      Democrats dreamed of doing but couldn’t do, basically. So there really isn’t an
      alternative here. As we’ve said before, do we need a third party? We need some
      solution that is not on the spectrum right now. I don’t know what that solution
      will be, but it’s going to be not the Republicans and not the Democrats. That’s
      what’s open. What on earth is going to be the solution? I don’t see a solution.
      So I see just a continual shrinkage of the similar party, no matter which party
      or which president is in power. I don’t see a change in this policy. I think that
      the military is going to be gaining with the war in Ukraine and against China
      and against the Baltics here, as it is in Germany. But that’s not going to be
      the economy. The stock market isn’t the economy. The economy is going to be left
      just in the way that you described, Richard. It’s going to be a mess. And the
      voters are not going to have much to say about it. RICHARD WOLFF: No. And one
      of the reasons we have been talking, and I believe it’s the correct thing, we’ve
      been talking about a declining empire as a larger context for much of the particulars.
      I think it is very, very significant that it’s only people like us who talk like
      that. If you listen to Republicans or the Democrats, not a word. Everything is
      reduced to this detail or that. They won’t cut the veterans as badly as the Republicans
      do. They won’t. That’s it. We are Trump light. You know, you don’t want to drink
      Pepsi, drink Pepsi light. You don’t want Trump, vote. That’s what they did in
      Canada. That’s what they are going to be doing in Europe in the elections to come.
      At least I think so. That’s what’s certainly worrying the leading politicians
      there. But no one said, you know, Biden didn’t say a word about a declining empire.
      Trump didn’t say a word. And Kamala Harris didn’t say a word. None of them can
      even entertain a larger context. For them, there is no contextual problem. The
      larger everything is okay. It’s just we have to adjust our minor navigate. It’s
      the attempt of people who are fundamentally supports of the status quo. A little
      this, a little that, center left, center right. Mr. Trump gained office by suggesting
      he wasn’t part of that broader consensus, but he was, and he’s proving it to us
      now. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah. Thank you so much, Richard and Michael for being with
      us today. Great pleasure as always. Same here. Talk to you soon. Talk to you soon.

      of May Day as a global celebration of the working class's struggles and achievements,
      rooted in its historical origins from the labor movement in Chicago in 1886.
    paragraph_summary: On May 1, 2025, Richard Wolff, along with colleagues Michael
      Alton and Mark Dydas, discussed the significance of May Day, a day historically
      dedicated to honoring the struggles and achievements of the working class worldwide.
      Wolff highlighted that May Day originated from a pivotal 1886 demonstration in
      Chicago, where workers protested for an eight-hour workday, pushing back against
      the long hours imposed by capitalism. This day serves as a reminder of the ongoing
      fight for workers' rights, with parades and demonstrations held globally to celebrate
      labor unions and advocate for workers' demands. The conversation emphasized the
      historical context of labor struggles and the importance of solidarity among workers.

    text: 'Transcription – 2025.05.08 – Dialogue Works NIMA ALKHORSHID: Hi, everybody.
      Today is Thursday, May 8th, 2025, and our friends, Michael Hudson and Richard
      Wolff, are back with us. Welcome back. RICHARD WOLFF: Thank you. Glad to be here.
      NIMA ALKHORSHID: Let’s get started with what the U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent
      said about the conflict in Ukraine and the way of Trump’s approach to that. And
      then I’m going to ask my question to you. Let’s talk to you about this. [clip
      start] SCOTT BESSENT: Ukraine Investment Partnership, the Economic Partnership,
      was his idea, and he believed that it would do several things. One, it would create
      more leverage for him with the Russian leadership when it was time to go to them.
      So the idea was start with Ukraine, sign a deal that shows that there is no daylight
      between the U.S. and the Ukrainian people. It would be a symbol to Ukrainian people
      that the U.S. is still there. It would be a symbol to a tired American public,
      skeptical of more financial commitments, that it was possible to have a shared
      prosperity with Ukraine. And then it would, in essence, be a tacit security guarantee
      because of the economic partnership. [clip end] NIMA ALKHORSHID: Yeah, here is,
      Michael, the question to you would be, can the United States continue to rely
      on a transactional approach to foreign policy when the global powers are pursuing
      long-term structural alternatives to the United States-led order? MICHAEL HUDSON:
      It looks like other countries are reacting against this. And the effect of what
      Trump imagines is a transactional approach is actually to drive them to do deals
      with each other. And all the attention has been focused so far on this flurry
      of action during Trump’s first 100 days in office. But how much real action has
      there been? Trump’s announcements have been more of a set of threats against other
      countries. That’s not a transaction yet. And yet he’s been quickly walking back
      all of these threats. It’s as if he’s negotiating with himself, arguing himself
      back down as he sees what the foreign reaction is. So I think this morning was
      the first transaction with England. Trump’s already relented on his 25% tariffs
      on auto parts with Canada and Mexico. He’s relented on America’s imports of iPhones
      and other products from China. He’s been walking back all of his talks with European
      countries. And the effect he’s had with his transactional approach saying let’s
      make Canada the 51st state has been to reelect Mark Carney as Canadian prime minister
      on a program of let’s have a nationalistic reaction against the United States
      and see what all of our options are. So this transaction approach is if Trump
      is trying to treat international relations as a real estate deal. His strategy
      is to make an extreme demand to frighten other countries. And just making this
      demand of these enormous tariffs that he’s proposed is supposed to expand their
      mind to think, well, oh dear, this can really screw up our economies, certainly
      in the short run. And Trump’s objective is not really to get any of these claims
      at all. That’s what’s so bizarre. It’s to meet them halfway. And that compromise
      is what he wanted all along. And the compromise often has nothing to do with tariff
      rates itself. He just made a deal this morning with London. And the deal, what
      did he want from London to give up for only taxing British imports by 10% apart
      from special aluminum and steel and other add-on taxes. He wanted England to give
      special tax preference for U.S. information technology firms and the NASDAQ stocks
      that have been driving up the stock average for NASDAQ. Essentially, as we discussed
      last time, he’s threatened to use tariffs to destabilize foreign trade unless
      they basically give the U.S. a free ride. With Panama, for instance, he’s asking
      that U.S. ships not have to pay any charge at all for going through the Panama
      Canal. And that’s in response to Panama’s claim that, well, the U.S. ships are
      so much larger, we have to charge the fees according to the size and the tonnage
      and the difficulty of getting them through the canal. So far, he’s been essentially
      using tariffs not really as a way of trying to raise tax revenue, but just to
      threaten to create chaos in other countries. Well, what’s the response for all
      these transactions? It has been to make other countries rethink all of their transactions
      with each other. And the funny thing is while Trump has not done very much for
      himself, the attention, I think, should be focused on what’s happened to the other
      100 days, the other countries have been doing during these 100 days. And that’s
      where the real action has been taking place, not in Mar-a-Lago. And obviously,
      there’s a big difference in the European and Asian reactions from what Trump expected.
      He had expected other countries to be desperate to make a deal. This is just as
      he’d expected Russia to be so desperate to make a deal in Ukraine that its economy
      was collapsing, its army was losing, it had lost a million men. All of this was
      propaganda given to him by Kellogg. And it didn’t have any basis in reality at
      all. But he thought that Russia was desperate. He then came out and said, “China’s
      desperate.” Look at the financial problems that it’s having with banking and real
      estate. He thought that China was so desperate that he could make a deal with
      them.” None of these countries are desperate. But what they realized is they would
      be desperate if they actually took Trump’s transactional threats at face value.
      And so they’ve been trying to make deals with each other. And the most important
      countries that have been making, changing their reactions have been America’s
      closest allies. The European countries have actually been standing up for themselves
      and making deals to, again, have imposed special taxes on the big internet companies,
      on Google, on Meta, and even to break them up or put very heavy fines on them.
      Just the opposite of what Trump wanted to do with them and with England. In Japan,
      they’ve said, “Well, we’ve really got to rethink what we’re going to do with all
      of our U.S. Treasury holdings if we’re really not able to export to the United
      States anymore and to trade with it. What’s the point of holding all of these
      treasury bills? And Japan holds more U.S. Treasury securities than any other country,
      even more than China.” So you’re having a reaction take place in other countries.
      That’s the reality. That’s the real transaction. And as we said last time, this
      change in the structure of world trade that is a reaction to Trump’s actions is
      irreversible. And once other countries make deals with each other to undertake
      the enormous expense of changing their production and trade relations to fit each
      other’s markets instead of the U.S. markets, they’re not going to roll things
      back the way they were, because that would take a whole other duplicate, enormous
      expense of restructuring their industry and trade. And it would also involve breaking
      all of their relations with each other and with China and with the parts of the
      world that are actually growing instead of the American economy shrinking. So
      here you have Trump making threats from an economy that’s shrinking, that is dependent
      on other countries, acting as if other countries need to make the deal. And what
      they realize, they do have to make a deal, not with the United States, but with
      each other. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, since Michael has talked
      about the international, let me talk a little bit about the domestic here inside
      the United States, just to round out the picture. And then I want to talk about
      two things. First, the tariffs, in terms of their internal effect on the U.S.
      And then the particular little story that isn’t very little, which was the agreement,
      I think, since our last meeting, or at least very recent, to change what’s called
      the de minimis rule, which is the rule that if your package coming into the United
      States is worth 800 or less, you do not pay a duty of any kind, you do not get
      inspected, you are just a retail transaction. Why is that important? Because the
      greatest use of that has been made by the lower half of the income distribution
      in the United States. Because what this is about is a way of cheapening the purchase.
      The reality is, and I’ll say it as starkly as I can, that in recent weeks and
      months, we have learned from the Starbucks corporation, the coffee shop chain,
      from the McDonald’s corporation, the hamburger chain, two of the most important
      widely distributed fast food service industries, that they are in financial trouble.
      And they have released information indicating that their research in both cases
      shows that they’re losing business from the lowest income groups that patronize
      them. In other words, it’s becoming unaffordable to get the latte at Starbucks
      or the Big Mac at McDonald’s. All right. If that’s the case, then I need to explain
      to everybody, if you haven’t understood it, that both a general tariff and the
      de minimis moving it from the 200$ to the 800$, and now taking it away, I believe,
      as of tomorrow, or in any case, about now, it’s being phased out. And all of those
      low income packages will now be hit with duties, and very high duties, we’re talking
      145%, doubling, more than doubling the price. Okay. A tariff is like a sales tax.
      It’s a regressive tax. It makes no effort to account for the purchaser’s ability
      to pay. It’s not like the federal income tax. It’s a regressive, not a progressive
      tax. Removing the $800 exemption for the de minimis is likewise a regressive act
      because it doubles the price, like a sales tax might, and that’s a well known
      regressive. So what are you doing? This entire package of policies can only worsen
      the already extreme inequality of income and income and wealth inside the United
      States. And I believe almost everyone, even right-wingers, understand what happens
      to social divisions, to animosities, to hostilities, to discrimination, when you
      do that, that every social problem we know is aggravated. You know, the recent
      books, the work by the Princeton researchers about the middle class that’s committing
      suicide and all the rest of it. The research is overwhelming that this is a, here
      we go, self-destructive program. So Michael just finished talking about how it’s
      self-destructive globally. And I want you to see it’s also extraordinarily self-destructive,
      I think, domestically. Mr. Trump is really strongly favoring the rich at the expense
      of everybody else. Systematically, step-by-step, whether he’s aware of it or not,
      I don’t know and I don’t care. But the interesting reality is that this is, this
      is extraordinary. One last point. I think it’s crucial to remind people, I know
      we’ve said it before, but it’s crucial at this moment, given what Michael just
      said, to remind people that the transactional approach that Michael just, you
      know, illustrated or summarized, on again, off again, now you have a tariff, now
      you don’t, now it’s high, now it’s low, now it may be just a negotiating ploy
      to get little gifts. He can run around the country and say to the American people,
      I got the minerals in Ukraine, or I got whatever the British gave away, etc.,
      etc. That the uncertainty, the non-fixity is an enormous reason why what Michael
      talked about will not be undone. Because even if you believe that Mr. Trump will
      simply be who he is for four years, you don’t know whether the Democrats, if they
      win the next election, will not simply undo every tariff he did. Which means you
      can’t come back. They make no sense. But it even means that the only thing now
      is to get out of the dependence on the United States, it’s too uncertain. And
      why is that important? Because even if it’s less profitable temporarily for the
      Chinese to sell what they sell to Indonesia rather than to New York, they’ll do
      that because a lower profit for a while is a better bet than the uncertainty of
      the deal they had in the United States. That will be as important a factor in
      the calculations of businesses around the world that are now going to do everything
      in their power to reduce their connection to the United States. It’s the same
      thing. If he undoes, he cuts a deal with Xi Jinping and the tariffs against China
      disappear or are reduced. It’s too late. You’ve shown what you’re prepared to
      do. Every Chinese company, even if they applaud reducing the tariffs, worry, when
      will they be imposed again? What set of difficulties in the United States and
      for the United States will lead it to try to solve its problems in this way? This
      is an empire whose decline is causing it difficulty, which it’s trying to solve
      by making the rest of the world pay, not understanding that the decline can’t
      be fixed that way, because it’ll make the decline worse. That’s what we’re doing.
      Every other empire has done things like this. We’re doing it as if it had never
      happened before, as if no one had Mr. Trump’s ear to say, “Be very careful. Declining
      empires have a nasty habit of trying to solve their problems by exploiting their
      empire situation, which only hastens then the demise.” MICHAEL HUDSON: Richard
      mentioned before the effect of Trump supporting the wealthy and the lower-income
      consumers and wage earners in America suffering. But the Wall Street Journal has
      been filled with accounts of small businesses in the U.S. that have been negotiating
      with Chinese companies to provide key products that they’ve been selling. And
      the number of small businesses that have been operating in China is a very significant
      proportion of China’s industrial factory production. And it’s these small businesses
      that are being subject to these tariffs. Some of the small businesses have actually
      arranged with their customers for the products for the Chinese companies indeed
      to send their packages either from China or sometimes from Hong Kong by the de
      minimis package sales to customers. But most of the companies simply have been
      importing what they have hired the Chinese factories to produce on highly specific
      product designs to sell to the customers. These small businesses are the single
      major sufferers of the tariffs that Trump has imposed on China. He’s exempted
      the big companies and especially those of his biggest campaign contributors like
      Amazon or the iPhones from having to pay the tariffs. But he hasn’t paid any attention
      at all to this large trade in small businesses. So it’s not only the lower income
      McDonald’s customers that are being squeezed, it’s the small businesses that are
      being squeezed. And that was because they were supposed to have been part of the
      Republican Party’s designated constituency. So all of this, I want to talk about
      what’s likely to happen this weekend in Switzerland when the American trade negotiators
      finally sit down with the Chinese negotiators to decide, you know, what is going
      to happen. Because after all, it’s the U.S.-China antagonism that’s created all
      of this. And I think that I can just imagine how the discussion is going to go.
      It’s not going to go the way that Mr. Trump expected. I think China is going to
      insist as a precondition, it’s asked to revive the World Trade Organization by
      permitting a quorum of judges to be filled instead of the current paralysis. They’re
      not enough – the United States has refused to appoint a judge to the World Trade
      Organization, which is preventing China from using the rule of international law
      to say the United States is breaking the law. We need compensation. The United
      States has crippled the WTO to enable it to break the law without any recourse.
      And what on earth, you know, even if you break the law, what’s the point if there’s
      no court to impose fines or sanctions or otherwise protect these countries? I
      think that Bessent is going to offer to cut U.S. tariffs to only 40%, maybe even
      less. And China recognizes that a 40% tariff on its goods or whatever Bessent
      asks for following Trump’s orders is the equivalent of a total block of Chinese
      imports. And so China is going to insist on no change at all. In fact, it said
      before we can negotiate, we’re not going to negotiate with a gun to our head,
      which is Trump’s idea of a transaction. I can shoot you, wreck your economy if
      you don’t do what I want. That’s a transaction Trump style. China is going to
      say, first of all, abolish all your tariffs on China. Then we can sit down and
      negotiate what kind of mutual tariffs we’re going to have. And that kind of negotiation
      usually takes three to five years. And Bessent has already said, well, all right,
      we’re going to offer no tariffs at all on specific categories of goods to the
      United States. For instance, your rare earths, the materials we need for national
      security to make our arms so that we can bomb you when we go to war with you in
      two years. No tariffs at all on those! And I think China is going to realize that
      these offers of trade with no tariffs, such as iPhones, are no U.S. sacrifice
      at all. They’re an indication that the United States needs these imports from
      China, that it’s dependent on these imports from China, and that all China has
      to do is nothing. And let Trump roll back the imports on designated products,
      just as he’s been doing with iPhone and with similar products for other countries.
      But what I think Bessent is really arguing for, remember, he’s a financial guy.
      He was part of George Soros’ team that raided the British sterling to force its
      devaluation a few years ago. Trump is going to say, well, you know, we can talk
      about lowering tariffs, but we want you to give special favoritism. Let U.S. banks
      come into China. Instead of having your socialized banking system, let American
      banks come in and make loans to your population. He’s going to want financial
      access. We’ll give you access to our markets for goods, you give us access to
      your financial markets. I think that’s – China would have to roll back its whole
      revolution to do that. I think the U.S. will ask China to stop its sanctions against
      exporting rare earths and other national security items. And there’s no way that
      China is going to agree to this. Any tariff agreement that China makes is subject
      to a parallel just as the United States blocks anything having to do with national
      security to China, such as advanced computer chips or the Dutch computer chip
      engraving machinery. China is going to say, well, you know, we’re going to trade
      in normal consumer goods, but not goods that are needed for Americans to be in
      direct military or monopoly competition, especially in the fields of information
      technology, high-tech processing. And I think that other countries are going to
      see that this is basically the approach that they’re going to be taking. I think,
      as Richard was just saying, they realize that any agreement they may make with
      the United States over the next three months – we’re still in the three-month
      interim that Trump has said he’s negotiating on a country-by-country basis- we
      will wreck you if you don’t give us a gift. All of these can – they make an agreement,
      and then Trump can change it unilaterally on a moment’s notice, leaving with other
      countries the same threat as before. But the United States will have used this
      time to insulate itself from foreign moves. This is very similar to the kind of
      ceasefire that Ukraine wanted. The United States wants a ceasefire in the trade
      war with China to say, well, you know, at least keep exporting to us the materials
      we need, rare earths, other materials, and we’ll see what we can do later. He
      tries to make a promise. Other countries know that he has no obligation to live
      up to these promises, and what Trump wants, just like Ukraine wants to use a ceasefire
      to mobilize its army and bring in the German weapons and missiles and the English
      troops to fight Russia, so the United States wants to use this total free trade
      to build up its national security reserves of products that it needs from China
      so that then it can go back to total trade war with China. Obviously, China’s
      not going to give up on that. So the real split in today’s relations among countries
      is, I think, countries that look at the short run, here’s the choice they’re given.
      They can look at the short run and say, all right, well, we don’t want our trade
      to be disrupted. And so we’re going to focus our trade still on the United States,
      even though it’s a shrinking economy in the long run. Or other countries are going
      to recognize the need for a long-term transformation of the world economic order
      to reorient their trade with China, Asia, the Belt and Road countries. The real
      choice is between independence from the United States or dependence on the United
      States and a U.S.-centered economic order that was put in place in 1945 that is
      now obsolete or the creation of a new economic order. Trump’s transactional approach
      has led to a transaction of consciousness on the part of other countries. And
      this change of consciousness is what is irreversible. And that’s the real effect
      of his first 100 days and the April 2nd tariffs that he imposed. NIMA ALKHORSHID:
      Richard. RICHARD WOLFF: Today’s Financial Times carries a story that EU companies,
      European companies, are busy in China, capturing or trying to capture the market
      that can no longer be served by American companies because of the tariff blocking
      them. Now, here’s why that’s an important story. It is a problem for China to
      find a market to replace the United States. They had not an overwhelming but a
      significant export business to this country. And there are very few places they
      could hope to replace it. But Europe is number one on the possible places for
      them to do that. But the Europeans wouldn’t allow the Chinese to do it unless,
      of course, the Chinese did for the Europeans what they need, because they’re losing
      their market in the United States. So you have, you know, a marriage of convenience
      between the Europeans and the Chinese as each of them uses the other to soften
      the blow of anything Mr. Trump might do. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, you may bring
      Japan in as well. RICHARD WOLFF: Yeah, and now, well, Japan’s a little different.
      But yes, especially after the bond market troubles of a few weeks ago now. Is
      it a few weeks ago when the Japanese were saying to the Americans, if I read it
      correctly, if you hit us with tariffs, we’re going to rethink the purchase of
      U.S. treasuries that we have so conveniently done for you for 30, 40, or 50 years.
      That this is, that’s another danger lurking. But let me finish this point. You
      are bringing together Europe and China. Let me stop everybody. That’s an enormous
      part of the world economy right now. Anything that even a transactional president
      might do that would bring together the Europeans and the Chinese and with the
      Chinese, the BRICS alliance into, you know, working together with the Europeans
      in jointly shared hostility to the United States. Well, that, you’re now moving
      out of the range of a mistake into the range of stupid. This is stupid. What are
      you doing? This is, you know, you’re creating enormous difficulties for the Europeans
      who don’t want to deal with the Chinese because of the Chinese closeness to Russia.
      And the fact that all European center and center-right governments now have nothing
      left but their anti-Russian politics as they die there. And Michael mentioned
      the Canadian election. Yes, but let’s also add the Australian election of a few
      days ago, which did the same thing, in which a candidate, Albanese, who was far
      behind in the polls, became the major anti-Trump candidate and walked away with
      a very profound win. This is, these are straws in the wind you do not want to
      pretend that you don’t see. And yet here they are. And then today’s, you know,
      I couldn’t believe it today’s Financial Times major story about EU companies grabbing
      market share from the Americans who can’t do their business anymore. This is,
      this is a concrete exemplification of what Michael was getting at in what he said
      at the beginning. MICHAEL HUDSON: So Trump is, integrating the whole rest of the
      world and here, all along we’ve been describing what the BRICs and other countries
      should be doing, if they want to create an alternative. And they’ve been – there
      was just a meeting a few days ago in Brazil with Lula where he was not taking
      a confrontational approach with BRICs at all. And you could see that his idea
      of BRICs, at least at the Brazil meeting, was to try to be a mediator between
      the global majority and the United States. Well, it’s the other countries, it’s
      Trump’s allies that are making the big pressure for all of this to create some
      kind of new order, and since Richard mentioned Japan, I’ll give you an example.
      I was in Japan some years ago and met with the CEO and the vice president of a
      major company for a long strategy dinner, one of the biggest companies in Japan.
      And one of the things that Japanese like to do is to sing songs at the dinner,
      and they sang one song. And I’d had quite a bit of sake and the only songs that
      I could remember were the old socialist songs that I knew as a child, since they
      said here are the songs you meant as a child. And I sang something like working
      men unite, you must put up a fight, et cetera. Well, all of a sudden the CEO,
      who’d looked like a Buddha was glowering and the vice president who had rather
      a threatening look on his face, had a big smile. He took me aside later and explained
      that his Japanese company always had a plan B as an alternative to a pro-U.S.
      plan A. And his job was to head plan B, which was to restructure the company’s
      trade and investment with China away from the United States. Well, China had lost
      very heavily in the Plaza and the Louvre accords with the United States that forced
      its currency up. And Japan had to agree, not the tariffs, but to voluntarily cut
      their automobile and electronics exports to the United States within limits so
      that the United States auto industry and electronic industry can become more competitive.
      But, as you can imagine, the United States agreements led Japanese industry to
      crash since 1990. It’s Nikkei stock average needed, I think, to be around 36,000
      in order to maintain growth. And it’s still going way, way, below that. And Japan
      doesn’t ever want to repeat this again. So I would imagine that there are talks
      going on now about, indeed, talking to China about well should we really have
      a phase change in our relations? Should we really reorient our trade with you?
      Can we agree on some kind of specialization of production, mutual investment,
      and markets that can help us replace the United States with China? Well, that’s
      how world economic works. It’s a step function. It’s not a world – the economy
      doesn’t evolve as a smooth evolution. It’s a quantum jump. And this is called
      a phase change. And we’re in a phase change like that, reflecting entirely new
      rules of trade and investment. And, today we’re seeing the rest of the world preparing
      for that while they’re making their own plans for how are we going to meet with
      Trump when he meets with us. And tries to do with us what he was able to do with
      England. RICHARD WOLFF: Well, the irony also is, and I think we’ve approached
      this in other discussions we’ve had in the past, that this is a bizarre process
      in which the pursuit of the United States against China, calling it, and I think
      this is significant, another cold war means that there’s the notion that your
      enemy now, China, is in some way comparable to the enmity with the Soviet Union
      of the second half of the 20th century. And that is a colossal mistake. Russia
      was a poor, backward economic mouse relative to the American elephant. That is
      not the case with China. And it’s not a case with the rest of the world. It is
      not emerging out of its colonial status. It has had now 40 years or 50 years or
      60 years to begin slowly, but significantly, to achieve an independence. It’s
      not just political, but also as much as a world economy allows anyone to be independent,
      to have an independent policy, to make a deal with China, which a colony could
      never have done before, et cetera, et cetera. So what you’re seeing is the ironic
      consequence that a cold war shifted from Soviet Union to China will have the opposite
      effect. You can argue that the cold war against the Soviet Union isolated and
      eventually undid the Soviet Union. The reality is that the same policy of a cold
      war against China is isolating the United States. It is literally removing the
      United States, moving it in an autarkic direction. I want to remind everyone that
      tariffs that make everything more expensive here, one way or another, means that
      other countries who have competitors to the United States will be able to buy
      their inputs at lower prices than American companies will have to pay because
      of the tariff wall. And that will diminish the competitiveness of the United States
      globally. And that will cost jobs, incomes, and will have a cumulative effect.
      To use the Marxian language, you are constricting the production of surplus here.
      And in the end, that’s the lifeblood of the system’s growth. And there’s no financial
      manipulation that will help you escape from that self-destructive, self-isolating
      policy. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I’m glad, Richard, that you mentioned the comparison
      between the new Cold War with China and the Cold War against the Soviet Union.
      What was really the source of this Cold War? It wasn’t just geopolitical. The
      Soviet Union wasn’t a trade rival or an investment rival. It was a different economic
      system. And that’s what led the United States to start the Cold War right away
      in 1917. As soon as you had the Bolshevik Revolution there, the U.S., along with
      England, tried to invade Russia and overthrow the revolution. The whole fight
      against communism, they didn’t say it’s against the Soviet Union or the Russian
      people or Russian production. It was against communism. And the threat of communism,
      what was it? The Americans feared that it was an alternative economic organization
      to that of American finance capitalism. And in the negotiations in 1944 and 1945,
      leading up to the World Trade Organization creation, the International Trade Organization,
      the U.S. negotiators said, “how are we going to deal with a socialist economy?”
      Because socialist economies are lower cost than Western capitalist economies.
      Socialist economies are more efficient because they don’t have a predatory financial
      class. They don’t have a real estate class. Their housing costs are much lower
      because you don’t have an absentee landlord class that is able to maximize its
      land rent. You don’t have debt. The government of Russia simply creates the money.
      Well, we all know that the Russian system really wasn’t a workable economic threat
      to the West because it was basically, under Stalin, a bureaucratic collectivism.
      They didn’t let a hundred flowers bloom as Mao did. They didn’t let what had been
      Lenin’s new economic policy of 1921 actually create any kind of competition there.
      China did. And so China’s threat isn’t simply that it’s producing low-price exports.
      That’s what America wanted with the class war of outsourcing its labor to China,
      that China was doing exactly what the United States wanted it to do, produce cheap
      labor to keep down America’s manufacturing labor. But what China did by being
      so successful was a system that the financial sector was part of the socialist
      government, it was the government that created money. China did not have a banking
      system that lent for corporate takeovers, for stock buybacks, for all of the things
      that the American banking system did. China did not have privatized transportation
      and other public utility monopolies, because these were public investments providing
      low-priced transportation, low-priced communication, and all of the things that
      socialism set out to do during the progressive era over a hundred years ago. That’s
      the threat to the United States, the specter of socialism being more efficient
      than the American financial system that has moved far away from the industrial
      capitalism idea of efficiency in the late 19th century to something completely
      different. The financial sector, finance capitalism has taken over industrial
      capitalism in the United States and the great threat is other countries saying
      this doesn’t work. Why has China grown and not the United States and Western Europe?
      It’s a different economic system and political organization. That is why there
      is a cold war today against China. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard. RICHARD WOLFF: The
      irony is, you can’t run it the same way because China isn’t small and poor. China,
      in addition to everything you’ve said, the Chinese are now showing that their
      system has enabled them to become rich and powerful enough that they are a competitor
      for the United States that the Soviet Union never came close to being. And so
      it’s completely different, you can’t, you know, it’s a joke. It’s that old joke.
      You can’t have the same policy approaching a radically different situation and
      hope for the similar result. And that’s not a sign that you’re saying you’re not
      doing the normal intellectual process of asking the relevant question. And the
      relevant question here is illustrated by that headline in today’s Financial Times,
      where you scratch your head and say, yeah, duh, the Europeans, while arguing against
      Mr. Trump, are quietly sending trade missions to China because they have a lot
      to talk about the two of them. China needs to export to Europe. Europe needs to
      export to China. Germany has been exporting to China in a crucial way for many
      years. So the relationships are there. The systems are there. The trade routes
      are there. Everything is in place for them to be able to do this. And they’re
      now going to do it. And they’re going to do it no matter what agreements are made
      by Starmer and Trump, because, again, for the British, unless they are unbelievably
      stupid, they are going to understand. They’re going to understand that the uncertainty
      alone means they have to do this, not to do this with China, given what Trump
      has already shown him. And by the way, not just Trump. But the fact that at least
      for the moment, there’s no visible corporate opposition. The corporate sector
      seems to be saying, let’s see what Trump can do. Well, that’s sending a message
      to everybody. It isn’t just Trump. And even if Trump were to disappear in some
      magical way, why should they believe that there isn’t another Trump waiting in
      the wings? And certainly, Mr. Vance, if you know his career, that this is a man
      who puts his finger in the air, to see which way the wind is blowing and makes
      his political decisions based on that. We used to call that the activity of the
      Clinton family, but Mr. Vance has learned how to be another Bill Clinton. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well Trump, in fact, has come right out and said that in these negotiations
      he’s undertaking with every single country bilaterally, the number one ask is
      you have to agree not to trade with China. Well, the way that from what you and
      I have just been describing, this is not going to be successful. So the whole
      idea of these threats that Trump has made that has disrupted the whole economy
      that is driving other countries together, leaving the United States self-isolated
      was all based on the erroneous belief that Trump could say we will lower the tariffs
      if you will make your economic trade and investment focus on the United States
      and boycott China and impose sanctions upon it. That has already been shown that
      it’s going to be a failure. The strategy that he said underlay the next three
      months of negotiations has collapsed. It’s not really a transaction at all from
      America’s point. To get back to Nima’s question at the beginning, other countries
      are making their own transactions. And the transactions is not only in trade and
      investment. The transaction is to create an entirely different structure and reorganization
      of the world trade and investment system. RICHARD WOLFF: So, Michael, I don’t
      know, I was just wondering whether Michael or you, Nima, whether there’s a provision
      in whatever was agreed between Trump and the British about what Britain is or
      isn’t free to do with China. In other words, was the ‘boycott China’ a component
      that was agreed to by Britain? MICHAEL HUDSON: And I think Trump is giving the
      speech on that even as we’re speaking today. Well, we can’t listen to that and
      talk at the same time. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Richard, just before wrapping up this
      session, I think the crucial point right now is for some countries like Brazil
      would be the following question. Can a middle ground strategy like the one Brazil’s
      Lula is attempting right now realistically exist in an increasingly polarized
      global order? And as we’re watching, as you’ve mentioned. RICHARD WOLFF: Well,
      on one fundamental basis, I don’t think so. And that fundamental basis is the
      fact that the Chinese keep outgrowing the United States. And what that means is,
      to be blunt, time is on the side of the Chinese. And they know it. And I believe
      Mr. Trump knows it. And they don’t have the time. They don’t have a middle ground
      compromise they could reach that would somehow be a plausible solution here. Because
      I think the United States, if it were to sign such a deal, would then observe
      in the following months and years a further deterioration. So what’s the point?
      You know that they can’t. Now, you might answer me by saying the apparent decision
      to continue the war in Ukraine is also an American agreement to something that
      can only get worse for the United States. Since, from everything I can tell, nothing
      is stopping the Russians from making a steady progress as they move westward across
      what remains of the Ukraine, period. You know, so they’re willing, apparently,
      to let that get worse in order not to have to take a position now. Well, maybe,
      I don’t know, maybe they would be willing to do that, if Michael is right, and
      if their effort to get countries around the world to break with China, if that
      fails, especially if it fails publicly so that it’s clear in the media that this
      hasn’t worked out. The way it’s quite clear now that the American effort to get
      a ceasefire in Ukraine did not work. Okay, well, maybe then they would have to
      do it. And then we will learn in the next two, three months, if that happens,
      and that will be the determinant of whether Mr. Lula’s effort to find the middle
      ground has a ghost of a chance to succeed. But sitting where I sit now, no. No,
      I’m fearful that the American recognition of the dead end it is in will make the
      attractiveness of doing something militarily sooner rather than later become a
      persuasive argument in Washington. And then, you know, I have no idea where that
      goes. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, Richard, maybe our materialist approach to history
      will begin to work out after all as a means of forecasting. Maybe countries are
      going to work in their own self-interest instead of in the self-interest of other
      countries. RICHARD WOLFF: They might and they might not have done it individually.
      Clearly, Europe’s demise is in large part the product of the inability of the
      European countries to make a union strong enough to deal with the large union
      of China and its allies and the large America and its allies. And so, look, they
      are, this goes back to the beginning of what Michael said, they are being pushed
      together by the United States on the one hand, and the victimization of China
      by the United States leading the Chinese to be more willing than ever to make
      a deal with the Europeans who are more willing than ever to do the same. That
      is, that might be very, very dangerous for the United States, because it could
      mean the salvation of Europe and of China by them coming together. Who would have
      thought it, given the three poles of the world that we were in up to a few years
      ago? MICHAEL HUDSON: Trump the Liberator. So that’s what he meant by Liberation
      Day on April 2nd. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Thank you so much, Michael and Richard, for
      being with us today. Great pleasure as always. RICHARD WOLFF: All right. Thank
      you very much. NIMA ALKHORSHID: Take care. Bye-bye Image by <a href=”https://pixabay.com/users/vilkasss-35420724/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=8253628″>Vilius

    paragraph_summary: In a discussion on May 8, 2025, Nima Alkhorshid, along with guests
      Michael Hudson and Richard Wolff, examined U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's
      comments on the U.S. approach to the Ukraine conflict and former President Trump's
      transactional foreign policy. Bessent highlighted the Ukraine Investment Partnership
      as a strategy to strengthen U.S.-Ukrainian ties and provide a security guarantee,
      aiming to reassure both Ukrainians and a skeptical American public. Hudson responded
      by questioning the viability of a transactional approach in a global landscape
      where other powers are forming long-term alliances, suggesting that Trump's strategy
      may inadvertently push countries to collaborate more closely with each other rather
      than the U.S. He noted that Trump's aggressive rhetoric has not translated into
      concrete actions, indicating a lack of genuine negotiation.

    text: 'Devika Dutt & David Adler in conversation with Michael Hudson [Transcription]
      DGI May 2, 2025 Nika Dubrovsky: Hello everyone. So this is the David Graeber Institute
      and we are working with David’s archive and preparing his work for publication.
      Each month we host a dialogue on debt inspired by the work of David Graeber and
      Michael Hudson. Today for our second session I’m happy to welcome Michael Hudson,
      David Adler and Devika Dutt. The global debt system lasted because it was seen
      as a moral story, one many people believed in. But this belief is now breaking
      down as more and more people see the system as neither fair or just. So my question
      is what kind of future can we imagine when the only options are financial globalism
      tied to a declining empire or nationalist capitalism where the state acts as a
      corporation and citizens are treated like employees. With that I’ll hand it over
      to David Adler who has kindly agreed to moderate today’s conversation and introduce
      our speakers. David Adler: Thank you so much Nika and thank you to the David Graeber
      Institute for hosting these really critical dialogues and conversations with such
      esteemed guest as we have today. Two brilliant minds, one I must admire, I’m a
      little starstruck myself and very delighted to be sharing a stage with Professor
      Michael Hudson and a dear friend David Kadat who I believe joins us now from London.
      So we’ll be talking today as Nika mentioned about the past, present and future
      of debt, the international financial system, its rapid and thorough transformation
      and potentially new horizons for what it might mean to transcend the limits of
      this highly financialized mode of capitalism and the moral stories that we tell
      around what it means to be in debt to each other, to our states and of course
      to empire. And so I’ll be moderating this discussion, we’re going to take it for
      the next hour and use we hope the last 10 minutes or so to engage you all, people
      who are viewing and watching from home, from work, your bosses, to take some time
      with us this morning or afternoon and so I’ll be keeping attention to the comments
      section where I’ll be able to relay some questions in the Q&A to our esteemed
      guests. And so to kick this off I wanted to give us a sense of orientation. We’re
      coming off a set of discussions that were happening in dark corridors as well
      as in public plenaries about the states of the so-called Bretton Woods Institutions,
      the IMF and the World Bank in Washington DC, their spring meetings, one of their
      two semi-annual meetings where there was a lot of anxiety, a lot of hand-wringing
      about the state of the international financial system, the position of the United
      States as a dominant player in it and the vision of the Trump administration for
      either maintaining or transforming the financial hegemon of the United States
      in that position. I thought we could go to our two esteemed panelists today to
      give us a sense of orientation, of where we are now and how we understand this
      present conjunction. I’m sure many people who are listening and watching this
      program have read in the pages of the FT or in their social media feeds about
      this geoeconomic conjuncture and I’m hoping that we can spend a little time at
      the beginning of this program giving a sense of how we might understand that.
      So Michael you’ve written a lot about this both in long form and in short form
      on your website and I thought we might start here. How do you think we should
      understand the question of where we are now as we hear these rumors of sovereign
      debt crises escalating across the south but we also at the same time have a kind
      of crisis of the self-image of empire taking place right there in the heart of
      these so-called Bretton Woods institutions in Washington DC. So what do you think
      Michael, how might we understand this present conjunction? Michael Hudson: Well
      most of my discussion in super imperialism and my economic books has been a critique
      of the junk economics promoted by the International Monetary Fund and also the
      World Bank to explain why they have to impose austerity plans on debtor countries
      that have prevented them from achieving the government investment that’s required
      in order to make them self-reliant. But what Nika has done and in asking me to
      talk to this discussion is focus on something that is completely left out of account
      in the financial sector’s discussion of debt servicing capacity and that’s the
      moral dimension. So I want to talk about the moral dimension because the financial
      sector has created a narrative and this narrative makes it appear as if somehow
      it’s perfectly natural for countries to run increasingly into debt, for the population
      to polarize between creditors and debtors, almost as if this is really not a policy
      discussion at all but a function of nature itself. And so what Nika and David
      Graeber has done is put it in the context of you know what is moral, what is fair,
      and I think the reason why David’s book was so powerful and so important was precisely
      because he focused on anthropological communities where debt all began and in
      these indigenous communities everybody owed debts to each other. It was a mutual
      gift exchange. Sometimes people would give crops to their neighboring families.
      The neighbors would give the same crop back. All of that was technically a gift,
      technically debt, but the idea in indigenous communities was that it was an integrating
      function. It tied people together. There were other kinds of debts, for instance,
      personal injury debt, what the medieval Europeans called Bergel debt, and if you
      injured somebody you or your family had to make restitution to their family so
      that there wouldn’t be a feud taking place and everybody just tries to have an
      eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. All that was kept in line with the ability
      to be paid and if for any reason it couldn’t be paid, the offenders were sent
      to a city of refuge until there would be a kind of peace, the equivalent of debt
      cancellation, a clean slate, a new beginning where they’d all come back. The other
      kind of debt was bride wealth or a dowry for women. They were inter-family debts
      that also were always able to be paid. The reason was that these indigenous anthropological
      communities were low surplus. They couldn’t afford usury because that would have
      polarized them. If you would have permitted debt to be beyond the ability to be
      paid, then some families would have fallen into bondage to their creditors and
      the community would have lost their labor, including the labor on public infrastructure
      projects like Corvee or in the Middle East building city walls, irrigation, all
      of the public enterprises that are in the crop season cultivators had to promote.
      So the debt that was formal and at a stipulated interest rate to be paid no matter
      what developed in a particular part of the world in Sumer in the third millennium
      BC and it was based on equity. It wasn’t really a debt relation when the palace
      would provide foreign traders with textiles to travel abroad to obtain the silver
      and the metal and the copper and the tin and the stone that the economy needed
      that wasn’t available in Sumer. How were they going to share the profits with
      the merchants that they consigned these to? Well, they assumed that the merchants
      were not going to keep records of every transaction, so they said, all right,
      in five years you’ll have to repay double the original principle. We assume you’ll
      much more than double your money. It can be paid. You then had a mutation to agriculture
      where the advance of land or seeds or cattle to do the harvesting would come.
      That’s where the problem came up and it was recognized that if there was a crop
      failure that the cultivators really couldn’t pay the debts, they’d fall into bondage.
      So the solution was to avoid debt from causing this kind of economic polarization
      and they did it by every new ruler taking the throne and throughout the ancient
      Near East from Sumer to Babylonia to Iran to the neighboring territories, they
      would have a clean slate when a new ruler would take the throne. This is like
      a forgiveness of crime, a forgiveness of criminals. People could return from cities
      of refuge presumably and other kinds of countries. Almost all of the world from
      the Near East to China had rules to prevent creditors and merchants from using
      their economic gains to impoverish the rest of the economy because it was recognized
      that debts, every rate of interest at debt is a doubling time and this doubling
      time of debts grew faster than the ability to be paid and so you had to write
      the debts down. That was the basic narrative of ancient Near Eastern religion
      and it was basically the logic that led Confucianism and Eastern countries to
      prevent merchants from having a high enough status to be able to take over the
      government and run the government on behalf of the creditors instead of for the
      public interest. Well, what happened then was a dark age. Bad weather came around
      1200 BC in the Near East. The palace economies fell apart and when trade began
      in the 8th century BC with Greece and Italy, the European countries didn’t have
      any background, any historical experience with divine rulership, with rulers able
      to keep that in place. So Western civilization was the first part of the world
      that didn’t have debt cancellation, that didn’t have a prevention of a financial
      oligarchy from developing. Well, we all know what happened from the 8th century
      to about the 4th century AD. The creditor class became an oligarchy, it impoverished
      the economy, it reduced much of the agrarian population to bondage and then to
      serfdom. And then there was such a revulsion against the economic polarization,
      the luxury at the top throughout the Roman Empire and the poverty that was created
      at the bottom that the Christian religion, the Islam when it was developed, the
      Persian religion, this revulsion led to a banning of interest altogether in the
      hope that that would somehow prevent that from causing the problems that it had
      caused. And this abhorrence of usury was the basis of early Christianity. When
      Jesus came to give his first speech to a synagogue, he unrolled the scroll of
      Isaiah calling for the year of the Lord, meaning the jubilee year, to cancel the
      debts and said that was his mission. And his sermon on the mount was the Lord’s
      prayer, forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, the basis of Christianity.
      Until the 12th and 13th centuries of our era, when the Roman church sent out to
      take over the rest of Christianity, Christianity was an Eastern Orthodox church
      centered in Constantinople. And the church essentially recruited warlords, Norman
      warlords, such as William the Conqueror, and who said, we’ll let you conquer England
      and make you king if you will agree to pay tribute to Rome and serve our interests
      and be our feudal vassal. And before that, William Guiscard in Southern Italy
      made a similar agreement. So these vassals were put in power and essentially told
      to fight against Germany, the Balkans, Constantinople, churches that didn’t accept
      Christianity. And somehow the problem was that to go to war required borrowing
      and debts required the payment of interest. So it was Christianity, it was precisely
      the Vatican that reversed the Christian abhorrence to usury and said, we need
      usury and interest so that we can fight the wars to fight against people who don’t
      accept Roman domination of religion. Well, what happened then was their local
      kings had a problem with local parliaments. The parliaments didn’t want to approve
      the king’s ability to levy debts to fight the Vatican’s war. This was first fought
      in 1215, you had the Magna Carta, which limited the king’s power. And 40 years
      later, the English nobility waged a civil war to prevent the king from taking
      on money to fight Rome’s war against the Germans who gained support in Southern
      Italy and Sicily. Well, what did the popes do? Pope Innocent III opposed the parliamentary
      supporters of the Magna Carta and denounced that as unchristian. And later you
      had Alexander IV excommunicate the barons who fought a civil war to limit the
      ability of England’s king to run up debts at their expense. So, and how are they
      going to create a narrative to support all of this inversion of what had been
      the center of Christianity? Well, that was the job of the 13th and 14th century
      schoolmen. And they developed a new word, interest, as distinct from usury. No
      ancient language had a distinction between interest and usury. All charging of
      interest was considered to be a form of usury. But the medieval churchmen said,
      well, there’s an excuse. And let’s look at the individual businessman, the money
      lender. If you have the money lenders who are merchants, they were the people
      who had the coinage to lend out. And if a merchant lends money to a borrower,
      then he’s not able to use this money to make his own, pursue his own trade. So
      he deserves compensation. And that’s lucrum cessans, there’s a long discussion.
      So all of a sudden, instead of focusing on the vast expansion of debt for war
      lending by the international banking class of North Italians and Transalpine bankers,
      the whole focus of analysis and moral judgment was, well, doesn’t the merchant
      have a right to make enough money to live on that cover his costs of doing business
      and being like other people? All of a sudden, the attention was shifted away from
      the international banking class lending to governments, not to individuals, to
      fight wars against each other. And in the 13th century, the wars backed by the
      Roman Church, and then afterward wars done by the kings on their own, trying to
      conquer other countries. Well, the final nail of the coffin was that the merchant
      banking class got so strong and so rising to the top of the economic pyramid,
      instead of the bottom of the economic pyramid, where it was in all earlier countries,
      that you had one of the wealthiest international bankers, the Medici, Pope Leo
      the 10th became Pope. And in 1515, he gave a long justification for usury and
      saying, well, banks have to get their money to lend to countries to wage war.
      How do they get the money? They pay interest to their depositors. And look at
      the Montepiata, that is a bank that was founded to provide low interest credit
      to poor people. And he said, if we didn’t have interest, how are the poor people
      going to get the money to live? They would have to depend on these voracious Christian
      money lenders. And so we’re doing a good job. Well, all of this was focused on
      somehow interest was a cost of doing business. It wasn’t exploitation. And creditors
      just had to live. Well, as you had to take off, I’m going to fast forward to the
      19th century. And you had more and more arguments that debt was impoverishing
      and polarizing society. Well, you had the Austrian economists, Bohm-Bawerk, for
      instance, said these wealthy people are making loans and doesn’t the creditor
      deserve some kind of reward for abstaining from consumption? If the creditor makes
      a loan to somebody who needs the money, then he has to forgo consumption. Well,
      Karl Marx poked fun at this by saying, gee, the Rothschild family must be the
      most abstinent family in Europe because they must forego consumption so much that
      that’s how they’re getting the money. Well, of course, this was all a myth. The
      wealthy people didn’t forgo consumption. They were just the opposite. They were
      the most profligate and over consuming class there was. So there was an idea that
      somehow interest was payment for a service. And that idea that interest is all
      fair and a payment for a service is built into today’s gross national product
      statistics, the national income statistics. The GDP includes interest payments
      as providing a service somehow that adds to GDP, just like landlords provide a
      service, even though that landlords and creditors, bankers make interest in their
      sleep. So there’s been a whole focus narrative that don’t look at the effective
      debt on impoverishing society, on empowering a financial oligarchy to get rich
      enough to take over the government today, like the financial oligarchy took over
      the Vatican and Christianity in the 16th century. It’s all sort of equilibrium.
      And basically, you have the culmination of this in the International Monetary
      Fund’s theory that other countries have to pay interest because they need the
      money to develop. They’re like the poor people before. They’re in need. And of
      course, being in need, they have to go into debt. And that’s the narrative that
      somehow justifies today’s international division of labor and specialization of
      production between raw materials exporters in the global South and the creditor
      industrial nations, the industrial power nations from the United States, Britain,
      France, and the other great creditor powers. So somehow this whole moral dimension
      that originally shaped how society dealt with debt and interest payments has just
      been, how do we squeeze out enough money from the debtors to be able to pay? And
      it’s become a purely technological question. And what David’s book Debt did was
      to shake up this discussion and show, put it in the context of, is society going
      to run for the benefit of the creditor class to live by earning on interest, or
      is the financial sector and banking going to be run to serve society? That’s the
      great moral question that has to be raised and should frame the discussion of
      interest payment in debt. David Adler: Thank you so much, Michael. And Devika,
      I thought I would pass it to you now. I mean, Michael’s given us this unbelievable
      tour of centuries and centuries of the political, economic, and moral dimensions
      of debt. I thought maybe you could fill in and take us to the present. I know
      you’ve got a lot of experience in thinking about 20th century struggles for economic
      justice and full economic decolonization, for example, in which the question of
      debt was epicentral. If you think about not just, you know, Sankara’s call for
      a united front against debt, but really from Bandung forward and thinking about
      colonialism in modern dress and the ways in which even though territorial colonialism
      had come to a close in the phase of high decolonization, there were these renewed
      forms of dependency and financial subordination to which these countries of the
      so-called global south or then third world were subjected. Do you see what kind
      of traces or how can we take Michael’s story about the moral frameworks and, you
      know, through the late 20th, some of the later movements in the 20th century around
      debt jubilee, debt abolition, and kind of more concrete examples, whether it’s
      Correa’s Ecuador or even up to present day, you know, you’re in South Asia now
      in thinking about a country like Sri Lanka, who is facing off with an International
      Monetary Fund now. Do we see a kind of more consistent trajectory from the history
      that Michael’s traced here? How should we understand the long legacy of these
      medieval and early modern stories about that through the lens of third worldism
      or, you know, of global south struggles for full economic sovereignty? Devika
      Dutt: Thanks, David, and thank you Michael, for such a commanding history of debt
      and sort of telling us how interest became sort of just the cost of doing business
      for creditors. I already learned so much from you when you were talking, but catching
      us up to the present and the more contemporary history of sort of capitalism and
      decolonization in the late 20th, in the 20th century for a large majority of countries.
      Debt, rooted in colonial exploitation, still controls the Global South. Even after
      decolonization, economic sovereignty remains out of reach due to debt, resource
      extraction, and reliance on the Global North. The US-dominated monetary system
      keeps countries dependent, and attempts at autonomy often face resistance or interference.
      Debt crises and austerity measures continue to harm developing nations, but there’s
      hope as more people challenge the current system and seek new economic models.
      But again, there are causes for hope, I think, and I’m sure we’ll get to that
      soon. I think the unpopularity of the IMF and also now the blatant, I feel like
      a lot more people who have, for the right reasons, lost faith in sort of the liberal
      international order, which literally is supporting genocide in Gaza and all kinds
      of bad things. Nobody has any faith anymore in this global international system,
      which for a lot of reasons, even though, yeah, it gives me a bit of hope in that
      way, but we can get to that soon. David Adler: Thanks so much, Devika. I’m going
      to turn it right back to you, Michael, and we’ve done a lot of trudging our way
      through centuries of history and trying to get up to the present. And you’ve written
      a lot about this sort of conjuncture, both as a site of contestation and perhaps
      a set of renewed imperial plunder and extraction. I wonder to this point, whether
      you think that the present moment gives us a unique opportunity to transcend and
      to rewrite some of those kinds of narrative frameworks that have been so instrumental
      in creating a global system that normalizes, facilitates, and enables under the
      South to the North? And if we’re turning to this question of what is to be done,
      how far do we have to go? Many of the questions that are coming into the Q&A are,
      should we be abandoning the banking system? Should we be moving to a more cooperative
      model? How can we finally break with these old, if renovated, moral frameworks
      that facilitate such subjugation and try to build a new kind of future? What could
      be some lessons and some guidelines and a vision that could carry us out of this
      so-called interregnum and into a future that doesn’t require us to follow these
      rules that, as you’ve pointed out before, were written by the mighty to subjugate
      the less powerful across the world? Michael Hudson: Well, there’s an international
      crisis of imminent defaults by global South countries right now, and any crisis
      offers an opportunity. Here’s the basic principle that should guide it. The existing
      volume of debt, foreign debt, dollar debt by global South and other countries
      cannot be paid without stopping their economic growth and preventing the investment
      that’s needed to enable their economies to grow forward. If they pay their debts,
      they cannot grow, the debt crisis will increase. And there’s an implicit moral
      principle in all of this that the United States and its academic economics promoted,
      and that was that the creditor countries have an obligation to enable the debtor
      countries to pay their debt. This is the basis of John Maynard Keynes’ proposal
      for a Bancor in 1944, as an alternative to the IMF. The United States did not
      want to take any responsibility for letting other countries pay. It wanted to
      exploit them. That’s its business plan. That’s how it ended up being able to use
      debt, to weaponize debt, to weaponize the dollar, to weaponize its foreign trade,
      to weaponize the World Bank’s prevention of other countries from borrowing money,
      if it was to feed themselves instead of becoming dependent on American agriculture.
      Well, right now, that implicit moral principle is blocked by President Donald
      Trump, who has imposed tariffs to disrupt the trade of every country in the world
      with which the United States trades with. And his threats made a few weeks ago
      was, we are going to wreck your economy if you don’t sit down and make a deal
      with us. The deal will be that you have to fight against China. You have to trade
      with the United States, not trade with China. Instead of trading with Asian countries
      that are growing, you have to trade with the United States that’s shrinking. You
      have to pay their debts, and you have to give the United States special privileges
      to take over your economy by using its debt to buy out your public infrastructure,
      privatize your infrastructure, sell it to the creditors, essentially dismantle
      your government, and impose the same neoliberal doctrine that has de-industrialized
      the United States, England, Germany, and the Western economies. Well, if the United
      States and its tariff policy and its creditor policy prevents other countries
      from paying their debts by making exports to the United States and using their
      export proceeds to pay their creditors, then the United States has prevented the
      debts from being paid. It has turned the international debt system into odious
      debts. And there’s a long discussion dating back a century on odious debts and
      why odious debts must not be paid because they’re odious. And so I think the debtor
      countries can get together and say, we are suspending our debt obligations now
      because the United States prevents us from paying. The United States blocks us
      from exporting not only to the United States by the tariffs, but to China and
      Asia that are the growing countries. But if we can’t export, how on earth can
      we pay our debts except by selling off every acre of land that the government
      owns, every public utility, every asset that the government owns? And this is
      itself an odious economic dynamic. And so we are suspending our debt payment with
      the intention that this suspending will be permanent until such time as we can
      make a new beginning and use a credit to finance our economic growth and development
      and economic self-sufficiency in agriculture, in basic consumer goods, in industry,
      just as the United States, Britain and Germany developed their own economies by
      doing this. We want the ability to do what the West did instead of letting the
      West use debt leveraging and debt dependency to prevent us from growing, to keep
      us in debt peonage. That should be their economic campaign. David Adler: I thought
      we were coming up to the last 10 minutes when I had promised to do a bit of Q&A.
      And so I just want to pass to you quickly Devika for just one quick comment, maybe
      one, two minutes before we turn to the Q&A, which is just, you know, Michael’s
      given us a really clear sense of what needs to be done and what could be done.
      And you’ve got a lot of experience in looking across the world and seeing sort
      of what countries you think are doing, what they hope to be doing. And I, you
      know, in my capacity as the co-general coordinator of this Progressive International,
      I also have a chance to talk with a lot of these governments and representatives
      and officials about this. And what I find sort of remarkable about the present
      conjuncture is there’s a very clear sense that something must be done. I mean,
      they’re drowning in sovereign debt. It’s massively impacting their fiscal space,
      as you mentioned, their ability to invest in health, housing, education, and critical
      services for their people. It’s handicapping progressive projects everywhere from
      Brazil to Colombia and beyond. But we’re not seeing the same kind of appetite
      for a Jubilee, for a debt cancellation, even that we saw 25 years ago. Now, part
      of that has to do with questions of leadership. You know, where we used to have
      Fidel Castro calling the world to Cuba to support a global struggle against these
      odious debts, as Michael has said. We’re not seeing the same kind of leadership
      on the question of sovereign debt. We’re also seeing a renewed attempt by the
      United States to override those efforts. We saw the South Africans try to launch
      a cost of capital commission through the G20 process in the U.S., forcing them
      to change the cost of capital commission. We just wanted to talk about the terms
      of integration into the international financial system into a review of the cost
      of capital. Why do you think we’re struggling so much to revive and renew a kind
      of politics of debt cancellation, of a more radical and protagonistic attempt
      to rewrite the rules that, as you rightly point out, continue to subjugate the
      world’s majority? Devika Dutt: That’s a really hard question, David, but if I
      had to take a stab at that, I think you’re absolutely correct. But I feel like
      this is definitely still a result of the decades of austerity that have sort of
      compromised basic, like compromised and worsened the lives of different people
      all over the world, which has given rise to fascist movements all over the world,
      which are not necessarily amenable to challenging global capitalism or the global
      debt system, especially when it’s in the interest of some of them to be in the
      good graces of President Trump now, for instance. So in a way, like it’s a very
      hard question, but in another way, it’s very obvious that this is the result,
      this is an outcome of the past 50 years of debt peonage, austerity, and the impacts
      of horrible policies imposed on many countries of the global South. But that being
      said then, the challenge then is that we need to sort of reclaim these movements,
      reclaim our projects of not just nation building, because I don’t think nation
      building is appropriate anymore in this context when nationalism is only about
      sort of demonizing the other or keeping people out or just sort of excluding somebody
      from your project and taking muscular control of something in every nation. And
      so the challenge of course then is to sort of reclaim, fight fascism and fight
      all these authoritarian movements everywhere, so that we can build this leadership,
      build this movement against sort of the system of debt peonage as well. I don’t
      wanna say that it has to be like one before the other, but I think this is in
      my view, one of the biggest impediments, because as you mentioned, there are leaders
      like Fidel and even in the global South, there are other places in the global
      South, like Nehru or Sukarno and all these great leaders, Nasser, who had a vision,
      who once again, weren’t necessarily perfect, but were definitely trying to build
      towards something better. And the leaderships in those countries now are nowhere
      near those that don’t have that kind of vision of sort of an anti-imperial project
      against sort of the hegemony of the global North, but specifically the United
      States. David Adler: Thank you, Devika. And so Michael, now that we’re coming
      to kind of the conclusion of the discussion, I wanna turn to a couple of the questions.
      Michael Hudson: Yes, that’s what I want, questions. David Adler: And they really
      focus on this question about the politics of debt. So one is asking about how
      legal and accounting systems that allow for ill-gotten profits to be obfuscated
      using corporate structures and ledger trickery. One is about how the international
      balance of payments have been privatized and forgotten ever since finance was
      untethered from reality as this comment points in 1971. And both these questions
      are pointing to looking at the past half century, how it may have become more
      difficult to build this movement as Devika and I were discussing a kind of different
      politics of debt. So what do you think of those questions about how corporate
      and banking sectors have transformed in the past 50 years? Obviously thinking
      about 1971 as a critical juncture of Nixon making some world historical unilateral
      decisions about the future of the international financial system. What are those
      changes in the past 50 years of the global economy mean for the politics of debt
      around the world? Michael Hudson: Well, part of the problem is the academic system.
      Economists don’t talk about debt. Debt plays no role in the economic models. They
      say, well, it doesn’t matter. Debt is, money is only avail and debt is only avail.
      And we owe the debt to ourselves, so it doesn’t matter. But the we is the 99%
      and ourselves that we owe it to are the 1%. So the academic economic profession
      plays no role. I think now you’re beginning to see UNCTAD potentially playing
      an important role. But there’s very little discussion in the mainstream press
      against all of this. Debt is something that is considered impolite to bring up
      in polite company. You know, a little over a century ago, sex was what people
      couldn’t talk about until really Freud came along. It just wasn’t what you talked
      about. Today, talking about debt is just like talking about sex around 1900. It
      disturbs people. They don’t wanna talk about it because there’s no solution to
      the debt problem without going beyond the permissible barriers of polite company
      and just acknowledging that debts can’t be paid. There is no equilibrium process
      that automatically keeps debt and foreign trade in a system of balance and equilibrium.
      The Ricardian theory, the theory that is used by, that Nobel prizes are given
      for, proves that there is no debt problem and can be no debt problem because paying
      debt automatically provides the opportunity to pay it. This is absolute nonsense,
      but the mathematics underlying the academic theory are less sophisticated than
      those taught in Babylonia in 1800 BC. And we know that because I’ve published
      the school texts that scribes were taught and scribes were taught to describe
      how long does it take for a debt to double? And the answer is exponentially doubling
      in five years, quadrupling in 10 years, octupling in 15 years, multiplying 16
      times in 20 years and 64 times in 30 years. Well, obviously no economy can keep
      up with this rate of growth. And at the same time, the Babylonian said, well,
      how fast can economies grow? And we have their mathematical training texts, for
      instance, how fast does a herd of cattle grow? Well, it begins to grow, but then
      it tapers off. This is the opposite of modern business cycle theory of the National
      Bureau of Economic Research. You have academic economics being weaponized. The
      National Bureau’s theory of business cycles says that there are automatic stabilizers.
      You don’t need a government to do any interference at all because automatically
      the economy is going to keep running and stabilizing. This leaves out of account
      the fact that every recovery since World War II from the United States to England
      to continental Europe has occurred at a larger and larger ratio of debt to income
      and debt to GDP. And now it’s reached the limit. That is said to be impossible
      according to every economic theory that’s received a Nobel Prize. So you have
      to realize that there has been the narrative of analyzing the debt problem has
      been turned into junk economics, basically, because it denies reality. It’s been
      formulated by the financial sector as a kind of propaganda to distract governments
      and the population and political parties and movements from realizing that the
      debts can’t be paid and therefore doing something about it. So you have to almost
      start another discipline. I don’t know if you’d call it anthropology or something
      or futurism, that’s what I called it in the 1970s because futurism doesn’t mean
      anything at all and it doesn’t have the baggage of academic economics saying debts
      don’t have any problem at all, just keep on paying them. So that’s what you have
      to come up with. And if you have an agency, let’s say like UNCTAD pointing out
      that the debts can’t be paid, then it’s obvious that if they can’t be paid, they
      won’t be paid. And the question is, how won’t they be paid? Well, you just have
      to write them off on something more drastic than the Brady Bonds of the Latin
      American debt bomb that occurred after 1982. And you have to replace academic
      economics with reality economics. And that’s very hard to do because if you’re
      an economist and want to bring it up, you really can’t get academic acceptance
      in the major journals that are all run from a pro-financial, pro-creditor point
      of view. Economic journals, economic teaching has been turned into special interests
      by the financial sector and by the rentier sector. Finance, insurance, and real
      estate have essentially justified themselves claiming to be making a productive
      contribution to the economy and to GDP and to economic growth instead of being
      a form of economic overhead. So the whole vocabulary and set of concepts dealing
      with how to look at the debt problem have to be popularized. And this has to be
      done, I think, from the self-interest of debtor countries outside of the United
      States that are trying to explain why the debt simply can’t be paid and therefore
      shouldn’t be paid without creating such a degree of impoverishment and economic
      polarization that it’s odious and abhorrent. David Adler: Thank you, Michael.
      I can think of no more of a rousing call to action than the odiousness and abhorrence
      of the international system of debts and the very importance stamp on all of our
      foreheads that if it can’t be paid, it won’t be paid. And whether it’s our generation
      who takes up that call or we’re able to set the terrain for a truly radical position
      on the abolition of odious debt remains our task. I do think, as we’ve said before,
      that because of these problems of academic ignorance, political myopia and structural
      subjugation, we live in a time in which it’s our task to revive and rejuvenate
      politics around sovereign as well as household of debts, a time to break the taboo,
      as Michael was saying, around debts that has come to replace the taboo around
      sex in our public imagination and move toward the truly liberatory paradigm that
      requires us to be literate in the great history that you’ve traced out for us,
      Michael. And of course, that David Graeber traced very eloquently through his
      work. And with that, I wanna thank Nika. I wanna thank the team at the David Graeber
      Institute for the opportunity to continue a dialogue with Professor Hudson. I
      wanna thank Devika for joining us on short notice to have this important conversation.
      And I wanna thank you all for joining us online and joining us with your comments
      and with your questions and with your dialogue in the comment section of the broadcast.
      I hope that we can meet again soon to continue this conversation, to continue
      with debates about how we can really work together to rejuvenate the politics
      around debt and think together about what a new vision might be, what it might
      mean to forge a common horizon for this liberation from such an odious and abhorrent
      system of debt, as Michael has said. Thank you so much to everyone. We’re gonna
      close it here. I hope you have an excellent weekend and see you next time. -End

      Hudson, Devika Dutt, and David Adler explore the unraveling belief in the moral
      legitimacy of the global debt system and contemplate potential futures shaped
      by either financial globalism or nationalist capitalism.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent dialogue hosted by the David Graeber Institute, Nika
      Dubrovsky introduced a conversation featuring Michael Hudson, David Adler, and
      Devika Dutt, focusing on the evolving perceptions of the global debt system. The
      discussion highlighted how the moral narrative that once upheld the debt system
      is crumbling, leading to questions about the future of financial globalism versus
      nationalist capitalism. Adler moderated the conversation, emphasizing the need
      to explore the past, present, and future of debt and the international financial
      system, while considering the implications of a highly financialized capitalism
      and the moral stories surrounding debt relationships among individuals, states,
      and empires. The session aimed to engage viewers in contemplating potential new
      horizons beyond the current financial structures.

    text: 'Logo Daedalus , READ BOOKS VLT. Interview April 24th, 2025 LOGO DAEDALUS:
      Well, I just wanted to say thank you. First off, your books have been extremely
      important to me. I’ve done, I think, some good work in helping to popularize them
      on Twitter or X, I guess we’re calling it these days. But when I first found your
      work, I was really coming from more of a literary studies sort of perspective.
      I studied Russian literature and Russian in college, and was mostly interested
      in literature, and then slowly became interested in economics, more from a literary
      perspective. In your one of your interviews about your biography, you described
      going into musical composition, classical composition, and then finding a sort
      of aesthetic satisfaction in the study of economics. I found that very inspiring
      personally, because I feel sort of the same way. The appeal to Marx and other
      political economists like Veblen and guys like that, guys like yourself, was that
      they gave me the same satisfaction of reading a great novel, especially like a
      great satirical novel. And that’s been sort of my interest in all of this… how
      economics is sort of an outgrowth of literary satire, and the genre of the anatomy
      that people like Northrop Frye would describe. So I think of you as like the greatest
      living satirist in the world – you make me laugh more than anyone in the whole
      world. So thank you. MICHALE HUDSON: Well, you understand where my mentality is
      at. LOGO DAEDALUS: If there’s any question I could start off with – I’m sure you’re
      going to cover this in the book you’re working on. I‘ve been a long time follower
      of your work. So I’m waiting patiently for the next book in the cycle on debt
      covering the crusades and onward, because that’s a particular interest of mine
      from a literary perspective on Christian hermeneutics. The translation of the
      Lord’s Prayer was a major thing for me – the “forgive us our debts” and whatnot.
      Tying this into material economics really opened all of this up for me. So I believe
      you referred to a specific school of the Catholics, men who come up with the justification
      for charging interest on debts, but under a different name, so it doesn’t qualify
      as usury. I was wondering if you could go into detail about when specifically
      you would say this shift happened and under what dispensation? MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Well, funny, you should put the question that way about literary discussion, because
      most of the discussions about economics in the 13th and 14th Century – and that’s
      when the schoolmen were coming up with their justification of interest – the best
      discussions were all of a literary character, of course, by Dante. I mean Dante
      describes putting all the usurers back in the seventh circle of hell. And there
      was a kind of theme of usurers being put together with the sodomites, in the sense
      that they said lending is sterile. Lending does not produce an economic return
      for the borrower. The borrower has pay the interest out of whatever they earn
      elsewhere. If it’s the government borrowing money to go wage war, then it has
      to levy taxes, and this reduces the population. If it’s an individual who borrows
      from a usurer, then they have to cut back their consumption or lose their property,
      or lose their economic freedom and fall into debt bondage. So it’s the literary
      people that describe this, just like in Greek and Roman history. It’s the literary
      writers that describe what was happening in the creditor landowning oligarchy
      that ended up stifling Rome. Also, in the 20th Century it was the literary historians
      that won the Nobel Literature Prize for writing about antiquity, or were nominated…
      people like Theodor Mommsen and Guglielmo Ferraro. They were viewed as literary
      historians. Economists don’t talk about debt, they don’t talk about finance, they
      don’t talk about interest, or how it began at all, because it didn’t begin in
      the private sector. It was the Catholic Church that created and sponsored the
      first international banking in the 12th and 13th Century. And they sponsored it
      because the Roman church wanted to essentially take over all of Christianity,
      and the crusades were waged mainly against Christians. The official crusade, the
      first real crusade, was in southern Italy and Sicily by Robert Guiscard. The Catholic
      Church asked, who are we going to get to kill the Christians that don’t agree
      with us? Who are we going to get to fight the Germans? The Germans wanted a decent,
      balanced church without all of the craziness and fighting against everybody who
      didn’t agree with you. How are we going to fight against the Muslim territories?
      But most of all, how are we going to fight against Orthodox Christianity, the
      majority of Christianity. There were five Patriarchates in the 12th Century. Rome
      was the least important. The most important was Constantinople, then, Antioch,
      then Alexandria, and then Jerusalem. Rome was at the nadir in the 9th and 10th
      Century. The Catholic Church histories call it the pornocracy, because it was
      basically just the local families of a wealthy Roman suburb called Tusculum that
      sort of had controlled the church as their own personal set of sinecures for themselves,
      and they were so corrupt that you had Germans set out to try to reform it. And
      then they said, how are we going to get rid of the nepotism and the fact that
      the Vatican is captured by churches? – basically, so they could find either young
      women or boys to screw… the utter corruption that you read about these families.
      They asked, how are we going to make some semblance of Christianity again? And
      they tried to reform. Well after them came another reform that wanted to prevent
      an aristocracy from taking over the Catholic Church and making it a family business.
      They did not want to let the clergy and popes be married, because if they marry,
      they’re going to have kids, and if they have kids, they’re going to make them
      the Pope. That’s what happened from the 9th and the 10th Century in Tusculum.
      You can find it all on Wikipedia or in the Catholic Church histories. They’re
      sort of embarrassed. So that made Western Christianity, Roman Christianity, different
      from all the other Christian churches that permitted priests to get married. LOGO
      DAEDALUS: Yeah, that used to be something you had to do. That was a way of demonstrating
      that you were invested in the community that you were overseeing. MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Sure, and the German reformers wanted to make the Christian church part of society,
      even playing a role in trade and in the military. They wanted, you know, to have
      a Christian community. That’s not what ended up happening. And also, the Roman
      church wanted to introduce this theory of the the Trinity that basically said
      Jesus wasn’t the Son of God, he wasn’t a human being, and he had nothing to do
      with being a political or social leader, or leading opposition to the creditor
      class. It was all about God. And the Catholic Church basically had been poisoned
      in the 4th and 5th Century by two of the most evil theologians in history, Cyril
      of Alexandria, who based the Christian church on anti-semitism because he wanted
      to drive out all of the Christians who weren’t under his personal control. And
      most early Christians were Jewish. So he led pogroms against the Jews in addition
      to killing Hypatia, who was a mathematician, and he put in the Trinity idea and
      elevated the Virgin Mary to the Trinity, knowing that that’s the one thing the
      Jews were not going to go along with because they wouldn’t have a woman as part
      of the Trinity. LOGO DAEDALUS: Well, it’s like a constant refrain in the Old Testament
      where they’re putting up the stack of idols to the Queen of Heaven and things
      like that, which becomes a major problem for the reformers. That’s one of the
      first things I think Jehu does in the Old Testament, is destroy all of the shrines
      to the Queen of Heaven. MICHAEL HUDSON: Right. And the other person, of course,
      St. Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo in North Africa, said, how do we get rid of
      the fact that a lot of Christians don’t like interest? They also don’t like landlordship,
      and if there’s a landowner that’s a creditor reducing people to bondage – according
      to the documents that have survived – they raid the guy’s house, and they freed
      the bond persons. So Augustine said, look, we’ve got to kill all of these Christians
      that are not pro-Roman. And he said, you’ve got to give their churches to us,
      not them… and he said, we’ve got to get rid of the fact that in the Lord’s Prayer
      they’re all praying “forgive us our debts,” because all the debts are owed to
      you – my constituency, the Romans, the 0.1%. And so he said, it’s not really about
      debt at all. It’s about sin, and we’re all born with sin, and there’s nothing
      we can do, just like you have to pay a debt, you have to pay for the sin, and
      you have to pay us, the church. And this led to a large argument, and there were
      Welsh, British theologians… LOGO DAEDALUS: The Pelagians! MICHAEL HUDSON: Who
      said, no, if we’re Christians, we want to do good things, good works for the world.
      You know, we want to use our money to help people, maybe to forgive the debt.
      Augustine said, no, no, I’m excommunicating you. You can’t have anything. You
      can’t have people spend their own money in helping the society around them. You
      have to give to the poor. The poor are us. The poor are us clergy who are going
      and helping them – we get the money. And it’s all about sin. And the sin is inborn.
      There is nothing you can do but go through us, and when you die, give us your
      estate so that you can go to heaven by giving us the money. I mean he sounds like
      one of today’s Protestant evangelical leaders. So this was the Roman setting for
      that. This did not characterize the Eastern Christian Church orthodoxy. It was
      Constantinople and the rest of the Patriarchates… Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem
      that we’re following pretty close to the original Christianity. The Romans said,
      we’ve got to fight against that in order to control the entire church and make
      it all celibate, so that we can’t have the Tusculum people, the Popes, making
      it a family. They had the same problem that they had that Stalin pointed to in
      World War II. He said, How many armies does the Pope have? Well, they didn’t have
      an army. So what were they going to do? They found Norman warlords who had come
      down and were raiding the lands of Southern Italy and the Popes said, to Robert
      Guiscard, well, we’ll give you the kingship of Southern Italy and Sicily – Sicily
      was the key – if you promise to be pledge fealty and become our vassal King, then
      we will back your divine kingship. And he did. He became king. And a couple of
      decades later, you had another warlord, William the Conqueror, and they made a
      deal. They said, William, if you want to take over Britain we will make you King.
      You have to promise to give us tribute and perform vassalage to us and do pretty
      much what we say. And William the Conqueror made the deal. He became King, and
      it was the Catholic Church. Well, then they went into the Crusades, really, to
      take over the lands that Constantinople held as Orthodox Christianity, especially
      in what used to be Yugoslavia – the whole peninsula going down the Balkans. Greece,
      they tried to grab that land. They opposed Germany, because the German Emperor
      was the Holy Roman Emperor, and that upset Constantinople, because they said,
      wait a minute, we’re the Roman Empire. We’re the New Rome. You’re not the New
      Rome. You’re old Rome. We’re the real Rome. You’re just on the sideline there.
      So the Catholic Church, the Romans, said, how are we going to have the British
      King and the Sicilian King fight against the Germans and Constantinople? The sinews
      of war are money. They needed money. How are we going to raise money? That’s when
      it was the church itself that created the banking class… merchant bankers in Northern
      Italy and right across in the Alps – the trans-Alpine bankers. Roman popes would
      go to the British Kings, especially at first King John, and then his son, Henry
      the Third, and say, you know, we want you to go into debt to pay for an army to
      go and fight the Germans, who somehow gained more control over southern Italy
      and moving into Spain and Sicily. So this led to a fight within the church. And
      you have wonderful documentation from the analysts at the time who wrote the annals,
      like Matthew Paris, who wrote all about all of this in great detail. He was a
      friend of Henry the Third and was very well situated at the monastery in Saint
      Albans, where he worked. So when Henry the Third was was told, well, you have
      to raise money and we’ll make your son King of Italy, as long as he pledges fealty
      and pays us tribute like you’ve been doing. Well, if you can imagine, the nobility
      fought back and said, wait, we don’t want to pay taxes in order for you to go
      to war to fight the church’s war, that’s not our war. Well, this fight had already
      occurred in 1215 with the Magna Carta under King John. King John wanted to look
      for Vatican support to grab the land. He was called John Lackland, while Richard
      was fighting in Jerusalem. And so the the Barons got together and wrote the Magna
      Carta. And John wrote something finally – you know they were going to overthrow
      him – so he said, okay, I’ll agree with all of your demands and I promise if I
      go back on my word then everything I say will be negated in all of this and I
      promise not to go and ask for any override. Well, as soon as they signed it – I
      guess he was the Donald Trump of his day, or Barack Obama – he immediately went
      to the Pope and said excommunicate all of these people who will not let me serve
      you. And the Pope excommunicated the Barons that supported the Magna Carta. In
      the 1250s, under Henry the Third, the same thing happened. Henry the Third wanted
      to go into debt to fight the Germans in Sicily and the church said, if you disagree
      with usury we will excommunicate you. And you can imagine the turmoil this caused
      in the church. The church used to excommunicate usurers and now they’re excommunicating
      those who oppose usury. What happened? Well, when the Pope kills other people
      and does usury it’s not a crime, to quote Richard Nixon, basically. It was all
      okay. The theologians were put to work to figure out how to get rid of all these
      critics of usury because the church is all about usury now. We have to create
      a banking class that will make its money by war lending to Kings who will go fight
      our wars against people who will not accept Roman leadership over the Orthodox
      Christian leadership and the German support of it. So that’s when the churchmen
      came in and said, we have a new word – it’s not called usury anymore, lets call
      it interest. And they acted as if somehow loans were made – not to wage war, not
      to fight and kill people, not to serve the Vatican – but just to do mercantile
      trade. Because after all most of the bankers had made their money in mercantile
      trade. They we’re merchant families and became merchant bankers. Well, they had
      a whole logic that we were taught in the history of economic thought when I was
      in college in the 1960s, and it was the problem of foreign exchange dealing. That’s
      not really interest – you’re charged a fee for foreign exchange. And since these
      were international loans you’re changing from one currency into another so you’re
      allowed to make agio. LOGO DAEDALUS: Take your bite. MICHAEL HUDSON: Yeah, just
      like when you exchange money at the airport they take a cut. Also, if a merchant
      banker lends money he is not able to use this to make profits for himself. So
      he is giving up the profits, and that’s called lucrum cessans – you stop getting
      lucre, money. They get compensated, and the rate was 22%. And if you’re late,
      the late fee is another 22%. The church became a Visa card. So it ended up in
      England to be 44% that they had to pay, and this was all legitimized by the churchmen
      as interest. Well, you can understand if someone is late in paying it costs money,
      so what did the bankers do? Well Matthew Paris, and local bishops in England,
      described just exactly what they did. They said, okay, you borrowed from us, now
      you have to pay us. The repayment is going to be in just one month or two. Well,
      normally you make a loan and pay at harvest time, because at harvest time – a
      year later – is when you get the money to pay the loan. Soon, you end up doubling
      the interest rates with the late fee. And the small print was easy to manipulate
      if you were a banker. And the Popes all stood behind that and basically got together
      and essentially reversed Christianity’s long standing opposition to Christianity.
      And this is after St. Augustine changed the Lord’s prayer to “forgive us our sins”
      for which you have to pay the church to get to heaven, instead of “forgive us
      our debts” that you’d have to pay to the Romans – if we’re following Christian
      documentation. So it was the Roman church that created the banking class. It’s
      very funny, there’s hardly any of this impetus on the church in economic histories.
      And a lot of it is because of Jewish historians that were understandably concerned
      about the fact that there was so much anti-semitism aimed at the Jews. Some, even
      many Jews, if they’re merchants, did lend money. But Matthew Paris and others
      say, well, they weren’t charging as much as the Christians. Well, Christians immediately
      – wanting to get rid of the Jewish money lenders – got King Henry’s son Edward
      to exile the Jews from England. And Phillip the Fourth exiled them from France.
      And so the Jews did not play a role in this creation of international banking
      – it was the church. And I’m just amazed at how the Jewish historians haven’t
      said that this whole idea of identifying Jews with international banking has been
      used as an anti-semitic accusation. They did not play any role at all. The Vatican,
      when it was organizing the war loans to its vassal Kings, did not borrow from
      the Jews. They would confiscate their money, but they wouldn’t borrow, and they
      would certainly not pay interest. The role of Jews when they were brought into
      England was the fact that they were the merchant class. And the warlords didn’t
      know too much about creating mercantile trade or production because they were
      robbers, not merchants. LOGO DAEDALUS: Well, listen, they did a lot of human trafficking
      so they had some industries. MICHAEL HUDSON: Right, so it was the Jewish population
      that had the background of organizing trade credit, along with the Islamic lenders.
      But of course the English and French chose to let the Jews in but not the Muslims,
      basically. LOGO DAEDALUS: That is making me think – I’m a big fan of Thorstein
      Veblen, and I know you’re a big fan of Veblen, too. He has this great, little
      essay he wrote called An Experiment In Trusts, which is about the origin of financial
      trusts with the Jomsvikings, in their slate trading corporations that they would
      establish. So I’ve been interested in how these Norman warlords are the reason
      why the Catholic Church develops this whole ideology so it can justify the extraction
      of interest. Why is it that none of this is ever covered in mainstream economics?
      It seems to lead to what now looks like a massive rise in anti-semitism you could
      say, but it’s really more like how Marx and Engels described anti-semitism as
      like, retarded political economy. Because it’s these people who are genuinely
      trying to understand how the system of economics that we live under works and
      where it came from, but, outside of you, there’s really not many great resources
      to point people toward in order to come to an understanding of the actual history
      of these things. And most of the people who are going to tell them that story
      are just going to tell them the Jews invented banking and here we are. MICHAEL
      HUDSON: Well, there’s a reason for this tunnel vision. If you look at Böhm-Bawerk
      and all of the apologists to justify the charging of interest, they all do it
      on an individual bases. Well, if a lender makes a loan then he’s not able to spend
      this money on his own consumption. So he is giving up something and he is being
      paid for being abstinent. That led Karl Marx to say that the Rothschilds should
      be the most abstinent family in all of Europe – obviously, if you’re a very wealthy
      banker you don’t really give up consumption. Because the money that you do get,
      the interest and others, you make new loans. You don’t consume more with it, you
      make new loans. And you mentioned trusts – you’re corporatizing, essentially,
      a monopoly, a business monopoly. Well, this is because of the genius of financial
      organization. By the 13th and 14th, you had the banking class decide… how can
      we extend the market for our loans? Well, I mentioned the fact that the Barons
      of England first opposed King John taking on debt with the Magna Carta. And then
      Henry the Third, again the Barons opposed it. And most Kingdoms of Europe – there
      was a kind of parliament of one kind or another – that had the power to block
      the Kings from taxing and said, you have to tax for the benefit of the country.
      And at that time they didn’t believe that going to war for somebody else’s war
      was for the country. The King was constrained. When a King took on debt from the
      international bankers there were only two resources a King had. One was his own
      royal domain – that part of the land that belonged to him personally. The royal
      domain was much less than the church domain. The largest landowner in almost every
      kingdom in medieval times was the church, not the King. So the King had that,
      and the King had the power to tax subject to parliamentary constraint. So, the
      bankers got together – and remember, they’re merchant bankers who did foreign
      trade as well as war lending – and they said, well, you’re able to charge customs
      duties, and that does not require parliamentary approval. They found the small
      print in the legal code and said you can organize the import and export trade.
      So you had the English Kings, Edward and onward, being able to make a corporation
      or partnership group out of England’s wool trade. And England would export the
      wool to Flanders and the low countries, to weave into cloth to send to Italy to
      be made into fashions. And the money would then go from Italy back to England
      via the low countries to pay for the wool. And that the triangular flow that you
      had in England, basically. So the way that Kings were able to make money without
      taxing the people was to make royal corporations that would be monopolies. By
      the 17th Century these extended to the East and West India Corporations. And the
      Bank of England was a corporation. You’d create a monopoly, you’d give it to the
      company to raise money, and you’d say, were going to sell it, and that’s how we
      get the money to pay our foreign creditors. And so the creditors sort of help
      the Kings organize their finances so they could raise enough money to pay the
      debts they took on. Well, by the late 17th Century, you had leading Kings who
      were all Catholics. French, the Spanish, and the Austrian, the Hapsburg Kings,
      all kept defaulting again and again and again in the 17th Century because, even
      though Spain had all of this silver coming in from the New World, it just went
      right out. The silver was squandered on luxury spending. None of the money being
      used was spent on developing its own handicraft industry. Instead, with all of
      this money coming in, they taxed handicraft labor and other labor, and you had
      a huge emigration of skilled labor. And Adman Smith pointed to this – they’d go
      to places like England, or the Protestant countries, where things were free. And
      the Protestant countries had a completely different form of political organization
      than the royal autocracies. The idea came from the self-governing cities of Europe,
      like Venice for instance, or Genoa and Florence. These self-governing cities would
      elect leaders, and because they were a commune, all of the members of the community
      were liable for the debts that the community took on. And the bankers said, this
      is a wonderful idea, if only we could have nations act this way. Well, you had
      a lot of these communities in the Dutch countries – and these communities joined
      together to create Holland. And the idea of having a whole national government
      as a community where all of the citizens were liable for debts and not only the
      King. If a King ran into debt and couldn’t pay and the debtor went bankrupt then
      the bank lost the money. Because they didn’t have any recourse to all the money
      in England when the King didn’t have the ability tax all of the citizens. But
      the new parliamentary democracies became something that have been called fiscal
      states. The bankers took the lead in organizing these fiscal states where the
      leadership in Holland and especially in England after the 1688 revolution that
      brought King George to England – all of that became the new kind of political
      organization. And the result was that the parliamentary democracies were able
      to borrow from creditors to get the military loans to defend themselves against
      the Catholic Kings who were attacking them to take them over. And the Catholic
      Kings couldn’t raise war loans because they were no longer as credit worthy as
      the democracies that could tax the entire population against them. So, it is very
      funny – Max Webber talked about the Protestant revolution as promoting a financial
      class because of its ethic of personal gain. But it was really the organization
      of the fiscal state that made the big change for what really emerged from all
      of this. And ever since, the Bank of England, and later the English and French
      governments tried to raise more money by selling off their monopoly of the slave
      trade. France sold the Mississippi bubble based on plantation slave agriculture
      in Louisiana. And England had the South Sea bubble – they had conquered Spain
      and had the Asiento monopoly on the slave trade. Everyone thought that the slave
      trade was going to be the industry of the future, sort of like computers today…
      so basically a bubble. So, you have the financial sector helping governments organize
      mercantile monopolies and organize finances. And the bankers of the 13th Century
      backed royal autocracies because the church was able to protect the Kings against
      the nobility, who would not want to pay the war debts they took on. By the 17th
      Century the banking class said, well, we really can’t afford autocracies anymore
      because they go to war – and because they’re an autocracy – all the debts are
      owned only by the King because the King controls everything, but there’s the rest
      of society around them… so now were going to switch to the opposite position that
      we had originally: we’re going to back the parliaments that we opposed when parliaments
      wouldn’t pay the debts, because now, under the new fiscal parliamentary states,
      the parliaments are promising to pay the debts. Because that was the condition
      on which they were able to borrow war loans from the banks. So that made them
      more credit worthy and they could borrow on better terms than the autocratic Kings
      who really couldn’t borrow at all. And that shifted the economic and military
      advantage to Northern Europe because of the banking class. Well, what happened
      is the banking class basically created a new web of interconnections within Europe
      that took the place of what used to be the Catholic Church. Instead of the Catholic
      Church creating a system of integration – largely economic, and above all financial
      with Europe – what this financial class created became the new organizer of the
      system of integration that shaped Europe and it’s gone right down to the present
      day. The banking class, through government, has backed governments who promote
      creditor interest. Because, if governments do not promote creditor interest then
      nobody will lend to it because it’s not credit worthy anymore. When it goes to
      war it’s not going to be able to get as much money as the other groups and war
      is fought by money and paying mercenaries. And that’s sort of the big theme of
      my book. The title I’ve come up with is A Political History of the West’s Financial
      Takeoff from the Crusades to World War I . And I’m working on the final chapters
      and rewriting the chapter summary now. LOGO DAEDALUS: Amazing. I can’t wait to
      read it. If there’s one last thing I could ask you about – I guess we’ll go to
      current events. MICHAEL HUDSON: Very briefly, because I don’t want to drain your
      audiences attention. LOGO DAEDALUS: I just wanted to throw this by you because
      I just read your interview with Ben Norton on the tariffs. There’s a great Veblen
      quote where he says, “all business sagacity reduces in the financial estimation
      to a judicious use of sabotage.” MICAHEL HUDSON: Ah ha! LOGO DAEDALUS: Would you
      describe that basically what’s going on is an attempt to sabotage the global economy
      – that’s all that it comes down to? MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, Veblens point was that
      it was the financial sector that sabotaged industrial capitalism. It’s the financial
      system that seeks to make its gains financially – capital gains, corporate raiding,
      living in the short term, paying out profits as quickly as it can instead of reinvesting
      its profits in long term investment like the German banks were doing . So it’s
      a shift from industrial capitalism to finance capitalism that ended up destroying
      industrial capitalism leading to deindustrialization. Veblen’s pointing on how
      the American economy was turned into a rentier economy, largely on real estate.
      Because 80% of bank loans are for real estate. And the effect of increasing the
      loan to value ratio is you lend more and more money against any given property
      or home or office building and the effect is to constantly inflate real estate
      prices. Well, the financial sector gained enough power over the government by
      being able to make mortgage interest the primary financial return along with monopoly
      rent. So you have land rent and monopoly rent being the objective of finance capitalism,
      not industrial profits. So the finance sector took the lead against classical
      economics. And the fight against classical economics was much like that of the
      Roman Church against early Christianity. The whole idea of classical economics
      and the free market – from the French physiocrats to Adam Smith to John Stuart
      Mill and Marx, all the way up to Veblen – was that a free market is one free from
      the landlord class and its land rent. Free from monopolies and monopoly rent.
      And free from predatory banking and its interest, which was a form of monopoly
      rent because banks had a monopoly on being able to create money and credit with
      government banking. And so, as the financial sector took over governments moving
      toward the apotheosis that you have in America since the Supreme Court Citizens
      United case – essentially privatizing the election process, saying anybody can
      fund elections – you have a shift of politics to favor the financialization of
      the economy, which in turn favors land rent, monopoly rent and interest. And also
      the financial class became the major donors to the Universities. Especially the
      business schools, and they backed economic curriculum that rewrites all of economic
      history as if its all individuals… well, international banking began when merchants
      wanted to lend money to handicraft people who were exporting to other people,
      weaving cloth, it was all part of business and its was all very productive. No
      discussion at all over the fact that that wasn’t what created banking. It was
      war lending that base of the international banking class. This is not a private
      enterprise approach to history. So, you have part of the financialization of the
      economy taking over the industrial aims – increasing labor productivity, raising
      wages, increasing the internal market. Now you have just the opposite. You have
      more and more of the economy siphoned off in the form of the various forms of
      various rent and less and less available for personal spending, the internal market,
      and private capital investment. So that’s basically the dynamic, which has gone
      hand in hand with an ideological airbrushing of history. When I went to graduate
      school, 60 years ago, we not only had the history of economic thought where you
      knew what Adam Smith really wrote – I wrote my book J is for Junk Economics on
      how the vocabulary has changed – we also had economic history. And even though
      the economic history wasn’t what I wrote about, at least you had economic history
      and a long term approach and you realized that markets are shaped by government,
      by society, by public policy, and there’s no room to analyze that. LOGO DAEDALUS:
      Yeah. There’s the irony that the creation of markets and all these things that
      are the bedrock of libertarian theory are all government creations, they’re all
      public goods – a corporation is a public good, markets in general are a public
      good. These things didn’t emerge from voluntary individuals but were state projects.
      MICHAEL HUDSON: Right. LOGO DAEDALUS: That’s an irony that’s very difficult for
      libertarians to see. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well that’s the neoliberalism. Economists
      are brought up with a tunnel vision. That’s the problem. They don’t see that there’s
      a role of government because the financial sector wants to take over government
      and dismantle it, and make what used used to be government – including all of
      the public enterprises and natural public monopolies and the election process
      – all part of the financial sector, not part of the political sector. LOGO DAEDALUS:
      Yeah, yeah… yeah. We’ll hopefully things get better, but it’s going to be a long
      road ahead. How do we change this view on economics en masse, how it is even possible
      when all of the institutions are effectively captured by the most powerful interests
      in the world to teach the exact opposite. MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the only way I
      can do it is by writing my books. No publisher has been eager to publish my books
      so they’re all done by my research foundation. They’re published by a Chinese
      group. LOGO DAEDALUS: Chinese, yeah. MICHAEL HUDSON: I translate my books into
      Chinese so obviously this idea is very popular there because they have a public-private
      economy and they’re open to this idea. Other countries translate the books but
      there’s very little English language discussion of this so there’s no market for
      publishers to write books like this because – how do you fit the ideas that I
      just described in the academic curriculum? It is not going to be in the economic
      courses because there’s no economic history anymore, maybe in the literary courses
      but I don’t think I’m going to win any literary prize for this. People don’t know
      how to characterize this approach just explained in the last 45 minutes. LOGO
      DAEDALUS: Well, it’s the approach that me and my listeners are a big fan of so
      keep up the good work. Thanks for letting me talk to you, man. Its been a dream
      of mine for a while and… get some rest. Stay strong, stay healthy. MICHAEL HUDSON:
      Thank you, I look forward to what your group comments on and what they see in
      all of this. LOGO DAEDALUS: Yeah, alright man, well, thanks again. MICHAEL HUDSON:

    text: 'Will US President Donald Trump be the tipping point for the dollar system?
      Even Western financial outlets now warn of the beginning of the end of dollar
      dominance.


      To discuss in this episode of Geopolitical Economy Hour, political economist Radhika
      Desai is joined by economist Michael Hudson and economic geographer Mick Dunford.


      You can find more episodes of Geopolitical Economy Hour here.


      Introduction


      RADHIKA DESAI: Will Trump prove to be the tipping point for the dollar system?


      As regular viewers of Geopolitical Economy Hour will know, we have done many programmes
      on the dollar’s shaky basis, and on how and why we can expect its role as world
      money to unravel.


      Now, suddenly, the Western press is full of forebodings of the demise of the dollar.
      The Financial Times alone, normally a loyal proponent of the wonders of the dollar
      system, has published a series of stories, each marshalling a different reason
      for the dollar system’s possibly imminent demise — over a dozen in April alone.


      So let me start us off with the following observations: What is interesting is
      how much these recent stories attribute to Trump the dollar system’s possible
      demise – evidenced by the simultaneous sell-off of US stocks, bonds, and dollars,
      which is surprising given that the latter two are generally considered “safe haven”
      assets which are bought when there is a sell-off of riskier assets like stocks.


      But is it really about Trump, or about the longer term currents which Trump may
      only be accelerating?


      Much attention has focussed on Trump and his administration’s threat to fire the
      chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Jerome Powell. This included the US president’s
      Truth Social post calling Powell a “loser” and insisting on lower interest rates
      forthwith.


      This was the latest straw on the already groaning back of the USD camel — raising
      fears that the replacement of Powell, a known quantity, would give markets a fright.


      More broadly, the same commentator also pointed out, “What many foreigners are
      inferring from Trump’s getting elected twice is that America itself cannot be
      trusted or relied upon”.


      Japanese and Chinese investors were quoted as saying that US “asset credibility”
      was slipping, and that the dollar and US treasuries, normally regarded as safe-haven
      assets, were now being regarded as risk assets.


      In April, FT reporter Robin Wigglesworth and his colleagues were asking, “Is the
      world losing faith in the almighty US dollar?”, focussing largely on how the world
      has been dumping dollar assets: equities and bonds — when normally investors dump
      one to buy the other — as well as the dollar, which is normally expected to rise
      amid crises, thanks to its haven status.


      The reason? Well, it’s all about trust and friendship, or in this case, distrust
      and resentment.


      The authors quoted a US finance representative:


      It’s not just that you can’t trust the US any more, be it on geopolitics or trade…
      We have also managed to massively piss off the rest of the world. There’s genuine,
      personal animosity towards us, and that hurts the dollar.


      Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Bloomberg has published a story on how
      two months of Trump has shaken “the pillars of American financial hegemony”.


      Bloomberg wrote that, with trade war and attacks on the Federal Reserve, Trump
      has sent investors who, until recently had been “anticipating a so-called Trump
      trade, essentially turbocharging US exceptionalism, but now it looks more like
      a sell-America trade”.

      Transcript


      (Intro)


      BEN NORTON: Why has US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on countries all
      around the world? And in particular, why is Trump waging a trade war on China?
      What are his real goals?


      Well, to try to answer these questions, I spoke with the economist Michael Hudson,
      who is the author of many books, and who just published the new report “Return
      of the robber barons: Trump’s distorted view of US tariff history“.


      Michael Hudson outlined the history of the use of tariffs in the United States
      and in other countries, and he explained how Trump is using tariffs as a weapon
      of class war, to benefit the rich at the expense of the vast majority of the population,
      and also how Trump is trying to reshape the global financial system, in order
      to benefit the United States at the expense of everyone else.


      But as Michael Hudson warns, this is already backfiring on the US economy, and
      it’s accelerating the transition to a more multipolar world.


      So here are a few clips from our discussion, and then we’ll go straight to the
      interview.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: The United States is the only country in the world that has weaponized
      its foreign trade; weaponized its foreign currency, the dollar; weaponized the
      international financial system; and treated every economic relationship in an
      adversarial way, to weaponize it.


      And other countries say, how can we have a different approach, and treat trade
      as how can we mutually gain? How can we treat investment as something where the
      investor gains, but we also gain?


      So what’s happening is that, as other countries are putting in place their mutual
      production facilities, transportation facilities, investment facilities, Trump
      is isolating the United States from trade and investment relations.


      It has tried to isolate China, but what it’s doing is isolating itself from everyone,
      except its satellites.


      (Interview)


      BEN NORTON: Michael, thanks for joining me; it’s always a pleasure. Let’s start
      by talking about this report that you published.


      You outlined the history of US use of tariffs and industrial policy, and your
      argument is that Trump is using tariffs essentially as a form of class warfare,
      to move the burden off of the rich and corporations, and to increase the burden
      of taxation on the working class through the use of tariffs.


      So can you talk about what your argument is in this report and why you decided
      to write it?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, it’s much more than simply class warfare. Trump has for
      years been complaining about the fact that the richest people are taxed progressively,
      at a higher tax rate than other people. He wants to get rid of the tax rate altogether
      for the finance, insurance, and real estate sector, the FIRE sector.


      I think he must have had a discussion with some economist or historian and said,
      “Isn’t there some way that we can get by without an income tax?” And the person
      must have told him, “Well, you know, the United States didn’t have an income tax
      before 1913”.


      And Trump said, “No income tax?” No, the Supreme Court ruled that an income tax
      was unconstitutional. That’s what supreme courts do; they try to prevent any kind
      of progressive social legislation.


      Well, finally, in 1913, the Senate passed the 14th Amendment, and enabled an income
      tax to be levied.


      So Trump said, “Well, how how did the United States finance itself before that?”
      And the answer was, well, almost all the US fiscal revenues came from the tariff,
      from customs receipts, in addition to land sales for land that they grabbed from
      the Indians.


      So Trump said, “Well, they did it through tariffs!” The advantage of tariffs,
      for Trump, is that the cost falls on consumers. He doesn’t see that they also
      fall on companies that import goods from their foreign affiliates.


      But, ultimately Trump said, “Oh, this is on consumers; this is wonderful! Why
      couldn’t we go back to the way things used to be, today? Why can’t we get rid
      of the income tax altogether — at least on my constituency, the campaign donors
      — and why can’t we simply raise tariffs?”


      Well, his associates must have said, “How ever are you going to convince people
      to go along with this?” And so Trump said, “Well, let’s see, under tariff protection,
      in the late 19th century, that’s how the United States rose to be a great industrial
      power. So somehow, tariffs must have nurtured industry. And I want to bring industrialization
      back to the United States, to make America great again. And I can say tariffs
      are going to bring back industry”.


      And what he means is, un-taxing the wealthy people, especially the finance and
      real estate sector, and shifting the tax on the consumers is going to make the
      country great again.


      Well, what he’s leaving out is the fact that it wasn’t tariffs as such that made
      America into an industrial power. What there was a whole large program that was
      necessary to industrialize America.


      All of this was spelled out in the 1820s by Henry Clay, and it was called the
      American System. And the American System was protective tariffs, with “internal
      improvements” — that means public investment in infrastructure — and a national
      banking system to finance industry.


      Well, Trump said nothing about these, so it’s worth saying something about them.


      By the late 19th century, the United States, said, “How are we going to lower
      the cost that industry has to pay for its wages, without leading to a huge round
      of strikes?”


      The solution was we can have the public sector pick up many of the costs that
      labor would otherwise have to pay out of its own paychecks.


      For education, we can have free education — not the $50,000 a year that workers
      have to pay today in order to get a job. We can have social programs, health programs,
      and others, to help them.


      We can have natural monopolies in the public domain, such as transportation, starting
      with the Erie Canal, and going all the way through roads and other transportation.
      Communications too.


      All of these natural monopolies, if they were not held in the public domain, would
      be owned by private people who would get monopoly rents. And the United States
      said the way that we can compete with other countries is pretty much the way that
      the classical economists said you compete: you lower the cost of production by
      having the government bear as many of these costs as possible through public enterprises,
      through public infrastructure; you essentially socialize or nationalize the land.


      “Socialism” was not a bad word in the late 19th century. Almost everyone across
      the political spectrum was describing their policies as socialist. There were
      Christian socialists, and libertarian socialists, and Marxian socialists, and
      social democracy. Everybody was one kind of socialist for another.


      That meant a rising role of government in providing more and more services, or
      regulating the economy, such as the anti-trust law of 1890, to prevent monopoly
      pricing, and Teddy Roosevelt’s, trust-busting.


      The whole idea was to minimize the cost of production with an act of a government.
      And they said that, well, if we can have a mixed economy, a public and private
      economy together, with the government sponsoring industrial credit — not the kind
      of British credit that was just for trade, or exploitative, or loans to the farmers
      — but actually to finance capital investment in industry, then we can take off.


      It was this context for protective tariffs that enabled the United States to get
      rich.


      Well, what Trump wants to do is the exact opposite of this context. He wants to
      deregulate the economy, not regulate it. He wants to privatize any public domain
      that’s left, any public enterprises.


      The post office, for instance, can be privatized. It’s going to cut back services
      to rural areas. It’s going to increase prices. It’s going to make most of the
      US economy look like Thames Water in London, for instance.


      They’re going to Thatcher-ize the American economy, to do to the American economy
      what Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair did for England; or what Reaganomics began
      to do for the United States.


      So we’re talking about an anti-government policy, not a mixed policy. And under
      Elon Musk, he wants to just carve up the government agencies altogether, privatize
      everything.


      What they’re going to do is dismantle the country’s social programs, dismantle
      its subsidies, dismantle subsidized social programs that have enabled companies
      like Amazon, or other low wage companies, to pay very low wages, and having the
      American social system pay for employees that are paid below the poverty line,
      because they haven’t been increasing the minimum wage in the United States.


      So, this is what is really in store for the US: cut, essentially privatize, the
      government; especially get rid of Social Security, and other social programs,
      Medicare.


      They call it streamlining the economy or making a “free market”, a market without
      government that interferes by protecting consumers, protecting the population
      against predatory monopolies and predatory finance.


      BEN NORTON: Michael, you raised so many important points there.


      I want to hit on this idea of the Gilded Age, that Trump sees the Gilded Age in
      the 19th century as essentially his model for what the US should return to.


      The Gilded Age is notorious for the robber barons, these big billionaires like
      Cornelius Vanderbilt and J.P. Morgan.


      Today there are, of course, similar oligarchs. Many of them are in the Trump administration,
      including Elon Musk, who’s the richest billionaire oligarch on Earth. You have
      the Treasury secretary, another billionaire hedge fund manager, Scott Bessent.
      Then you have the billionaire who is the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick; he’s
      also from Wall Street.


      And at his inauguration in January, Trump invited the world’s most powerful billionaires,
      like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and others.


      So one of the points that you emphasize is that Trump is really trying to overturn
      not only the progressive gains of the New Deal, but even the gains of the Progressive
      Era in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.


      When Trump looks back at people like McKinley, the US president, he sees essentially
      the 19th century and the Gilded Age as something positive. Of course, the vast
      majority of the population was exploited, and lived in horrible conditions, but
      for a small handful of oligarchs, the situation was quite rosy for them.


      So why do you think Trump sees it this way?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: What Trump doesn’t realize is that the Gilded Age was a failure
      of US protectionism.


      In the process of protecting industrial investment, you had the financial sector
      making a lot of money off this. And finance has always been the mother of trusts.


      Finance began to lead to a fight over who is going to control the railroads. The
      crisis of 1873 came when [robber baron] Jay Cooke’s railroad defaulted. There
      were rivals trying to buy control of railroads from each other.


      The Gilded Age emerged sort of accidentally, as a byproduct of making industry
      rich, you also made a lot of opponents of industry rich, like monopolists.


      That’s why in the year of the McKinley tariff, when he was a congressman in 1890,
      you had the Sherman anti-trust law. They said, OK, we’re going to make sure that
      the protection of industry does not become protection of monopolies; it will not
      become a protection of unearned wealth, economic rent-seeking.


      So Trump gets it all backward: what was an oversight that the Americans cured
      in 1890 — or at least started to put in place a public mechanism for avoiding
      the Gilded Age — as if that was actually a great success.


      If only it had succeeded, Trump would say, then, America would have polarized
      and done what gilded ages do.


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, and one of the points that you emphasize, Michael, is how China’s
      model is completely different.


      China is following the kind of state-led industry of policy that every industrialized
      economy has used to industrialize, to develop a manufacturing sector.


      China has state ownership of telecommunications, infrastructure, education, energy,
      land, and finance — most importantly, the financial system in China is state-owned.


      China has five-year plans, in which they target certain industries that they want
      to develop.


      China creates plans for sectors like electric vehicles, and they say that the
      government is going to direct resources into these industries through the use
      of subsidies, and infrastructure investment, and job training, and education,
      and cheap loans from state-owned banks. And they’re going to develop semiconductors;
      they’re going to develop local civilian airliners.


      So can you can you contrast China’s industrial policy with the Trump administration’s
      lack of an industrial policy?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you could say, could I compare China’s development to the
      policies of the United States and also Germany when it was developing?


      China has sort of reinvented the wheel. One of the first books of mine that they
      translated as a textbook into Chinese was my book on trade, development, and foreign
      debt, when I described the contrast between free trade and protectionism, and
      how the United States developed a protectionist argument to counter the free-trade
      arguments of England, in order to protect industry.


      So, China has essentially done the same logical thing that any government would
      have to do. You have to subsidize your own industry and protect it, insulate it,
      from lower-cost imports underselling you.


      You have to enable industry, if not really to make a profit, to at least make
      enough money to somehow be able to pay its labor force, and to pay for the raw
      materials and the machinery that it takes to create industrial production.


      The one thing that China has done that other countries did not do — although Germany
      began to do it in the 19th century — was to keep money and credit as a public
      utility.


      China did this because it really didn’t have much of a choice, after Mao’s revolution.
      How is the government going to finance capital investment in industry in what
      was a very poor country of peasants, basically, as the US secretary of commerce
      keeps calling China, a country of peasants.


      BEN NORTON: US Vice President JD Vance referred to the Chinese as a bunch of peasants.
      And this has really angered people in China.


      JD VANCE clip: We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese
      peasants manufacture. That is not a recipe for economic prosperity.


      BEN NORTON: And this has really united people in China against the US.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Of course. Well, at any rate, since Mao’s revolution had got rid
      of the wealthy financial classes, there was no way that the government could do
      what the Western countries did and borrow from the wealthy classes to pay for
      the government deficit in financing industry. So China created its own money.


      Well, that’s exactly what the American colonies did in the 17th and 18th centuries.
      When Britain was dominating the colonies, and forcing the colonies to export crops
      and other materials, by borrowing hard money from British merchants, the colonies
      began to create their own paper money.


      That’s how they basically developed.


      When America fought the Revolutionary War, the government issued Continentals
      — fiat currency called Continental currency.


      In the Civil War, in America, the costs of the war were so large that it couldn’t
      possibly borrow from domestic creditors, the government printed Greenbacks. But
      in peacetime, the financial sector fought back and insisted on “sound money”,
      meaning money that you pay interest on to private financiers.


      Well, since China didn’t have private financiers, it did the same thing that America
      had done: it printed the money itself.


      And it kept banking in the public domain. And what that means is that banking
      in China does not make loans for the same kind of things that American banks make
      loans.


      We know that they went overboard in making fairly reckless real-estate loans,
      but they don’t make loans for corporate takeovers, of private investors to borrow
      the money to take over another industrial corporation and just sort of empty it
      out and do what American corporate raiders and kleptocrats do.


      So China has been able to create money to spend into the economy for purposes
      intended to serve the public interest, to build housing, to finance high-speed
      railways, to finance all of the public infrastructure that China has kept in the
      public domain, to offer at low, subsidized prices to the population at large.


      So if you have a private enterprise in China, creating a factory to produce goods
      for exports to the United States or other countries, they don’t have to pay the
      workers enough to have to pay for privatized transportation; they have wonderful
      public transportation, in the subways and railroads.


      They they don’t have to take out student loans to get an education; they can get
      the education from the public sector in China. They can get health care.


      They don’t have to pay for all of the things that the United States’ employees
      and employers have to pay for. That’s what enables China to have low-cost labor.


      It’s not that it’s impoverished labor; it’s not that it’s pauper labor; because
      the labor in China is better and better remunerated; but its remuneration is not
      only in the form of its paychecks that it gets in salary; it’s in the form of
      all of the public services that it gets, that Americans have to pay out of their
      salary.


      So when you realize that the standard of living of workers is not only the paycheck,
      but the public services they get, or the subsidized prices they have to pay for
      basic needs, then you find that, if basic needs are treated as basic needs, then
      everybody should be able to get them, as a precondition for being citizens.


      That’s basically what happens in China. And that’s what has enabled China to undersell
      Western economies that have privatized, and Thatcher-ized, and Reagan-ized their
      economies.


      And, of course, that’s how the United States, and Germany, and other countries
      that industrialized in the late 19th century built up their competitive power
      internationally.


      BEN NORTON: Those are very important points, Michael.


      Trump has been expanding his tariffs not only against other countries — he now
      has blanket 10% tariffs on all countries around the world — but he has specifically
      targeted China with now tariffs of 245% — which, after a certain point, there’s
      not really any meaning to further increasing these tariffs; it’s largely symbolic.


      Why do you think Trump has been so aggressive targeting China specifically?


      Do you think it has to do with what you were just explaining, the significant
      differences between China’s system and the US system? That might explain why the
      US has deindustrialized, and simply can’t compete with China’s very sophisticated
      system of manufacturing.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you’re right that America can’t compete. It realizes that
      it can’t compete. It’s treating China as an enemy.


      But, regarding the the tariff question, the way in which Trump has arranged his
      three-month interim, before the very high punitive, disruptive tariffs are imposed,
      is specifically aimed against China.


      Let me explain what the connection is, because it’s not clear on the surface.


      The tariffs that he has announced are so disruptive of trade for other countries
      that they’re going to suffer — as will the US economy, and US consumers and businesses
      are going to suffer.


      Trump says that these maximum demands are open to negotiation. And he’s asking
      other countries, well, if we don’t disrupt your trade by imposing these 40% or
      even higher tariffs on you, what are you going to give us in return? What’s your
      give-back to us for us not making these demands on you?


      At first, I thought, well, he’s going to demand that maybe they’ll have to sell
      off some public infrastructure to Americans. Maybe they’re going to have to give
      trade favoritism to Americans. There are all sorts of things.


      But Trump has made it clear: what Trump wants is diplomatic givebacks. Every country
      is going to be subject to one-on-one, distinct pressures. 75 countries, he says,
      have called him and want to negotiate.


      DONALD TRUMP clip: I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing
      my ass. They are dying to make a deal. Please, please, sir, make a deal. I’ll
      do anything. I’ll do anything, sir!


      MICHAEL HUDSON: With each country, he’s going to treat individually, that they
      give America something. But the common denominator in all of his demands is that
      they impose trade sanctions against commerce with China, and against mutual investment
      with China, and especially any plans they may have to join its Belt and Road Initiative
      in favor of US plans to interrupt the whole connection system of Belt and Road
      that China wants to put in place.


      So Chinese officials can see where all this is leading. They’ve announced their
      refusal to negotiate with the United States, when a gun is pointed to their head.


      China recognizes that Trump really doesn’t have many cards in his hands. What
      does he really offer other countries except to refrain from disrupting their economy?


      He’s what back in Mao’s time was called a paper tiger, militarily. Well, America
      has become a paper tiger financially today. It doesn’t really have anything to
      offer except the threat of tariffs, the threat of suddenly disrupting all of the
      trade patterns that have been put in place over the last few decades.


      So the most important consideration for China in all of this, in what is it going
      to do, is that it doesn’t need the US market to anywhere near the degree that
      the United States is dependent on China for key metals, and key materials, and
      key industrial products.


      Most in the news are the rare earths, ores that are refined to make magnets and
      other alloys that are used in almost every high-tech manufacture today, from electric
      cars to military, and space things; but also steel and aluminum are faced with
      enormous tariffs, as well as key products that American industry needs; and of
      course all of the consumer goods that Walmart imports into the United States and
      that Apple imports for use in its iPhones.


      So, what is really the threat of these tariffs against China? It has already said,
      well, we don’t need to buy soybeans from America; we can buy soybeans from Brazil,
      instead of US farmers. And most US farmers of soybeans live in Republican districts,
      because the Republican Party appeals to the western, midwestern, rural population
      much more than the educated urban population.


      I’m told that one of the key US products that the United States has sort of cut
      China off from is soy sauce. And, all these years, my Chinese friends tell me,
      they’ve been buying soy sauce from a Singapore company with a Chinese name that
      they thought was Chinese. Probably just organized out of Singapore, but it turns
      out that it’s an American company, and now they can’t get it.


      So, what’s going to happen? Well, it’s not that hard to make soy beans into soy
      sauce. And you can imagine that what is going to happen is that China is going
      to respond to the US sanctions in the way that any country responds to sanctions:
      once they can’t import something that they’ve been importing from another country,
      that they need, they produce it themselves.


      That’s exactly what Russia did, when the United States told Europe, stop exporting
      food to Russia; let’s starve them out. Russia stopped its dairy and farm imports
      from the Baltics and other countries, and developed its own agricultural, production.
      That’s called import [substitution].


      So the reaction to sanctions is to force other countries to replace US imports
      with domestic production. And that’s exactly what China has done.


      Well, why do the United States strategists have this blind spot? And the reason
      is, I think, the whole mentality of US diplomats is punitive. That’s the only
      thing they have today. They have little to offer the other country.


      They can’t do what President Xi does and say, here’s a win-win situation; we’ll
      develop our trade with each other, and we’ll both gain from this, from our mutual
      interdependency that’ll create an efficient, regional trading system.


      But the United States doesn’t have that. All it can do is disrupt the trading
      system. And they can disrupt it for a few months; maybe it’ll take a year. It
      takes time to replace new means of production, to replace trade, imports and exports,
      with the United States.


      But you can imagine that European countries, Asian, African countries, Latin American
      countries, are all spending these next three months thinking, how are we going
      to create a world after August, that is going to enable us to keep on producing
      what we’re producing and importing what we’re importing, but not from the United
      States.


      They’re all trying to think of realignment. And the United States says, well,
      this is going to disrupt your economy for a year or so; and the other countries
      will make a calculation and they’ll say, yes, it’s going to disrupt our economy
      for a year or so, but then for the next decade or century, we won’t have to deal
      with US threats anymore.


      The United States is the only country in the world that has weaponized its foreign
      trade; weaponized its foreign currency, the dollar; weaponized the international
      financial system; and treated every economic relationship in an adversarial way,
      to weaponize it.


      Other countries say, how can we have a different approach, and treat trade as
      how can we mutually gain? How can we treat investment as something where the investor
      gains, but we also gain?


      If China is going to build up ports and infrastructure for us, and we will pay
      China in the form of raw materials, or agricultural production, or whatever we’re
      producing; then we get the capital investment that China is providing, and we’re
      providing them with the trade that they’ve helped develop by putting in place
      ports, and roads, and railroads, and other means of transportation.


      So you have two different views of what an alternative world trade system would
      look like. And of course, this alternative is what everybody expected to be created
      after World War One.


      That was the promise of mutual gain that mutual trade was going to integrate countries,
      and provide gains from trade, for peaceful, friendly international relations.


      It hasn’t turned out that way. But now other countries are saying, well, we can
      achieve that kind of trade under rules very similar to those that the United Nations
      created in 1945. But we can’t do it under the rules that the United States imposes
      for its own one-sided, unipolar world order that it’s insisting on.


      So what’s happening is that other countries are putting in place their mutual
      production facilities, transportation facilities, investment facilities. Trump
      is isolating the United States from trade and investment relations.


      It has tried to isolate China, but what it’s doing is isolating itself from everyone,
      except its satellites, in Western Europe — Germany, England, and the other European
      countries.


      The question is, how long can its Asian satellites — South Korea, Japan, and the
      Philippines, even Taiwan — how long can they decide, well, are we going to look
      at our long-term future as trade with China, which is growing and expanding its
      market, or with United States, whose market is shrinking?


      And it goes even further than that. Trump also has said he’s going to punish other
      countries that try to find an alternative to the dollar. And yet today’s Wall
      Street Journal [on April 18] had a whole editorial: Trump is now trying to prevent
      other countries from keeping their international reserves in dollars.


      He’s forcing other countries to sell off their dollars by imposing a tax on other
      countries’ holding of Treasury securities.


      If you’re a foreign central bank and you’ve done what you’ve done since 1971,
      when Nixon went off gold, and you kept your foreign exchange reserves in the form
      of US dollars, in the form of US Treasury securities, or government agency securities,
      or other US holdings, then all of a sudden you’re going to have to pay a tax on
      them, and this tax is going to mean that you’re losing money.


      Well, the dollar has been going down steadily, day after day after day, for the
      last few weeks. And it looks like it’s going down because other countries are
      looking at what Trump is threatening, and they think, this guy may really mean
      it!


      The whole essence of American imperialism — as my book Super Imperialism explained
      way back in 1972 — the whole essence is that America gets a free lunch; it can
      print its dollars, flood the economy with dollars, mainly through its foreign
      military spending — which is, in most years, the leading element in the balance
      of payments deficit — flood this and other countries haven’t had an alternative
      to the dollar to hold.


      They’ve been discouraged from buying gold. Well, as you can imagine, China has
      been buying gold. Now other countries are buying gold. Germany has asked for the
      gold that it had been keeping in the Federal Reserve for safekeeping after World
      War Two, that this is returned. None of my German financial reporters have been
      able to find out whether it’s actually got any of this gold. The politicians are
      quite mum on that.


      So, other countries are essentially being driven out of the dollar, at the same
      time that Trump says, don’t join together and create a non-dollar area.


      Well, if they can’t hold US dollars, or they’re told, if you recycle your savings
      and your surplus dollars into US treasury bills, you’re going to have to lose
      money year after year.


      Well, as they sell the Treasury securities, the dollar is going down. And as the
      dollar goes down, that means that, even if other countries get a higher return
      in stocks or US bonds, the value in euros, and Chinese currency, and Japanese
      currency, the value in their own currency is going down as a result of Trump’s
      policies.


      Well, Trump believes that if you lower the exchange rate of the dollar, that will
      make American exports more competitive. And of course, it would, if America had
      something to export.


      But how can you make industrial exports more competitive, at a lower price — which
      lowers the cost of labor, lowers the cost of America — if you don’t have factories
      to produce these exports? That’s the crazy thing about all this!


      How can you increase export competitiveness of industry, if you don’t have an
      industry?


      The United States, ever since, really, Clinton in the 1990s, has offshored American
      industry — to Asia, to China and other countries — how on Earth can it be competitive?


      Basically neoliberalism has undercut the ability of the United States to be competitive
      in the way that, it and European countries, and now China, had become competitive
      as a mixed economy.


      The essence of neoliberalism is to carve up and privatize governments, basically
      on credit, borrowing the money to buy things.


      So you’re having an inherent instability. And this is what other countries are
      discussing.


      Now, the question is, will other countries agree to give up the Chinese market
      in order to gain the American market?


      Well, how long is the American market going to last? And how much trade and diplomacy
      with China are they going to give up? Will it be a total set of sanctions and
      isolation? Will it be partial? All of this is a product of bilateral negotiation.


      I think other countries should take a look at what’s happening domestically, in
      the way that Trump bargains.


      You’ve seen two big fights, domestically, of Trump in the American economy, have
      occurred in the last few months: the fight against law firms and the fight against
      universities.


      Trump declared war on law firms that had worked for the Democratic Party in the
      last few decades, especially law firms that supplied lawyers who prosecuted him
      for all of the Democratic lawfare that the Biden administration began.


      And he said, well, you have to do a give-back. And the first give-backs that he
      asked from these firms is, you have to provide $50 million of pro bono — meaning
      work without payment – for Republican-backed organizations.


      Well, almost all the law firms capitulated. They surrendered and they agreed to
      give him, you know, $50 million, or however much free legal advice he wanted,
      at their expense.


      Well, now, in the last few days, he has asked for what the New York Times and
      Wall Street Journal say is $1 billion from the law firms, saying you’re going
      to have to not only support the Republican administration, but you’re now going
      to have to support me, and support Republican policies, as we bring lawsuits against
      the government, to try to carve it up, and shrink it, for the kind of things that
      Elon Musk is doing.


      So, he keeps raising the price. He’ll make an agreement. They think, ok, we gave
      him $50 million. That’s enough. Trump had said, if you don’t do this, I’m going
      to cancel your security clearance for all of your lawyers, and I’m going to ban
      your lawyers from federal buildings, because you’re a “security risk”. And I can
      declare a national emergency, and a national emergency is anything I find a national
      emergency in. Any threat to me is a national emergency, because I’m the state.
      Sounds like King Louis of France.


      He asks for more and more and more. It’s a never-ending rise in demand. So, again,
      here’s the problem that they face.


      Once you begin to give in to Trump, a bully thinks, oh, I’ve been able to do this;
      now I can do even more. If you begin giving into him, it’s a never ending path
      of decline. That’s the whole problem.


      China describes the choice as between the post-war, the whole world’s post-1945
      commitment to free trade and the same rules for all countries; or henceforth,
      are they going to be subjected to America’s neo-mercantilist protectionism, as
      the new context for international trade?


      BEN NORTON: Michael, as always, you made so many great points there. It’s hard
      to know where exactly to respond.


      But let’s pick at this idea, which I think is very important, which is that China
      has said that the US is essentially trying to recreate the global system that
      the US ironically helped to create in the first place, after World War Two.


      You described that system very well in your book Super Imperialism, published
      in 1972. The US designed the international financial system, giving itself the
      exorbitant privilege of printing the global reserve currency.


      The US also helped to design the international legal institutions and political
      institutions through the United Nations. And still at the UN Security Council,
      the permanent seats are held, yes, by China and Russia, but also by the US, France,
      and the UK. And the US has used its veto power to essentially neuter the UN, to
      prevent the UN from taking any action the US doesn’t approve of.


      So the US has really benefited from the system. But it seems like Trump is now
      just throwing a bomb and blowing everything up. What do you think is happening?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: The world has changed a lot since 1945, when the US not only led
      the creation of the United Nations, but also the International Monetary Fund and
      the world Bank.


      It created a system of free trade because, under free trade, the dominant economic
      and industrial power wins over countries that haven’t industrialized.


      That’s why countries that haven’t industrialized need protective tariffs, to develop
      their industry, and especially their agriculture — which is how the United States
      subsidized all of its agricultural productivity in the 1930s.


      So, the United States, in 1945, could say, all countries have to follow the same
      rules, because it knew that the rules that they were to follow — with free trade,
      and no imperial preference for the British pound sterling, no colonialism, you
      decolonize — the US knew that it would gain.


      But, since 1945, we’ve now gone eight decades since then, and since the United
      States has deindustrialized, it no longer benefits from the rules and the whole
      philosophy that it supported back in 1945.


      Under the United Nations, at that time, it said all countries should be treated
      politically as equals. That has been the whole rule of international law since
      1648, when the 30 Years War was ended: no country should interfere with other
      countries.


      Well, the United States no longer treats that. It is able to interfere with other
      countries, but essentially claims that any other country that gets a benefit from
      the United States is somehow interfering with its trade, or posing a national
      security threat.


      So the United States has ended the kind of idealistic rhetoric, and the underlying
      world order that it put in place in 1945.


      So, China, Russia, the speeches of Foreign Minister Lavrov and President Putin,
      they’re all saying the same thing: the ideals of the United Nations as they were
      set out; the ideals of trade, not to weaponize trade, but to have mutual gain;
      the ideal of the role of government to provide basic needs for the population;
      all of this was a good idea.


      But the spread of neoliberalism by the United States and by Europe, essentially,
      is now opposing everything that was promised in 1945. We’re in a completely different
      world.


      We cannot achieve and restore this world as long as we leave the United States
      with veto power in the United Nations, to stop it; and with a military power and
      willingness to intervene in foreign elections; to support regime change, to make
      sure that its own politicians are elected, over and above whatever the population
      may want.


      Such as Europe — most of Europe’s population wants an end to the war in Ukraine.
      The politicians want to escalate NATO’s war against Russia.


      You can go right down the line, that what the politicians that are supported by
      the United States in many countries advocate is the opposite of what voters want.


      Just like in the United States. Trump won the election saying he’s going to bring
      peace in NATO’s war against Russia; he’s going to be a peace candidate, not the
      war candidate that Biden and Harris were. Now all of that is just sort of, well,
      that’s campaign promises; that’s just rhetoric; that’s the narrative that we’ve
      created.


      So, you’re having, in a way, two different narratives to shape how people think
      of the split in the world, between the 15% of the population — the US and Europe,
      plus America’s satellites in Asia — and the 85% — the Global Majority, in the
      Global South — that are trying to have mutual trade and benefit.


      In order to have this mutual trade and benefit, you have to have a political system
      and a tax system, that essentially prevents the emergence of a domestic financial
      oligarchy, and monopoly oligarchy, and real estate oligarchy, from stifling economic
      growth in their countries.


      And the United States wants to create such an oligarchy as long as it’s controlled
      by US investors themselves.


      So how do you explain why politicians follow this pro-US submission that they’re
      doing?


      Well, I think there are a number of answers for why you’re having a different
      approach to how the world is being restructured.


      Politicians live in the short run, and many are so used to being bullied that
      they’ve succumbed to the Stockholm Syndrome and identify with the bully. They
      think, well, the Americans are so powerful; there’s really nothing that we can
      do; we have to join them because the bully strong enough to fight any other policy
      that we may do.


      Well, democracy is supposed to prevent the kind of oligarchy from developing that
      you have in the United States.


      They’re supposed to prevent a Gilded Age. They’re supposed to prevent the economic
      polarization between the 1% of the economy — the creditor class, the billionaire
      class of creditors, monopolists, real estate owners — and the rest of the economy
      — of debtors, of renters, of wage earners that have less and less control over
      their working conditions.


      That’s not being prevented; that’s being encouraged by neoliberalism — just the
      opposite of what was promised.


      It’s as if we’re having a new kind of colonialism; but it’s not overtly a military
      colonialism, except in countries that refuse to follow US laws. It’s sort of what
      free-trade imperialism, or what the [US] Treasury bill standard was.


      It’s what the West calls “democracies”, which is foreign control by the neoliberal
      class, the kind of people who go to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland and
      think that they’re planning the kind of world that they would like to see.


      We’re dealing with two kinds of economic theory.


      The reality-based economic theory recognizes that debts tend to grow exponentially,
      and polarize society, and create a crisis, if they’re not canceled.


      The orthodox economic theory, that’s taught in all the universities throughout
      the West, says if you just get rid of government, leave government alone, don’t
      regulate anything, the economy will automatically self stabilize, and produce
      equality among people, and among nations; free trade will make nations more equal,
      instead of polarized.


      You have a whole different body of economic theory to justify a whole means of
      social and economic organization that occurs.


      In other countries, the fight by Asia and the Global Majority today — and by Putin
      against the legacy of kleptocrats that the neoliberals subsidized in Russia —
      was how do you keep this wealthy class — you can let it accumulate wealth, but
      it has to use its wealth in the public interest, to develop the overall economy
      and benefit the economy, not to subject the economy to lower wages, to use its
      wealth to take over government and disable the government from the ability to
      regulate it.


      Well, this disabling of government to regulate is the political program of Donald
      Trump. He says he wants to deregulate any kind of government regulations, and
      tax. He wants to get rid of progressive taxation.


      He wants to stop any environmental regulation. He has pulled out of all of the
      global warming agreements that America has had.


      Trump and Vance have gone to Europe and backed the right-wing parties that are
      following this there.


      The US is backing this kind of economic and social philosophy. For any country
      that is trying to do regulation, it’s being attacked politically.


      This has gone on for 2500 years. The lead for democracy in Greece occurred already
      in the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries BC, when the local mafia-like oligarchies were
      overthrown by populist leaders who were called “tyrants”.


      The Roman oligarchy accused reformers of seeking kingship. The Greek oligarchy
      called any reformers wanting democracy as being tyrants. And the Americans call
      any reformers as being socialists — as if socialist today is the same term as
      seeking kingship to control ambition, being tyrants.


      The narrative of history has been turned inside out. And they treat all of these
      as bad words, not as the ideal that it was during the whole reform movement, in
      the 19th century.


      BEN NORTON: Well, I don’t know if I can add much there. You again raised so many
      interesting points. And you did a great job of drawing these parallels over thousands
      of years of history, in the fight against oligarchy.


      We see this so clearly today. Of course, every US president represents the financial
      oligarchs on Wall Street. But Trump has taken the mask off, lifted the veil, and
      made it as clear as day.


      He’s regularly inviting these billionaires to the white House. He gave Elon Musk,
      the world’s richest billionaire, an office at the white House. He invited all
      these oligarchs to his inauguration.


      So I think your argument is — you’ve been saying this for a long time, and you’ve
      been proven so correct. Trump is really the epitome of everything you’ve been
      saying for so long.


      So on that note, I think that’s actually a really good place to conclude. Is there
      anything else you want to add?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Listening to what you just summarized, what kind of country would
      elect a leader who made this money by cheating other people? By cheating his suppliers
      and not paying them, offering only half the money that they had promised; cheating
      his suppliers; going bankrupt and defaulting on his bank loans; and being not
      only a congenital liar, but treating that as a social virtue!


      You wonder, when somebody like that is elected, or someone like Obama, or Biden,
      when you look at the people who have been elected in the United States, or even
      in Britain, how could this have ever happened, under what was expected 80 years
      ago?


      The world is being turned inside out. And how is the rest of the world going to
      try to undo the damage?


      And they can’t really undo the damage. All they can do is isolate, is go along
      with Trump — accept the isolation. Isolating themselves is the only way that they
      can create an alternative to surrender to the US neoliberal, polarized economy
      and society.


      BEN NORTON: Once again, well said. I was speaking with the economist Michael Hudson,
      and I will link to his most recent report on Donald Trump’s tariffs, and the robber
      barons, and the Gilded Age.


      Thanks so much for joining me, Michael. It’s always a real pleasure speaking with
      you.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Thanks for having me again, Ben.'
    one_sentence_summary: Economist Michael Hudson argues that Donald Trump's tariffs
      are a form of class warfare benefiting the wealthy elite while harming the majority,
      and that this trade war is isolating the U.S. and pushing other countries to seek
      alternative economic partnerships.
    paragraph_summary: In an interview with economist Michael Hudson, he argues that
      Donald Trump's tariffs are primarily benefiting wealthy elites while burdening
      the working class, framing the trade war with China as a form of class warfare.
      Hudson explains that Trump's approach to tariffs is an attempt to reshape the
      global financial landscape to favor the U.S., but it is backfiring by isolating
      the country and accelerating the shift towards a multipolar world. He critiques
      Trump's misunderstanding of historical tariff policies, suggesting that they were
      part of a broader industrial strategy that included public investment and social
      programs, which Trump is now dismantling. Hudson contrasts this with China's state-led
      industrial policy, which effectively supports its economy through public ownership
      and investment in infrastructure, allowing it to compete successfully against
      the U.S. Hudson warns that Trump's aggressive tariffs, particularly against China,
      are not only economically disruptive but also reflect a misguided view of the
      past that ignores the lessons learned from the Gilded Age.

      Summary


      Donald Trump’s tariff policy has thrown markets into turmoil among his allies
      and enemies alike. This anarchy reflects the fact that his major aim was not really
      tariff policy, but simply to cut income taxes on the wealthy, by replacing them
      with tariffs as the main source of government revenue. Extracting economic concessions
      from other countries is part of his justification for this tax shift as offering
      a nationalistic benefit for the United States.


      His cover story, and perhaps even his belief, is that tariffs by themselves can
      revive American industry. But he has no plans to deal with the problems that caused
      America’s deindustrialization in the first place. There is no recognition of what
      made the original U.S. industrial program and that of most other nations so successful.


      That program was based on public infrastructure, rising private industrial investment
      and wages protected by tariffs, and strong government regulation. Trump’s slash
      and burn policy is the reverse – to downsize government, weaken public regulation
      and sell off public infrastructure to help pay for his income tax cuts on his
      Donor Class.


      This is just the neoliberal program under another guise. Trump misrepresents it
      as supportive of industry, not its antithesis. His move is not an industrial plan
      at all, but a power play to extract economic concessions from other countries
      while slashing income taxes on the wealthy. The immediate result will be wide-spread
      layoffs, business closures and consumer price inflation.


      Introduction


      America’s remarkable industrial takeoff from the end of the Civil War through
      the outbreak of World War I has always embarrassed free-market economists. The
      United States’ success followed precisely the opposite policies from those that
      today’s economic orthodoxy advocates. The contrast is not only that between protectionist
      tariffs and free trade. The United States created a mixed public/private economy
      in which public infrastructure investment was developed as a “fourth factor of
      production,” not to be run as a profit-making business but to provide basic services
      at minimal prices so as to subsidize the private sector’s cost of living and doing
      business.


      The logic underlying these policies was formulated already in the 1820s in Henry
      Clay’s American System of protective tariffs, internal improvements (public investment
      in transportation and other basic infrastructure), and national banking aimed
      at financing industrial development. An American School of Political Economy emerged
      to guide the nation’s industrialization based on the Economy of High Wages doctrine
      to promote labor productivity by raising living standards and public subsidy and
      support programs.


      These are not the policies that today’s Republicans and Democrats advise. If Reaganomics,
      Thatcherism and Chicago’s free-market boys had guided American economic policy
      in the late nineteenth century, the United States would not have achieved its
      industrial dominance. So it hardly is surprising that the protectionist and public
      investment logic that guided American industrialization has been airbrushed out
      of U.S. history. It plays no role in Donald Trump’s false narrative to promote
      his abolition of progressive income taxes, downsizing of government and privatization
      sell-off of its assets.


      “What Trump singles out to admire in America’s nineteenth-century industrial policy
      is the absence of a progressive income tax and the funding of government primarily
      by tariff revenue.”


      What Trump singles out to admire in America’s nineteenth-century industrial policy
      is the absence of a progressive income tax and the funding of government primarily
      by tariff revenue. This has given him the idea of replacing progressive income
      taxation falling on his own Donor Class – the One Percent that paid no income
      tax prior to its enactment in 1913 – with tariffs designed to fall only on consumers
      (that is, labor). A new Gilded Age indeed!


      In admiring the absence of progressive income taxation in the era of his hero,
      William McKinley (elected president in 1896 and 1900), Trump is admiring the economic
      excess and inequality of the Gilded Age. That inequality was widely criticized
      as a distortion of economic efficiency and social progress. To counteract the
      corrosive and conspicuous wealth-seeking that caused the distortion, Congress
      passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Law in 1890, Teddy Roosevelt followed with his trust
      busting, and a remarkably progressive income tax was passed that fell almost entirely
      on rentier financial and real estate income and monopoly rents.


      Trump thus is promoting a simplistic and outright false narrative of what made
      America’s nineteenth century policy of industrialization so successful. For him,
      what is great is the “gilded” part of the Gilded Age, not its state-led industrial
      and social-democratic takeoff. His panacea is for tariffs to replace income taxes,
      along with privatizing what remains of the government’s functions. That would
      give a new set of robber barons free reign to further enrich themselves by shrinking
      the government’s taxation and regulation of them, while reducing the budget deficit
      by selling off the remaining public domain, from national park lands to the post
      office and research labs.


      Key policies that led to America’s successful industrial takeoff


      Tariffs by themselves were not enough to create America’s industrial takeoff,
      nor that of Germany and other nations seeking to replace and overtake Britain’s
      industrial and financial monopoly. The key was to use the tariff revenues to subsidize
      public investment, combined with regulatory power and above all tax policy, to
      restructure the economy on many fronts and shape the way in which labor and capital
      were organized.


      The main aim was to raise labor productivity. That required an increasingly skilled
      labor force, which required rising living standards, education, healthy working
      conditions, consumer protection and safe food regulation. The Economy of High
      Wages doctrine recognized that well educated, healthy and well fed labor could
      under-sell “pauper labor.”


      The problem was that employers always have sought to increase their profits by
      fighting against labor’s demand for higher wages. America’s industrial takeoff
      solved this problem by recognizing that labor’s living standards are a result
      not only of wage levels but of the cost of living. To the extent that public investment
      financed by tariff revenues could pay the cost of supplying basic needs, living
      standards and labor productivity could rise without industrialists suffering a
      fall in profit.


      The main basic needs were free education, public health support and kindred social
      services. Public infrastructure investment in transportation (canals and railroads),
      communications and other basic services that were natural monopolies was also
      undertaken to prevent them from being turned into private fiefdoms seeking monopoly
      rents at the expense of the economy at large. Simon Patten, America’s first professor
      of economics at its first business school (the Wharton School at the University
      of Pennsylvania), called public investment in infrastructure a “fourth factor
      of production.”* Unlike private-sector capital, its aim was not to make a profit,
      much less maximize its prices to what the market would bear. The aim was to provide
      public services either at cost or at a subsidized rate or even freely.


      In contrast to European tradition, the United States left many basic utilities
      in private hands, but regulated them to prevent monopoly rents from being extracted.
      Business leaders supported this mixed public/private economy, seeing that it was
      subsidizing a low-cost economy and thus increasing its (and their) competitive
      advantage in the international economy.


      The most important public utility, but also the most difficult to introduce, was
      the monetary and financial system needed to provide enough credit to finance the
      nation’s industrial growth. Creating private and/or public paper credit required
      replacing the narrow reliance on gold bullion for money. Bullion long remained
      the basis for paying customs duties to the Treasury, which drained it from the
      economy at large, limiting its availability for financing industry. Industrialists
      advocated moving away from over-reliance on bullion by the creation of a national
      banking system to provide a growing superstructure of paper credit to finance
      industrial growth.**


      Classical political economy saw tax policy as the most important lever steering
      the allocation of resources and credit towards industry. Its main policy aim was
      to minimize economic rent (the excess of market prices over intrinsic cost value)
      by freeing markets from rentier income in the form of land rent, monopoly rent,
      and interest and financial fees. From Adam Smith through David Ricardo, John Stuart
      Mill, to Marx and other socialists, classical value theory defined such economic
      rent as unearned income, extracted without contributing to production and hence
      an unnecessary levy on the economy’s cost and price structure. Taxes on industrial
      profits and labor’s wages added to the cost of production and thus were to be
      avoided, while land rent, monopoly rent and financial gains should be taxed away,
      or land, monopolies and credit could simply be nationalized into the public domain
      to lower access costs for real estate and monopoly services and reduce financial
      charges.


      “From Adam Smith through David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, to Marx and other socialists,
      classical value theory defined such economic rent as unearned income, extracted
      without contributing to production and hence an unnecessary levy on the economy’s
      cost and price structure.”


      These policies based on the classical distinction between intrinsic cost-value
      and market price are what made industrial capitalism so revolutionary. Freeing
      economies from rentier income by the taxation of economic rent aimed at minimizing
      the cost of living and doing business, and also minimizing the political dominance
      of a financial and landlord power elite. When the United States imposed its initial
      progressive income tax in 1913, only 2 percent of Americans had a high enough
      income to require them to file a tax return. The vast majority of the 1913 tax
      fell on the rentier income of financial and real estate interests, and on the
      monopoly rents extracted by the trusts that the banking system organized.


      How America’s neoliberal policy reverses its former industrial dynamic


      Since the takeoff of the neoliberal period in the 1980s, U.S. labor’s disposable
      income has been squeezed by high costs for basic needs at the same time as its
      cost of living has priced it out of world markets. This is not the same thing
      as a high-wage economy. It is a rakeoff of wages to pay the various forms of economic
      rent that have proliferated and destroyed America’s formerly competitive cost
      structure. Today’s $331,000 economic output per family of four is not being spent
      mainly on products or services that wage-earners produce. It is mostly siphoned
      off by the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE) sector and monopolies at
      the top of the economic pyramid.


      The private-sector’s debt overhead is largely responsible for today’s shift of
      wages away from rising living standards for labor, and of corporate profits away
      from new tangible capital investment, research and development for industrial
      companies. Employers have not paid their employees enough to both maintain their
      standard of living and carry this financial, insurance and real estate burden,
      leaving U.S. labor to fall further and further behind.


      Inflated by bank credit and rising debt/income ratios, the U.S. guideline cost
      of housing for home buyers has risen to 43% of their income, far up from the formerly
      standard 25%. The Federal Housing Authority insures mortgages to guarantee that
      banks following this guideline will not lose money, even as arrears and defaults
      are hitting all-time highs. Home ownership rates fell from over 69% in 2005 to
      under 63% in the Obama eviction wave of foreclosures after the 2008 junk-mortgage
      crisis. Rents and house prices have soared steadily (especially during the period
      the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low deliberately to inflate asset prices
      to support the finance sector, and as private capital has bought up homes that
      wage earners cannot afford), making housing by far the largest charge on wage
      income.


      Debt arrears also are exploding for student education debt taken on to qualify
      for a higher-paying job, and in many cases for the auto debt needed to be able
      to drive to the job. This is capped by credit-card debt accumulating just to make
      ends meet. The disaster of privatized medical insurance now absorbs 18 percent
      of U.S. GDP, yet medical debt has become a major cause of personal bankruptcy.
      All this is just the reverse of what was intended by the original Economy of High
      Wages policy for American industry.


      This neoliberal financialization – the proliferation of rentier charges, inflation
      of housing and health-care costs, and the need to live on credit beyond solely
      one’s earnings – has two effects. The most obvious is that most American families
      have not been able to increase their savings since 2008, and are living from paycheck
      to paycheck. The second effect has been that, with employers obliged to pay their
      labor force enough to carry these rentier costs, the living wage for American
      labor has risen so far above that of every other national economy that there is
      no way that American industry can compete with that of foreign countries.


      Privatization and deregulation of the U.S. economy has obliged employers and labor
      to bear the rentier costs, including higher housing prices and rising debt overhead,
      that are part and parcel of today’s neoliberal policies. The resulting loss of
      industrial competitiveness is the major block to its re-industrialization. After
      all, it was these rentier charges that deindustrialized the economy in the first
      place, making it less competitive in world markets and spurring the offshoring
      of industry by raising the cost of basic needs and doing business. Paying such
      charges also shrinks the domestic market, by reducing labor’s ability to buy what
      it produces. Trump’s tariff policy does nothing to address these problems, but
      will aggravate them by accelerating price inflation.


      This situation is unlikely to change any time soon, because the beneficiaries
      of today’s neoliberal policies – the recipients of these rentier charges burdening
      the U.S. economy – have become the political Donor Class of billionaires. To increase
      their rentier income and capital gains and make them irreversible, this resurgent
      oligarchy is pressing to further privatize and sell off the public sector instead
      of providing subsidized services to meet the economy’s basic needs at minimum
      cost. The largest public utilities that have been privatized are natural monopolies
      – which is why they were kept in the public domain in the first place (i.e., to
      avoid monopoly rent extraction).


      The pretense is that private ownership seeking profits will provide an incentive
      to increase efficiency. The reality is that prices for what formerly were public
      services are increased to what the market will bear for transportation, communications
      and other privatized sectors. One eagerly awaits the fate of the U.S. Post Office
      that Congress is trying to privatize.


      Neither increasing production nor lowering its cost is the aim of today’s sell-off
      of government assets. The prospect of owning a privatized monopoly in a position
      to extract monopoly rent has led financial managers to borrow the money to buy
      up these businesses, adding debt payments to their cost structure. The managers
      then start selling off the businesses’ real estate for quick cash that they pay
      out as special dividends, leasing back the property that they need to operate.
      The result is a high-cost monopoly that is heavily indebted with plunging profits.
      That is the neoliberal model from England’s paradigmatic Thames Water privatization
      to private financialized former industrial companies such as General Electric
      and Boeing.


      In contrast to the nineteenth century’s takeoff of industrial capitalism, the
      aim of privatizers in today’s post-industrial epoch of rentier finance capitalism
      is to make “capital” gains on the stocks of hitherto public enterprises that have
      been privatized, financialized and deregulated. A similar financial objective
      has been pursued in the private arena, where the financial sector’s business plan
      has been to replace the drive for corporate profits with making capital gains
      in stocks, bonds and real estate.


      The great majority of stocks and bonds are owned by the wealthiest 10 percent,
      not by the bottom 90 percent. While their financial wealth has soared, the disposable
      personal income of the majority (after paying rentier charges) has shrunk. Under
      today’s rentier finance capitalism the economy is going in two directions at once
      – down for the industrial goods-producing sector, up for the financial and other
      rentier claims on this sector’s labor and capital.


      The mixed public/private economy that formerly built up American industry by minimizing
      the cost of living and doing business has been reversed by what is Trump’s most
      influential constituency (and that of the Democrats as well, to be sure) – the
      wealthiest One Percent, which continues to march its troops under the libertarian
      flag of Thatcherism, Reaganomics and Chicago anti-government (meaning anti-labor)
      ideologues. They accuse the government’s progressive income and wealth taxes,
      investment in public infrastructure and role as regulator to prevent predatory
      economic behavior and polarization, of being intrusions into “free markets.”


      The question, of course, is “free for whom”? What they mean is a market free for
      the wealthy to extract economic rent. They ignore both the need to tax or otherwise
      minimize economic rent to achieve industrial competitiveness, and the fact that
      slashing income taxes on the wealthy – and then insisting on balancing the government
      budget like that of a family household so as to avoid running yet deeper into
      debt – starves the economy of public injection of purchasing power. Without net
      public spending, the economy is obliged to turn for financing to the banks, whose
      interest-bearing loans grow exponentially and crowd out spending on goods and
      real services. This intensifies the wage squeeze described above and the dynamic
      of deindustrialization.


      A fatal effect of all these changes has been that instead of capitalism industrializing
      the banking and financial system as was expected in the nineteenth century, industry
      has been financialized. The finance sector has not allocated its credit to finance
      new means of production, but to take over assets already in place – primarily
      real estate and existing companies. This loads the assets down with debt in the
      process of inflating capital gains as the finance sector lends money to bid up
      prices for them.


      This process of increasing financialized wealth adds to economic overhead not
      only in the form of debt, but in the form of higher purchase prices (inflated
      by bank credit) for real estate and industrial and other companies. And consistently
      with its business plan of making capital gains, the finance sector has sought
      to untax such gains. It also has taken the lead in urging cuts in real estate
      taxes so as to leave more of the rising site value of housing and office buildings
      – their rent-of-location – to be pledged to the banks instead of serving as the
      major tax base for local and national fiscal systems as classical economists urged
      throughout the nineteenth century.


      The result has been a shift from progressive taxation to regressive taxation.
      Rentier income and debt-financed capital gains have been untaxed, and the tax
      burden shifted onto labor and industry. It is this tax shift that has encouraged
      corporate financial managers to replace the drive for corporate profits with making
      capital gains as described above.


      What promised to be a harmony of interests for all classes – to be achieved by
      increasing their wealth by running into debt and watching prices rise for homes
      and other real estate, stocks and bonds – has turned into a class war. It is now
      much more than the class war of industrial capital against labor familiar in the
      nineteenth century. The postmodern form of class war is that of finance capital
      against both labor and industry. Employers still exploit labor by seeking profits
      by paying labor less than what they sell its products for. But labor has been
      increasingly exploited by debt – mortgage debt (with “easier” credit fueling the
      debt-driven inflation of housing costs), student debt, automobile debt and credit-card
      debt just to meet its break-even costs of living.


      Having to pay these debt charges increases the cost of labor to industrial employers,
      constraining their ability to make profits. And (as indicated above) it is such
      exploitation of industry (and indeed of the whole economy) by finance capital
      and other rentiers that has spurred the off-shoring of industry and deindustrialization
      of the United States and other Western economies that have followed the same policy
      path.***


      In stark contrast to Western deindustrialization stands China’s successful industrial
      takeoff. Today, living standards in China are, for much of the population, broadly
      as high as those in the United States. That is a result of the Chinese government’s
      policy of providing public support for industrial employers by subsidizing basic
      needs (e.g., education and medical care) and public high-speed rail, local subway
      and other transportation, better high-technology communications and other consumer
      goods, along with their payments systems.


      Most important, China has kept banking and credit creation in the public domain
      as a public utility. That is the key policy that has enabled it to avoid the financialization
      that has deindustrialized the U.S. and other Western economies.


      “The great irony is that China’s industrial policy is remarkably similar to that
      of America’s nineteenth-century industrial takeoff.”


      The great irony is that China’s industrial policy is remarkably similar to that
      of America’s nineteenth-century industrial takeoff. China’s government, as just
      mentioned, has financed basic infrastructure and kept it in the public domain,
      providing its services at low prices to keep the economy’s cost structure as low
      as possible. And China’s rising wages and living standards have indeed found their
      counterpart in rising labor productivity.


      There are billionaires in China, but they are not viewed as celebrity heroes and
      models for how the economy at large should seek to develop. The accumulation of
      conspicuous large fortunes such as those that have characterized the West and
      created its political Donor Class have been countered by political and moral sanctions
      against the use of personal wealth to gain control of public economic policy.


      This government activism that U.S. rhetoric denounces as Chinese “autocracy” has
      managed to do what Western democracies have not done: prevent the emergence of
      a financialized rentier oligarchy that uses its wealth to buy control of government
      and takes over the economy by privatizing government functions and promoting its
      own gains by indebting the rest of the economy to itself while dismantling public
      regulatory policy.


      What was the Gilded Age that Trump hopes to resurrect?


      Trump and the Republicans have put one political aim above all others: cutting
      taxes, above all progressive taxation that falls mainly on the highest incomes
      and personal wealth. It seems that at some point Trump must have asked some economist
      whether there was any alternative way for governments to finance themselves. Someone
      must have informed him that from American independence through the eve of World
      War I, by far the dominant form of government revenue was customs revenue from
      tariffs.


      It is easy to see the lightbulb that went off in Trump’s brain. Tariffs don’t
      fall on his rentier class of real estate, financial and monopoly billionaires,
      but primarily on labor (and on industry too, for imports of necessary raw materials
      and parts).


      In introducing his enormous and unprecedented tariff rates on April 3, Trump promised
      that tariffs alone, by themselves, would re-industrialize America, by both creating
      a protective barrier and enabling Congress to slash taxes on the wealthiest Americans,
      whom he seems to believe will thereby be incentivized to “rebuild” American industry.
      It is as if giving more wealth to the financial managers who have deindustrialized
      America’s economy will somehow enable a repeat of the industrial takeoff that
      was peaking in the 1890s under William McKinley.


      “It is easy to see the lightbulb that went off in Trump’s brain. Tariffs don’t
      fall on his rentier class of real estate, financial and monopoly billionaires,
      but primarily on labor.”


      What Trump’s narrative leaves out of account is that tariffs were merely the precondition
      for the nurturing of industry by the government in a mixed public/private economy
      where the government shaped markets in ways designed to minimize the cost of living
      and doing business. That public nurturing is what gave nineteenth-century America
      its competitive international advantage. But given his guiding economic aim to
      untax himself and his most influential political constituency, what appeals to
      Trump is simply the fact that the government did not yet have an income tax.


      What also appeals to Trump is the super-affluence of a robber-baron class, in
      whose ranks he can readily imagine himself as if in a historical novel. But that
      self-indulgent class consciousness has a blind spot regarding how its own drives
      for predatory income and wealth destroy the economy around it, while fantasizing
      that the robber barons made their fortunes by being the great organizers and drivers
      of industry. He is unaware that the Gilded Age did not emerge as part of America’s
      industrial strategy for success but because it did not yet regulate monopolies
      and tax rentier income. The great fortunes were made possible by the early failure
      to regulate monopolies and tax economic rent. Gustavus Myers’ History of the Great
      American Fortunes tells the story of how railroad and real estate monopolies were
      carved out at the expense of the economy at large.


      America’s anti-trust legislation was enacted to deal with this problem, and the
      original 1913 income tax applied only to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population.
      It fell (as noted above) mainly on financial and real estate wealth and monopolies
      – financial interest, land rent and monopoly rent – not on labor or most businesses.
      By contrast, Trump’s plan is to replace taxation of the wealthiest rentier classes
      with tariffs paid mainly by American consumers. To share his belief that national
      prosperity can be achieved by tax favoritism for his Donor Class by untaxing their
      rentier income, it is necessary to block aware- ness that such a fiscal policy
      will prevent the re-industrialization of America that he claims to want.


      The U.S. economy cannot re-industrialize without being freed from rentier income


      The most immediate effects of Trump’s tariff policy will be unemployment as a
      result of the trade disruption (over and above the unemployment flowing from his
      DOGE cutbacks in government employment) and an increase in consumer prices for
      a labor force already squeezed by the financial, insurance and real estate charges
      that it has to bear as first claims on its wage income. Arrears on mortgage loans,
      auto loans and credit-card loans already are at historically high levels, and
      more than half of Americans have no net savings at all – and tell pollsters that
      they cannot cope with an emergency need to raise $400.


      There is no way that disposable personal income will rise in these circumstances.
      And there is no way that American production can avoid being interrupted by the
      trade disruption and layoffs that will be caused by the enormous tariff barriers
      that Trump has threatened – at least until the conclusion of his country-by-country
      negotiation to extract economic concessions from other countries in exchange for
      restoring more normal access to the American market. While Trump has announced
      a 90-day pause during which the tariffs will be reduced to 10% for countries that
      have indicated a willingness to so negotiate, he has raised tariffs on Chinese
      imports to 145%.****


      China and other foreign countries and companies already have stopped exporting
      raw materials and parts needed by American industry. For many companies it will
      be too risky to resume trade until the uncertainty surrounding these political
      negotiations are settled. Some countries can be expected to use this interim to
      find alternatives to the U.S. market (including producing for their own populations).


      As for Trump’s hope to persuade foreign companies to relocate their factories
      to the United States, such companies face the risk of him holding a Sword of Damocles
      over their heads as foreign investors. He may in due course simply insist that
      they sell out their American affiliate to domestic U.S. investors, as he has demanded
      that China do with TikTok.


      And the most basic problem, of course, is that the American economy’s rising debt
      overhead, health insurance and housing costs already have priced U.S. labor, and
      the products it makes, out of world markets. Trump’s tariff policy will not solve
      this. Indeed, his tariffs by increasing consumer prices will exacerbate this problem
      by further increasing the cost of living and thus the price of American labor.


      Instead of supporting a regrowth of U.S. industry, the effect of Trump’s tariffs
      and other fiscal policies will be to protect and subsidize obsolescence and financialized
      deindustrialization. Without restructuring the rentier financialized economy to
      move it back toward the original business plan of industrial capitalism with markets
      freed from rentier income, as advocated by the classical economists and their
      distinctions between value and price, and hence between rent and industrial profit,
      his program will fail to re-industrialize America. Indeed, it threatens to push
      the U.S. economy into depression – for 90 percent of the population, that is.


      “Instead of supporting a regrowth of U.S. industry, the effect of Trump’s tariffs
      and other fiscal policies will be to protect and subsidize obsolescence and financialized
      deindustrialization.”


      So we find ourselves dealing with two opposing economic philosophies. On the one
      hand is the original industrial program that the United States and most other
      successful nations followed. It is the classical program based on public infrastructure
      investment and strong government regulation, with rising wages protected by tariffs
      that provided the public revenue and profit opportunities to create factories
      and employ labor.


      Trump has no plans to recreate such an economy. Instead, he advocates the opposing
      economic philosophy: downsizing government, weakening public regulation, privatizating
      public infrastructure, and abolishing progressive income taxes. This is the neoliberal
      program that has increased the cost structure for industry and polarized wealth
      and income between creditors and debtors. Donald Trump misrepresents this program
      as being supportive of industry, not its antithesis.


      Imposing tariffs while continuing the neoliberal program will simply protect senility
      in the form of industrial production burdened by high costs for labor as a result
      of rising domestic housing prices, medical insurance, education, and services
      bought from privatized public utilities that used to provide basic needs for communications,
      transportation and other basic needs at subsidized prices instead of financialized
      monopoly rents. It will be a tarnished gilded age.


      While Trump may be genuine in wanting to re-industrialize America, his more single-minded
      aim is to cut taxes on his Donor Class, imagining that tariff revenues can pay
      for this. But much trade already has stopped. By the time more normal trade resumes
      and tariff revenue is generated from it, widespread layoffs will have occurred,
      leading the affected labor to fall further into debt arrears, with the American
      economy in no better position to re-industrialize.


      The geopolitical dimension


      Trump’s country-by-country negotiations to extract economic concessions from other
      countries in exchange for restoring their access to the American market no doubt
      will lead some countries to succumb to this coercive tactic. Indeed, Trump has
      announced over 75 countries have contacted the U.S. government to negotiate. But
      some Asian and Latin American countries already are seeking an alternative to
      the U.S. weaponization of trade dependency to extort concessions. Countries are
      discussing options to join together to create a mutual trade market with less
      anarchic rules.


      The result of them doing so would be that Trump’s policy will become yet another
      step in America’s Cold War march to isolate itself from trade and investment relations
      with the rest of the world, including potentially with some of its European satellites.
      The United States runs the risk of being thrown back onto what has long been supposed
      its strongest economic advantage: its ability to be self-sufficient in food, raw
      materials, and labor. But it already has deindustrialized itself, and has little
      to offer other countries except for the promise not to hurt them, disrupt their
      trade and impose sanctions on them if they agree to let the United States be the
      major beneficiary of their economic growth.


      The hubris of national leaders trying to extend their empire is age-old – as is
      their nemesis, which usually turns out to be themselves. At his second inauguration,
      Trump promised a new Golden Age. Herodotus (History, Book 1.53) tells the story
      of Croesus, king of Lydia c. 585-546 BC in what is now Western Turkey and the
      Ionian shore of the Mediterranean. Croesus conquered Ephesus, Miletus and neighboring
      Greek-speaking realms, obtaining tribute and booty that made him one of the richest
      rulers of his time, famous for his gold coinage in particular. But these victories
      and wealth led to arrogance and hubris. Croesus turned his eyes eastward, ambitious
      to conquer Persia, ruled by Cyrus the Great.


      Having endowed the region’s cosmopolitan Temple of Delphi with substantial gold
      and silver, Croesus asked its Oracle whether he would be successful in the conquest
      that he had planned. The Pythia priestess answered: “If you go to war against
      Persia, you will destroy a great empire.”


      Croesus optimistically set out to attack Persia c. 547 BC. Marching eastward,
      he attacked Persia’s vassal-state Phrygia. Cyrus mounted a Special Military Operation
      to drive Croesus back, defeating Croesus’s army, capturing him and taking the
      opportunity to seize Lydia’s gold to introduce his own Persian gold coinage. So
      Croesus did indeed destroy a great empire – but it was his own.


      Fast-forward to today. Like Croesus hoping to gain the riches of other countries
      for his gold coinage, Trump hoped that his global trade aggression would enable
      America to extort the wealth of other nations and strengthen the dollar’s role
      as a reserve currency against foreign defensive moves to de-dollarize and create
      alternative plans for conducting international trade and holding foreign reserves.
      But Trump’s aggressive stance has further undermined trust in the dollar abroad,
      and is causing serious interruptions in the supply chain of U.S. industry, halting
      production and causing layoffs at home.


      Investors hoped for a return to normalcy as the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared
      upon Trump’s suspension of his tariffs, only to then fall back when it became
      clear that he was still taxing all countries 10 percent (and China a prohibitive
      145 percent). It is now becoming apparent that his radical disruption of trade
      cannot be reversed.


      The tariffs that Trump announced on April 3, followed by his statement that this
      was simply his maximum demand, to be negotiated on a bilateral country-by-country
      basis to extract economic and political concessions (subject to more changes at
      Trump’s discretion) have replaced the traditional idea of a set of rules consistent
      and binding for all countries. His demand that the United States must be “the
      winner” in any transaction has changed how the rest of the world views its economic
      relations with the United States. An entirely different geopolitical logic is
      now emerging to create a new international economic order.


      China has responded with its own tariffs and export controls as its trade with
      the United States is frozen, potentially paralyzed. It seems unlikely that China
      will remove its export controls on many products essential for U.S. supply chains.
      Other countries are searching for alternatives to their trade dependency on the
      United States, and a reordering of the global economy is now under negotiation,
      including defensive de-dollarization policies. Trump has taken a giant step toward
      the destruction of what was a great empire.

      Transcript


      (Introduction)


      BEN NORTON: The price of gold has been skyrocketing. Since 2018, the price of
      gold has nearly tripled. This has caused a big debate around the world about why
      this is happening. There are, of course, several different factors.


      One of them is that central banks around the world have been buying more and more
      gold, especially with the threat of sanctions from the United States. One-third
      of all countries on Earth are under US sanctions, including 60% of low-income
      countries.


      The war in Ukraine has only accelerated this, as the US and the EU seized $300
      billion dollars and euros worth of assets held by Russia’s central bank. This
      has scared many other countries’ central banks, which fear that they could be
      next to have their assets seized by the West.


      Gold is being seen as an alternative to dollar- or euro-denominated assets.


      But it’s not just central banks. There’s also a lot of private demand, especially
      as there was a lot of inflation coming out of the Covid pandemic.


      What’s interesting is that, typically, gold is seen as an inflation hedge. And
      when inflation increases, the price of gold tends to increase. But in the past
      two years, inflation has come down, yet the price of gold has continued to skyrocket.


      So why is this happening?


      Well, today I had the privilege of being joined by the award-winning economist
      Michael Hudson, and he explained why the price of gold continues to rise, and
      what the implications could be for the entire global economy, and the politics
      of gold — because, as Michael often stresses, you cannot separate economics from
      politics.


      So here are a few highlights of Michael Hudson, and then we’ll go straight to
      the interview.


      (Highlights)


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Demand for gold, as I said, has been far outstripping the supply
      for many, many years now. And as we’re taught in Economics 101 textbooks, when
      demand outstrip supply, prices go up.


      But that hasn’t been happening with the gold price until just the last few months.
      And the question is, why hasn’t it happened?


      …


      Well, the obvious answer is that the gold market isn’t like regular commodity
      markets.


      …


      So the United States has sought to keep gold prices down ever since it was revalued
      in 1971… The aim of this was political: to keep the world viewing the US dollar,
      meaning essentially US Treasury securities, as the most secure form of their international
      reserves.


      It’s secure in the sense that, unlike other countries, the United States can simply
      print the dollars. It can’t go bankrupt.


      …


      People like to say gold is an inflation hedge. But you could say eggs are an inflation
      hedge, or pork is an inflation hedge.


      The point is, the real problem is the US balance of payments deficit pumping dollars
      into the world.


      You’ll pay dollars to an exporter, from China or Germany — when there was still
      a German industry — and they turn the dollars over to their central bank, and
      the central bank would then say, “What are we going to do with these dollars?
      If we don’t send them back to the United States, our currency is going to go up
      against the dollar, and that is going to make our exports less competitive. So
      we have to keep our currency, our exchange rate, down; and we do that by buying
      Treasury securities”.


      It has always been political. And the newspapers don’t want to talk about politics,
      because if they talked about politics, all of a sudden people would realize the
      Western political and economic system cannot last in the way that it’s structured
      now.


      When you talk about politics, you realize the game is over for the West.


      (Full interview)


      BEN NORTON: Hi, Michael. It’s always a real pleasure having you. The last time
      we had a discussion, we analyzed the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs, or his
      threat of tariffs. And you warned that it could cause a global financial crisis,
      as countries won’t be able to get the dollars they need to pay off their dollar-denominated
      debt.


      After we had that conversation, you raised some other points about the gold market
      that you wanted to talk about, and I thought that would be a great separate episode.


      So why do you think we’ve seen this massive shift, the near tripling of the price
      of gold in the past seven years?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, we’ve been talking for many years now about how the international
      financial system works, and central bank reserves, and de-dollarization, and the
      split of the BRICS away from the West.


      And that’s what my book Super Imperialism was about, how America was driven off
      the gold standard because of the balance of payments drain from the Vietnam War
      and for world military spending, up to 1971. The entire U.S. balance of payments
      deficit from the Korean War in 1950, all the way through the ‘50s, the ‘60s, and
      into the ‘70s was military spending.


      The result was that the United States had, every month, to sell the accumulation
      of dollars that ended up in France, Germany, and other countries. The dollars
      spent in Vietnam that were exchanged for local currencies ended up in French banks,
      because Southeast Asia was a part of the French empire; and the French banks sent
      these dollars to Paris, and General [Charles] de Gaulle would then cash in the
      dollars [for gold] every week.


      Until 1971, every printed dollar — your dollar bills in your pocket — had to be
      backed, by law, 25% by gold. So we were watching the American gold supply go down,
      down, down to the gold cover.


      Every week, on Friday morning, when the Federal Reserve gold report would come
      out on Wall Street in the mid ‘60s, we were all saying, “When is the breaking
      point going to come?”


      Well, it came in August 1971. At that time, the US government thought, “This is
      terrible. We have controlled the whole world financial system ever since World
      War One, by holding gold, and that was what other countries used to have their
      monetary reserves. We have controlled other countries’ ability to run budget deficits,
      to fund their own economy with gold; now we don’t have it anymore”. And there
      was a lot of hand-wringing.


      I wrote my book Super Imperialism to say that this is not going to interfere with
      the American empire, because if countries, central banks, governments can’t buy
      gold, they had only one big alternative at that time, and that was to buy dollars.


      And how do they buy dollars? They buy US Treasury bonds, Treasury notes, short-term
      Treasury securities. They put in their money and hold it in the form of US debt.


      As they got more and more dollars, they spent more and more money buying US debt.
      And that became an increasing way of how the United States funded its own budget
      deficits.


      Who bought the bonds to fund these? Increasingly, central banks. So the United
      States found this is what some people called the “exorbitant privilege” of the
      dollar.


      When other countries run a balance of payments deficit, they have to devalue.
      The IMF comes in; they say, “Lower your wages; impose poverty to squeeze out enough
      money to pay the bondholders”. But the United States can keep printing the money.


      So, what can other countries do? They don’t have an alternative.


      Well, you’ve seen increasing pressure to create an alternative for the last decade
      or so. That’s what your and my discussions and your site has been about.


      Other countries want to de-dollarize, and the United States fears, “What is going
      to be the alternative?”


      Well, to some extent, we know they’re buying each other’s currencies. They’re
      buying yuan, rubles; doing trade and investment in each other’s currencies; to
      avoid having to use the dollar, and having to take the risks that Venezuela took,
      Iran, and Russia, of just having the dollars confiscated.


      But still, there is an idea that gold is a kind of asset that the whole world
      has been able to agree on, along with silver, for the last 3000 years, as the
      monetary base.


      How are you going to get countries all over the world, from North America, to
      Europe, to Asia, all to agree on what to hold?


      Well, they’re trying to come up with an agreement now, and they realize that you
      can’t have a BRICS monetary system until you have a whole political integration
      of the BRICS. So that’s not going to be an alternative for right now. So countries
      have been buying gold.


      Well, the private sector is watching all of this. They’re listening to your show,
      and what I’ve been writing about, and they say, “We’re in a situation now, just
      like the world was in the late ‘60s, going into the 1970s, when finally the gold
      price rose beyond the ability of the United States to keep it down to $35 an ounce”.
      So private investors have got into the gold market.


      This is what makes the gold market not simply talk about commodities, how to get
      rich; it talks about how the world economy is being restructured, and its monetary
      relations, and what the politics are.


      But what I’m going to talk about today is what is happening that makes the gold
      market so political and so unique, that something very strange is happening there.


      On Monday, February 10th, the week started with gold rising to over $2,900 an
      ounce. So we’re on the verge of it going up to $3,000 an ounce. That’s a quantum
      leap.


      If you look at the statistics for gold mining throughout the world, the supply
      and demand of gold, demand has been far outstripping the supply now for 20 or
      30 years.


      We’re seeing now an effect very much like a run on the bank. But that run on the
      bank has actually been occurring for a few decades.


      So the question that you have to ask to begin with is, why did it take so long,
      until just this year, for gold to begin to go up in price, after it stagnated
      for a decade?


      We’ve seen, in the last decades, the central banks have devoted a steady rise
      in the proportion of their reserves that they hold in gold, and proportionately
      less of their reserves in the form of U.S. dollars.


      They’re still holding more and more dollars every year, because the United States
      is running such a large balance of payments deficit that it’s pumping dollars
      into the world economy.


      But other countries are not just recycling these dollars. They’re spending more
      and more of the dollars they get on gold, as a kind of safe haven for them: something
      that is solid.


      Gold is an asset that doesn’t have a debt attached to it. If you hold a gold coin,
      or a gold bar, that’s a pure asset — no debt at all.


      But if you hold a Treasury bond; that’s a debt, a debt of the United States. And
      if it’s a debt of the United States, it’s like your bank deposit is a debt of
      the bank to you.


      If the US goes under, like a bank goes under, or if it just refuses to pay, then
      you’re out. And there’s something ephemeral about all of this.


      Well, if you look at the trend of gold prices, it stagnated in a very narrow range
      from about $1200 to $1400 an ounce for a few years, from 2015 to 2019. It was
      all in that range.


      I spent a lot of time in Europe and Asia at that time, and all of the government
      officials I talked to, the financial funds, all said, “You know, we’re buying
      more and more gold, because this system can’t last, politically, the way it is”.
      But the price didn’t go up.


      Then, during the Covid years, from 2020 to early 2023, once again, there was a
      stagnation, a range from $1800 to $2000 an ounce. That’s a pretty narrow range
      — you know, a low range, a little step function to a new range, and then very
      gradually drifting upward, but not anywhere near as fast as the actual demand
      for gold was.


      Well, finally, in the last half-year, we’ve seen the gold price rise all out of
      range to, as I said, nearly $3,000 an ounce.


      So the question is, are we in a new range for gold, or is the price going to go
      higher?


      With so many people buying the rights to hold gold — you’ll buy a gold fund, and
      you’ll pay money into the gold fund, and that has securities in gold; or you’ll
      buy gold and you’ll store it with a bullion dealer, because you don’t want to
      keep it at home, because it could get stolen, or who knows what will happen.


      Well, where is all this gold going to come from, physically, to meet the demand?


      During the last half a century, quarter century, there has been a rising private
      investment boom in gold, because people can look at the trend — more and more,
      excess demand over the supply — and they can see that this is an unstable situation.


      So to understand it, you have to understand how unique the gold markets are. And
      I want to talk about that today, not simply as an exercise, but to show what the
      politics behind the gold market are, and what it means for how the world economy
      is being restructured.


      Suddenly, gold is more than just an investment vehicle. There have always been
      gold bugs who don’t understand, “How is it that the government can just print
      money? We don’t understand. We’re going to just try to buy gold, and there should
      still be the gold standard, like there was in the 19th century”. There are all
      these crazies on the right wing, libertarians, who don’t trust government.


      But now we’re talking about demand not just from the crazies, but from regular
      funds that are looking at the trends, and they realize that there’s a pile-on
      effect that is occurring. Everybody suddenly is moving into gold.


      You’ll find the advertisements all over the internet, when you watch YouTube shows,
      there is very often an advertisement for gold on there. And obviously, more and
      more people are doing it.


      So the question is, is all this just a bubble, or are we moving towards a new
      and even higher long term plateau? Is there a change occurring in the world’s
      financial and monetary system? Politically?


      Well, I’m going to explain what is happening.


      Demand for gold, as I said, has been far outstripping the supply for many, many
      years now. And as we’re taught in Economics 101 textbooks, when demand outstrip
      supply, prices go up.


      But that hasn’t been happening with the gold price until just the last few months.
      And the question is, why hasn’t it happened? And why have the gold prices suddenly
      begun to escape from their former narrow range and risen so fast, since last autumn?


      Well, the obvious answer is that the gold market isn’t like regular commodity
      markets. And even regular commodity markets don’t operate in the simple way that
      popular media and textbooks say.


      One reason for that is that, for the last century, the price of gold has been
      regulated by central banks, mainly by the US Treasury, ever since Franklin Roosevelt
      revalued gold to $35 an ounce in 1933.


      That lasted until President Nixon took the US off gold in 1971. And, as a result
      of the war, and as I said, US officials were very frightened that the US was no
      longer able to control the price of gold. Hence the key to the whole world’s money
      creation that it needs to finance how its economy operates.


      The US thought, “Well, other countries are now going to take gold, and we’re not
      going to keep up with them, and there goes our leverage for imposing power in
      institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, that were
      all put in place 1944, 1945, at the end of World War Two”.


      But that didn’t happen, for the reasons that I explained in Super Imperialism,
      my book in 1972. There really weren’t many alternatives large enough to put foreign
      money in.


      So instead of cashing in their dollar inflows by buying gold, foreign central
      banks just bought Treasury securities. And as I said, that funded the rising portion
      of the US domestic budget deficit.


      Well, the dollar glut was run up mainly, as I said, by military spending. And
      I worked for a year with Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, and Chase Manhattan
      Bank, showing this. And I became a consultant to the US government, explaining
      this phenomenon, during the 1970s.


      This is not something that is taught in economics courses, because it’s politically
      sensitive, and economics tries to be “apolitical”, because if you see how political
      economics really is, you have a different approach to politics.


      So the United States has sought to keep gold prices down ever since it was revalued
      in 1971. Gold prices went up pretty quickly to about $700, $800 an ounce. Then
      finally, by the mid 2010s, into $1200, $1400, you know, gradually going up.


      The aim of this was political: to keep the world viewing the US dollar, meaning
      essentially US Treasury securities, as the most secure form of their international
      reserves.


      It’s secure in the sense that, unlike other countries, the United States can simply
      print the dollars. It can’t go bankrupt, and be unable to pay the debts, because
      unlike other countries that have debts in a foreign currency, the US debt is in
      its own currency in dollars, and it can just keep printing them.


      BEN NORTON: Very well said, Michael. There’s so much we could respond to.


      We talked about central bank demand for gold. But I think another important factor
      here is inflation, because traditionally gold has been seen as an inflation hedge.


      When you have moments of high rates of inflation — for instance, coming out of
      the Covid pandemic, as the economy reopened in 2022, consumer price inflation
      was very high in the United States and many countries, because of the supply chain
      disruptions.


      So as inflation increased in 2022, you could see that, in October, the gold price
      was around $1,600, and it increased pretty substantially to almost $2,000 in the
      spring of 2023.


      What happened then is that, in early 2023, the inflation peaked, and the gold
      price went down, as inflation went down, because it’s of course seen as an inflation
      hedge, so it makes sense that they would tend to move together.


      However, then something very strange happened. In October 2023, the gold price
      reached a low of around $1,850, and since then, consumer price inflation has continued
      to fall. But that relationship broke, and instead the gold price skyrocketed by
      another thousand dollars to around $2,900.


      So, Michael, that relationship has now ended, it’s broken. Why do you think that
      is?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: I don’t think there’s a causal relationship, there at all. That’s
      my whole point.


      People like to say gold is an inflation hedge. But you could say eggs are an inflation
      hedge, or pork is an inflation hedge.


      The point is, the real problem is the US balance of payments deficit pumping dollars
      into the world.


      You’ll pay dollars to an exporter, from China or Germany — when there was still
      a German industry — and they turn the dollars over to their central bank, and
      the central bank would then say, “What are we going to do with these dollars?
      If we don’t send them back to the United States, our currency is going to go up
      against the dollar, and that is going to make our exports less competitive. So
      we have to keep our currency, our exchange rate, down; and we do that by buying
      Treasury securities”.


      It has always been political. And the newspapers don’t want to talk about politics,
      because if they talked about politics, all of a sudden people would realize the
      Western political and economic system cannot last in the way that it’s structured
      now.


      When you talk about politics, you realize the game is over for the West. And so
      of course they don’t. They want to make it appear micro, “Oh, there are some people
      who just try to look at inflation rates”.


      Some people really believe this. They believe the textbooks. They’re gullible.
      Most investors in gold, I have to say, are gullible, but there are other people
      who are actually looking at reality, and they can see, this system can’t last.


      In the end, the people who don’t trust gold are going to win.


      I’ll give you an example. In 1973 or ‘74, Herman Kahn and I went to the White
      House for a meeting with the US Treasury. And I was explaining to them how the
      Treasury bill standard worked.


      Well, what I said was something that, certainly, they didn’t want to hear. I said,
      “Gold is ultimately the peaceful metal, because it was the US running out of gold
      that threatened to stop it from spending the military costs of the war in Southeast
      Asia, and all over, the 800 military bases that it has over the world”.


      If you have gold continue, and if Nixon did not go off gold, then America would
      very quickly lose all of its gold stock, as the cost of waging war against the
      rest of the world, of keeping its unilateral military power.


      It’s not power because it’s a democracy; it’s not power because people love it;
      it’s because American power is the ability to hurt other countries, to bomb them,
      to finance regime change, and to threaten other countries. And that costs a lot
      of money to keep threatening.


      That’s part of the whole crisis that we’re seeing now, and you’re all of a sudden
      winding down what has been, as Trump and [Elon] Musk have been saying, you’re
      winding down what has been absorbing an enormous part of the American budget,
      pushing it into deficit.


      And these are deficit bugs. They’re not modern monetary theorists; they believe
      that deficit spending is bad, not that deficit spending is how the government
      provides money into the economy at large.


      So, there’s a whole conflict of monetary theory that’s going on now. So you could
      say that this whole fight over gold and gold futures reflects the whole idea of
      what is going to be the basis of American military policy, and American foreign
      policy, and geopolitics.


      Are we going to be in a constant war against the whole rest of the world? Or are
      we going to try to make peace with Russia, China, and Iran, and just focus against
      countries that we can really beat up, like Canada, England, Australia, Japan,
      South Korea?


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, what’s also ironic is that Trump talks about cutting the deficit,
      but he’s also cutting taxes on the rich, which will likely increase the deficit,
      which is exactly what Ronald Reagan did.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Right! He is not quite — ha! That’s the unstated part. We all
      know what he wants.


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, exactly. It’s the same thing that Ronald Reagan did. You know,
      Reagan said he was going to cut government spending, but, actually, the US deficit
      as a percentage of GDP increased significantly under Reagan.


      Ironically, it was the neoliberal Bill Clinton administration that actually reduced
      the deficit, and for the first time ever since, the only time ever since, the
      US actually had a budget surplus.


      But what’s interesting, Michael, is that you have been associated with Modern
      Monetary Theory (MMT), and you’re not a gold bug.


      But what you’re saying here is that there is an element — you’re not arguing that
      the dollar should go back to the gold standard. That’s not what you’re arguing.


      You’re saying that there have to be limitations to the amount of money printing,
      by having some kind of a link to reality [and the real economy].


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Modern Monetary Theory explains how to finance the domestic budget
      deficit.


      One thing Modern Monetary Theory theory cannot do, when you create money, is you
      can’t create foreign currency.


      [The United States] can create dollars to spend into the economy. You don’t have
      to borrow these dollars from wealthy bondholders and investors. You can simply
      print the money. You don’t have to levy taxes, because that’s the essence of paper
      money.


      But, when it comes to foreign spending, especially military spending, [the United
      States] can’t print Chinese currency to finance your spending in Asia. [The United
      States] can’t print rubles. You can’t print other currencies for spending abroad.


      So Modern Monetary Theory refers to a domestic economy, not to foreign money.
      It’s a theory of domestic money.


      Gold is a constraint on money creation. It all goes back to the awful, awful theories
      of David Ricardo, the bank lobbyist, in Britain in 1809 and 1810, when he was
      testifying before the Bullion Committee and saying, “We need to keep wages down.
      We need to keep the economy poor, so that the wealthy creditors can get enough
      money to control the world, and reduce everybody else to abject dependency. So
      we’re against paper money. Paper money is inflationary. If you only use gold and
      silver, which the rich people have, then we can operate the whole world”.


      Well, he didn’t say it just in those words, as you can imagine, but his arguments
      were against creating paper money. This was the antithesis of Modern Monetary
      Theory.


      Ricardo spelled out in great detail exactly what the principles of the International
      Monetary Fund are have been since 1944 and ‘45, that, if you don’t let countries
      create their own paper money, and force them to have hard currency, gold, or US
      dollars, then they can’t afford to hire more labor; they can’t afford to invest.
      They’ll be completely dependent on countries that can act as is creditors.


      Again, that’s what I explain in my book Super Imperialism, how this whole system
      came in.


      I’m writing a book now — I’m on the last two chapters — on the political alliances
      of bankers from the Crusades up to World War One, where you have the whole attempt
      at hard money.


      This is what caused a rupture in American politics in the 1870s, ‘80s, and early
      ‘90s.


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, at the end of the 19th century, the famous populist US politician
      William Jennings Bryan said that the financial class wanted to “crucify mankind
      on a cross of gold”.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Remember, the creditors after the Civil War wanted to roll back
      prices. They said, “Well, there’s been inflation during the Civil War. And that
      means that all of our bondholders, we don’t have the same purchasing power over
      labor. We have to reduce labor’s wage rates and make them poorer and poor, so
      that we can get richer and richer, and we do this by forcing gold down. You need
      unemployment”.


      They were, just like the Federal Reserve says, “We need unemployment, hard money,
      to keep wages down, so that employers can make more profits from hiring cheap
      labor, basically”.


      This is a class war of the financial sector against the economy at large, against
      industry. Finance capitalism has become antithetical to industrial capitalism.
      That’s what you and I have been talking about in these shows.


      It all goes back to Ricardo saying, if you take away the government’s ability
      to run deficits and spend money into the economy, then you’ll be dependent on
      the rich people to supply the money.


      So when President Clinton finally ran a budget surplus in 1998, what happened?
      That meant that the government was not spending money into the economy. People
      had to go to the banks and borrow, and pay interest to the banks.


      That’s what the financial sector wants. It wants to get interest to force the
      economy at large to pay interest, to get the money that it needs to conduct business,
      and employ labor, instead of having the government simply provide, printing the
      money, without interest. The inflationary effect is identical.


      It’s no more inflationary to print money than to borrow from a billionaire, who
      isn’t going to spend money on buying [more] eggs, in any case, and “printing”
      the money that way.


      So there’s a whole fight over, what is the source and the use of money in an economy
      today?


      That has been pretty much not discussed in the popular press, but that’s what
      Modern Monetary Theory is all about. That was fought against by the financial
      sector that wanted to control money by the wealthy classes, by the financial sector,
      and by the banks, not by the government for the public interest.


      The [US] government position, Democratic Party position or Republicans, is that
      money is to be created to make money for the wealthy financial sector, not for
      the economy.


      Modern Monetary Theory is that we should create money to promote actual economic
      growth and rising living standards, not simply create money in a way that makes
      money for the financial sector and the billionaires.


      All of this political argument lies behind the restructuring of monetary policy
      that we’re going to be seeing in the next few years, triggered by this gold meltdown.


      BEN NORTON: Very well said, Michael. There’s so much we could respond to, but
      I want to go back a little bit to talking about the gold market.


      Something that you were emphasizing is how different the gold market is from other
      markets. You were talking about how, you know, the actual economy works very differently
      from what is taught in textbooks.


      You emphasized that the gold market in particular is different from other commodity
      markets. So can you talk more about that?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: So, the important key to understanding just how all of this was
      accomplished is to see how complex the world’s financial commodity exchanges where
      gold prices are set are, and what’s their relationship to actual commodity dealers,
      which is where individuals go to buy gold.


      Central banks can buy gold from each other. Investment funds, hedge funds, individuals,
      jewelry makers, etc. buy gold from bullion dealers.


      Well, there’s a general impression that when people, or central banks, or mutual
      funds, buy gold, they place bids in a market, something like the Commodity Exchange,
      COMEX.


      But that’s not really where people buy and sell gold.


      In a commodity exchange, this is really a gambling venue. You bet on whether the
      price of a stock or a bond, or gold, or a commodity — copper, or wheat, or any
      other commodity — is going to go up and down.


      So a commodity exchange is [where you go to] bet on where prices are going to
      go.


      These dealers who are buying and selling options for grain prices — and where
      is the stock market, or the S&P 500 going to go — they’re not actually going to
      buy wheat, or gold, or the stocks; they’re putting a bet on which way prices are
      going to go.


      That bet is supposed to reflect what’s happening in the real world. There’s supposed
      to be some physical, tangible basis for all of this.


      So I want to take a minute to explain. [The asset manager] Vanguard has a site
      that talks about puts and calls, and selling short, and options, and that has
      a vocabulary all its own.


      I’m going to quote what Vanguard says:


      When you buy a call option, you’re buying the right to purchase a specific security
      at a locked-in price (the “strike price”) sometime in the future [at a given date].
      If the price of that security rises, you can make a profit by buying it at the
      agreed price and reselling it on the open market [in the exchange] at the higher
      market price. When you buy a put option, you’re buying the right to sell someone
      a specific security at a locked-in strike price sometime in the future.


      So suppose, the price of gold is at $1,250. You can say, “Well, I’m going to sell
      it to you at only $1,200”. Well, if the price falls, you can actually make a profit
      by buying it on the open market at the lower price, and then exercising your put
      option at the higher price. That sounds complicated.


      BEN NORTON: Just to simplify for people — you had a good description — the very
      simple explanation is, if you buy a call, it’s because you think the price will
      go up; if you buy a put, it’s because you think the price will go down. So, call
      up, put down.


      As you said, these are essentially financial bets. This is options trading.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, the question is, during the 2010s, why, when everybody was
      saying, “This trend can’t go on; the price of gold has got to go up”, why would
      somebody come in and keep selling gold at a lower price forward, saying, “In three
      months, we’re going to sell you gold at $50 an ounce less, or $25 an ounce less”.
      Who was doing this?


      I don’t know any private investor that would have come and done that, because
      they said, “Well, we think the price is going to go up, instead of going down;
      that’s the long-term trend of gold”.


      Well, the explanation is this selling of gold forward was done by central banks,
      mainly by the US Federal Reserve and Treasury, acting on behalf of the Treasury,
      or the Bank of England.


      When you buy a put or a call, you have to pay money for the options. And there
      used to be, you would look in the newspapers, and here’s how much it cost to buy
      an option for treasury bonds, a price for stocks, or for gold.


      When you sell the right to buy gold at, let’s say the same price, or a dollar
      or two less, then people will pay you for that option to buy it at the same price
      in three months, or six months. That’s a source of revenue.


      So the US Treasury, and the Bank of England, were actually making money selling
      gold short. And when you keep promising, you have so much money, and you’re such
      a large participant in the market, you’re sort of like George Soros when he broke
      the Bank of England. You can make the market by being so large.


      When you come in and you keep selling gold short, way beyond the demand, you’re
      overwhelming the market, and that holds the price down.


      Even though more and more people may be buying gold, the United States and England
      are making money by essentially engaging in this market manipulation as a source
      of revenue.


      That is one of the factors that was holding down [the price of gold].


      Well, central banks also have, in fact, been selling gold short for many decades
      now. And they’ve been making money by it.


      As I said, to buy this option, to buy gold at a fairly low price when you think,
      “Well, certainly the market is going to go up for gold; the price must be going
      up for gold, because everybody is buying it. I’m going to buy this option”.


      And it just didn’t work. A lot of people, pessimists, tried to do this, and they
      were overwhelmed by the central banks’ selling.


      Most options are not exercised, because central banks keep selling forward again,
      and again, and again. That is what held down the price of gold for many decades.
      It kept the price from rising, because future buyers can always buy the other
      end of a short sale, at a lower price.


      The supply and demand wasn’t just in the private market; it wasn’t just among
      central banks; it was a manipulated market.


      So it seems that this gold drain, to satisfy the recent thousand dollar an ounce
      price rise that we’ve seen, has seriously depleted gold reserves. The Treasury
      has actually had to sell them.


      This is another aspect of the market. That’s the gold dealers.


      Suppose there were not a commodity exchange, to set the prices for contracts.


      Well, the demand for physical gold has been running ahead of its supply. So, central
      banks have been leasing the gold to gold dealers.


      In other words, the central banks have felt, you could call it hubris. They said,
      “Well, we’re always going to be able to keep the price of gold down”. So gold
      dealers are buying gold, and selling it to their customers, who expect prices
      to go up.


      So the gold dealers will say, “Lease us a ton of gold, at this price. We will
      pay you to lease it so that we can send it to customers”.


      If the price doesn’t go up, you know, at a certain point, the customers will say,
      “OK, I didn’t make the profits in gold that I made in the stock market, or in
      the bond market”.


      Remember, after the Obama bank crisis in 2008-2009, the whole quantitative easing
      came in, and interest rates were so low that it spurred an enormous stock market
      boom, and the biggest bond market boom in history.


      Why would people want to buy gold after 2009, when gold prices are going up gradually,
      but stock prices and bond prices were going up so much more?


      So the rival to gold was this artificial boom created by quantitative easing and,
      low interest rates. So that’s part of the equation.


      Central banks were happy to lease the gold to gold dealers. They made money from
      this leasing, just like you’d lease a car. You would give them the gold; they
      would have to give it back at a specified date.


      You say, “OK, we’ll lend you this gold for a year, and at the end of the year,
      you’ll have to give it back, but you can hold it, and do what you want at that
      time”.


      Well, the gold dealers would then turn around and sell to the private investors
      — maybe to central banks, too — the gold that they’d leased. At the end of the
      year, they would say, “We’ll take out another lease, and we’ll lease now for two
      tons”; then later, you know, for three tons.


      So the central banks would keep leasing out the gold, ton after ton, to the gold
      dealers.


      Well, that meant that the US would send gold, physically, from Fort Knox to the
      gold dealers — largely in London, which was sort of the gold trading center.


      Just like the gold market after World War Two, when the United States held down
      the price of gold in the market. That was in the London gold exchange, that they
      were holding it all in.


      So, the US and England kept leasing gold, making money that way from the dealers,
      and selling gold short, and making money off the purchase of the commissions.
      And that became a good source of financing.


      If you do the accounting, Fort Knox would have a claim for payment on the gold
      dealers for leasing this gold. And, that was a way for Fort Knox and the Treasury
      to make money.


      But their aim wasn’t simply to make money; it was to keep down the price of gold,
      so that gold would not reemerge as a rival to the US dollar.


      That’s what drove, this whole system. And that was the motivation for the United
      States. It was political.


      BEN NORTON: Michael, by the way, just, for people who don’t know, Fort Knox is
      the Department of the Treasury’s gold holdings. It’s the physical location.


      It’s officially called the US Bullion Depository. It’s where the Treasury has
      its physical gold reserves.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Yes, but most people think of that as Fort Knox. If you saw the
      movie Goldfinger, you know where it is.


      BEN NORTON: By the way, for younger viewers, when you say Goldfinger, you’re referring
      to a classic James Bond movie from the 1960s.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: It’s a very good movie, too. You can watch it again, and it’s
      always fresh. Sean Connery was still the James Bond back then.


      So the question is, how do we know how much US gold has been actually sent to
      foreign dealers? There are no statistics on this.


      There are not even any statistics for how much gold is actually in Fort Knox.


      The United States reports its gold supply, but the gold supply treats all the
      gold that has been leased to foreign dealers as part of the gold supply, because
      it is our gold supply. But we’re not holding it. We’ve leased it out!


      It’s just like, if you’re an auto company, like Hertz or Avis, and you lease the
      car, the car is your car; it’s not the renter’s car. Well, the gold is still yours;
      it doesn’t belong to the gold dealers who have leased it from you.


      So, Roberts, a friend of mine who was the former assistant secretary of the Treasury
      for monetary affairs under Ronald Reagan, back in 1981 and 1982, wrote me recently
      to say, I’ll quote, “Before we learned to suppress the gold price with naked shorts”
      — that is selling gold short when you don’t have it — “we leased the gold to bullion
      dealers who sold the gold”.


      The state of this leasing seems to have accelerated steadily. There are no statistics.
      And, “Representative Ron Paul, years ago, could never get a gold audit of Ft.
      Knox. He wasn’t even be allowed inside to see if there was any gold there”


      Ron Paul, who’s a libertarian, the [former] leader of the libertarian group in
      Congress, “made a fuss, but was told that this was a matter of national security”.


      So imagine, even a congressman cannot find out how much gold physically is there.
      Why would it be a matter of national security, if there is no problem?


      Why isn’t the US glad to say, “Here’s how much gold we have. You know, we’re perfectly
      solvent. We have it all. No problem”.


      They’re not letting any statistics out at all.


      So the Treasury has worked in two ways, as I’ve said, to keep the price down:
      leasing gold, for many years; and then manipulating it in price, to keep it low
      via the gold exchange standard.


      The question is, the gold dealers, what have they done with this gold that they’ve
      leased?


      Well, when I was studying the history of money and banking, 60 years ago, the
      principle of fractional-reserve banking was the first thing that the professors
      talked about and explained.


      That means that, if you go to a bank, and you have a deposit there, the bank doesn’t
      just hold all your money. It realizes that not all of the bank depositors are
      going to want all their money at the same time, unless there’s a run on the bank.


      So the banks take your money, and they have to keep, let’s say, one-seventh of
      the money they keep liquid, you know, for just the turnover, for normal demand
      by people who actually want to write checks on their accounts and spend the money.


      But basically, they make their money by lending out most of the money you put
      into banks, and mortgages, or to stock dealers and bond dealers, they lend it
      out, and only keep some of their money on reserve.


      Banks have specific reserve requirements, and now it’s capital backing requirements
      that they have. They’re regulated, for how much money they have to keep liquid,
      on hand.


      But back in the 16th and 17th centuries, before there was modern banking, gold
      dealers played the role.


      If you were a well-to-do person, the money that you had was gold and silver coinage.
      You didn’t really have paper currency coming in until the 17th century, and especially
      after the Bank of England was created in 1694. People used, their transactions
      were in coinage and gold.


      So if you were wealthy enough, and you had extra coinage, you would keep it with
      a bullion dealer, because you didn’t want to keep it at home, because you could
      be robbed, or there could be a fire, and the gold would all melt. And the gold
      dealers would charge you for safekeeping your gold.


      But they realized that, as more and more people sold gold, they didn’t have to
      keep all this gold in their own vaults.


      They could take this coinage and they could buy bonds that were yielding a good
      amount of money, or they could buy real estate. They could buy whatever they wanted.
      They only had to keep some of this gold in their hands as reserves.


      Needless to say, when there was a financial crisis, or when there was a war, you
      had these depositors come and say, “OK, we want our gold. There’s instability.
      We want to keep the gold at home now”.


      And the gold dealers would have said, “Well, we’ve bought bonds with them. We
      have lent out the money to traders, to make money on import and export trade.
      The money is safely invested, but we don’t have the physical gold to pay you”.


      There would be a crisis, and gold dealers would go under, if they really didn’t
      have enough money to pay their depositors, just as banks would go under when there
      was a run on the bank.


      So some gold dealers over lent, and some prudent dealers experienced risks, because
      there was always some crisis that comes up at some point, for reasons that usually
      can’t be anticipated.


      That’s why you have regulated reserves. But, back in the time of gold dealers,
      there wasn’t any regulatory agency to make sure that they didn’t just lend out
      all the money, and make money by not only collecting money from the depositors
      for holding their gold safe, but making money for lending out the gold, and investments,
      which came to a crisis at the end.


      Well, this kind of behavior, leveraging your reserves in order to make money,
      poses an obvious problem. I guess you can think of what it is.


      How long has Fort Knox, and the Bank of England, and perhaps other banks, been
      leasing their gold? And how near are they to running out of it? What if there’s
      no gold left in their vaults at all?


      Imagine Goldfinger trying to rob Fort Knox, as they did in the movie, and discovering
      that it turns out that its vaults are empty, and there’s nothing to steal!


      Are gold dealers in a similar position to Fort Knox, having gold claims for payment
      for gold that is leased from the United States, but they’re not able to give it
      back?


      The United States, will say, “We want our gold back now”. And the dealers have
      said, “Well, in the past, when you said you wanted it back, we just paid you a
      little bit more to lease it, and a little bit more to lease it. How much do we
      have to pay you this time to lease it?”


      Well, the United States can’t say, “We want all our gold back, because people
      are questioning whether America really has control of this gold stock”.


      You know, it’s like an Avis car getting into an auto wreck, and, all of a sudden,
      Avis is writing on its balance sheet, “Well, we have so many cars, and it turns
      out that some of them are broken down, or some of them are crashed, or some of
      them are missing”.


      This is the kind of situation we have now. And Avis has auditors; and gold dealers
      and mutual funds have auditors; and probably the Treasury has auditors, but it’s
      all secret. So nobody can see it.


      So everybody is operating in the dark right now. They would like to operate in
      the light by saying, “Look, what is the real situation? Who has the gold? Who
      owes the gold? What’s the supply and demand?”


      If you factor in all of this leasing, all of these short sales, you know, what’s
      the actual physical demand for gold? Where is all this gold that has been leased
      out or sold forward coming from? Where is it going?


      Well, we may be near to see the whole charade being exposed. That point is going
      to come when enough investors actually want to take physical delivery.


      It could be Indian jewelers. India used to be called the “sink of gold”, because,
      while most of the West and China operated on the silver standard; India always
      focused on gold. So it has been a major private sector purchaser of gold.


      A lot of gold of held in gold dealers, or Singapore is a place, a country that
      provides safekeeping for people who want to hold gold there. So you’ll have a
      claim on a Singapore bank or dealer, or on a Swiss bank that holds gold.


      And you assume that it really has the gold, and isn’t operating just on a fractional-reserve
      basis.


      So, last week, a former [US] military officer Douglas Macgregor was interviewed
      by Judge Napolitano, and he cited Alex Kreiner telling him that there are suspicions
      that the Bank of England may not have the gold that they’re supposed to have.


      The US Treasury has suggested they’ll send treasuries through London to provide
      the British banks with a backup, so that they can say, “OK, we won’t give you
      the gold, but we’ll give you the money for the gold. Isn’t that the same thing?”
      Well, of course it’s not the same thing.


      He thinks that US investors are among the recipients of the gold that has been
      leased out.


      Suppose the United States Treasury and Bank of England have leased gold to gold
      dealers. The gold dealers are supposed to be holding the gold.


      It becomes a pyramid scheme, basically. And this can’t be solved simply by paying
      money for the price that you had, because people want the gold. That’s why the
      price has been going up so much.


      The leasing would have kept working if the United States and its British satellite
      had enough gold to keep selling it short and leasing it out.


      But if more and more buyers buy the right to get gold on COMEX futures, then the
      Treasury can simply pay them the price gain that they bet on. The problem can
      be solved simply by printing more money, which the [Fed] can create ad infinitum.


      But once you lease gold, that poses a more concrete and immediate problem. At
      some point, people are going to want to take physical possession of the gold.
      That’s what’s occurring. It’s a run on the gold market — not a run on the bank,
      but a run on the gold market.


      Most individual investors haven’t wanted to hold gold until right now, but now
      they’re getting antsy.


      So what’s going to happen? And how is all of this sort of pyramid scheme going
      to end?


      Well, the preferred solution for the United States and the British government
      would be to simply pay their way out of the present quandary.


      But investors who bought receipts for holding gold want to have some security
      that the gold is really there. And for the first time, they’re not really trusting
      the dollar or the pound sterling anymore.


      That’s why, for so many thousands of years, people have wanted to hold gold bullion,
      because it’s tangible, and you know how much you have.


      One solution would be for central banks to try and replace tangible monetary investments
      by just saying, “Well, we’re going demonetize gold. We don’t need gold anymore.
      We demonetized it in 1971. We kept it on the books. But now we don’t need gold.
      We’re an electronic, artificial intelligence system now. So we’re going to just
      adopt a blockchain accounting system, and forget gold; it doesn’t count anymore.
      Poof! We’re going to pay you the money that you paid to get your gold, and isn’t
      money as good as gold? Isn’t the paper credit that we’re creating on our computers,
      the computer electronic credit, isn’t that as good as gold?”


      That’s the ideal for a fictitious financial universe based on claims and liabilities
      that have lost all connection to physical reality. That’s one kind of future that
      would solve the problem.


      Otherwise, how can the US and Britain cover up the problem and avoid liability?


      The old rhyme said there’s a problem selling a commodity short when you actually
      don’t have the commodity: “He who sells what isn’t his’n, must buy it back or
      go to prison”.


      That’s what people always warned short sellers. Be very careful if you sell the
      right for somebody to demand this commodity from you, you know, when the period
      is up, and you say, “Well, I’m sorry, we just speculated that the price would
      go down, but we really don’t have the gold, or the wheat, or the copper, to sell
      you”. Then that’s fraud, and you’re sent to prison.


      So, what’s going to happen if a whole government does it?


      Well, remember what President Nixon said: “When the president does it, it’s not
      a crime”.


      Today, they’ll say, “Well, it’s not a crime that we can’t give you the gold that
      you thought you bought. We’ve given you the money for the gold; we’ve made you
      whole. Isn’t that enough?” Because we’ve changed the whole nature of the system.


      So, they need a new Goldfinger to blame for the empty vaults at Fort Knox. But
      how are they going to find this? Well, Goldfinger really couldn’t have done all
      of what he did so simply in the movie.


      But maybe somebody can just atom bomb Fort Knox, and then you’ll blame whoever
      is America’s enemy of the week. They can say, “Oh, Hamas blew up Fort Knox with
      the atom bomb that Iran gave them. We’re going to attack Iran. And it’s really
      too bad that they’ve done this, but there’s no more gold. So that’s a national
      emergency. You’re just going to have electronic dollars now”. Maybe there will
      be something science fiction, like that.


      Well, the West wants to demonetize gold so that the problem — poof! — goes away
      by collective agreement.


      The problem is going to be to convince the Europeans and others to take it on
      the chin and say, “OK, we’re going to demonetize all of our gold. You know, we’ll
      hold it, but we’ll agree, in the future, that the United States can continue to
      wage the new cold war, and spend dollars into the economy, and we’re not going
      to buy more gold, unless we pay $4000, $5000, $6000 an ounce for it. But, we’re
      going to continue to let the US dollar be the basis of our own monetary and financial
      system”.


      Well, is Europe really going to do that? Certainly, China, Russia, most of Asia,
      and the Global South are not going to do that.


      That’s what makes this gold price so political. This idea of where did the gold
      go is the key to how the world’s monetary system [works], and it controls where
      world geopolitics is going to be going for the next few years.


      BEN NORTON: Very well said, Michael. I think you raised all of the important points
      that you had wanted to raise. Was there anything else?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I know that it sort of seems boring to people to go through
      the mechanics of the COMEX exchange, and the bullion dealers — these technicalities
      and how the system works doesn’t seem very exciting, but it turns out the Devil
      is in the details.


      Once you understand how the system works, you see where the vulnerabilities lie,
      and where the instability lies — or, as we like to say, internal contradictions.


      BEN NORTON: Well, I think that’s a great note to end on, Michael.


      We were speaking with the award-winning economist Michael Hudson. You can find
      all of his work at his website, Michael-Hudson.com.


      Michael, thanks for joining us today at Geopolitical Economy Report, and explaining
      these very important, very interesting developments.


      It’s always a real pleasure having you.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I’m glad you let me get into all the technicalities that
      we don’t usually work into our political discussions.


      BEN NORTON: Of course, it’s a real pleasure. We’ll see you next time.'
    one_sentence_summary: The rapid increase in gold prices, nearly tripling since 2018,
      is driven by central banks' heightened purchases amid fears of U.S. sanctions
      and asset seizures, alongside persistent private demand, as countries seek alternatives
      to dollar-denominated assets, highlighting the intertwining of global economics
      and politics.
    paragraph_summary: The recent surge in gold prices, which have nearly tripled since
      2018, can be attributed to a combination of factors, as discussed by economist
      Michael Hudson in an interview with Ben Norton. Central banks worldwide are increasingly
      purchasing gold as a safeguard against potential asset seizures by the U.S., especially
      following sanctions against Russia, with one-third of countries under U.S. sanctions.
      This trend is further fueled by inflation concerns stemming from the COVID-19
      pandemic, despite inflation rates having decreased recently. Hudson emphasizes
      that the dynamics of the gold market differ from typical commodity markets, as
      the U.S. has historically manipulated gold prices to maintain the dollar's status
      as the world's primary reserve currency. The growing demand for gold reflects
      a broader shift in the global financial landscape, with countries seeking alternatives
      to dollar-denominated assets, indicating a potential restructuring of monetary
      relations and the political implications tied to these economic changes.

      (Highlights)


      RADHIKA DESAI: Trump has won his election by telling a big lie. What’s the big
      lie? The big lie is that the people in the United States are suffering because
      of the trade deficit, because of China, because of Mexico, because of Canada.
      No!


      MICHAEL HUDSON: What you’re seeing in Trump, with his flurrying around, is a kind
      of desperation. He wants to appear to be acting in US interests, but it comes
      down really to blustering.


      MICK DUNFORD: He’s using tariffs not so much as to provide the framework for a
      domestic industrial policy, but he’s actually using it to threaten other countries,
      and to require them to transfer investments to the United States.


      (Full transcript)


      RADHIKA DESAI: Hello and welcome to the 40th Geopolitical Economy Hour, the show
      that fortnightly brings you discussions about the fast-changing political and
      geopolitical economy of our time.


      I’m Radhika Desai, your host. And behind the scenes, working to bring you the
      show every fortnight, are Paul Graham, our videographer; Eklavya Jain, our transcriber;
      and Ben Norton, our host.


      So, what is it with Trump and tariffs? He says he loves the word. He says tariffs
      are better than sanctions — although exactly how weaponizing trade is going to
      improve things upon weaponizing the financial system is anybody’s guess.


      He thinks tariffs are a big revenue raiser, and harks back to the times of William
      McKinley, when there were no income taxes in the United States, and all the revenue
      was raised by imposing tariffs.


      Sometimes we are told that Trump is using tariffs as a negotiating tool, but even
      after doing so, he talks continually about America’s trade deficit and the need
      to correct it, and so on.


      Of course, as many people point out, if tariffs of the sort that Trump is talking
      about, 25% on Mexico and Canada — and tariffs in Mexico and Canada have been put
      in abeyance, but 10% tariffs on China have already been imposed, and that’s on
      top of tariffs that have already been imposed on China since his first term in
      office.


      These sorts of tariffs are practically guaranteed to raise inflation. And this
      is precisely the point on which he was elected. People expected that he — you
      know, they associated Trump with the time of low inflation. This helped him immensely.


      Trump also talks about tariffs helping to reindustrialize the United States. Are
      tariffs enough to do that? Does Trump even had an economic strategy of any sort?


      And keeping track of the whirlwind of new orders and shocks, in addition to tariffs,
      as you know, there are lots of other things about making Gaza into a Mediterranean
      Riviera, to talk about just the most shocking. It’s hard to keep up with all these
      threats, promises, executive orders, etc.


      So how long can it last? Does Trump have a strategy? Will he stop, or will he
      be stopped, when his measures boomerang?


      Joining me today to talk about all this are two of our regulars and favorites:
      Michael Hudson. Hello, Michael.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Hello.


      RADHIKA DESAI: And Mick Dunford. Hello, Mick.


      MICK DUNFORD: Hello, Radhika; hello, Michael; and thank you very much for the
      invitation.


      RADHIKA DESAI: Yeah, it’s always a great pleasure to have you, Mick, and Michael.


      So, Michael, why don’t you start us off by really talking about what you think
      Trump’s game with tariffs is?


      I mean, what do you think is really going on? Does he mean what he says? Does
      he mean what he says? Is he going to back off? Etc.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, before you look at Trump’s idiosyncrasies, I think it’s
      good to put the big picture in perspective.


      He looks back to President McKinley and the century in which America rose to become
      an industrial power. And it did so through protectionism. And the U.S. protectionist
      doctrine was more sophisticated than those of England or even Germany. It was
      not only protective tariffs; it was promoting public infrastructure investment,
      to provide basic needs for labor and for the population, so that the industrial
      employers wouldn’t have to pay such high wages, because the government was subsidizing
      public transportation, education, healthcare — all sorts of things that today
      have to be paid for.


      Well, once this strategy of development by the American School of political economy
      achieved dominance in World War I, helped by the fact of inter-Allied debts owed
      to the United States, the United States wanted to pull up the ladder, as it were.
      It did not try to promote its doctrine of protectionism and industrial growth
      to other countries.


      Now that it was dominant, it did just exactly what England did: it moved for free
      trade. We have an advantage; we don’t want other people to share our advantage.
      Let’s have free trade so that we can out-compete them and increase our lead steadily.


      And already at that time, in the 19th century and early 20th century, there was
      an idea that the world economy was polarizing. Well, all this seemed to be built
      into the World Order in 1945 when World War II was over, as we’ve discussed. But
      then you had the 1980s, you had neoliberalism, you had financialization, and that’s
      the opposite of industrial capitalism. And so, by today, America has lost its
      industrial lead. And it has lost it by privatizing all of the infrastructure that
      was public before, forcing its labor to pay enormous costs for education that
      used to be free, for healthcare that used to be subsidized, for transportation
      that used to be subsidized.


      So, Americans lost. What is it going to do when it still imagines that it can
      become the leading country in the world? The dominant financial power, the dominant
      trade power, and absorbing the world’s economic surplus. There’s a desperation
      going on, and I think what you’re seeing in Trump with his flurrying around is
      a kind of desperation. So, we’re going to discuss today his policies as they affect
      various countries.


      But I think when you’re analyzing why he’s doing it, there are two dynamics at
      work. Not only the international dynamics but if you’re looking at what he’s done
      so far with the seemingly absurd claims against Canada and Mexico, it’s all about—fentanyl
      and the drugs—he seems to be paying more attention to the domestic U.S. audience
      than actually seeking a serious response. He wants to appear to be acting in U.S.
      interests, but it comes down really to blustering in the U.S. interests.


      And I think we can talk about his general strategy. His general strategy is simply
      to threaten to crash the international economy or the economy of his trading partners.
      And he’s not really going to crash it, because that would crash the United States
      too. But he wants to panic them. And he panicked Canada and Mexico into agreeing
      to spend a billion dollars each—even Canada, a billion dollars—on border guards
      just to stop fentanyl and presumably people coming in from Ecuador into America
      vis-a-vis Canada. It doesn’t seem to make sense.


      I think I figured out what it is—he doesn’t really expect the 25% tariffs to go
      into effect, but he thinks that other countries, Canada and Mexico, will be so
      frightened that they’ll say, “Well, isn’t there a compromise?” Well, the compromise
      is what he’s wanted all along. He says, “All right, we’ll suspend the tariffs
      for now. Let’s pause them for a month. But in the meantime, you spend these billion
      dollars here.” And when the month is over, he says, “Well, the tariffs are still
      back on. What are you going to give me?”


      He’s going to use salami tactics to cut—to get one advantage after another after
      another. What could it be? Maybe he wants Canada to sell its industry to some
      of his campaign contributors. I think he’s making it up as he goes along. But
      his basic tactic is the opposite of China’s tactic. He’s not offering other countries
      a win-win game. What he’s saying is, “If there’s a win-win game, like President
      Xi wants in China, then we lose. Because if another country also gets a win in
      addition to us, that’s something that we’re not taking.”


      So, he’s going to want to find out what everybody else’s surplus is and take as
      much as he can. And a win-win game for him is a loss for the United States. He’s
      using the tariffs to create a panic and saying, “What can I get from this?” And
      this is where we’re standing right now, at least in Canada and Mexico.


      RADHIKA DESAI: And Mick, do you want to?


      MICK DUNFORD: OK, if I just make two points. I mean, I think in some ways the
      background is that the United States is in dire straits in very many ways. No,
      I mean, in this year they have to refinance $9.8 trillion of debt. They’ve got
      a situation where they have a huge debt pile after many years of fiscal profligacy,
      productivity has slowed down, crumbling infrastructure, extraordinarily high costs
      for health and education, and of course, as Michael said, it has been deindustrialized
      in many ways by the offshoring of American capital. So, you know, the starting
      point in the sense is that very, very deeply problematic situation in which the
      United States finds itself.


      And you know, I assume that the intention ultimately is to try to address these
      issues, but, as Michael said, in a kind of win-lose way. I mean, it seems to be
      targeted at gaining the United States and sort of monopolizing key areas of the
      new economy, for example, and excluding others from it, which, as Michael said,
      differs very, very radically from the Chinese path.


      Beyond that, however, I do want to emphasize that tariffs are basically an instrument
      of trade and industrial policy. And as Michael said, they were used in the past
      by McKinley. They were used by Britain in the 1930s. They were used by Japan and
      South Korea and the other Asian tigers. In some respects, you know, one can also
      say that there are other industrial strategies, you know, in terms of credit policy
      and so on, that were used by China. So many countries that seek to come from behind
      to employ tariffs as one instrument amongst others of their industrial and trade
      strategy.


      Now, one of the reasons for that, evidently, is that basically free trade is advantageous
      to the strongest competitor. So, in the 19th century, Britain imposed free trade
      on China with devastating consequences. Britain also imposed free trade on Portugal.
      And people drew on that story. You know that story of Ricardo who argued that
      trade is mutually beneficial because it’s driven by comparative advantage. But
      in fact, I mean, trade is not driven by comparative advantage. It’s driven by
      absolute advantage. And if you look at Ricardo’s story, you know, Portugal could
      produce clothes and wine more cheaply than England.


      RADHIKA DESAI: Correct.


      MICK DUNFORD: All right, in that situation, everyone would buy all their clothes
      and all their wine from Portugal. The fact that British cloth is relatively less
      inexpensive would not encourage people to purchase English cloth. So, something
      had to happen, you know, such that the costs of English cloth were reduced and
      actually became cheaper than Portuguese cloth. So, I mean that rest upon certain
      adjustment mechanisms, and there’s serious debate, you know, about the way in
      which these adjustment mechanisms work.


      But I mean we do know is that in the past, free trade has led to polarization
      of development. So, in that sense, you know, these measures play a role, certainly
      in relation to the countries that have been left behind that are seeking to come
      up and improve the living standards of their people. And I think we have to keep
      that in mind.


      But I do think, you know, we can come back to it. I do think that Trump is using
      it in a rather different way to try to impose American will and basically what
      are win-lose solutions on other countries in the world.


      RADHIKA DESAI: Yeah. And you know, I mean, both of you raise some such important
      points that I just want to make a series of responses on a whole number of them.
      So first of all, you know, I’m very glad that you’ve mentioned—both of you have
      mentioned—that the United States itself has a history of industrialization that
      is based on tariffs, and it’s important to recall that.


      Because the bulk of the opposition to Trump’s tariffs is coming from people who
      take a free trade point of view. But the free trade point of view is not necessarily
      what even the United States needs right now. This is not to endorse Trump’s tariffs,
      the disruptive behavior that Trump is engaged in, or anything like that, but it
      is to remember that there’s nothing in per say about tariffs that is necessarily
      bad.


      And you see that one of the most talked about bits of opposition to Trump has
      been this letter written by Larry Summers and Phil Graham, in which they basically
      say, “The United States has no industrial problems at all.” United States industry
      is booming as never before, according to them. You think if you read that letter
      that there was absolutely no reason for Trump to get elected, that the American
      working class was doing fine, etcetera, etcetera.


      Secondly, they also repeat a whole number of canards that have become part of
      the lexicon of the sort of globalist American position in which they want the
      United States to continue running deficits, trade and otherwise, and so on. And
      so, they say that while the United States has always run trade deficits when it’s
      prosperous, when it is growing. But this is just the wrong way of putting it.


      The problem is that the United States has become so deindustrialized; its economy
      has become so penetrated by imports that every time there is growth, every time
      people have a better money in their pockets, they spend it on imports. That’s
      why the United States trade deficit always expands with American growth. But they
      celebrate as though, you know, deficits are a sign that America is growing, which
      is just completely economically illiterate.


      And of course, I mean they repeat all sorts of such things. And so, I think it’s
      very important for us to tell a different story. The problem is not times per
      se. The problem is the way in which Trump is imposing them and also the other
      thing is, is that Trump thinks that insofar as he says anything about this, he
      says, you know, tariffs are going to reindustrialize the United States.


      But Mick as you were saying, in order to succeed at doing that, tariffs have to
      be part of a larger industrial strategy. That larger industrial strategy requires
      that the state controls capital. Unfortunately, in the United States, capital
      controls the state. There is no way in this context that the reindustrialization
      of the United States is going to be the result of Trump’s tariffs policies.


      And there’s another very important thing here and which we have talked about the
      three of us and Michael and I and over many many geopolitical economy hour episodes.
      The inclination of the American corporate capitalist class is to invest in financial,
      in finance, in speculation and predatory lending, etc. It is not to invest productively
      and where is the power that is going to say to them, “No, you must if you if you.
      If you invest your way, we will close off these avenues of speculative investment
      and predatory lending and only allow you to invest productively.” There is no
      such power. Trump is as much, if not more, a creature of this financialized capitalist
      class than any other previous president. So, in that sense you know this is not
      going to work.


      A related point, I just… very quickly. You know, it’s important to remember that
      people always celebrate the United States turn to free trade in the context of
      the Great Depression and the passing of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act or
      whatever it was called, RTAA and so on. And this was, you know, the United States
      waking up and becoming more enlightened than the rest of the world, which was
      imposing protectionist tariffs and worsening the depression. There was a very
      simple reason why the United States had to become pro free trade during the Great
      Depression.


      Number one, it suffered the most from the Great Depression and it suffered the
      most from the Great Depression because unlike its competitor powers, its peer
      powers, it did not have colonies which could be forced to accept America’s surplus
      produce. That is why it’s actually in the context of the 1930s that not only were
      steps towards free trade being made, but also the United States decided to normalize
      relations. With the Soviet Union. I mean, you know, whatever little market that
      created for them that would be a good idea. So that’s another thing. So, there’s
      a good reason why the United States became a free trading power.


      And just two further points. I think that you know, both of you have said some
      things about, you know, whether Trump will carry through with his tariffs or not.
      Quite frankly, I don’t think even Trump knows what he’s going to do because Trump,
      is not a resolution to the deep crisis that the United States is in. The United
      States is in economic crisis. It is so far away from financial crisis. It is in
      social crisis. It is in public health crisis with the opioid epidemic and. So,
      on every front, it is in crisis. Trump is not a resolution to the crisis. Trump
      can only express the crisis in his contradictory behaviors. He can only express
      the fact that the United States does not have that many levers with which to deal
      with it.


      And finally, I’m not so sure, that you can say the Trump’s threats are working.
      I think Trump’s threats because you see Canada has apparently announced that it’s
      going to spend $1.3 billion more on border security. But that’s an announcement.
      It’s like Trump’s threats. We have to see exactly what really happens in the course
      and the newspapers in Canada complaining that, you know we haven’t got any details.
      Of course, you haven’t got any details because it doesn’t hurt to make an announcement.
      We are going to spend, but you haven’t yet spent. We’ll have to see how that works.
      So, so many things to talk about, but I think it’s your turn Michael now.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, you made the important point that really is the takeoff
      points that America after World War 2 was supposed to provide dollars to the economy
      by growing. But it’s not growing now. So, the question is, what is it going to
      do? Well, the only way instead of providing dollars to the economy, it has to
      suck up the surplus from other countries and specifically Europe. So, I think
      instead of just saying how bad America’s problems are, the three of us have just
      explained that.


      Let’s talk about what the response is going to be. What can other countries do
      when the United States says, well, we are not going to make prosperity from a
      trade surplus, but from a trade deficit, because we’re not exporting that much
      anymore, but from the trade deficit, a deficit now, how can we make money off
      a trade deficit? Well, all of a sudden, tariffs. This means that you know other
      countries when they produce exports to the United States, now part of what they
      get in exports, they will have to absorb the price in tariffs that will be collected
      by the United States to finance this bunch of deficit, largely for the neoliberal
      policy of getting taxes.


      Well, yesterday’s Financial Times had a very interesting discussion of Europe.
      So far, if you look at Europe, Europe looks like the patsy in all of this—it looks
      like it hasn’t been doing any response at all. But the Financial Times article
      said that when Trump began to get aggressive, just like today in his first term
      as president, Europeans threw up an Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) to impose penalties
      and restrictions on US goods and services.


      If Trump use tariffs to force policy changes. Well, there’s been no discussion
      of this in Canada or Mexico or the Global South countries. But now that Trump’s
      wealthiest supporters and his closest advisors are from the high-tech sector,
      I think that certainly Europe said, well, we’re going to retaliate against the
      US and the Silicon Valley companies—Facebook, X, and Google.


      And retaliation, the Financial Times article said the retaliation may come in
      the form of “revoking the protection of intellectual property rights in their
      commercial exploitation, such as software downloads and streaming devices. It
      also allows the EU to block foreign direct investment or restrict market access
      for banking and financial services groups.” This is really serious.


      This is the first revival of a discussion that American foreign policy is based
      on the assumption that other countries have no alternative, that they will not
      respond, that they’re all going to be like Canada, just sort of going along with
      whatever the United States says—that the leaders of all other countries are like
      Justin Trudeau or like Olaf Scholz in Germany.


      But in 2018, such retaliation took three months for Europe to begin to move against
      Trump, and it forced them to roll back his threats to Europe. Yesterday, the French
      Finance Minister said, “We’re not going to take three months this time. It’s going
      to be very quick.” So, all of a sudden, despite the fact that you’ve seen Europe
      buckle under on trade with Russia and imposing sanctions on China and turning
      it into NATO, all of a sudden, the European heavy industry and the wealthiest
      industrial class are planning on retaliating quickly.


      The big question is what will Trump be able to do against that? That’s the big
      question. For the first time now, Trump is not acting in the vacuum that he thinks
      he’s acting in. He’s acting in a way where if the United States tries to impose
      tariffs, threaten to wreck the economy of other countries, they can retaliate
      by wrecking the United States the more.


      The result of Trump’s actions that we’re seeing unfolding now—the question to
      be asked is, how is this going to hurt the US economy itself? How is Trump’s intention
      of controlling the rest of the world going to create feedback that ends up isolating
      the United States from the rest of the world going forward?


      RADHIKA DESAI: Exactly. Mick, please.


      MICK DUNFORD: OK, it strikes me, I mean, just looking at some of the statements
      that have been made in the recent past that he’s using tariffs, not so much as
      to provide the framework for a domestic industrial policy, but he’s actually using
      it to threaten other countries and to require them to transfer investments to
      the United States.


      So, he demanded that Saudi Arabia undertake major investments in the United States.
      I read that he’s threatened Taiwan, claiming that TSMC should relocate to the
      United States, and that if it did not do so, he would impose tariffs on Taiwan.
      In the case of Europe, I mean, Europe was pressed into imposing sanctions on Russia.
      As a result of that, energy costs soared. It’s now provided with expensive energy
      from the United States, and a lot of European industry is considering relocating
      to the United States. So, its use of tariffs, if you like, is somewhat unusual
      in relation to the ways in which they’ve been used in the past. So that’s the
      first point I want to make.


      I just wanted to make a couple of others. I mean, if you look at what he does,
      he looks at bilateral trade balances. So, he looks at the trade with China and
      says, “We have a $360 billion deficit last year.” Now, if you think about what
      is happening, basically the United States imports manufactured goods from China.
      China’s overall trade surplus is not especially large—it’s about 5% of GDP—because
      China imports large volumes of goods from other parts of the world. China has
      20% of the world’s population, 5% of the world’s arable land, and 5% of many critical
      resources, so it has to import very, very many things in order to meet the needs
      of its people.


      That means looking at bilateral balances doesn’t make much sense. You have to
      think about it in a wider context of a set of relationships that are mutually
      beneficial between a large number of countries. And then, the other point is,
      of course, when China did have a significant trade surplus, what it was largely
      doing was using that trade surplus in order to purchase U.S. Treasuries. So, it
      was effectively lending money to the United States in order for it to spend.


      That raises—and it’s something that Michael said some very important things about
      recently—the whole question of the role of the capital account and of the capital
      flows going around in the world. Because United States is a large net recipient
      of capital from the rest of the world in a whole variety of ways. And Michael
      can speak about it himself—I mean, he’s made a very important point recently that
      many countries are in debt. They have to repay their debt, but if they have to
      repay their debt, they need to generate revenue to do so, which means they need
      to be able to export to other countries.


      So, if it becomes more difficult for them to export to the United States and other
      parts of the world because of a breakdown of the international trade system, that
      makes it exceptionally difficult for them to meet their debt obligations. So,
      it’s a policy that has a number of very, very contradictory elements to it.


      RADHIKA DESAI: Yeah, it’s a bit like the interwar period, of course, where precisely
      the disruption of trade made it difficult for debts to be repaid. Exactly.


      Again, a few points to the very excellent points that you’ve made. I think that,
      you know, Trump acts as though US threats are extremely serious—that the US threats
      are essentially the threat of a really, really large actor of a sort that the
      US simply is not today.


      So, one very important statistic that I read in the FT a week or two ago is that
      the United States today accounts for only 15.9% of world imports. That is an end.
      The EU comes a close second, and China a close third. So apart from extremely
      vulnerable countries such as Mexico and Canada, which, thanks to NAFTA, are particularly
      deeply intertwined with the US economy—and their economies are not as big as China’s
      is—they are very vulnerable.


      But most of the rest of the world can very well do without trade with the United
      States. Yes, they will suffer a bit of a shock, but quite frankly, if they cannot
      export to the United States, they will find many other places to export to.


      There are a few other trends as well. Trump is today speaking in a world in which
      trade is considerably less important. So, the head of the WTO was recently interviewed,
      and she pointed out that for the last decade—15 years, or since the middle of
      the 2000s—basically, world trade has been growing less fast than world GDP.


      Which means that essentially, the bulk of what countries produce—on average, more
      of it—is being consumed at home. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. At the
      end of the day, while of course most people say trade drives growth, no—growth
      drives trade. And if countries are growing and populations of countries like India
      or Bangladesh or China or whatever are consuming more of what they produce, what’s
      wrong with that?


      The whole purpose of economic development is to expand the consumption of the
      people of your country, especially in places where consumption has historically
      been low. So anyway, I think the world will suffer a bit of a shock, but it is
      not a shock from which it cannot recover. So that’s something that we must bear
      in mind.


      That’s why the Europeans and others will be able to retaliate. And I think that
      these sanctions, like the sanctions against Russia or these trade tariffs, will
      also boomerang.


      Another point that people keep forgetting about—people say that, or rather, there
      are two points: one of which everybody does remember, lots of people remember;
      another people completely forget.


      These tariffs, if they are imposed on the scale that Trump is talking about, will
      definitely lead immediately to inflation in the United States. And that inflation
      will have a further effect, which I mean—that inflation will be bad enough, but
      because of the cost-of-living crisis that is already raging in the United States,
      if that inflation then goes up, the Federal Reserve will be further constrained
      from reducing interest rates. It may even be constrained to increase interest
      rates, in which case it will more or less immediately trigger a financial collapse
      or a financial crisis, which will hurt Trump’s own friends a great deal because
      they are the ones who are in the forefront of making lots of money based on borrowed
      money through leveraged trading and so on. And that is the wealth that will essentially
      go down.


      And a final point—I’ll make a couple of others, but I’ll come back later—you know,
      Mick, you talked about capital inflows into the United States, but the fact of
      the matter is that these inflows had already gone down well before Trump came
      to power. And these inflows—the lowering of these inflows—has already led to a
      situation where the health of the treasury market is under scrutiny.


      The treasury market used to be considered the broadest, deepest, most liquid market
      in the world. It is no longer. With the United States issuing more and more demand
      for credit, there are not enough suppliers. That’s why the Federal Reserve has
      itself had to step in in order to keep up the treasury market. And all sorts of
      devices have had to be used in order to try to retain what liquidity it has. But
      the liquidity of the treasury market is itself in great doubt.


      So, I just thought I’d leave it there. But Michael, I guess it’s your turn now.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I want to take off from the point that Mick made. That is
      all important. The key is not the balance of trade; it’s the balance of payments,
      which is much larger in the end. And 60% of China’s exports to the United States
      are made in American-owned factories there. They’re important to the United States,
      and all of the same thing happens in Canada and Mexico for automobile parts made
      by firms that are affiliates of US parent companies.


      So any attempt to impose tariffs on Chinese exports, or Canada’s auto exports,
      or Mexico’s auto exports to the United States—or all of the maquiladoras, the
      firms just over the border that are assembly plants to put parts together to send
      to US parent companies to put into American final products—all of this is going
      to, all of a sudden, increase the costs to the United States, that has set up
      these factories in China, Mexico, and Canada as part of its outsourcing of labor,
      which is part of the Clinton Democratic Party class war against the Labor in the
      United States, drive down wages by shifting your production abroad to foreign
      countries, and you’ll cut back industrial employment here. That will create an
      oversupply of labor, and wages will go down, and presumably profits will go up,
      and therefore stock market prices will go up. That’s the Democratic Party’s growth
      plan that’s become the whole basis of American strategy for the last few years.


      Well, by America imposing tariffs on these goods that are used by American companies,
      just imagine—the first effect will be to price American automobiles out of the
      market because you’re taxing many of the imports. But there’s another factor that
      I want to point out. When you look at the overall balance of payments in the relationships
      of this trade, you realize that what is considered to be American production,
      and American GDP turns out not to be American at all.


      If an automobile is made from parts that are imported—most of the parts from Canada
      or Mexico—then that means that, well, certainly when the car is shipped off from
      Detroit to the dealers, it’s counted as American auto production, American GDP.
      But a large portion of this isn’t American at all. It’s foreign, of course. It
      shouldn’t be in GDP because it’s part of the output, and the way they measure
      it, but it’s really not American.


      So much so, in the way in which Trump has chosen to begin his tariff fight, is
      a fight against American companies above all. The single major victim of the tariffs
      against Canada are Ford and General Motors. And the threat against China—likewise,
      China has been cutting back its exports to the United States. It’s fallen from,
      I think, 22% to now it’s only 15% of China’s exports here to the US. And many
      of these are to the US companies that have established the factories there.


      And of course, the US has also diversified in importing from other Asian countries
      too. So, the kind of imports that America is importing to be part of its industrial
      plan turns out to be undercutting industrial revenue and industrial profits. You
      can expect the share prices of these firms to go down as their profits go down.
      The value of wealth in the form of stock and bond ownership is going to go down,
      and you’re going to have the American auto companies fall into the same problem
      that you had years ago when there was the auto bailout.


      You’re also going to have companies like Walmart be targeted. Walmart gets an
      enormous amount of consumer goods from China. Well, just imagine—either Walmart
      will have to increase the price of these goods, or it’ll have to absorb the cost
      of the tariffs itself. Same thing with the auto companies. Either they will increase
      the price of their autos by 25% or so—at least for the import content part of
      it—or they’ll have to say, “Well, we’ll lose our market if we raise the price
      by 25%. All we can do is absorb the profit ourselves. We will have to pay the
      tariff. We can’t raise the prices and make the consumers pay because there are
      all these other cars that other countries are putting in.”


      So, you’re seeing, if you look at who Trump is really threatening, think of him
      as threatening the US economy itself. And the question is going to be—are the
      big US industrial companies, those that are left, going to try to push back? That’s
      going to be the domestic political question we’re going to see unfolding, I think,
      in the next month or two.


      RADHIKA DESAI: Yeah, Mick, please.


      MICK DUNFORD: OK, I was very struck by what you said, Radhika, about the difficulties
      of the treasury market. And I think it brings us back to something that was said
      very early on, namely, you know, that in a sense, Trump is trying to manage the
      decline of the United States and trying to deal with the very difficult situation
      that is within the country itself.


      I think an interesting question is whether what he is doing in the international
      arena will actually exacerbate some of the problems that he confronts. In relation,
      for example, to these tariffs that he’s imposed on China—I mean, China provides
      certain critical goods. So, the first question is, can the United States obtain
      these intermediate goods and commodities that it imports from China from other
      countries?


      So that raises the question as to what extent trade diversion is possible. And
      to some extent, I mean, it will probably occur. It’s certainly the case that some
      Chinese companies are ramping up production in Vietnam, you know, in order to
      supply the US market and to circumvent these particular sanctions.


      But I think, you know, that raises the question of the extent to which, confronting
      these sanctions, countries such as China—but also other countries in the Global
      South—are going to fundamentally reorient their trade away from the United States.


      RADHIKA DESAI: That’s it.


      MICK DUNFORD: I was quite clear, you know, for some years now that China has been
      reorienting its trade towards Southeast Asia, towards its BRICS partners, and
      towards the Global South. And it’s also very interesting that they actually responded
      in a very strong way to the imposition of tariffs on China because they introduced
      a 15% duty on coal, liquefied natural gas, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural
      equipment, and certain cars.


      Now, these are products that China can very easily source from Russia, from its
      neighbor Russia. So again, it’s quite conceivable that this set of tariffs will
      lead China itself to accelerate its diversification of its own trade. And in that
      sense, you know, it may actually exacerbate the difficulties of the United States.


      So, I think, you know, this issue of trade diversion and how people respond to
      these tariffs is actually a question that’s very important to explore.


      RADHIKA DESAI: Yeah, and I’d say, you know, first of all, I mean, I would say
      that you inadvertently—I’m sure being too complimentary to Trump—when you say
      that Trump is trying to manage US decline. I think really Trump is surfing US
      decline, and in the process, he will make the most of it for himself and his corporate
      cronies and so on.


      Beyond that, I don’t think Trump has the capacity to think of the United States
      as an economy, as a people, as a country, or anything like that. I simply can’t
      believe it. From what I’ve seen of the guy over the last 8-plus years, it’s just
      not possible that he has anything in mind.


      And here’s a very interesting thing. You know, obviously, tariffs are such a big
      deal for Trump. He has made tariffs into such a big deal because, as I always
      love to say, Trump has won his election by telling a big lie. What’s the big lie?
      The Big Lie is that the people in the United States are suffering because of the
      trade deficit—because of China, because of Mexico, because of Canada. No, the
      real reason the people in the US are suffering is because of 45 and more years
      of neoliberal policy, which have led to the systematic deindustrialization of
      the United States and all the other things that have led to the financialization
      of the US economy, led to, I mean, incredible, historically unprecedented levels
      of inequality—all those things, you know.


      So, this is why people are suffering. But he needs to misdirect that anger—that
      righteous anger of people—at something else, and he’s misdirecting it at trade:
      China, Mexico, Canada, Europe, and so on. So, this is why tariffs are such a big
      deal. He has to seem to be very active on the tariff front.


      But here’s another really dirty little secret about Trump’s tariffs. Trump says
      that the Chinese will pay the tariffs, and the Mexicans will pay the tariffs.
      No, it’s ordinary American consumers who are going to pay the tariffs. And you
      know, with suppliers like China or Mexico particularly, they have been supplying
      all the things that the American working class has been able to buy for very little
      for decades.


      Now, it’s going to become more expensive. This will lead to a direct decline in
      the cost of living of ordinary American people. And there’s a Sorry story there,
      which I may come back to later on, but let me just say another thing.


      What’s the flip side of this? The flip side of this is that he wants tariffs to
      generate revenues so that he can give even more income tax cuts to his big corporate
      cronies.


      So, this is really—I mean, this is a shabby, dirty little secret of Trump’s tariffs.
      And that’s why we should repeat them because they’re not going to help ordinary
      American workers at all. This is the thing.


      And of course, the secret of low inflation over the last 40-odd years, until very
      recently, has been precisely that the rest of the world has, for a variety of
      reasons, supplied the United States with dirt-cheap goods. And now that they are
      less easily available—partly because countries like China are doing well and their
      labor is no longer dirt cheap, and partly because the pressure of neoliberal policies,
      the pressure of climate change, the pressure of wars, et cetera, is actually destroying
      the world’s capacity to produce in many countries—this is also happening.


      And the dual pressure of that is leading to high inflation. None of that is going
      to be solved by Trump.


      So, one more point—you know, we say, what will these tariffs mean for the United
      States? And we’ve already mentioned many things, and I’ll mention another thing.
      People forget the extent to which the United States is still reliant on agricultural
      exports, and if there is retaliation, the US farmers are going to suffer an enormous
      amount.


      But more than that, I think, from a macro point of view, from a big-picture point
      of view, I think that the effect of the tariffs on the US economy will be to accelerate
      the diminution—the already ongoing diminution—in the weight and influence of the
      United States in the world economy. It will shrink the US economy in relation
      to the world economy. It will shrink US imports and exports in relation to the
      world economy and all the things that follow from that.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: All right, based on what you’ve just said, I think we should title
      the show with the words that Mick used: “Managing the US decline.” That’s really
      what we’re talking about, and Trump is accelerating it. And Mick used the word
      “trade diversion”—that’s exactly what is going to happen.


      For instance, Tesla generated $22 billion from China in the last year, as reported
      in 2023. Now, that’s 25% of Tesla’s revenue coming from China. Imagine what would
      happen if China just moved against Tesla. That would enormously affect Tesla’s
      owner.


      Now, I imagine also how the terms of trade diversion could play out. Imagine how
      Mexico and Canada could realize that, well, because we’re America’s largest trading
      partners, who are they going to take from us? Because we’re right next door. They’re
      going to try to exploit their partners most of all because it’s easier to exploit
      partners than enemies that are not going to let you do it or just more distant
      people.


      Now, I think Dean Baker said the other day, “Well, what if Mexico, and Canada
      decided to shift their supply chains away from the United States towards China?
      Let’s get their solar panels, batteries, and other items, like electric cars,
      from China instead of from the United States.” Imagine if Canada, that has been
      blocking electronic vehicles from China in order to try to protect the market
      for US goods in China in Canada, decided to begin getting these from China.


      Trump’s actions have made the United States prone to a change in the supply chain
      to China. Shouldn’t China choose to realize that there is a real economic, political,
      and military war against China now that it’s been called the number one enemy
      of America, the existential enemy, and decides to play hardball?


      America and Trump don’t really have many cards to play. The cards to play are
      in the countries that have not been industrialized and the countries that are
      not very highly indebted and financialized. So, America is trying to bully from
      a very, very weak position, and Trump, blustering, wants to make it appear in
      his personality as if we’re in a strong position, telling other people what to
      do. But it’s really not in a very strong position at all. It’s in a very weak
      position.


      So, all of a sudden, he’s made America prone to almost every kind of supply chain
      shift to other countries, and they now have the option of actually taking the
      initiative and conquering the US market for what it’s worth. And whatever they’re
      going to do with the Treasury and US dollar holdings, if they’re going to get
      from this.


      MICK DUNFORD: OK, I mean, something that I think one needs to ask is, why is the
      United States so uncompetitive? Now, you know, one reason obviously is the lack
      of investment in industry and the slowdown in productivity growth—the absence,
      if you like, of the kinds of factories you find in China that have extraordinary
      productivity levels and that actually, as you said, Radhika, pay good real wages
      to their workforce.


      But at the beginning, you know, Michael talked about, for example, the cost of
      health in the United States. So, the United States has this extraordinary cost
      structure. I mean, I live in Beijing in an apartment, and for one year, electricity,
      gas, water, and district heating through the winter months cost me about $500
      per year.


      RADHIKA DESAI: What’s district heating?


      MICK DUNFORD: This is a central heating system, but for the whole community—a
      residential community. A lot of Americans discovered that these costs are way,
      way lower than China when TikTok was stopped, many of them immediately switched
      to something that’s called Red Notes. Actually, the Chinese name is Xiaohongshu,
      and if you translate it, it means “Little Red Book.” It’s very amusing because
      its impact was almost revolutionary, because certainly all these Americans were
      actually talking to Chinese people, and they were comparing things like the cost
      of living, the quality of their transport infrastructure, the quality of their
      subway systems, the quality of their vehicles.


      So, these are fundamental issues, you know, that if the United States is to rebuild
      itself, have to be addressed. And it’s in many ways a much more important issue
      than threatening other countries in ways that may well prove deeply counterproductive.


      RADHIKA DESAI: No, this is a very important question, and I should maybe put in
      a little advertisement for our next show because after this one, Mike Dunford
      and I are going to talk about the whole issue of competitiveness and about technological
      innovation and advancement, because we’re going to devote a whole program to talking
      about what it means when China says that they’re going to develop the new productive
      forces, and particularly talking about it in the light of what DeepSeek has done
      in the past couple of weeks.


      I mean, DeepSeek has completely, in my humble opinion, upended the American business
      model. And you know, you and Michael pointed to how there are these broader social
      costs that are more efficiently paid in countries like China, whereas in the United
      States they end up, you know, making products less competitive and so on.


      But there’s also something else. I think the American capitalist class has long
      ago ceased to innovate in any serious sense. It has been a direct result of neoliberalism
      and financialization. Practically every other week, there is a news story about
      what went wrong with Boeing. How did it go from being a major innovative company
      producing the best aircraft in the world to becoming a company that cannot even
      produce aircraft that don’t go down?


      I mean, this is completely ridiculous, and it has everything to do with the fact
      that in Boeing, there was a huge culture shift when instead of keeping innovation,
      safety, and technological advancement in the forefront, they put the bottom line
      in the forefront of all their endeavors. And that’s what you got.


      But there are many, many other things besides. I think there is plenty of evidence
      to say that US capitalists today require a greater return on their capital than
      capitalists elsewhere. So, you know, there are so many things we can talk about,
      and we will. But I think we should probably wind down, as we are close to an hour.
      So maybe I’ll give everybody a last little chance to say a couple of things each,
      and then I will close.


      So, Michael, do you want to add any final reflections on our topic today?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: But I think you just summed it up. We haven’t even talked about
      the accompaniment to tariffs and that’s sanctions on other countries that America
      convinced that Europe and other allies to impose, much at their cost. What if
      the United States could say, “Well, the World Trade Organization isn’t functioning
      anymore,” because the United States has refused to permit enough judges on the
      World Trade Organization court. So, when China and other countries sue the United
      States for violating the trade rules that America agreed to, it can’t get a hearing
      because the United States has essentially blocked the World Trade Organization.


      China’s already been protesting, and I’m glad that Mick brought up TikTok because
      that’s exactly the point. Now, the United States says if China or Taiwan or any
      other country invests in the United States, as we told them to, and creates a
      factory here, we can then expropriate them and take it over at pennies on the
      dollar by whatever campaign contributors are closest to whoever is the current
      president of the United States.


      Other countries can say they don’t want to go on this, and they can not only retaliate
      in terms of the tariffs, but they can say, “We’re going to drop the sanctions.
      If we can’t export to the United States, if we can’t have production facilities
      in the United States without you doing to us what you did to TikTok—confiscate
      it and give it to your campaign contributors—we’re just going to go back to where
      we were before with our focus on Asia.”


      Well, the problem for Europe, of course, is that Russia and Asia have turned their
      backs on Europe, and Europe is going to be left the big, probably the big loser
      in all of this. But you’re seeing the whole system that America has created to
      make sure that it’s an exploitative system and gets the benefit is being unwound
      by the way in which Trump is so blatantly and explicitly saying, “We’re going
      to gain America first, you lose.”


      This is a declaration of war not only against the world but against the whole
      system of world trade, world investment, and international finance that was put
      in place after World War Two. We’re seeing the ending of that very, very quickly—slowly
      at first, and then suddenly, as the saying goes.


      MICK DUNFORD: OK, you know, I think Michael’s highlighted the importance of the
      character of the international order. And then I think, you know, as he said,
      an international order was put in place after the Second World War. It had, in
      the United Nations, some very, very positive dimensions. But the point is, if
      you look at the United States, essentially, you know, from the Truman Doctrine
      onwards—and earlier, in fact, because that was formulated in 1945—the United States
      adopted a kind of modus operandi in which they work with these structures if they
      served their interests and work outside them if they do not.


      So, if you go back, you know, to the Marshall Plan, instead of channeling it through
      the Economic Commission for Europe, it was managed by a separate agency, basically
      in order to secure the one-sided aims of the United States. And that abuse, you
      know, has actually increased, especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union
      in recent years.


      I think an essential issue is the way in which other countries in the world are
      going to try to restore some kind of equitable international order that actually
      respects the equality of all states and tries to ensure that the benefits of trade
      are widely diffused. And try to ensure that technology spreads. If technology
      can spread, that can transform the lives of millions of people. And in that sense,
      that’s why what has happened with DeepSeek is so important—because that has made
      it available to the entire world instead of trying to establish a monopoly in
      order to appropriate an extraordinary share of world wealth for a small minority.


      RADHIKA DESAI: Well, that was great. Michael and Mike, really insightful closing
      comments. For my closing comments, I just want to make a couple of quick points.


      The first really is that, as you’ve said on this program many times before, what
      China means by globalization and what the West means by globalization is very
      importantly different. Basically, in Western countries, globalization has been
      used as a way of talking about lifting all restrictions on free markets and free
      trade. So that essentially the result of that would be that the economies, people,
      and societies of the rest of the world become open to penetration by excess commodities
      from the West, excess capital from the West, and so on. They also become open
      to supplying what the West needs, particularly cheap labor and cheap inputs.


      But in China, globalization has always meant expanding and deepening international
      cooperation, international trading, investment linkages, and international linkages
      of every sort that are mutually beneficial to the countries concerned—or at least
      considered by their governments to be so. This is the principle on which China
      has proceeded. And China has indeed deepened its interaction with the world economy,
      mostly to the benefit of the world economy, for the last many decades since 1978
      and the reform and opening up.


      It’s important to understand this because, at a time when the United States is
      tearing up every agreement it has been part of—including essentially destroying
      the WTO, violating its decisions, refusing to appoint judges to the dispute resolution
      mechanism, and so on. Meanwhile, China continues to comply in its own way with
      its regulations. And I think the reason as well is important to remember is because
      the WTO while it was not a complete victory for developing countries, it did represent,
      to some extent, an advance in leveling the playing field, and so on, vis a vis
      the non-Western world, in particular.


      And of course, China’s entry into the WTO was also negotiated based on set of
      agreements in which China made sure that the WTO would be beneficial to it rather
      than just essentially exposing it to the marauding attentions and intentions of
      Western corporations. So, WTO in this form is probably something to defend, and
      undoubtedly also something to reform from the point of view of the rest of the
      world. But it is an existing structure. The United States is today attacking it,
      and it may very well be that in the end it is China’s vision of globalization,
      rather than the US’ vision, that will save the WTO.


      The second point I wanted to make is that the United States is today reduced to
      playing a zero-sum game. And I think when a country is reduced to playing a zero-sum
      game, it shows that they have nothing to offer their potential partners. Because
      in order to play a positive-sum game, it has to be a game of give and take. You
      have to be able to offer something to your potential partners, adversaries, or
      whoever in order to play a positive-sum game.


      China can do that because it has much to offer the rest of the world. The United
      States finds itself today in a position where it simply cannot do that, and therefore
      it can only play a zero-sum game. And it is a very sad commentary on the leadership
      of a country that once had so many benefits and privileges to be reduced to this.


      Ultimately, this is a question of leadership. The United States, as an economy,
      is ruled by the whims, needs, and fancies of a tiny corporate elite.


      But yeah, that’s it for now. Thank you very much, Mike and Michael, and thanks
      to all who are listening and will continue to listen. Please share with other
      people who may be interested. I think it’s been a really, really fascinating discussion—far
      more in-depth than many that I have heard elsewhere by newspapers and magazines,
      as well as on YouTube.


      So, thank you very much, and see you in a couple of weeks. Bye-bye.'

      (Introduction)


      BEN NORTON: Donald Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on countries all around
      the world, including the top three trading partners of the United States: Canada,
      Mexico, and China.


      DONALD TRUMP: The word “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary —
      more beautiful than “love”, more beautiful than “respect”. No, less beautiful
      than “religion”, no. Right? I don’t want to get into that argument. But the word
      “tariff” is the most beautiful word in the dictionary, remember that. It’s going
      to make our country rich.


      BEN NORTON: Now, Trump says he’s doing this because he wants to reduce the trade
      deficit that the US has with the rest of the world.


      However, there’s a major contradiction in Donald Trump’s economic policy, because
      he also wants to maintain the US dollar as the global reserve currency.


      And Trump has threatened other countries, especially countries in BRICS, that
      are trying to de-dollarize. Trump has said that if countries de-dollarize, he
      will put 100% tariffs on them.


      DONALD TRUMP: We will keep the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And
      it is currently under major siege. Many countries are leaving the dollar.


      They’re not going to leave the dollar with me. I’ll say, “You leave the dollar,
      you’re not doing business with the United States, because we’re going to put 100%
      tariff on your goods”.


      …


      I’m very much a traditionalist. I like staying with the dollar. You know that
      from when I was there. Make the dollar the choice. I hate when countries go off
      the dollar. I would not allow countries to go off the dollar.


      BEN NORTON: So what Trump’s trying to do is have his cake and eat it too, because
      this is a contradictory policy. Trump wants to reduce the US trade deficit, but
      he also wants to maintain the US dollar as the global reserve currency.


      The problem is that if Trump wants other countries to continue using the US dollar
      in international trade and finance, the US has to run a deficit, so other countries
      can get access to those dollars. If Trump wants to use tariffs to reduce the US
      trade deficit, it means that other countries will not be able to get the dollars
      that they need in order to use the dollar in international trade and finance.


      So these very contradictory policies that Trump is trying to maintain could have
      severe repercussions on the global economy. And today, I had the pleasure of speaking
      with the award-winning economist Michael Hudson, who has warned that if Trump
      imposes high tariffs on countries like, for instance, Canada and Mexico, their
      currencies will fall significantly against the US dollar, which will mean that
      they will not be able to pay off the debt that these countries have denominated
      in US dollars.


      This could cause a global debt crisis, as countries around the world can’t get
      the dollars they need to pay off their debts.


      Here are a few highlights from my discussion with the economist Michael Hudson.
      And after I will go straight to the interview.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: To Trump, a win-win is a loss, because a win-win means some other
      country also wins, not only you, the United States. And if some other country
      also wins, that means the United States has not grabbed everything there is to
      grab, and Trump wants to grab everything that is available, the entire economic
      surplus.


      …


      Here, again, you have one of the features that makes the United States an exceptional
      country. And Trump is making use of that exceptional characteristic of the United
      States.


      The United States can do what no other country does. It can threaten to hurt other
      countries if they don’t do what the United States wants. It can bomb them. It
      can engage in regime change, through the National Endowment for Democracy and
      USAID.


      It can hurt other countries. Other countries don’t have a foreign policy anything
      like that.


      …


      What Trump realizes is normally you don’t need military force to subjugate and
      colonize another economy. You can use financial warfare, and you can use trade
      warfare, and that’s “peaceful”.


      You don’t need to mobilize American troops to invade a country. Vietnam showed
      you can’t do that anymore.


      You can simply use trade and financial sanctions. That’s what he’s trying to do.


      …


      That’s America’s strong point. It’s not that it’s going to use the hydrogen bomb.
      It can wreck world trade, wreck world finance, and try to force the kind of economic
      relationship that Trump and the deep state wants.


      And Trump has made it clear that America has to be the winner in any kind of trade
      agreement that it makes with any other country.


      …


      If American companies are unable to export to China, then their profits will be
      down, and they will lack the money to engage in the research and development they
      need to keep up with the technology that the rest of the world is doing.


      And so the result is that Trump’s policy is deliciously self-defeating for US
      policy. It will mean inflation. It won’t mean more industrialization.


      (Full interview)


      BEN NORTON: Michael, it’s a real pleasure having you today. Thanks for joining
      us.


      I wanted to ask you about an article that you recently published warning about
      the impact that Trump’s tariffs could have on the global economy.


      The basic point you make is that the US designed the global financial system in
      a way in which the US dollar is at the center, and other countries need to get
      access to dollars to pay off their dollar-denominated debt, and to pay for imports.


      Yet, in order for this system to work, the US has to run a deficit with the rest
      of the world, a current account deficit, so other countries can get those dollars.


      But Trump wants to disrupt this. He says he wants to tariff other countries to
      reduce the US trade deficit, which means that other countries won’t be able to
      get the dollars they need to pay off their debt and to pay for imports.


      Now, this could be good news, if you actually wanted to end the US dollar’s role
      as the global reserve currency. But then Trump also is threatening countries that
      de-dollarize, threatening 100% tariffs on BRICS countries.


      As you put it in your article, he has two completely contradictory ideas in his
      head.


      At the same time, you warn that this could cause a financial crisis. So can you
      explain your argument and why you’re concerned?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, people usually think of the dollar as being used for international
      trade, but the vast use of dollars is on the capital account, for financial transactions.
      And the great majority of international debts, owned by governments to other governments
      and to bondholders, is denominated in US dollars. That’s quite different from
      using the dollars.


      By denominating them in dollars, that means that you have to use your domestic
      currency to buy dollars. And if the dollar goes up in price relative to other
      currencies, if it appreciates, then you use much more of your domestic currency
      to spend. And that requires governments to essentially cut back their spending
      on [things] other than debt service.


      For instance, the Canadian dollar has gone way down against the US dollar. So
      Canadians have to spend much more money in their currency to pay their dollar
      debts.


      The Federal Reserve in the United States has been raising interest rates here,
      and that has attracted investors into the dollar, pushing up the exchange rates,
      especially against Global South currencies.


      And this means that the Global South, in addition to having problems of earning
      the money to pay their dollar debts, have to pay more and more of their own currency
      to pay the dollar debts.


      The result is that their currency goes down, and that increases the price of their
      imports, increasing their domestic price inflation.


      This is what occurred in Germany in the 1920s on a massive scale, when no matter
      how much Germany tried to depreciate the mark (its currency), it wasn’t able to
      raise the money to pay its debts, because it would throw the marks on the foreign
      exchange.


      Well the reparations were set around 1921. And as soon as the mark began to go
      down, the American Congress said, “Well, German exporters are competing with American
      industrialists”. So they passed a law, the law against trade with countries with
      depreciating currencies. And that meant that whatever price advantage Germany
      got from a lower exchange rate, the tariff rate went up accordingly.


      So the United States prevented Germany from obtaining the dollars and hard currencies
      to pay the Allies, for them to turn around and pay the inter-Ally war debts to
      the United States, for arms that the United States had sold to England, France,
      and other Allies before the United States entered the war.


      Well, by 1927 and 1928, there was a great argument among economists: should the
      debts be written down, or not?


      It was obvious that the debts couldn’t be paid without creating economic austerity
      and a disaster, not only in Germany, but France also had a hyperinflation trying
      to pay its central debts.


      So John Maynard Keynes made the point that there is an implicit morality underlying
      the international credit system, that a creditor nation has an obligation to accept
      the exports of countries that are paying the debts, to enable them to pay the
      debts.


      Well, this argument went all the way back to 1809 and 1810, when David Ricardo
      was the bank lobbyist in England for credit. And David Ricardo, came out with
      the exact same junk economics idea that guides the International Monetary Fund
      today.


      Ricardo said that you didn’t need any government interference, any government
      money, for debtor countries, because, when a debtor country paid its debts, its
      currency would go down, and that would drain its money. The drain of money, according
      to the quantity theory of money, would lower the prices, and its exporters would
      have a price advantage. And the price advantage would end up competing with the
      exports of the creditor nation, and automatically this depreciation of prices
      would continue until there was balance restored, automatically, without any government
      interference in international debt.


      Well, this was, of course, nonsense. Take the case of Haiti, for instance. Haiti
      was exporting basically sugar and coffee to France. The lower price didn’t make
      France buy more Haitian plantation crops, because it was already buying everything
      they could do.


      Same thing with the Global South countries. The International Monetary Fund says
      if a country is unable to pay its debts, all it has to do is break up its labor
      unions, get rid of the political leaders that want to increase wages, lower wages,
      and austerity is going to lower the prices, and these countries will have the
      money to pay the debts.


      Well, the reality is that austerity never helped any country pay the debts. Austerity
      means that there’s unemployment. Austerity means that industrialists, of capitalists,
      or whatever investors, don’t have enough money to invest in new means of production.


      And austerity means that labor is not able to increase its living standards and
      productivity. And the government is not able to spend on domestic social spending
      like education, healthcare, and other basic social needs that are necessary to
      make an economy work.


      So the whole idea of automatic adjustment mechanisms was fallacious. But underlying
      Ricardo’s attempt to sort of provide an apologetics for debt service is this the
      recognition that if a country is owed money, it has to enable the debtor country
      to pay.


      That’s not happening. And, right now, you already have countries owing so much
      foreign debt as a result of the bad loans, even the bad loans made by the International
      Monetary Fund and bondholders, without any capacity to evaluate what are the abilities
      of countries to actually pay.


      The Global South is already strapped, and is then prevented from spending money
      and investing in public infrastructure, and domestic private investment, and government
      investment to actually grow.


      So the problem is how do these Global South countries, and actually the BRICS
      in general, other countries, how do they get the money to be able to grow? And
      that would include Canada, Mexico, and even Europe.


      Well, Trump has this myth of tariffs. He says, “We’re going to raise tariffs because,
      back 130 years ago, under President McKinley, America became strong by imposing
      protective tariffs”. That was what created a price barrier, so that American industrialists
      were able to gain the money to invest in steel, manufacturing, and other production.


      America got rich by protectionism, just like England first got its economic advantage
      in industry by mercantilist protectionist policies. Germany and France also built
      up their industrial supremacy in the late 19th century, early 20th century, by
      protectionist government [policies].


      But after World War One, the United States and others stopped protectionism. They
      had already gained their economic advantage over other countries, and they wanted
      to pull up the ladder, and prevent other countries from doing what it had done
      — public investment, raising living standards, the economy of high wages to increase
      labor productivity.


      They wanted to prevent other countries from imposing their own tariffs, to protect
      their agriculture, especially.


      And as a result, the Global South and many BRICS countries are running chronic
      balance of payments deficits.


      How are they going to get the money to pay the debts that are denominated in dollars?
      Well, the only way is to increase their exports, but the international free trade
      laws that the United States and Europe created in 1944 and 1945, have prevented
      other countries from following the government policies to increase their exports.


      So they’re sort of crippled already in their ability to develop their economies
      by enough to pay their foreign debts.


      Well, here comes Donald Trump, to answer your question. And he said, “We’re going
      to impose tariffs on you, to promote American industry, and to force you to follow
      the policies that we’re telling you to do”.


      And here, again, you have one of the features that makes the United States an
      exceptional country. And Trump is making use of that exceptional characteristic
      of the United States.


      The United States can do what no other country does. It can threaten to hurt other
      countries if they don’t do what the United States wants. It can bomb them. It
      can engage in regime change, through the National Endowment for Democracy and
      USAID. It can hurt other countries.


      Other countries don’t have a foreign policy anything like that.


      So Trump is going to use this ability to hurt other countries, to force them to,
      for instance, in the case of Europe, he said, Europeans should increase their
      NATO spending from 2% to 5% of their GDP. That means they have to buy more arms
      from the United States.


      The United States dollar will go up. The euro will go down.


      Trump also says that, Europe should buy more of its, [liquefied natural gas],
      its energy, its gas from the United States, LNG, through American tankers, not
      from Russia or from elsewhere.


      Again, Europe is paying more of its currency to the United States for dollars.
      That’s why the euro is going down in value.


      So the result of Trump’s policy with Europe is saying, “If you don’t do these
      things, we will impose 25% tariffs on you”.


      Well, if that is the case, it will make European exports even less competitive
      than they are now, and the euro will go down.


      Well the American, financial class, behind Trump, is all in favor of that, because
      you’ve had in the recent few months, American investors have been going to Europe
      and say, “This is great. The euro is going down. That makes it cheaper for us
      Americans to buy their industrial companies. We can just pick them off”.


      Germany is going into a depression. Its companies are going out of business. They’re
      laying off labor. There’s shrinkage. Profits are down. That means that their stocks
      are down. And the price of buying their stocks in dollars is going down even more.


      So you’re having an American takeover of European industry, such as hasn’t been
      seen in quite a while. So Trump is able to exploit Europe, to that extent.


      The problem is that the dollar is going up against the Global South currencies.
      And the Americans already have pretty much what they wanted to buy in the form
      of foreign raw materials, natural resources, public monopolies that have been
      privatized.


      And the result is that Trump’s actions, of trying to hurt other countries, will
      prevent them from paying their dollar debts.


      I’ve used Mexico as a particular example in all of this, because Mexico has a
      higher proportion of its balance of payments, receipts coming from immigrants’
      remittances than any other country. Immigrants’ remittances are a key supporter
      of the peso’s exchange rate.


      And these are remittances from Mexican seasonal labor that goes to California
      to pick crops, and also from the many Mexicans that have left for the United States
      to earn dollars by working in the construction industry, or food services, or
      retail industry, other sectors, so that they can send the dollars they earn back
      to their families.


      And many Latin American countries also have sent their children to the United
      States to earn dollars. And what little they can make over the minimum wage that
      they’re paid is sent back to their families in their home countries.


      That has helped Latin American countries support the exchange rate of their peso
      or other currency, enabling them to pay their foreign debts, and to afford the
      more expensive oil, gas, and raw materials that have been rising as a result of
      US policy, and the sanctions that it’s imposed on Russia, China, and other countries.


      Well, all of this will be disrupted. And the question is, what are other countries
      to do if all of a sudden their ability to export to the United States, to earn
      the money to pay their foreign debts, is blocked by the United States?


      They have two choices: One is to sacrifice their economy, to impose absolute austerity,
      to follow the International Monetary Fund’s direction, to fire and lay off their
      labor, to begin selling more of their property at distressed prices to US vulture
      buyers, and basically give up their hopes to develop a balanced economy.


      The alternative is to say, “We’re sovereign countries under international law.
      We can decide to put our interests before that of foreign countries. After all,
      voters elect us to represent domestic interests, not foreign interests. So we
      are suspending our debt service, so that we can afford to break even and continue
      the economic balance that has characterized our economy, and to enable us to provide
      basic needs for the economy”.


      And the basic needs include expanding investment, becoming more self-sufficient.


      Now, of course, if they do this, the United States is going to impose all sorts
      of sanctions against them.


      The US response will be to treat countries that don’t pay their foreign debts
      like the United States treated Argentina: you try to grab whatever foreign holdings
      they have; grab their gold stocks that they hold in New York, or in the Bank of
      England. If they have not taken back their gold stocks, it’ll be grabbed.


      They will lose whatever foreign assets they have. If they have ships, naval ships,
      that go abroad, those can be grabbed, as the creditors, bondholders, of Argentina
      tried to grab its foreign ships. I’ve described all this in my book Killing the
      Host.


      So it’s very difficult for one country to say, “We’re going to have to suspend
      our debt”. Even if that country is as strong as Mexico.


      In fact, if Mexico were to say that, for all we know, the United States, Trump
      would send an army in and grab its oil fields, and say, “Well, you can’t pay your
      debts. We’re going to grab your oil resources. Just like we’ve grabbed the oil
      resources in Syria. Nothing wrong with that. We grabbed Syrian oil, we can grab
      your oil”.


      So, this this essentially is an escalation of US control.


      Trump has campaigned as a “president of peace”. Unlike Biden, unlike the deep
      state, he is trying to clean out the neocons from the US government. That’s good.
      He’s trying to close down much of the CIA, and much of the FBI. That’s good.


      What Trump realizes is normally you don’t need military force to subjugate and
      colonize another economy. You can use financial warfare, and you can use trade
      warfare. And that’s “peaceful”.


      You don’t need to mobilize American troops to invade a country. Vietnam showed
      you can’t do that anymore.


      You can simply use trade and financial sanctions. That’s what he’s trying to do.


      But Trump tends to think, and American foreign policy tends to think, in very
      segregated, partial equilibrium approaches, it’s called in economics: you assume
      that whatever you do in trade, is not going to have ramifications in the financial
      sector, the diplomatic sector, even the monetary sector, such as it’s having now.


      So the problem if Mexico, Colombia, or other countries are faced with a blockade
      of their exports, and they decide, “We’re not going to pay the foreign debts,
      because you’ve prevented us from paying the foreign debts; that makes these debts
      odious debts”, they have to do it as a group, by getting together and saying,
      “We Latin American countries, African countries, and many Asian countries, along
      with Canada and Europe, are all in the same boat. We’ve got to suspend debt service”.


      And we know that that is going to bring down the international financial system,
      but that’s going to hurt primarily the United States and its English and European
      satellites.


      That’s what their strong point is. They can call Trump’s bluff, and they can call
      the bluff that any American tries to make, by saying, “Yes, you can wreck the
      trade system; we can wipe out the financial system. And by doing that, we’re reestablishing,
      we’re actually helping our balance of payments”.


      What Trump has done against Colombia, trying to force it to repatriate deportees
      in a very degrading way, on military transports, shackled — this is not all that
      extraordinary, that’s been happening under the Biden administration right along.


      But the fact that Trump is trying to make a showdown with Colombia by doing this
      shows what it can do as its modus operandi against other Latin American countries,
      and Global South countries, and Asian countries, and Canada, and so forth.


      So I think this, in a way, it serves as a wake up call to the rest of the world
      to decide, “How are we going to cope with the policies that America is trying
      to do?” It’s a new American aggression policy, and you don’t know how far this
      can go until other countries begin to press back.


      Every time they knuckle under, as, Colombia basically did, then it encourages
      Trump to go on, and on, and on.


      That’s essentially what he’s doing, and even extending it into the military policy,
      when he says, “We need raw materials. Just as we grabbed Syria’s oil, we can grab
      Greenland because we need raw materials. And we also need military bases so that
      we can fight against Russia or China planning an international transport system
      through the Arctic Ocean. We want to control the Arctic Ocean so we have the power
      to wreck the world trade”.


      That’s America’s strong point. It’s not that it’s going to use the hydrogen bomb.
      It can wreck world trade, wreck world finance, and try to force the kind of economic
      relationship that Trump and the deep state wants.


      And Trump has made it clear that America has to be the winner in any kind of trade
      agreement that it makes with any other country, from European countries to Russia
      and China.


      This is another characteristic that makes America the exceptional country. Other
      countries usually follow what President XI of China does. He’s trying to do a
      win-win situation.


      China is not trying to militarily invade other countries. He’s trying to say,
      “We can invest money in developing your ports, and your railroads, for internal
      trade, so that you don’t have to rely on export trade to achieve financing, to
      support your government spending. You can trade with your neighboring countries
      all together, in basically a Eurasian economic unit, so that you will not be dependent
      on the United States. It’s a win-win”.


      Well, to Trump, a win-win is a loss, because a win-win means some other country
      also wins, not only you, the United States. And if some other country also wins,
      that means the United States has not grabbed everything there is to grab. And
      Trump wants to grab everything that is available, the entire economic surplus.


      So that is the confrontational characteristic of US diplomacy, in the United States
      today.


      BEN NORTON: Well, you raised a lot of great points there. There’s so much to respond
      to, Michael.


      I’ll start with this question: in your article, you mentioned that Trump has this
      uncanny ability to have completely contradictory thoughts in his head at the same
      time. There are a few examples of that you mentioned.


      For instance, he says he’s going to fight the neocons, and then he selects the
      king of the neocons, Marco Rubio, to be his secretary of state. And his national
      security advisor, Mike Waltz, is also a neocon. So there’s that.


      Trump said he’s going to be a “peace president”, he’s going to be against war,
      but he’s threatening to colonize Panama, the Panama Canal, Greenland, even Canada,
      threatening Mexico.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: But he’s doing that for peace. “Peace” is when the United States
      controls everything and no other country has any ability to fight back. That’s
      “peace”!


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, great point. That’s the Orwellian US empire’s view of peace:
      war is peace.


      But another example this is what we talked about earlier, that Trump wants the
      US dollar to remain the global reserve currency. He has threatening countries
      that de-dollarize with tariffs. He threatened 100% tariffs on BRICS countries,
      which now represent 55% of the world population.


      Yet at the same time, he says that he wants to re-industrialize. But in order
      to re-industrialize the US, the dollar has to come down. It’s extremely expensive.
      Even some some major US banks are saying that the US dollar is extremely overvalued.


      You talked about how the Federal Reserve has significantly raised interest rates
      in recent years, which has caused many other currencies to depreciate against
      the dollar.


      So if Trump wants to re-industrialize, he has to tackle this issue, unless he
      wants iPhones to cost $5,000 to produce.


      He says he wants to produce this stuff locally, but it’s so expensive, he’s not
      even going to be able to export it, because it’s going to be so uncompetitive
      internationally, because of the very expensive dollar.


      So to me this seems to be another major contradiction that Trump, he wants to
      punish countries that de-dollarize, and he says he wants to re-industrialize.
      Yet he also is engaging in these policies like tariffs that only push the dollar
      further up.


      So it seems like something has to break at some point. Do you think that it’s
      possible for this strategy to work, for the US to re-industrialize with such an
      expensive dollar, while threatening other countries that de-dollarize, and putting
      on tariffs that keep driving up the dollar?


      And I’ll add one other part of this question: he also has chosen the billionaire
      hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to be his Treasury secretary.


      There are 13 billionaires in the Trump administration. These are people who are
      not going to want to bring down the dollar, because that would hurt Wall Street,
      because the stronger the dollar gets, the better, the richer they get with all
      of their US financial assets.


      So I mean, what’s going to break, what’s going to happen here?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, there are a number of things you have said. To begin with,
      there’s a great misunderstanding, and that’s because money and debt are blind
      spots in the economic education that people get in the United States.


      Trump follows a sort of neoliberal blind spot in not looking at industrialization
      and international finance as an interrelated economic system.


      In theory, the idea is that if only you will lower the dollar’s exchange rate,
      that will make American exports more competitive, with European exports and China’s
      exports. That’s crazy! What American exports? America has de-industrialized.


      Let it devalue the currency by 90% — 90%! It will take 10 or 15 years to recreate
      the industry that America has outsourced to foreign countries.


      America doesn’t have the production to lower its prices on. It has control of
      the world oil industry, as a center of American diplomacy; it has American agriculture;
      but it doesn’t have industrial exports, like cars.


      Its idea of industry is information technology. Well, we just saw that go “poof”,
      with DeepSeek, the Chinese information technology.


      The problem is that what has de-industrialized the United States, and makes it
      impossible to industrialize, is the United States is no longer in an era of industrial
      capitalism; it’s finance capitalism.


      And the aim of the financial companies, whether they’re steel companies, or auto
      companies, or computer companies, is to increase the price of their stocks.


      Most of the financial fortunes in the United States and Europe are not made by
      earning profits on production; they’re made by capital gains in their stock prices.
      And the capital gains are financed mainly by debt leveraging, from banks at low
      interest rates to buy one stock. Or if you do make profits, you pay them out as
      dividends, to increase your stock prices.


      I think I’ve said on your show before that 92% of the of the Standard and Poor’s
      500 (S&P 500) cash flow, profits, are paid out as dividends and stock buybacks,
      not as industrialization [investment].


      You can see an example in what has happened with Intel, in the United States.
      The United States wanted to prevent China from getting computer chips, imagining
      that, if the United States blocks computer chips from China, China will say, “Oh,
      we give up, we don’t know how to produce computer chips”.


      Well, obviously China has gone way ahead. But Intel has been blocked from selling
      computer chips to China.


      And Intel’s stock has been plunging, because its CEO has said, “Well, wait a minute,
      our biggest single market is China. Now that we’ve lost the Chinese market, our
      profits are way down. And if we don’t make profits, how are we going to get the
      money to finance research and development? We’ve got to support our stock by using
      the few profits that are left for us to make on stock buybacks and paying out
      as dividends to support our shareholders”.


      So, essentially, the United States has been cutting its own throat, its industrial
      throat, with financialization, and the fact that the whole objective of American
      corporate industry isn’t industrial anymore; it’s financial.


      If you have created a way of making America’s comparative advantage in finance,
      then you’ve lost your advantage in industry.


      Can America, can any economy, that does not produce industrial exports, does not
      produce exports or products that other countries want, except maybe liquefied
      natural gas and farm products, can that really dominate the world?


      If you’ve outsourced all of your industry, all of your research and development,
      if you’ve stopped your infrastructure spending in order to cut taxes on the wealthiest
      financial classes so that they can make more money, instead of the economy rebuilding
      its bridges and infrastructure, and developing like it used to do, then you’re
      going to have the United States becoming a failed industrial economy. And that’s
      what has happened.


      So in that sense, lowering the dollar’s exchange rate isn’t going to help. But
      if you raise the dollar’s exchange rate, that’s going to make it easier for US
      financial institutions and corporations to buy out European and other foreign
      industries, as we talked about a few minutes ago.


      So I think that really is the problem. I don’t think the financial sector really
      wants to depreciate the dollar, because if you depreciate the dollar, relative
      to foreign currencies, and you have de-industrialized and rely on China, Asia,
      India, other countries for your imports, that means that, is that if the dollar
      goes down 20%, the price of your imports will go up by 20% — an equivalent amount.


      And if the prices for imports go up, that will create a price umbrella that will
      mean American inflation will largely accelerate.


      So, if you look at this economic dynamic at work — it’s so simple that you have
      to be an economic PhD not to recognize it, to get distracted from it — then I
      think the outlook is for a very rapid acceleration in the US inflation, precisely
      what Trump wanted to bring down, without industrializing, without having any good
      effect on American industry.


      And in fact, as long as Trump uses his adversarial economic war diplomacy, focusing
      on China, and Asia, if American companies are unable to export to China, then
      their profits will be down, and they will lack the money to engage in the research
      and development they need to keep up with the technology that the rest of the
      world is doing.


      So the result is that Trump’s policy is deliciously self-defeating, for US policy.
      It will mean inflation. It won’t mean more industrialization. It will mean corporate
      layoffs. And it means probably that, at a certain point, stocks will go down.


      And the rest of the world will find its political and diplomatic interests in
      reorienting its foreign trade and finance among itself. So what Trump is doing
      is speeding the foreign guest.


      The neocons and the neoliberals assume that other countries will not respond to
      US actions. They think, “We’re going to do this. What can they do? We have all
      the power”.


      They don’t take into account blowback, and they don’t take into account the fact
      that what the Biden administration has been doing, and what Trump is simply accelerating,
      is forcing the parting guest to leave, and to look as rapidly as they can for
      an alternative.


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, Michael, very well said.


      You raised in your article, Michael, you quoted a speech that Trump gave at the
      World Economic Forum in Davos, and he said, I’ll play a clip of this:


      DONALD TRUMP: My message to every business in the world is very simple: come make
      your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation
      on Earth. We’re bringing them down very substantially, even from the original
      Trump tax cuts.


      But if you don’t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then,
      very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.


      BEN NORTON: So Michael, that is Donald Trump’s proposal. What is your response
      to that?


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Haha, “If you do move to America, we will have your investment,
      we will simply grab it; we’ll take it away from you, and then you’ll lose it anyway.
      We’ll do to you Europeans, Asians, Latin Americans, just what we did to China,
      with TikTok”.


      TikTok tried to do something in America, and it was so productive that, Donald
      Trump, and the Biden administration says, “We want Americans to grab it. We are
      not going to let other countries make a profit off Americans. We’re going to grab
      it all. And we’re going to either ban you or, if you continue to operate in America,
      it will be by selling control of your company at pennies on the dollar to American
      investors”.


      Well, Trump has had the Silicon Valley people flocking to Florida to talk to him,
      to say, “We want to buy TikTok. You know it’s worth, Trump says TikTok is worth
      $1 trillion. Let’s offer $50 billion, you know, 5% of what it’s actually worth.
      And if they don’t agree to lose 95% of what it’s worth, then we’re going to just
      ban them from doing it”.


      That’s an invitation to Germany, sure, Germany, Europe, reinvest in America. You’ll
      have to leave your labor there. Let your labor, you know, essentially, work in
      restaurant, serving tourists or something, but, yeah, we have to employ American
      labor. Of course, we’ll have to first of all send them to school to learn engineering
      and basic skills to work in the factory.


      But you’ll move them here, and then we’ll just raise taxes on you; we’ll take
      you over.


      Obviously, the American mentality since, the McKinley era, of imperialism, from
      the Philippines to Cuba, has been confiscation. So he has threatened other countries
      with confiscation if they invest in America.


      Venezuela tried to invest in gas stations, and refining companies, and marketing,
      to be able to sell its oil in America. America confiscated this, because it said,
      “You elected a socialist. If you don’t elect a neoliberal, we will confiscate
      whatever you have in America”.


      What does that tell Europe? That if Europe, if Germany, Italy, France, elect a
      nationalist, their property can be nationalized the same way.


      America has declared trade war and financial war on the rest of the world. And
      it’s as if this seems so surprising to them, so unthinkable, that they’re not
      thinking about, how do we cope with this?


      The only way of coping it with it is to call Trump’s bluff and say, “If you want
      to raise the tariffs, that’s fine with us, to sell at our price. We’re not going
      to lower the [price] and except less for our exports. If you want to gain more
      money, and charge American consumers more, and raise your price index, that’s
      fine with us. Be our guests. And in fact, if you impose a 20% tariff on our exports,
      that means that we’ve been under-pricing our exports. So we’re going to impose
      a 20% export charge on our exports, so that our government makes as much money
      as you’re making off our export trade”. That’s one possible response.


      BEN NORTON: Well, that was an excellent discussion. We hit all of the points I
      wanted to address.


      We’re living in a very interesting time. Things are happening very quickly. So
      it’s always a pleasure having you, Michael.


      I hope to have you back on soon to discuss, who knows, all of the other crazy
      things that will be developing in the upcoming weeks and months.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Well, I look forward to it — and to the transcription, that we
      can post.


      BEN NORTON: Yeah, absolutely. For anyone watching or listening, if you go to GeopoliticalEconomy.com,
      you can always find transcripts of the interviews that I do with Michael Hudson.


      So thanks for joining me today, Michael, and I’ll see you next time.


      MICHAEL HUDSON: Bye bye.'
    one_sentence_summary: Economist Michael Hudson warns that Donald Trump's proposed
      tariffs could destabilize the global economy by preventing countries from accessing
      the US dollars needed to pay off their debts, potentially leading to financial
      crises as currencies depreciate.
    paragraph_summary: Economist Michael Hudson warns that Donald Trump's proposed tariffs
      could destabilize the global economy by exacerbating financial crises, particularly
      for countries that rely on the US dollar for debt payments. Trump's protectionist
      policies aim to reduce the US trade deficit while simultaneously attempting to
      maintain the dollar's status as the global reserve currency, creating a contradictory
      situation. If tariffs limit other countries' access to dollars, their currencies
      may depreciate, making it difficult for them to service dollar-denominated debts,
      potentially leading to a global debt crisis. Hudson emphasizes that Trump's approach
      could harm not only the economies of countries like Canada and Mexico but also
      the broader international financial system, as it relies on the US running a deficit
      to provide dollars for global trade. The situation reflects a historical pattern
      where creditor nations impose economic hardships on debtor nations, risking severe
      repercussions for global trade and finance.

    text: 'The 1940s saw a series of movies with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, starting
      with the Road to Singapore in 1940. The plot was always similar. Bing and Bob,
      two fast-talking con men or song-and-dance partners, would find themselves in
      a scrape in some country, and Bing would get out of it by selling Bob as a slave
      (Morocco in 1942, where Bing promises to buy him back), or committing him to be
      sacrificed in some pagan ceremony, and so forth. Bob always goes along with the
      plan, and there’s always a happy Hollywood ending where they escape together –
      with Bing always getting the girl.


      In the past few years we have seen a series of similar diplomatic stagings with
      the United States and Germany (standing in for Europe as a whole). We could call
      it the Road to Chaos. The United States has sold out Germany by destroying Nord
      Stream, with Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholtz (the hapless Bob Hope character)
      going along with it, and with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen
      playing the part of Dorothy Lamour (the girl, being Bing’s prize in the Hollywood
      Road movies) demanding that all Europe increase its NATO military spending beyond
      Biden’s demand for 2% to Trump’s escalation to 5%. To top matters, Europe is to
      impose sanctions on trade with Russia and China, obliging them to relocate their
      leading industries in the United States.


      So, unlike the movies, this will not end with the United States rushing in to
      save gullible Germany. Instead, Germany and Europe as a whole will become sacrificial
      offerings in our desperate but futile effort to save the US Empire. While Germany
      may not immediately end up with an emigrating and shrinking population like Ukraine,
      its industrial destruction is well under way.


      Trump told the World Economic Forum at Davos on January 23: “My message to every
      business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America and we
      will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on earth.” Otherwise, if they
      continue to try and produce at home or in other countries, their products will
      be charged tariff rates at Trump’s threatened 20%.


      To Germany this means (my paraphrase): “Sorry your energy prices have quadrupled.
      Come to America and get them at almost as low a price as you were paying Russia
      before your elected leaders let us cut Nord Stream off.”


      The great question is how many other countries will be as quiescent as Germany
      as Trump changes the rules of the game: America’s Rules-Based Order. At what point
      will a critical mass be achieved that changes the world order as a whole?


      Can there be a Hollywood ending to the coming chaos? The answer is no, and that
      the key is to be found in the balance-of-payments effect of Trump’s threatened
      tariffs and trade sanctions. Neither Trump nor his economic advisors understand
      what damage their policy is threatening to cause by radically unbalancing the
      balance of payments and exchange rates throughout the world, making a financial
      rupture inevitable.


      The balance-of-payments and exchange-rate constraint on Trump’s tariff aggression


      The first two countries that Trump threatened were America’s NAFTA partners: Mexico
      and Canada. Trump has threatened to raise U.S. tariffs on imports from both countries
      by 20% if they do not obey his policy demands.


      He has threatened Mexico in two ways. First of all is his immigration program
      of exporting illegal immigrants and permitting short-term work permits for seasonal
      Mexican labor to work in agriculture and household services.


      He has suggested deporting the Latin American immigration wave to Mexico, on the
      ground that most have come to America via the Mexican border along the Rio Grande.
      This threatens to impose an enormous social-welfare overhead on Mexico, which
      has no wall on its own southern border.


      There also is a strong balance-of-payments cost to Mexico, and indeed to other
      countries whose citizens have sought work in the United States. A major source
      of dollars for these countries has been money remitted by workers who send what
      they can afford back to their families. This is an important source of dollars
      for families in Latin America. Deporting immigrants will remove a substantial
      source of revenue that has been supporting the exchange rates of their currencies
      vis-à-vis the dollar.


      Imposing a 20% tariff or other trade barriers on Mexico and other countries would
      be a fatal blow to their exchange rates by reducing the export trade that U.S.
      policy promoted starting under President Carter to promote an outsourcing of U.S.
      employment by using Mexican labor to keep down U.S. wage rates.


      The creation of NAFTA under Bill Clinton led to a long line of maquiladora assembly
      plants just south of the U.S.-Mexico border, employing low-wage Mexican labor
      on assembly lines set up by U.S. companies to save labor costs. Tariffs would
      abruptly deprive Mexico of the dollars received to pay pesos to this labor force,
      and also would raise costs for their U.S. parent companies.


      The result of these two Trump policies would be a plunge in Mexico’s source of
      dollars. This will force Mexico to make a choice: If it passively accepts these
      terms, the peso’s currency exchange rate will depreciate. This will make imports
      (priced in dollars on a worldwide level) more expensive in peso terms, leading
      to a substantial jump in domestic inflation.


      Alternatively, Mexico can put its economy first and say that the trade and payments
      disruption caused by Trump’s tariff action prevents it from paying its dollar
      debts to bondholders.


      In 1982, Mexico’s default on its tesobono bonds denominated in dollars triggered
      the Latin America debt bomb of defaults. Trump’s acts looks like he’s forcing
      a replay. In that case, Mexico’s countervailing response would be to suspend payment
      on its U.S. dollar bonds.


      This could have far-reaching effects, because many other Latin American and Global
      South countries are experiencing a similar squeeze in their balance of international
      trade and payments. The dollar’s exchange rate already has been soaring against
      their currencies as a result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, attracting
      investment funds from Europe and other countries. A rising dollar means rising
      import prices for oil and raw materials denominated in dollars.


      Canada faces a similar balance-of-payments squeeze. Its counterpart to Mexico’s
      maquiladora plants are its auto-parts plants in Windsor, across the river from
      Detroit. In the 1970s the two countries agreed on the Auto Pact, allocating what
      assembly plants would work on in their joint production of U.S. autos and trucks.


      Well, “agreed on” may not be the appropriate verb. I was in Ottawa at the time,
      and Canadian government officials were very resentful at being assigned the short
      end of the auto deal. But it is still going today, 50 years later, and remains
      a major contributor to Canada’s trade balance and hence the exchange rate of its
      dollar, which already has been falling against that of the United States.


      Of course, Canada is no Mexico. The thought of it suspending payment on its dollar
      bonds is unthinkable, in a country run largely by its banks and financial interests.
      But the political consequences will be felt throughout Canadian politics. There
      will be an anti-American feeling (always bubbling under the surface in Canada)
      that should end Trump’s fantasy of making Canada the 51st state.


      The implicit moral foundations of the international economic order


      There is a basic illusory moral principle at work in Trump’s tariff and trade
      threats, and it underlies the broad narrative by which the United States has sought
      to rationalize its unipolar domination of the world economy. That principle is
      the illusion of reciprocity supporting a mutual distribution of benefits and growth
      – and in the American vocabulary, it is wrapped together with democratic values
      and patter talk about free markets promising automatic stabilizers under the U.S.-sponsored
      international system.


      The principles of reciprocity and stability were central to the economic arguments
      made by John Maynard Keynes during the debate in the late 1920s, over U.S. insistence
      that its European wartime allies pay heavy debts for arms bought from the United
      States before its formal entry into World War One.


      The Allies agreed to pay by imposing reparations on Germany, to shift the cost
      onto the war’s loser. But the demands by the United States on its European allies,
      and in turn by them on Germany, were far beyond the ability to be met.


      The fundamental problem, Keynes explained, was that the United States was raising
      its tariffs against Germany in response to its currency depreciating, and then
      it imposed the Smoot-Hawley tariff against the rest of the world. That prevented
      Germany from earning the hard currency to pay the allies, and for them to pay
      America.


      To make the international financial system of debt service work, Keynes pointed
      out, a creditor nation has an obligation to provide debtor countries with the
      opportunity to raise the money to pay by exporting to the creditor nation. Otherwise,
      there will be currency collapse and crippling austerity for debtors.


      This basic principle should be at the heart of any design for how the international
      economy should be organized with checks and balances to prevent such collapse.


      Opponents of Keynes – such as the French anti-German monetarist Jacques Rueff
      and the neoclassical trade advocate Bertil Ohlin – repeated the same argument
      that David Ricardo laid out in his 1809-1810 testimony before Britain’s Bullion
      Committee. He claimed that paying foreign debts automatically creates a balance
      in international payments. This junk-economic theory provided a logic that remains
      the basic IMF austerity model today.


      According to this theory’s fantasy, when paying debt service lowers prices and
      wages in the debt-paying country, that will increase its exports by making them
      less costly to foreigners. And supposedly, the receipt of debt service by creditor
      nations will be monetized to raise its own prices (according to the Quantity Theory
      of Money), thereby reducing its exports.


      This price shift is supposed to continue until the debtor country suffering a
      monetary outflow and austerity is able to export enough to afford to pay its foreign
      creditors.


      But the United States did not permit foreign imports to compete with its own producers.
      And for debtors, the price of monetary austerity was not more competitive export
      production but economic disruption and chaos.


      Ricardo’s model and U.S. neoclassical theory were simply an excuse for hard-line
      creditor policy. Structural adjustments or austerity have been devastating to
      the economies and governments on which they has been imposed. Austerity reduces
      productivity and output.


      In 1944, when Keynes was trying to resist the U.S. demand for foreign trade and
      monetary subservience at the Bretton Woods conference, he proposed the Bancor,
      an intergovernmental balance-of-payments arrangement calling for chronic creditor
      nations (namely, the United States) to lose their accumulation of financial claims
      on debtor countries (such as Britain would become).


      That would be the price to be paid to prevent the international financial order
      from polarizing the world between creditor and debtor countries. Creditors had
      to enable debtors to pay, or lose their financial claims for payment.


      Keynes also emphasized that, if creditors want to be paid, they have to import
      from the debtor countries to provide them with the ability to pay.


      This was a profoundly moral policy, and it had an additional benefit of making
      economic sense. It would enable both parties to prosper instead of having one
      creditor nation prosper while debtor countries succumbed to austerity, preventing
      them from investing in, modernizing, and developing their economies by raising
      social spending and living standards.


      Under Donald Trump, the United States is violating that principle. There is no
      Keynesian Bancor-type arrangement in place, but there are the harsh America First
      realities of its unipolar diplomacy.


      If Mexico is to save its economy from being plunged into austerity, price inflation,
      unemployment, and social chaos, it will have to suspend its payments on foreign
      debts denominated in dollars.


      The same principle applies to other Global South countries. And if they act together,
      they have a moral position to create a realistic and even inevitable narrative
      of the preconditions for any stable international economic order to function.


      Circumstances thus are forcing the world to break away from the U.S.-centered
      financial order. The U.S. dollar’s exchange rate is going to soar in the short
      term, as a result of Trump blocking imports with tariffs and trade sanctions.


      This exchange-rate shift will squeeze foreign countries owing dollar debts in
      the same way that Mexico and Canada are to be squeezed. To protect themselves,
      they must suspend dollar debt service.


      This response to today’s debt overhead is not based on the concept of odious debts.
      It goes beyond the critique that many of these debts and their terms of payment
      were not in the interest of the countries on which these debts were imposed on
      in the first place. It goes beyond the criticism that lenders must have some responsibility
      for judging the ability of their debtors to pay – or suffer financial losses if
      they have not done so.


      The political problem of the world’s overhang of dollar debts is that the United
      States is acting in a way that prevents debtor countries from earning the money
      to pay foreign debts denominated in US dollars.


      U.S. policy thus poses a threat to all creditors denominating their debts in dollars,
      by making these debts practically unpayable without destroying their own economies.


      The U.S. policy assumption that other countries will not respond to its economic
      aggression


      Does Trump really know what he’s doing? Or is his careening policy simply causing
      collateral damage for other countries?


      I think that what’s at work is a deep and basic internal contradiction of U.S.
      policy, similar to that of U.S. diplomacy in the 1920s. When Trump promised his
      voters that the United States must be the “winner” in any international trade
      or financial agreement, he is declaring economic war on the rest of the world.


      Trump is telling the rest of the world that they must be losers – and accept the
      fact graciously in payment for the military protection that it provides the world,
      in case Russia might invade Europe or China might send its army into Taiwan, Japan,
      or elsewhere.


      The fantasy is that Russia would have anything to gain in having to support a
      collapsing European economy, or that China decides to compete militarily instead
      of economically.


      Hubris is at work in this dystopian fantasy. As the world’s hegemon, diplomacy
      in the U.S. rarely takes account of how foreign countries will respond. The essence
      of its hubris is to simplistically assume that countries will passively submit
      to U.S. actions with no blowback. That has been a realistic assumption for countries
      like Germany, or those with similar U.S. client politicians in office.


      But what is happening today is system-wide in character. In 1931 there was finally
      a moratorium declared on Inter-Ally debts and German reparations. But that was
      two years after the 1929 stock market crash and the earlier hyperinflations in
      Germany and France.


      Along similar lines, the 1980s saw Latin American debts written down by Brady
      bonds. In both cases, international finance was the key to the system’s overall
      political and military breakdown, because the world economy had become self-destructively
      financialized.


      Something similar seems inevitable today. Any workable alternative involves creating
      a new world economic system.


      U.S. domestic politics is equally unstable. Trump’s America First political theater
      that got him elected may get his gang unseated, as the contradictions and consequences
      of their operating philosophy are recognized and replaced.


      His tariff policy will accelerate U.S. price inflation and, even more fatally,
      cause chaos in U.S. and foreign financial markets. Supply chains will be disrupted,
      interrupting U.S. exports of everything from aircraft to information technology.
      And other countries will find themselves obliged to make their economies no longer
      dependent on U.S. exports or dollar credit.


      Perhaps in the long-term view this would not be a bad thing. The problem is in
      the short run, as supply chains, trade patterns, and dependency are replaced as
      part of the new geopolitical economic order that U.S. policy is forcing other
      countries to develop.


      Trump bases his attempt to tear up the existing linkages and reciprocity of international
      trade and finance on the assumption that, in a chaotic grab-bag, America will
      come out on top. That confidence underlies his willingness to pull out today’s
      geopolitical interconnections.


      He thinks that the U.S. economy is like a cosmic black hole, that is, a center
      of gravity able to pull all the world’s money and economic surplus to itself.
      That is the explicit aim of America First. That is what makes Trump’s program
      a declaration of economic war on the rest of the world.


      There is no longer a promise that the economic order sponsored by U.S. diplomacy
      will make other countries prosperous. The gains from trade and foreign investment
      are to be sent to and concentrated in America.


      The problem goes beyond Trump. He is simply following what already has been implicit
      in U.S. policy since 1945.


      America’s self-image is that it is the only economy in the world that can be thoroughly
      self-sufficient economically. It produces its own energy, and also its own food,
      and supplies these basic needs to other countries, or has the ability to turn
      off the spigot.


      Most important, the United States is the only economy without the financial constraints
      that constrain other countries. America’s debt is in its own currency, and there
      has been no limit on its ability to spend beyond its means by flooding the world
      with excess dollars, which other countries accept as their monetary reserves as
      if the dollar is still as good as gold.


      Underneath it all is the assumption that, almost with a flick of the switch, the
      United States can become as industrially self-sufficient as it was in 1945. America
      is the world’s Blanche duBois in Tennessee Williams’ Streetcar Named Desire, living
      in the past while not aging well.


      The American empire’s self-serving neoliberal narrative


      To obtain foreign acquiescence in accepting an empire and living peacefully in
      it requires a soothing narrative to depict the empire as pulling everyone ahead.
      The aim is to distract other countries from resisting a system that actually is
      exploitative.


      First Britain and then the United States promoted the ideology of free-trade imperialism,
      after their mercantilist and protectionist policies had given them a cost advantage
      over other countries, turning these countries into commercial and financial satellites.


      Trump has pulled away this ideological curtain. Partly this is simply in recognition
      that it no longer can be maintained in the face of U.S.-NATO foreign policy and
      its military and economic war against Russia and sanctions against trade with
      China, Russia, Iran, and other BRICS members.


      It would be madness for other countries not to reject this system, now that its
      empowering narrative is false for all to see.


      The question is, how will they be able to put themselves in a position to create
      an alternative world order? What is the likely trajectory?


      Countries like Mexico really don’t have much of a choice but to go it alone. Canada
      may succumb, letting its exchange rate fall and its domestic prices rise as its
      imports are denominated in “hard currency” dollars.


      But many Global South countries are in the same balance-of-payments squeeze as
      Mexico. And unless they have client elites like Argentina – its elites being themselves
      major holders of Argentina’s dollar bonds – their political leaders will have
      to stop debt payments or suffer domestic austerity (deflation of the local economy),
      coupled with inflation of import prices as the exchange rates for their currencies
      buckle under the strains imposed by a rising U.S. dollar. They will have to suspend
      debt service or else be voted out of office.


      Not many leading politicians have the leeway that Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena
      Baerbock has, of saying that her Green Party does not have to listen to what German
      voters say they want. Global South oligarchies may rely on U.S. support, but Germany
      is certainly an outlier when it comes to being willing to commit economic suicide
      out of loyalty to U.S. foreign policy without limit.


      Suspending debt service is less destructive than continuing to succumb to the
      Trump-based America First order. What blocks that policy is political, along with
      a centrist fear of embarking on the major policy change necessary to avoid economic
      polarization and austerity.


      Europe seems afraid to use the option of simply calling Trump’s bluff, despite
      it being an empty threat that would be blocked by America’s own vested interests
      among the donor class.


      Trump has stated that if other NATO members do not agree to spend 5% of their
      GDP on military arms (largely from the United States) and buy more US liquid natural
      gas (LNG), he will impose tariffs of 20% on them.


      But if European leaders do not resist, the euro will fall perhaps by 10-20%. Domestic
      prices will rise, and national budgets will have to cut back social spending programs
      such as support for families to buy more expensive gas or electricity to heat
      and power their homes.


      America’s neoliberal leaders welcome this class-war phase of U.S. demands on foreign
      governments. U.S. diplomacy has been active in crippling the political leadership
      of former labor and social democratic parties in Europe and other countries so
      thoroughly that it no longer seems to matter what voters want.


      That is what America’s National Endowment Democracy (NED) is for, along with its
      mainstream media.


      But what is being shaken up is not merely America’s unipolar dominance of the
      West and its sphere of influence, but the worldwide structure of international
      trade and financial relations – and inevitably, military relations and alliances
      as well.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article draws parallels between the Hollywood films featuring
      Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, where one character sacrifices the other for personal
      gain, and the current geopolitical dynamics involving the U.S. and Germany, suggesting
      that the U.S. is exploiting Germany's vulnerabilities through economic policies
      that could lead to significant damage to both Germany's economy and the global
      balance of payments, ultimately resulting in chaos rather than a happy resolution.
    paragraph_summary: The article draws parallels between the comedic films of Bing
      Crosby and Bob Hope in the 1940s and the current geopolitical dynamics involving
      the United States and Germany, framing the latter as a "Road to Chaos." It critiques
      U.S. policies under Donald Trump, particularly the destruction of the Nord Stream
      pipeline and aggressive tariff threats, which are seen as detrimental to Germany
      and other countries, leading to economic instability and potential defaults on
      dollar-denominated debts. The author argues that Trump's approach reflects a hubristic
      belief that the U.S. can dominate the global economy without considering the repercussions
      for other nations, which may ultimately lead to a breakdown of the existing international
      financial order. The article suggests that as countries like Mexico and Canada
      face economic pressures from U.S. policies, they may be forced to suspend debt
      payments, creating a need for a new global economic system that recognizes the
      moral obligations of creditor nations to support their debtors.
