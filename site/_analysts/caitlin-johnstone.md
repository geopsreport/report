summary: |
  Amid ongoing upheaval in the Middle East and intensifying Western political polarization, the latest developments highlight a deepening crackdown on dissent and a hardening of official narratives regarding Israel and Palestine.
  
  Most recently, British authorities have escalated their response to anti-genocide activism, arresting protesters associated with Palestine Action and formally designating the group as a terrorist organization. **Caitlin Johnstone** notes that this move signals a “troubling narrative where peace advocates are criminalized while those perpetrating violence are protected.” The criminalization of nonviolent protest marks a significant shift in Western policy, with implications for civil liberties and the broader legitimacy of pro-Palestinian activism across Europe.
  
  Concurrently, the cultural landscape in the West is undergoing a transformation. The 2025 Glastonbury Festival became a focal point for this shift, as artists like Bob Vylan openly expressed solidarity with Palestine. According to **Johnstone**, this reflects “a growing rebellion in western counterculture against Israel’s actions,” suggesting that grassroots opposition is not only persisting but gaining momentum despite official suppression.
  
  On the geopolitical front, the underlying causes of Israel’s actions remain a subject of intense debate. The latest edition of JOHNSTONE magazine challenges the prevailing narrative that current Israeli policies are aberrations tied to extremist leadership. Instead, **Johnstone** argues these behaviors are “rooted in the state’s foundational ethnosupremacist ideology,” indicating that meaningful change is unlikely without a fundamental re-examination of Israel’s identity and policies.
  
  Looking ahead, the trend toward criminalizing dissent in Western countries is expected to intensify, with high confidence that further restrictions on pro-Palestinian activism will be implemented. Simultaneously, there is a high chance that countercultural resistance will continue to grow, potentially leading to broader societal divisions. The ideological entrenchment of Israeli policy, as described by **Johnstone**, suggests that international pressure alone is unlikely to produce substantive change in the near term. Most definitely, the polarization around these issues will define Western political and cultural discourse for the foreseeable future.

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now British police have been arresting anti-genocide
      protesters for holding signs expressing support for activist group Palestine Action,
      which London has now officially designated a terrorist group for putting red paint
      on war planes that were being used in the Gaza holocaust. That’s right, welcome
      to the empire, where peace activists are called terrorists, where hospitals are
      called military bases, where facts are called blood libel, where people opposing
      genocide are called hateful Nazis, where genocidal soldiers are a protected group
      and chanting for their death is a hate crime. ❖ Israeli outlet Haaretz has published
      an article titled “ Now I Understand Why Israel Is Denying Journalists Access
      to the Appalling Scene in Gaza ” by a French historian named Jean-Pierre Filiu,
      who spent a month in the killing fields of the ruined Palestinian territory after
      entering with a busload of French physicians. Israel has banned journalists from
      Gaza in order to hide its war crimes, making doctors and other specialists the
      de facto western reporters on the ground. And they’re all reporting the same thing
      about what they are seeing. ❖ https://x.com/caitoz/status/1941166811120345523
      ❖ Part of the problem is how normies who don’t follow this stuff closely cannot
      believe Israel could be as evil as we’re saying it is. They’re often like “Oh
      yeah right, they’re just killing civilians because they’re evil and want Palestinians
      to die.” Which would make sense as an objection if you hadn’t been following Israel’s
      pattern of behavior from day to day and weren’t familiar with the way Israelis
      talk about Palestinians whenever they’re speaking to each other in Hebrew instead
      of addressing the western press. Israel’s public image is somewhat protected by
      the fact that its behavior is so profoundly evil that simply talking about it
      strains credulity among the uninformed, in the same way you sound like a crazy
      conspiracy theorist if you talk about some of the things the CIA has openly admitted
      to doing in the past. Many people literally cannot believe anyone could be as
      evil as Israel is, so the true extent of their crimes go unseen. ❖ I’ve decided
      I’m never going to click on another Piers Morgan Uncensored video. He’s just a
      shitty western empire stooge playing Jerry Springer with people’s outrage over
      the worst things in the world and pretending to be impartial while generating
      viral online video clips fueled by rage and partisan echo chamber amplification.
      It occasionally looks edifying, but it’s really a symptom of some of the most
      diseased aspects of this civilization, like Mr Beast. The man is a parasite feasting
      on the vitriolic energy of these dark and troubling times, directly profiting
      from the immense suffering caused by the empire he serves. ❖ The western public
      has stopped viewing Palestine as an intimidating issue to speak out about, and
      it’s causing a major problem for the Israel PR machine. One of the biggest obstacles
      for the pro-Palestine movement used to be the way Israel-Palestine was incorrectly
      regarded as a super complex issue that the average busy member of the public can’t
      hope to understand. That’s changing now because a live-streamed genocide is straightforward
      enough to override the “No you don’t understand what’s happening because words,
      words, words” schtick that Israel apologists always use to shut people down, but
      for a long time the hasbarists were able to intimidate people into silence just
      by knowing a bunch of clever talking points that the average casual observer would
      struggle to come up with answers for. https://x.com/FarOutMag/status/1938999362912129329
      One of my favorite clips from the Glastonbury Festival came from Australian band
      Amyl and the Sniffers, whose vocalist Amy Taylor gave an off-the-cuff speech about
      Palestine and colonialism and the parallels between what white colonizers did
      to Indigenous Australians and what’s happening to the Palestinians today. It wasn’t
      a perfect or super eloquent speech by Taylor’s own admission, but it was passionate
      and it got the point across. At the end she said, “That’s the truth and I thought
      I’d share that today. It was gonna be something way more poetic but that’s just
      what I said; it’s not perfect but I think it’s better to say anything than to
      say nothing at all right now.” More and more people are seeing this when it comes
      to Gaza — that it’s better to say anything than to say nothing at all right now.
      You don’t have to be an expert. You don’t have to know everything there is to
      know about about the apartheid state of Israel and the history of the Zionist
      project. You know what you’re seeing and you know it’s wrong, and that’s enough.
      Don’t let anyone intimidate you into being silent on the defining issue of our
      times. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

      Palestine Action, now labeled a terrorist group for their activism, highlighting
      a troubling narrative where peace advocates are criminalized while those perpetrating

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the recent arrests of anti-genocide protesters
      in Britain for supporting Palestine Action, which has been labeled a terrorist
      group by the UK for its actions against military planes involved in the Gaza conflict.
      It highlights the troubling narrative where peace activists are branded as terrorists,
      while those committing violence are protected. The piece references a Haaretz
      article by historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, who, after witnessing the devastation
      in Gaza with a group of French doctors, underscores the Israeli government's efforts
      to restrict journalist access to conceal its alleged war crimes. The author argues
      that many people struggle to accept the severity of Israel's actions due to a
      lack of awareness about the ongoing situation and the stark contrast between the
      reality on the ground and the narratives presented in the media.

      at is the only thing Israel could ever have been. What we are seeing from Israel
      today is the inevitable outcome of the ethnosupremacist, hypermilitaristic, psychopathic
      ideology upon which the state was founded. Israel’s horrific abuses in Gaza, the

      was planted after the second world war. Netanyahu didn’t make Israel the way it

      Everyone’s still talking about Bob Vylan, and rightly so. A crowd full of westerners
      happily being led through a chant of “Death, death to the IDF” at the 2025 Glastonbury
      Festival was a historical landmark moment for the 21st century, and the group’s
      persecution at the hands of western governments is once again highlighting the
      way our society’s purported values of free thought and free expression go right
      out the window wherever Israel is concerned. But one thing that’s not getting
      enough attention is the fact that many, many other acts also spoke out in support
      of Palestine at that same festival, and that the crowd was full of attendees waving
      Palestinian flags. Supporting Palestine and opposing Israel’s genocidal atrocities
      is just what’s cool now. This is a massive cultural development, because it means
      we are seeing the emergence of actual, meaningful rebellion in western counterculture
      for the first time arguably since the Vietnam War. The artists and their fans
      aren’t just talking the talk of sticking it to the establishment anymore. https://x.com/desigotdone/status/1940685023071641733
      For generations the ruling class has been successfully stomping out all politically
      relevant counterculture, first in the form of direct frontal assault by official
      government operations like COINTELPRO , and then by the way all major platforms
      and studios are owned by plutocrats who benefit from the imperial status quo and
      refuse to elevate anyone who might pose a threat to it. There have of course been
      countless artists in every generation who put on a rebellious face and give the
      finger to authority, but they’ve never presented any kind of threat to real power.
      Punk rockers who sing “fuck the man” but never advance any actual tangible causes.
      Satanic panic bands and shock rock superstars scaring church ladies and stirring
      culture wars. Bands voicing criticisms of the Iraq invasion but making it about
      supporting the Democratic Party. Celebrity musicians promoting social justice
      and equality without ever saying anything that might inconvenience the oligarchs
      and empire managers who rule our world. The rich and powerful don’t care if you
      dye your hair or pierce your nose or kiss a member of the same sex or say Hail
      Satan. They don’t care if you support one mainstream political faction over the
      other, or if you yell empty words about anarchy and revolution that aren’t pointed
      toward any real material goals. They care very much, however, if you are undermining
      public consent for military and geopolitical agendas they’ve worked very hard
      to propagandize the public into accepting. The establishment never dropped the
      hammer on Marilyn Manson. Lady Gaga never ran into trouble with the state for
      singing that gay people are Born This Way. Ozzy Osbourne is living in the lap
      of luxury with an estimated net worth of $220 million. But groups like Kneecap
      and Bob Vylan are being subjected to police investigations and visa revocations
      for taking a stand on Palestine. Which, of course, is only going to make their
      position more popular among young people with a defiant streak in them. It’s hard
      to imagine how western governments could make support for Palestine look more
      attractive to western youths, really. Here’s this unimaginably horrific mass atrocity
      that they can all watch unfolding on their phone screens in real time every single
      day of the year, and they’re being told “You’re not allowed to oppose this. We,
      the stuffed shirts in Washington and London, command you to obey. If you think
      unauthorized thoughts and chant unauthorized chants, we are going to get very
      huffy and upset.” I mean, can you think of anything more fun? This is after all
      the generation who’s been told that they need to accept being poorer and sicker
      than their parents and grandparents and that they’ll never own a home no matter
      what they do, knowing full well that the crusty old bastards finger-wagging at
      them for opposing an active genocide are the same freaks who’ve refused to do
      anything to steer their planet’s ecosystem away from looming disaster. They have
      every reason to want to express defiance, and nothing to lose by doing so. A real,
      politically meaningful counterculture has been born in the western world, and
      our rulers are already showing us that they’re afraid of it. This is a fascinating
      time to be alive. __________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      expressing solidarity with Palestine and attendees waving Palestinian flags, indicates
      a growing rebellion against the establishment, reminiscent of the anti-establishment

      a meaningful change in how artists and their audiences engage with political issues,
      contrasting it with past generations where rebellious expressions often lacked
      real impact on power structures. The piece highlights the challenges faced by
      artists in a system dominated by wealthy elites who suppress politically relevant
      counterculture, yet suggests that the current wave of support for Palestine signifies
      a potential shift towards more genuine activism in music and popular culture.

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now My God Israel supporters are exhausting.
      I’ve never gotten used to it. “Wahh, Zohran Mamdani wants to murder Jews!” “Wahh,
      the musician hurt the IDF’s feelings!” Shut up. Shut up. Shut the whole entire
      fuck up. Everyone is sick of your bullshit. There is a genocide happening. A genocide.
      Babies are being starved . IDF soldiers are telling the Israeli press that they’re
      being ordered to massacre desperately hungry civilians at aid sites. There are
      vast stretches of the Gaza Strip that now look like the surface of the moon. Trump
      and Netanyahu are openly working to purge the Palestinian territory of Palestinians
      so the land can be permanently taken from them. Your feelings don’t matter. The
      world does not revolve around you and your feelings. Your emotional response to
      whatever made up nonsense you’re choosing to have a melodramatic tantrum about
      today is completely irrelevant. Every single Palestinian who died today, individually,
      matters infinitely more than every feeling you’ve ever felt about every imaginary
      phantom you’ve pretended to feel threatened by. Anyone who has had the misfortune
      of knowing a manipulative narcissist has seen all these patterns before. The self-centeredness.
      The hypocrisy. The horrific abuse, followed by collapsing into blubbering victimhood
      the second the abuse is called out. The aggressive efforts to control the narrative
      and frame all critics and rivals as evil monsters. It’s a very familiar playbook.
      My hope for our world is that we one day become so emotionally and psychologically
      healthy that such cynical manipulations stand out like a white cloud against a
      deep blue sky. That we become so caring, understanding and supportive of our fellow
      human beings that the needful get everything they require to lead a fulfilling
      life, while sociopathy and psychopathy become as alienating and disadvantageous
      as chronic schizophrenia is today. That we become so tender-hearted that genocide
      can never rear its ugly head on this planet again, and all the abusive dynamics
      which made the Gaza holocaust possible fade away like darkness in the rising sun.
      https://x.com/caitoz/status/1940162165996228799 ❖ The real story is not that one
      musical act said “death to the IDF” at Glastonbury Festival, the real story is
      that a huge number of acts spoke out in support of Palestine at Glastonbury Festival.
      They’re just making the story about one of those acts hoping you won’t notice
      that supporting Palestine and opposing Israel is what’s popular and cool now.
      ❖ It’s so funny when people accuse me of “bias” when I talk about Gaza. Like oh
      no I’m not being neutral enough about the active genocide, I’m so sorry. ❖ Israel
      is making it abundantly clear that it’s going to keep doing everything it can
      to instigate a war between the US and Iran, and the Washington swamp is crawling
      with war sluts who are pushing in the same direction. Trump’s cabinet is full
      of Iran hawks , and Trump himself has publicly confessed to being bought and owned
      by the world’s richest Israeli, Miriam Adelson. Israel will not stop pushing for
      a full-scale American regime change war until it gets it. It will keep pushing
      and pushing and pushing, because there’s nothing stopping it from doing so. It
      has too much to gain and too little to lose, since the political layout in Official
      Washington and the parapolitical layout in the unelected deep state largely aligns
      with this goal as well. The warmongers will keep trying, and if they fail next
      time, they will try again. Nobody with any real power is doing anything to permanently
      shut this warmongering down and lock it away; at most they’re just postponing
      it a bit until the next moment of demented brinkmanship occurs. What this means
      is that anyone in the United States who doesn’t want this war to happen needs
      to get much, much more hostile toward all the elements that are seeking to bring
      it about. Support for Israel needs to become politically toxic. A complete abandonment
      of Washington’s status quo approach to the middle east must be demanded. A robust
      peace movement needs to emerge. The people in power aren’t pushing back against
      this mad shove toward war, so the pushback is going to have to come from the American
      people themselves. It will not happen from the top down, so it’s going to have
      to come from the bottom up, or it’s not going to come at all. That’s the only
      thing that will stop this looming nightmare from being inflicted upon our world.

      Honestly at this point they should just get Netanyahu his own room in the White
      House and a desk in the Oval Office. The prime minister of Israel is taking his
      third trip to the White House in the five months since Trump has been back in
      office. I have immediate blood family members who I love with all my heart and
      visit less often than this. This comes as the Trump administration revokes the
      US visas of British punk rap duo Bob Vylan ahead of a US tour for chanting “Death,
      death to the IDF” at a concert in the UK. Trump’s sycophantic supporters who spent
      years complaining that their free speech rights were under assault appear fine
      with their government deciding what words Americans are allowed to hear in their
      own country. https://x.com/IbaraEleven/status/1939732311769317699 This also comes
      as Trump actively intervenes in the Israeli judicial system to prevent Netanyahu’s
      corruption trial from moving forward. The president has repeatedly taken to social
      media to demand that Israel abandon its corruption case against the prime minister,
      at one point even implying that the US could cut off arms supplies if his trial
      isn’t canceled. “The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year,
      far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel,” Trump said.
      “We are not going to stand for this. We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister
      Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI
      GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!” It’s so revealing what the US government is and
      is not willing to threaten conditioning military supplies on, and what it’s willing
      to interfere in Israel’s affairs to accomplish. Ever since the Gaza holocaust
      began we’ve been hearing lines like “ Israel is a sovereign country ” and “ Israel
      is a sovereign state that makes its own decisions ” when reporters ask why the
      White House doesn’t leverage arms shipments to demand more humanitarian treatment
      for civilians in the Gaza Strip. But the president of the United States is willing
      to leverage those same arms shipments to directly interfere in Israeli legal proceedings
      which have nothing to do with the US government in order to get Netanyahu out
      of trouble. https://x.com/AssalRad/status/1843718880868565333 And it would appear
      that the president’s intervention has been successful; Netanyahu’s corruption
      trial has since been postponed . When it comes to committing genocide using American
      weapons funded by American taxpayers, Israel is a sovereign state upon which the
      US can exert zero leverage or control. When it comes to meddling in the corruption
      trial of a man who is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court,
      the White House pulls no punches in protecting its favorite genocide monster.
      There is no meaningful separation between the US and Israeli governments. They’re
      two member states in the undeclared empire that sprawls across the entire western
      world, and Trump and Netanyahu are two of the most depraved and most consequential
      managers of this empire today. They are thick as thieves. They are partners in
      crime. Call it the Trumpanyahu administration. ________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter

      I still can’t get over how we’re being asked to pretend “Death, death to the IDF”
      is some kind of hate crime at the exact same time IDF soldiers are telling the
      Israeli press they’re being ordered to massacre starving civilians at aid sites.
      I’ve been seeing a number of people arguing that it’s wrong to say “death to the
      IDF” because soldiers aren’t to be blamed for the criminality of their government.
      This framing is only accepted in the west because western soldiers also do evil
      things that our society needs to make up excuses for. As an aside, “Death, death
      to the IDF” is an insanely catchy earworm. Been dancing around in my mind all
      day. ❖ Deliberately starving a civilian population and then setting up aid sites
      as a death trap to massacre starving people trying to get food is too evil to
      wrap your mind around. If we saw a supervillain doing this in a movie we’d think
      it was dumb, because it wouldn’t be believable. ❖ It’s like everyone’s standing
      around watching a man beat a small child to death at a restaurant. “Should we
      do something?” someone asks. “You saw the kid throw food at the guy,” someone
      replies. “The man has a right to defend himself.” “But he’s killing him!” “It’s
      a fight. Bad things happen in a fight.” “Yeah, the boy shouldn’t have started
      a fight he can’t win.” “You’re actually being quite hateful right now.” And sure,
      maybe it’s true the child did set the man off by throwing food at him. Maybe the
      child did so fully knowing that it would send the man into a murderous rage, because
      the man had been horrifically abusing the child his entire life. Maybe instigating
      a physical confrontation in full view of the public was the child’s last desperate
      attempt to expose the man’s depravity, in the hope that everyone would finally
      see what’s happening and do something to stop the abuse. But nobody’s stopping
      it, because the man has spent years charming and befriending everyone in town — or
      frightening and intimidating them if that’s easier. So now everyone’s watching
      a grown man beat a child to death and pretending they’re watching a fight, when
      they all know deep down what they’re really watching is a cold-blooded murder
      by a cold-hearted man, who should have been stopped and locked away a long time
      ago. ❖ The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is saying that Iran
      could probably start enriching uranium again within a few months, which Iran has
      said it plans to do, and which Trump has said will result in another US bombing
      assault. Trumpers tried to argue that the bombing of Iran was a brilliant strategic
      maneuver to avoid full-scale war, when it appears to have only made such a war
      much more likely. Now the president is saying he’ll bomb Iran again if it resumes
      enriching uranium, something it will probably be able to do quite soon, after
      giving Iran every reason to start actively seeking a nuclear weapon. When Iran
      hawks were arguing against the JCPOA (the Iran nuclear deal laid out during the
      Obama administration), one of their most common talking points was that it was
      “ kicking the can down the road ” to a nuclear-armed Iran in the future. In reality
      the JCPOA was a remarkable feat of international diplomacy that could have avoided
      all these needless escalations, and it is Trump and the Iran hawks who have been
      kicking the can down the road to full-scale war with Iran (if Iran doesn’t get
      nukes first). There’s a lot to despise Trump for, but spending both of his terms
      setting the US on a trajectory toward war with Iran ranks right up around the
      top of the list. The JCPOA was working fine, but Trump shredded it in 2018 to
      set us on this path that is only getting darker and darker at a faster and faster
      pace. Trump chose that course of action to implement his “maximum pressure campaign”
      on Iran. Trump chose to assassinate Soleimani. Trump chose to bomb Iran. Everything
      that happens from here on out is Trump’s fault. _____________________ Caitlin’s

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Israel supporters everywhere have been
      in full blown crisis mode for days because, apparently, antisemitism smears have
      stopped working. Zohran Mamdani has won the Democratic Party primary in the New
      York City mayoral race after a frenetic smear campaign to portray him as an antisemite
      for his pro-Palestinian views, and now all the world’s worst people are freaking
      out about it. I’m seeing some intensely rabid Islamophobia throughout public discourse
      in response to Mamdani’s win, the likes of which I haven’t seen since 9/11. All
      this hatred we’re now seeing directed toward Muslims is going to look pretty weird
      after the imperial crosshairs shift to Beijing and all these same people start
      acting super duper concerned about the plight of Muslims in Xinjiang. I never
      get excited about anything that happens in the Democratic Party anymore, but the
      fact that these smears have lost a lot of their power has some encouraging and
      far-reaching implications for western politics in general. Things have come a
      long way since the psyop against Jeremy Corbyn. ❖ The British government has “strongly
      condemned” a live performance on the BBC by rap duo Bob Vylan in which the crowd
      was led through a chant of “Death, death to the IDF.” British police are investigating
      the incident as a potential criminal offense, and Zionists everywhere are treating
      this incident like a second Holocaust. Inside the western empire it’s considered
      offensive and unacceptable to say “death to” a foreign military comprised entirely
      of armed combatants which is presently committing a genocide in full view of the
      entire world. It is not, however considered offensive and unacceptable to commit
      genocide. So, just to be clear — SAYING “death to” the foreign military which
      is presently committing genocide: wrong, unacceptable, outrageous, no. CAUSING
      death to a civilian population because of their ethnicity by that same foreign
      military force: fine, normal, absolutely, yes. ❖ Israeli is not a religion and
      Jewish is not a nationality and anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism and all decent
      people despise the state of Israel. ❖ Hating Israel is one of the most patriotic
      things Americans can do at this point. It’s clear now that Israel is going to
      keep aggressively pushing for a US war against Iran until they get it, and making
      support for Israel politically toxic in the US may be the only thing that can
      prevent them from succeeding. ❖ I don’t like the far right OR the far left. I
      like things to stay in the moderate center, where genocide is fine and people’s
      healthcare money is given to cruise missile manufacturers. ❖ They’re not going
      to let any journalists into Gaza until the whole thing’s been emptied out and
      they’ve hidden all the evidence of their holocaust —  and then they’ll call you
      an antisemitic conspiracy theorist if you say it happened. ❖ I’ve never understood
      the debate about whether or not support for Israel is commanded in the Bible.
      If you think the Bible commands you to support what’s being done in Gaza, then
      throw your Bible in the trash and get a different religion, because it’s plainly
      false and immoral. It is not legitimate to offload your responsibility for your
      own behavior onto your religion. If your religion commanded you to sexually molest
      children, it would be your moral responsibility as a human being to disobey your
      religion and stop following it. Gaza’s no different. ❖ A charismatic pro-Palestinian
      Muslim becoming the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City. Westerners
      chanting “death to the IDF” and having a great time doing it. Israeli soldiers
      confessing their genocidal atrocities in the Israeli press. Israel’s PR stranglehold

      Sometimes I’ll write a headline that looks odd on its face, but then I’ll lay
      out facts and arguments which allow the reader to understand the validity of the
      claim by the end of the essay. This is not one of those times. This headline is
      just me saying the thing that happened. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      and Defense Minister Israel Katz are publicly denouncing a report from an Israeli
      newspaper quoting Israeli soldiers who describe atrocities they were ordered to
      commit in the Israeli military, accusing the report of “blood libels”. The Israeli
      newspaper Haaretz has published an article titled “ ‘It’s a Killing Field’: IDF
      Soldiers Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian
      Aid ”, subtitled “IDF officers and soldiers told Haaretz they were ordered to
      fire at unarmed crowds near food distribution sites in Gaza, even when no threat
      was present. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, prompting the military
      prosecution to call for a review into possible war crimes.” https://x.com/jasonhickel/status/1938507822120972440
      One Israeli soldier attests that civilians seeking aid are “treated like a hostile
      force — no crowd-control measures, no tear gas — just live fire with everything
      imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars.” “We open fire early
      in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters away,
      and sometimes we just charge at them from close range. But there’s no danger to
      the forces,” the soldier says, adding, “I’m not aware of a single instance of
      return fire. There’s no enemy, no weapons.” IDF sources tell Haaretz that Gaza
      has become “a place with its own set of rules” where they are interacting with
      civilians with whom “your only means of interaction is opening fire”. Deadly military
      weapons are used as crowd control to steer the starving populace wherever it’s
      determined they’re supposed to be, routinely killing desperate aid seekers. Another
      soldier describes being instructed to fire artillery shells at a crowd to keep
      them at a distance, saying, “Every time we fire, there are casualties and deaths,
      and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there’s never a good answer. Sometimes,
      merely asking the question annoys the commanders.” In quote after quote after
      quote we read Israeli soldiers describing atrocities they were ordered to commit
      which they knew were wrong. I guess Israel’s PR machine never counted on some
      of the soldiers they sent in to perpetrate the Gaza holocaust having an actual
      conscience. https://x.com/caitoz/status/1938737242354393414 A joint statement
      from Netanyahu and Katz denounced the report, accusing Haaretz of publishing “blood
      libels”. “The State of Israel absolutely rejects the contemptible blood libels
      that have been published in the Ha’aretz newspaper, according to which ‘IDF Soldiers
      Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian Aid.’
      These are malicious falsehoods designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military
      in the world,” the statement reads. “Blood libel ” refers to the way medieval
      Europeans used to falsely accuse Jews of murdering Christian children in blood
      sacrifices — an early form of atrocity propaganda used to justify the persecution
      of Jews. So again, just to be absolutely clear, the leader of the Israeli government
      is claiming that an Israeli newspaper quoting Israeli soldiers describing their
      own atrocities is antisemitic. And that mountains of testimony from inside the
      IDF is “designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military in the world.” What
      can I even say about that here? It speaks for itself. I have nothing to add. The
      more exposed Israel’s criminality becomes, the more absurd the arguments made
      in its defense are getting. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      all those US military bases surrounding China are just a defensive measure to
      contain Beijing’s insanity. Assad just went nuts one day and started slaughtering
      his own people out of nowhere. Gaddafi is a sexual sadist who’s giving Viagra
      to his troops to help them commit mass rapes in Libya. Saddam Hussein is so crazy
      and evil he’s trying to obtain weapons of mass destruction to give Americans another
      9/11. The North Koreans used to be far too insane to be allowed to have nuclear
      weapons because they’d nuke San Francisco immediately, but after they obtained
      nuclear weapons they were miraculously cured of this rare psychological disorder.
      The stories of the western empire ask us to believe that everyone who finds themselves
      in the imperial crosshairs is an irrational actor whose loony behavior can only
      be attributed to some uncontrollable defect within their own minds, or who will
      soon snap and do something nutty if they are not contained by force. One antagonist
      who never appears in these fairy tales of the western empire is the western empire
      itself. In the storytelling of the empire, there is no globe-spanning power structure
      which is constantly inflicting violence and destruction upon populations around
      the world while seeking to crush any nation who disobeys its dictates. It’s just
      a bunch of irrational psychos, seeking nuclear weapons and becoming aggressively
      militaristic for no other reason than because they are crazy, while the totally
      normal alliance led by a totally normal country in North America innocently responds
      to their crazy behavior. That’s the story. In real life, the most aggressive and
      unreasonable actor on the world stage by far is the empire-like power structure
      that is loosely centralized around Washington DC. Nobody else is constantly waging
      wars of aggression around the world. Nobody else is circling the planet with hundreds
      of military bases for the purpose of global domination. Nobody else has spent
      the 21st century killing millions of people and deliberately targeting civilians
      with starvation sanctions in countries on the other side of the planet. Only the
      US-centralized empire has been doing these things. But we are asked to believe
      that this vicious imperial power structure is the only rational actor on earth,
      and that those who resist its aggressions are the crazy ones. And you are told
      that if you can’t see this, then you’re crazy too. You’re a crackpot. A conspiracy
      theorist. A paranoid nutball whose voice should be marginalized and whose ideas
      should be dismissed with a scoff. You are crazy if you don’t believe what the
      world’s craziest power structure says about its enemies being crazy. It is gaslighting
      on a global scale. It is madness, and that is why this civilization has gone mad.
      Let’s hope someone finds a way to protect the world from the insanity of the western
      empire. ______________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the narrative in Western politics that
      portrays adversaries of the U.S. empire as irrational and mentally unstable, suggesting
      that this perspective serves to justify aggressive foreign policies. It highlights
      examples such as Iran, North Korea, and various Middle Eastern groups, framing
      them as "crazy" actors whose actions stem from a supposed psychological defect.
      The author argues that this storytelling conveniently ignores the role of the
      U.S. empire itself as a global power that inflicts violence and seeks to dominate
      other nations, thereby presenting a skewed view of international relations that
      simplifies complex geopolitical dynamics into a tale of good versus evil.

      Dear Israel apologist, There is nothing you can say to me that will make me stop
      opposing Israel’s western-backed atrocities. Call me an antisemite or a Nazi or
      any name you want. The name-calling stopped having any effect a long time ago.
      Babble about October 7 and Hamas and hostages all you wish. I’ve stopped listening
      to you. Pile on as many walls of text as you like explaining why it is actually
      fine and good to bomb hospitals and massacre starving civilians seeking aid. I
      ain’t reading all that, free Palestine. Regurgitate whatever the latest propaganda
      narrative is about Iran or the Houthis or Hezbollah or whichever new war Israel
      is getting ready to start this week. We both know it’s all lies. Parrot whatever’s
      the current hasbara slogan justifying Israel’s genocide in Gaza if you want to.
      Your words have no power here. That’s why your old tricks have stopped working,
      you know: all you have is words. We have truth, facts and morality on our side,
      and you have a bunch of words. We have mountains of raw video footage documenting
      war crimes and mass atrocities. And you have a mountain of words. We have an unshakable
      confidence in our opposition to history’s first live-streamed genocide, and you
      have a river of verbiage. Your weapons don’t work here. This is not a fair fight.
      You are as outmatched as the helpless children being slaughtered by the Israeli
      military. I am going to keep opposing the crimes of Israel and the western sponsors
      of its atrocities. I am going to keep opposing the wars that Israel and its western
      backers are always starting in the middle east. I am going to keep opposing the
      US empire which is fueled by human blood. I am going to keep opposing the western
      media who spread war propaganda and normalize genocide. I am going to keep opposing
      all the systems, institutions and ideologies which have given rise to the Gaza
      holocaust. I am going to keep mocking your manipulations and weakening the power
      of your words. There is nothing you can say to stop me from doing this. There
      is nothing you can say to stop anyone from doing this. Because all you have is
      words. And nobody’s listening anymore. ________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is

      Well it’s been a crazy couple of days. Trump bombed Iran’s civilian nuclear energy
      facilities in an attack that CNN reports did no lasting damage, and Iran exercised
      extraordinary restraint with symbolic retaliatory strikes on US military bases
      coordinated to avoid American casualties — a move many are comparing to Iran’s
      non-lethal response to the US assassination of General Qassem Soleimani in 2020.
      After pumping out deception and fake diplomacy for weeks in order to assist Israel’s
      unprovoked war on Iran and launch an unprovoked attack on his own, Trump took
      to social media to proudly celebrate his administration’s facilitation of a ceasefire
      to the war he himself needlessly started, like an arsonist giving himself a trophy
      for extinguishing one of his own house fires. And, for the moment at least, the
      ceasefire appears to be holding . Which is good. There are a lot of terrible people
      who did everything they could to get Iran to kill US troops and spark a horrific
      war, but Iran didn’t take the bait. Iran doesn’t want war at all. Trump found
      out that Americans disapproved of the airstrikes and opposed war with Iran . And
      Israel found out that fighting an actual military force is a lot less easy than
      fighting hospital patients and children. So for now we’ve got a ceasefire. We
      have never been shown any evidence that Iran was working on obtaining nuclear
      weapons, which given the US empire’s extensive history of lying about this sort
      of thing means we should assume it was not. But it has certainly been given every
      incentive to obtain them now, given that that’s probably the only thing that can
      stop the US and Israel from casually committing these egregious acts of aggression
      whenever they feel like it. And isn’t it interesting how Iran keeps demonstrating
      a degree of restraint that we all know we’d never see from the United States or
      Israel if another country bombed their energy infrastructure or assassinated their
      military leaders, and yet Iran is the country we’re told can never be trusted
      with nuclear weapons? The US empire and Israel both exist in a perpetual state
      of war and attack other countries constantly; Iran never invades other countries
      and avoids war like Melania Trump avoids missionary position. But we’re meant
      to accept that it’s fine for the US and Israel to have nukes and do anything necessary
      to prevent Iran from getting any? Even if you accept the evidence-free premise
      that Iran would do crazy and reckless things if it became a nuclear-armed state,
      there is no rational argument that Trump and his handlers have been going about
      preventing this outcome intelligently. As Joe Lauria explains in Consortium News
      , the Iran nuclear deal was a remarkable achievement of international diplomacy
      that was working fine until Trump shredded it in 2018. Iran was following all
      the agreed upon rules and its nuclear enrichment was capped at 3.67 percent, but
      Trump killed it because the Zionists and warmongers who brought him to power want
      more aggression toward Iran instead of less. It’s so intensely stupid that we
      have to keep doing this horrifying dance every few years just because there are
      too many war-horny freaks with way too much power inside the US empire. And every
      time they get closer to getting their wish. Iran is being given more and more
      reasons to view the US and Israel as an existential threat, more and more motive
      to obtain nuclear weapons, and less and less reason to negotiate anything with
      Washington. These bastards keep pushing us toward something very ugly. Let’s hope
      people keep waking up to the depravity of Israel and the US empire before the
      warmakers succeed in obtaining their long-sought prize. _______________ Caitlin’s

    one_sentence_summary: In a chaotic few days, Trump launched an attack on Iran's
      nuclear facilities, which resulted in minimal damage and prompted a restrained
      Iranian response, while he later claimed credit for facilitating a ceasefire in
      a conflict he instigated, drawing comparisons to an arsonist celebrating the extinguishing

    paragraph_summary: In a recent escalation, Trump ordered airstrikes on Iran's civilian
      nuclear facilities, which reportedly caused no significant damage, while Iran
      responded with restrained, symbolic strikes on US military bases, avoiding American
      casualties. This measured response has drawn comparisons to Iran's reaction to
      the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani in 2020. Despite Trump's attempts
      to frame his administration's actions as facilitating a ceasefire, critics argue
      that he is merely celebrating the aftermath of a conflict he instigated. The current
      ceasefire appears to be holding, reflecting Iran's reluctance for war, contrary
      to the desires of some factions eager to provoke conflict. The article suggests
      that the lack of evidence for Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions, combined with
      the US and Israel's aggressive actions, may push Iran toward pursuing nuclear
      capabilities as a deterrent against future aggression. The piece concludes by
      highlighting Iran's restraint, contrasting it with the aggressive responses typically
      exhibited by the US and Israel.

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Journalist Ken Klippenstein has drawn attention
      to an overlooked remark made by State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce last
      month saying that the United States is “the greatest country on earth, next to
      Israel.” “The pride of being able to be here and do work that facilitates making
      things better for people and in the greatest country on Earth, next to Israel,”
      Bruce told Jewish News Syndicate . “It’s an honor to be able to make a difference
      and to be able to speak in this regard with an administration that I love so much
      and that I feel genuinely represented by.” It’s like this administration is doing
      everything it can to vindicate those who accuse it of being Israel First instead
      of America First. ❖ I feel like we don’t talk enough about the fact that Donald
      Trump publicly admitted to being bought and owned by the richest Israeli on earth,
      Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson. On the campaign trail last year Trump told
      the Israeli American Council Summit that the first time he was president, Miriam
      and her late husband Sheldon “would come into the White House probably almost
      more than anybody, outside of people that work there.” He said they were always
      after something, “always for Israel,” and “as soon as I’d give them something,
      they’d want something else.” He named the US recognition of the occupied Golan
      Heights as part of Israel as one of the gifts he showered the Zionist state with
      to please the Adelsons, who pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his presidential
      campaigns. ❖ It’s hard to focus on Israel’s airstrikes in Lebanon due to Israel’s
      invasion of Syria, which is hard to focus on due to Israel’s atrocities in the
      West Bank, which are hard to focus on due to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, which
      is hard to focus on due to Israel’s war on Iran, which is hard to focus on because
      of America’s war on Iran. ❖ Top Ten dumbest things we’re being asked to believe
      about Iran: 1. That the Iranians want to be bombed. 2. That the guy bombing Iran
      wants peace. 3. That regime change interventionism is a swell idea this time.
      4. That anyone who doesn’t want war with Iran hates Jews. 5. That this time the
      government and the media are telling us the truth about an American war. 6. That
      this time the neocons are smart and correct. 7. That bombing Iran makes it LESS
      likely to try to obtain nukes. 8. That Iran is trying to assassinate the US president
      when all US presidents have the same foreign policy. 9. That Iran (a country that
      never starts wars) cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons, but Israel (a country
      that starts wars constantly) can. 10. That attacking Iran benefits Americans.
      ❖ It blows my mind that there are people trying to argue that Trump does not seek
      war. What do these idiots think the United States would do if another country
      started bombing American energy infrastructure? ❖ I’m trying to get an important
      business deal done, so I firebombed the guy’s house to make him more likely to
      negotiate with me. I just want peace. ❖ The following things are antisemitic:
      - opposing war with Iran - viewing Palestinians as human - opposing genocide -
      Greta Thunberg - peace - journalism - Ms Rachel - truth - critical thinking -
      the UN - Tucker Carlson - Amnesty International - Human Rights Watch - equal rights
      ❖ It’s hilarious that anyone still takes this “antisemitism” schtick seriously.
      Oh no there’s a special group of white people who might get hurt feelings if I
      don’t want to send my kids to invade Iran. ❖ The western world has been on a two-year
      crash course learning all the reasons why the Muslim world has been correct about
      Israel this entire time. ❖ It’s kind of nice to be arguing with George W Bush
      conservatives about US foreign policy again. For the last few years I’ve been
      getting called a Nazi by western Zionists and a Putin-loving fascist by NATO simps;
      it’s refreshing to be hated for the hippie moonbat I actually am for once. ______________

      Bruce told Jewish News Syndicate . “It’s an honor to be able to make a difference
      and to be able to speak in this regard with an administration that I love so much
      and that I feel genuinely represented by.” It’s like this administration is doing
      everything it can to vindicate those who accuse it of being Israel First instead
      of America First. ❖ I feel like we don’t talk enough about the fact that Donald
      Trump publicly admitted to being bought and owned by the richest Israeli on earth,
      Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson. On the campaign trail last year Trump told
      the Israeli American Council Summit that the first time he was president, Miriam
      and her late husband Sheldon “would come into the White House probably almost
      more than anybody, outside of people that work there.” He said they were always
      after something, “always for Israel,” and “as soon as I’d give them something,
      they’d want something else.” He named the US recognition of the occupied Golan
      Heights as part of Israel as one of the gifts he showered the Zionist state with
      to please the Adelsons, who pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his presidential
      campaigns. ❖ It’s hard to focus on Israel’s airstrikes in Lebanon due to Israel’s
      invasion of Syria, which is hard to focus on due to Israel’s atrocities in the
      West Bank, which are hard to focus on due to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, which
      is hard to focus on due to Israel’s war on Iran, which is hard to focus on because
      of America’s war on Iran. ❖ Top Ten dumbest things we’re being asked to believe
      about Iran: 1. That the Iranians want to be bombed. 2. That the guy bombing Iran
      wants peace. 3. That regime change interventionism is a swell idea this time.
      4. That anyone who doesn’t want war with Iran hates Jews. 5. That this time the
      government and the media are telling us the truth about an American war. 6. That
      this time the neocons are smart and correct. 7. That bombing Iran makes it LESS
      likely to try to obtain nukes. 8. That Iran is trying to assassinate the US president
      when all US presidents have the same foreign policy. 9. That Iran (a country that
      never starts wars) cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons, but Israel (a country
      that starts wars constantly) can. 10. That attacking Iran benefits Americans.
      ❖ It blows my mind that there are people trying to argue that Trump does not seek
      war. What do these idiots think the United States would do if another country
      started bombing American energy infrastructure? ❖ I’m trying to get an important
      business deal done, so I firebombed the guy’s house to make him more likely to
      negotiate with me. I just want peace. ❖ The following things are antisemitic:
      - opposing war with Iran - viewing Palestinians as human - opposing genocide -
      Greta Thunberg - peace - journalism - Ms Rachel - truth - critical thinking -
      the UN - Tucker Carlson - Amnesty International - Human Rights Watch - equal rights
      ❖ It’s hilarious that anyone still takes this “antisemitism” schtick seriously.
      Oh no there’s a special group of white people who might get hurt feelings if I
      don’t want to send my kids to invade Iran. ❖ The western world has been on a two-year
      crash course learning all the reasons why the Muslim world has been correct about
      Israel this entire time. ❖ It’s kind of nice to be arguing with George W Bush
      conservatives about US foreign policy again. For the last few years I’ve been
      getting called a Nazi by western Zionists and a Putin-loving fascist by NATO simps;
      it’s refreshing to be hated for the hippie moonbat I actually am for once. ______________

      issues amid ongoing geopolitical turmoil.

      President Trump has a new post on Truth Social that reads as follows: “It’s not
      politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian
      Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change???
      MIGA!!!” Lots to unpack here. First of all, I love how he opens with “It’s not
      politically correct” to support US regime change interventionism. Right away he’s
      trying to frame support for longstanding neoconservative war agendas as part of
      the American right’s culture war against progressivism. He’s telling his base
      that they are actually resisting the Woke Agenda by siding with warmongering swamp
      monsters like Bill Kristol and John Bolton on the issue of regime change war with
      Iran. Secondly, Trump’s endorsement of regime change comes hours after officials
      from his own administration asserted emphatically that the president is not seeking
      regime change in Iran. Vice President JD Vance told the press that the administration
      “has been very clear that we don’t want a regime change,” and Defense Secretary
      Pete Hegseth said Trump’s aggressions toward Iran are “not about regime change” — only
      to have Trump grab his phone and immediately turn them into liars. https://x.com/BillKristol/status/1936924146073563626
      Another interesting choice is Trump’s use of the acronym “MIGA”, which here is
      intended to stand for “Make Iran Great Again”, but has for years been used by
      anti-Israel rightists in the United States for “ Make Israel Great Again” in mockery
      of the Israel-first sentiments within the greater MAGA movement. That he would
      post this acronym at the height of criticisms that his administration is bought
      and owned by Israel is either a sign of being extremely out of touch or an effort
      to manipulate search results on Google. Trump’s post delighted arch neocon Bill
      Kristol, who tweeted “brb — starting up PNAC again” in response. PNAC stands for
      Project for the New American Century , the neoconservative think tank co-founded
      by Kristol which is notorious for its role in pushing Washington toward war with
      Iraq. This is Trump communicating to his hardcore loyalists that it’s time to
      start cheerleading for regime change interventionism in Iran. He’s rolling out
      the George W Bush playbook for regime change war and playing it note for note,
      while still trying to ride the support he garnered with his populist messaging
      about draining the swamp and ending the wars. Now here he is, being applauded
      by the worst swamp creatures in Washington and trying to drum up consent for one
      of the worst wars imaginable. Call him George Dubya Trump. ________________ Caitlin’s

    text: 'Subscribe now Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley)
      : The US military has bombed multiple Iranian nuclear sites on the orders of President
      Trump, immediately putting tens of thousands of US military personnel in the region
      at risk of an Iranian retaliation which can then escalate to full-scale war. Earlier
      this month Iran’s Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh explicitly warned the United
      States that a direct US attack would result in Tehran ordering strikes on US bases
      in the middle east, saying “all US bases are within our reach and we will boldly
      target them in host countries.” In the lead-up to Trump’s act of war on Iran,
      the president told the press that an attack on American troops will mean a harsh
      response from the US, saying, “We’ll come down so hard if they do anything to
      our people. We’ll come down so hard. The gloves are off. I think they know not
      to touch our troops.” Trump reiterated this threat to Iran in his announcement
      of the US attack today. “There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy
      for Iran, far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,” Trump
      said. “Remember, there are many targets left. Tonight’s was the most difficult
      of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly,
      we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of
      them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.” So you can see how we might already
      be on our way toward a war of nightmarish proportions as a result of the president’s
      unprovoked act of aggression. Tehran now has to choose between reestablishing
      deterrence with extreme aggression or opening the floodgates to a whole host of
      existential threats from both outside and inside the country. Add to that the
      possibility of Iran blockading the Strait of Hormuz and the fact that Iran has
      now been strongly incentivized to actually obtain a nuclear weapon, and it looks
      very likely that we are plunging into a situation that could unfold in any number
      of horrific ways. Right now American political discourse is rife with the narrative
      that the US has been “dragged” into Israel’s war, which I reject entirely. Every
      step of the way this entire thing has been signed off on by US leadership. We
      are at this point because Trump and his regime knowingly chose to take us here.
      https://x.com/kenklippenstein/status/1936585741456244801 US troops within reach
      of Iran’s missiles are reportedly being briefed that they can expect to be on
      the receiving end of retaliatory strikes in the coming days. Again, Iran explicitly
      warned it would attack the US military if the US military did the thing it just
      did. If and when these retaliatory strikes come, the warmongers will try to argue
      that this is a valid reason to escalate this war. They will be lying. They chose
      to make this happen. Whatever transpires from this point on is the fault of Donald
      Trump and the unelected thugs he listens to. If US troops are killed, the war
      sluts in Washington and the Pentagon propagandists in the press will list their
      names and bandy about their photos and demand that their deaths be avenged with
      further acts of war — but it will not be Iran’s fault that they died. It will
      be Trump’s fault. It will be the fault of everyone whose decisions led up to bombs
      being dropped on Iranian energy infrastructure, and the fault of everyone who
      put those soldiers in harm’s way. None of this needed to happen. Iran was at the
      negotiating table. The Iran deal was working fine before Trump shredded it to
      put us on this terrible trajectory. The warmongers artificially manufactured this
      situation and knowingly inflicted this horror upon our world. I am really not
      looking forward to all the melodramatic victim-LARPing if and when Iran kills
      US military personnel stationed in west Asia. The US is the only nation on earth
      that can rival Israel in its ability to play the victim when the ball they’ve
      thrown at the wall bounces back. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      or risk facing greater threats, potentially including a blockade of the Strait
      of Hormuz and a renewed push for nuclear armament, indicating a dangerous path
      toward broader conflict.'

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Do Israel’s supporters know it’s over for
      them? Like, they know they’re going to be despised for the rest of their lives,
      right? That they will never, ever live down the fact that they supported a live-streamed
      genocide? And that it will only get worse for them as history clarifies things?
      Surely they must realize this by now. Surely they must realize that nothing they
      do for the rest of their lives will ever be as significant as the fact that they
      played cheerleader for genocide and all of Israel’s demented warmongering, long
      after normal people realized it was the wrong thing to do. That in the eyes of
      the world they will all always be first and foremost someone who supported and
      defended history’s first live-streamed genocide. I wonder what that’s like, knowing
      that about yourself? If that was me maybe I’d be pushing for World War Three as
      well, I dunno. Maybe I’d hope we could turn the whole world into Gaza and let
      the flames wash away human memory of the things we had done. That enough death
      and destruction spread out across enough of the earth would make my crimes look
      small in comparison or something. It won’t work, though. Everyone’s always going
      to remember what they did. Their grandchildren will be disgusted by them. Their
      families will carry their shame for generations. What a terrible way to be. ❖
      The UK will reportedly be designating Palestine Action as a terrorist group for
      spraying British military planes with red paint to protest the genocide in Gaza.
      It says a lot about how backwards and diseased western civilization has become
      when peace activists are designated as terrorists for trying to stop the world’s
      worst acts of terrorism. ❖ Iran is having more and more success with its missile
      strikes on Israel. I am not a military expert, but I’ve been hearing for years
      that Israel doesn’t want to fight Iran because it can’t reliably stop Iran’s missiles.
      Israel of course would have known this, so it looks like the plan was always for
      Israel to get itself into hot water and have the US pull it out. ❖ Iran’s real
      sin is insisting upon its own sovereignty as a nation. That’s why it’s a target
      of the western empire. Giving up sovereignty over its own energy infrastructure
      would be giving up the very thing the Iranians started fighting for in the first
      place all those years ago. They’re not going to do it unless they are forced to,
      otherwise what was the point of resisting absorption into the imperial blob that
      whole time? ❖ I’m supposed to hate a country for saying “Death to America”? I
      yell that during sex. ❖ The only reason they get to call the Gaza holocaust a
      “war” is because they’re using bombs and bullets to do the extermination. If they
      were using gas chambers to kill the same number of people with the exact same
      motive, all it would change is the world’s understanding of what’s happening.
      ❖ War after war after war the western empire has told us it needs to ship off
      our young to go fight evil murderous tyrants, only for the west to wake up to
      the reality that the empire’s dearest ally in the middle east is the most evil,
      murderous and tyrannical regime around. ❖ The idea of war with Iran would be even
      less popular than it is now if the western media hadn’t spent all these years
      referring to Iran’s civilian nuclear energy program as “Iran’s nuclear program”,
      deliberately causing people to assume that Iran is working on nuclear weapons.
      ❖ Friendly reminder that last year the official Democratic Party platform slammed
      Trump for choosing not to go to war with Iran in 2018, 2019 and 2020 during his
      last presidency. Americans aren’t allowed to vote against war. _______________

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      President Trump has twice thrown his own intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard under
      the bus, repeatedly telling the press that the national intelligence director
      was wrong when she told Congress in March that the American spy network does not
      believe Iran is attempting to obtain a nuclear weapon. To be clear, when Gabbard
      made this statement she was not voicing her personal opinion, she was repeating
      verbatim the findings laid out in the 2025 Threat Assessment of the intelligence
      agencies of the United States, which said “We continue to assess Iran is not building
      a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program
      he suspended in 2003, though pressure has probably built on him to do so.” Despite
      this, Trump has been publicly expressing disdain for his intelligence director,
      flatly saying “she’s wrong” when asked about Gabbard’s testimony on Friday, and
      saying “I don’t care what she says” when asked the same question about Gabbard’s
      statement earlier this week. Rather than push back on the president’s crude dismissal,
      Gabbard took to social media to tell everyone that Trump is actually right about
      Iran, and that everyone who thought she said Iran isn’t seeking a nuclear weapon
      is imagining things. “The dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony
      out of context and spreading fake news as a way to manufacture division,” Gabbard
      said on Twitter . “America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it
      can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize
      the assembly. President Trump has been clear that can’t happen, and I agree. My
      full testimony below:” Bizarrely, Gabbard accompanied this text with a video clip
      of her congressional testimony in March which in no way validates anything she
      says in her post. Nowhere in the clip does she utter anything about Iran being
      weeks to months from a nuclear weapon, and she explicitly says the words “the
      IC [Intelligence Community] continues to assess Iran is not building a nuclear
      weapon and the Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized a nuclear weapons
      program that he suspended in 2003.” A recent report from CNN says that according
      to US intelligence sources Iran is not “weeks to months” from a nuclear weapon
      but years , reporting that Tehran is “up to three years away from being able to
      produce and deliver one to a target of its choosing.” This kind of post-truth
      society behavior, where one tells people they’re not seeing what’s directly in
      front of their eyes, is the kind of thing you only expect from Donald Trump and
      his most obsequious bootlickers. And what we are witnessing here is Tulsi Gabbard
      getting down on her knees and putting tongue to leather. https://x.com/DNIGabbard/status/1936174674595008517
      Tulsi Gabbard is a warmongering asshole, and a liar. She is helping to deceive
      the world into yet another horrible middle eastern war, and if she and her fellow
      warmongers succeed her words will go down in history as among the most depraved
      lies ever told. This is the same person who tweeted back in March, “President
      Trump IS the President of Peace. He is ending bloodshed across the world and will
      deliver lasting peace in the Middle East.” This is also the person who attacked
      Trump’s hawkishness on Iran constantly while campaigning for president as a Democrat
      in the 2020 primary race. “Intel officials & politicians led us into Iraq war,”
      Gabbard tweeted in 2019. “Now Trump’s using the same playbook to lead our country
      into war with Iran. The cost in lives & treasure will be infinitely greater than
      the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, & Syria, and will undermine our ntnl security.”
      “The main responsibility of the president is to keep Americans safe. Trump has
      failed — undermining our national security by tearing up the Iran nuclear deal,
      threatening military action, bringing us closer to war with Iran that will be
      far worse than war in Iraq,” reads another 2019 tweet . “They are setting the
      stage for a war with Iran that would prove to be far more costly, far more devastating
      and dangerous than anything that we saw in the Iraq War,” Gabbard said of the
      Trump administration during a 2019 interview on ABC. https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1130459408260059136
      This fraudster has built an entire political career out of pretending to oppose
      war and militarism in order to win the support of Americans who are sick of pouring
      blood and treasure into the US slaughter machine, opportunistically drifting to
      whatever corner of the political spectrum would offer her the most power, and
      then when she got as high as she can go she sold all her stated principles to
      the furthest extent possible at the earliest opportunity. Pee fetish porn stars
      have more dignity and integrity. I feel so stupid for having bought into Gabbard’s
      antiwar schtick early on. Fuck this asshole, fuck Trump, fuck Israel, and fuck
      the US empire. _____________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

      War is the worst thing in the world. It is the single craziest behavior exhibited
      by humans. The most destructive. The most traumatizing. The least sustainable.
      The least conducive to human thriving. All the things we fear most become the
      norm in a land ravaged by war. Death. Pain. Suffering. Rape. Chaos. Uncertainty.
      Losing loved ones. Losing homes. Losing limbs. Living in terror. Being attacked.
      Being brain damaged. Being faced with impossible choices. All the things we frighten

      no escape. War creates a waking nightmare which any sensible person would want

      slander anyone who resists in the name of peace. Who will actively fight against
      every healthy impulse in everybody in their society to push their war agenda forward.
      They always tell us the new war they want us to fight is about self-defense, or
      about liberating an oppressed population from a tyrannical dictatorship, or about
      preventing terrorism, or about spreading freedom and democracy. Usually they tell
      us it’s about all of these things. But it never is. They are always lying. Always.
      They are pushing human beings into the worst circumstances they could possibly
      experience here on earth for no other reason than power and profit. To advance
      the hegemonic agendas of empire managers and to fill the coffers of war profiteers.
      That’s all it ever is. Always, always, always. They say whatever they need to
      say and move whatever chess pieces they need to move to get their war, and then
      they send a bunch of poor suckers to go fight in it, lying to them that they are
      doing something noble and heroic. They ship them off to a foreign land, and then
      they are trapped. They can’t flee into the wilderness because they don’t know
      how to survive and have no way of getting home. They can’t ask the locals for
      help because the locals are their victims. They have no choice but to either fight
      and kill people who have never wronged them, or lay down their arms and be caged
      like animals. If they choose to fight, the best case scenario is that they spend
      the rest of their lives knowing that they killed other human beings who wanted
      to live just as much as themselves, and who had just as much right to. All because
      some people who already had far too much power wanted a little bit more. It’s

      War is the worst thing in the world. It is the single craziest behavior exhibited

      The least conducive to human thriving. All the things we fear most become the
      norm in a land ravaged by war. Death. Pain. Suffering. Rape. Chaos. Uncertainty.
      Losing loved ones. Losing homes. Losing limbs. Living in terror. Being attacked.
      Being brain damaged. Being faced with impossible choices. All the things we frighten
      ourselves with by watching horror movies become a reality from which there is
      no escape. War creates a waking nightmare which any sensible person would want

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Israel and its western allies are crying
      and rending their garments about an Israeli hospital that was damaged in an Iranian
      missile strike. Western media outlets like the BBC and New York Times have suddenly
      remembered how to write headlines which assign blame to the attacker after deciding
      that hospitals getting bombed is a newsworthy event again. The Iranian attack
      didn’t even kill anybody, and the damage to the hospital was reportedly the result
      of a shockwave from a strike on a nearby Israeli military facility. That’s right:
      the Israeli military was using the hospital for human shields. As always, every
      accusation is a confession. Israel, as we all know, bombs hospitals constantly.
      Israel bombed an Iranian hospital just the other day to almost no coverage from
      the western press. Israel has attacked healthcare workers and healthcare facilities
      in Gaza around 700 times according to the World Health Organisation, and the IDF
      has repeatedly been documented entering the hospitals it attacks to destroy individual
      pieces of medical equipment. Israel, unlike Iran, is deliberately targeting healthcare
      facilities to make Gaza unlivable. Israeli defense minister Israel Katz is now
      saying that because of the hospital strike, Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “cannot
      continue to exist.” Knowing what we know about Israel’s track record, saying that
      people who bomb hospitals should not be allowed to exist can only be interpreted
      as an extremely antisemitic statement. https://x.com/caitoz/status/1935671926997082410
      ❖ The only way the US wins a war with Iran easily, quickly, and without massive
      losses is if it uses a nuclear weapon. This fact, combined with that Huckabee
      post comparing Trump to Truman in 1945 and Trump’s “ evacuate Tehran ” and “ UNCONDITIONAL
      SURRENDER ” statements, makes me nervous. And the Americans are reportedly discussing
      using nuclear weapons on Iran already. Fox News reports that the Trump administration
      has not ruled out any options regarding the possibility of using a tactical nuke
      to destroy an Iranian nuclear facility. That’s right kids, we’ve got to nuke the
      Iranians to liberate the Iranians. We’ve got to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear
      weapons because a nuclear-armed despotic regime might use those powerful weapons
      to do crazy and reckless things, like drop a tactical nuke on a foreign nation’s
      power plant. ❖ Israel: [Massacres children, bombs hospitals, assassinates journalists,
      starves civilians, kills aid workers, murders starving civilians seeking aid,
      destroys Gaza, assaults the West Bank, invades Syria, invades Lebanon, bombs Yemen,
      bombs Iran] Iran: [Bombs Israel back] World: Hooray! Israel [crying]: They hate
      us because of our religion! ❖ I’ve never understood why people think “you hate
      Israel!” is an insult. If you knew a guy who was constantly murdering children
      and setting fire to his neighbors’ homes while meddling in your home life, you’d
      probably hate that guy. The problem is people don’t hate Israel enough . ❖ If
      you’ve never been called an antisemite then you are way too chill about genocide.
      ❖ If your case for going to war contains the words “the Bible says” or “God commands
      us”, then you do not have a case for going to war. ❖ Tucker Carlson conducted
      a two-hour interview with Senator Ted Cruz in which he aggressively interrogated
      the lawmaker’s hawkish position on Iran. There are a lot of clips from the interview
      going around online, the most famous of which features Carlson asking Cruz basic
      questions about Iran’s population which the Texas senator is unable to answer.
      The lesson here isn’t that war hawks are too lazy or stupid to learn things about
      the nations they want to destroy, the lesson is that they are lying when they
      say they care about the people in those nations and want to liberate them. They
      don’t care about Iranian people. At all. They care about power, empire-building,
      oil, and Israel, and then they make up a bunch of stories about wanting to rescue
      the people they’re about to murder from the rule of a tyrannical regime. All wars
      are built on lies. _______________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now President Trump has shared a text message
      that was sent to him by Mike Huckabee, the deranged Christian Zionist who serves
      as the current US ambassador to Israel, and it is one of the creepiest things
      I have ever seen in my life. The text reads as follows: “Mr President, God spared
      you in Butler, PA to be the most consequential President in a century — maybe
      ever. The decisions on your shoulders I would not want to be made by anyone else.
      You have many voices speaking to you Sir, but there is only ONE voice that matters.
      HIS voice. I am your appointed servant in this land and am available for you but
      I do not try to get in your presence often because I trust your instincts. No
      President in my lifetime has been in a position like yours. Not since Truman in
      1945. I don’t reach out to persuade you. Only to encourage you. I believe you
      will hear from heaven and that voice is far more important than mine or ANYONE
      else’s. You sent me to Israel to be your eyes, ears and voice and to make sure
      our flag flies above our embassy. My job is to be the last one to leave. I will
      not abandon this post. Our flag will NOT come down! You did not seek this moment.
      This moment sought YOU! It is my honor to serve you! Mike Huckabee” There are
      so many weird, creepy things about this message. The intensity. The religious
      fanaticism. The groveling, self-debasing obsequiousness, clearly designed to appeal
      to Trump’s enormous ego. But by far the most disturbing part was the reference
      to Truman in 1945 — a nod to the last and only time a national leader used nuclear
      weapons against an enemy state. Trump claims to have experienced a religious transformation
      after surviving an assassination attempt last year. Nuclear weapons and doomsday
      cultism are poor bedfellows. I really hope this is just some bizarre madman diplomacy
      and not an accurate reflection of something that is actually occurring inside
      the president’s mind as he pushes toward direct confrontation with Iran. ❖ The
      US and Israel don’t oppose Iran getting nukes because they fear a nuclear attack
      by irrational tyrants, nor because they worry about Iran giving nukes to terrorist
      factions. They oppose Iran getting nukes because then all their regime change
      agendas go right out the window. This isn’t actually about nukes. It’s about toppling
      Tehran so that the US and Israel can dominate the middle east. It’s about regional
      hegemony and geostrategic control , and nothing else. They’d be pushing for regime
      change in Iran whether they believed Iran was seeking a nuke or not. ❖ How fucking
      stupid do you have to believe the lies about Iran? It’s just a much dumber, much
      more obvious version of the Iraq war narratives, pushed by a much dumber, much
      more obvious US president. With the benefit of having watched it all happen before.
      At least with the Iraq invasion Bush had a year and a half of soaring approval
      where he got to posture as the Good Guy protecting Americans from the Bad Guys.
      This time it’s been a year and a half of the US backing history’s first live-streamed
      genocide, with Israel essentially telling the world “WE’RE HITLER, WE’RE THE NEW
      NAZIS, WE KILL KIDS” for 20 months, and now they’re getting ready to say that
      THIS is what US soldiers need to go fight and die for? Come ON people. It’s the
      same movie. They barely even changed the name, they just switched the Q to an
      N. There is no excuse for failing to see what’s happening here. ❖ A new Economist/YouGov
      poll found that only 16 percent of Americans currently support a US war with Iran.
      Most Americans oppose such a war, including a majority of Trump supporters. People
      advocating regime change interventionism in Iran are arguing that the US needs
      to ignore the will of its own electorate in the name of spreading democracy. ❖
      There are no anti-war Trump supporters; if you’re still supporting Trump, you’re
      not anti-war. There are no anti-war Republicans; if you’re still a member of the
      Republican Party, you’re not anti-war. If you got scammed by Trump’s anti-war
      schtick that’s one thing, but it’s another thing entirely if you’re still buying
      into the scam after being taken by the hand and carefully shown that it’s a scam
      in excruciating detail throughout Trump’s second term. If you supported Trump
      because you thought he was anti-war, the time is now to completely wash your hands
      of him and firmly take your stand against him. If you stood with the Republicans
      because you thought they were less warmongering than the Democrats, it’s time
      to leave the party and join the actual anti-war movement. If you’re not willing
      to do either of these things, it’s time to stop pretending you don’t love war.
      ❖ I don’t feel the same disdain toward people who got scammed by Trump’s fake
      antiwar schtick that I see others expressing. I understand it, but I don’t feel
      it. We live in an information ecosystem teeming with propaganda and deception,
      and people are going to get confused. There’s no shame in being deceived. There
      IS shame in deceiving. There IS shame in continuing to support a warmonger after
      you discover that you were deceived about him. But BEING deceived in and of itself
      is no crime. That’s why the perpetrator goes to jail in fraud cases and not the
      victims. Mark Twain said “It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that
      they have been fooled,” and it’s SO true. As social animals, humans are so dominated
      by the need to conform to our tribal loyalties that we’ve got psychological barriers
      to admitting that our tribe/faction got things wrong. And as social animals, shame
      is a powerful driving force in our psychological lives, because we’re afraid of
      being seen as deficient by other humans. But it’s irrational for us to view those
      who are deceived as deficient, and it’s irrational to feel shame about having
      gotten something wrong. I’ve gotten lots of things wrong over the years. I’m sure
      there are some things I’m still getting wrong. Being willing to see you got it
      wrong is the essential first step to getting it right. Always being open to the
      possibility that you could be wrong is necessary to forming a truth-based relationship
      with reality. If you were duped by the MAGA scam, that’s okay. Just take what
      you learned and start working on re-orienting yourself toward truth. You know
      what’s false, so now you can start working on finding out what’s true. And you
      can start constructing a new worldview accordingly. ________________ Caitlin’s

      Trump a text message expressing his belief that Trump is divinely chosen to be
      a consequential leader, emphasizing the importance of following God's guidance

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, President Trump shared a disturbing text
      message from Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, which reflects extreme
      religious fervor and an unsettling level of devotion. Huckabee's message praises
      Trump as potentially the most significant president in a century, emphasizing
      that he is guided by a divine voice that surpasses all others. The text contains
      alarming references to historical moments, particularly a comparison to President
      Truman's decision to use nuclear weapons in 1945, suggesting a troubling connection
      between religious zealotry and global power dynamics. The article expresses concern
      that Huckabee's intense admiration and the implications of his message could indicate
      a dangerous blend of fanaticism and political influence, particularly in light
      of Trump's claimed religious awakening following an assassination attempt.

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now President Trump has shared a text message
      that was sent to him by Mike Huckabee, the deranged Christian Zionist who serves
      as the current US ambassador to Israel, and it is one of the creepiest things
      I have ever seen in my life. The text reads as follows: “Mr President, God spared
      you in Butler, PA to be the most consequential President in a century — maybe
      ever. The decisions on your shoulders I would not want to be made by anyone else.
      You have many voices speaking to you Sir, but there is only ONE voice that matters.
      HIS voice. I am your appointed servant in this land and am available for you but
      I do not try to get in your presence often because I trust your instincts. No
      President in my lifetime has been in a position like yours. Not since Truman in
      1945. I don’t reach out to persuade you. Only to encourage you. I believe you
      will hear from heaven and that voice is far more important than mine or ANYONE
      else’s. You sent me to Israel to be your eyes, ears and voice and to make sure
      our flag flies above our embassy. My job is to be the last one to leave. I will
