  - title: Anti-Genocide Activism Is Terrorism In The Empire Of Lies
    url: https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/anti-genocide-activism-is-terrorism
    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now British police have been arresting anti-genocide
      protesters for holding signs expressing support for activist group Palestine Action,
      which London has now officially designated a terrorist group for putting red paint
      on war planes that were being used in the Gaza holocaust. That’s right, welcome
      to the empire, where peace activists are called terrorists, where hospitals are
      called military bases, where facts are called blood libel, where people opposing
      genocide are called hateful Nazis, where genocidal soldiers are a protected group
      and chanting for their death is a hate crime. ❖ Israeli outlet Haaretz has published
      an article titled “ Now I Understand Why Israel Is Denying Journalists Access
      to the Appalling Scene in Gaza ” by a French historian named Jean-Pierre Filiu,
      who spent a month in the killing fields of the ruined Palestinian territory after
      entering with a busload of French physicians. Israel has banned journalists from
      Gaza in order to hide its war crimes, making doctors and other specialists the
      de facto western reporters on the ground. And they’re all reporting the same thing
      about what they are seeing. ❖ https://x.com/caitoz/status/1941166811120345523
      ❖ Part of the problem is how normies who don’t follow this stuff closely cannot
      believe Israel could be as evil as we’re saying it is. They’re often like “Oh
      yeah right, they’re just killing civilians because they’re evil and want Palestinians
      to die.” Which would make sense as an objection if you hadn’t been following Israel’s
      pattern of behavior from day to day and weren’t familiar with the way Israelis
      talk about Palestinians whenever they’re speaking to each other in Hebrew instead
      of addressing the western press. Israel’s public image is somewhat protected by
      the fact that its behavior is so profoundly evil that simply talking about it
      strains credulity among the uninformed, in the same way you sound like a crazy
      conspiracy theorist if you talk about some of the things the CIA has openly admitted
      to doing in the past. Many people literally cannot believe anyone could be as
      evil as Israel is, so the true extent of their crimes go unseen. ❖ I’ve decided
      I’m never going to click on another Piers Morgan Uncensored video. He’s just a
      shitty western empire stooge playing Jerry Springer with people’s outrage over
      the worst things in the world and pretending to be impartial while generating
      viral online video clips fueled by rage and partisan echo chamber amplification.
      It occasionally looks edifying, but it’s really a symptom of some of the most
      diseased aspects of this civilization, like Mr Beast. The man is a parasite feasting
      on the vitriolic energy of these dark and troubling times, directly profiting
      from the immense suffering caused by the empire he serves. ❖ The western public
      has stopped viewing Palestine as an intimidating issue to speak out about, and
      it’s causing a major problem for the Israel PR machine. One of the biggest obstacles
      for the pro-Palestine movement used to be the way Israel-Palestine was incorrectly
      regarded as a super complex issue that the average busy member of the public can’t
      hope to understand. That’s changing now because a live-streamed genocide is straightforward
      enough to override the “No you don’t understand what’s happening because words,
      words, words” schtick that Israel apologists always use to shut people down, but
      for a long time the hasbarists were able to intimidate people into silence just
      by knowing a bunch of clever talking points that the average casual observer would
      struggle to come up with answers for. https://x.com/FarOutMag/status/1938999362912129329
      One of my favorite clips from the Glastonbury Festival came from Australian band
      Amyl and the Sniffers, whose vocalist Amy Taylor gave an off-the-cuff speech about
      Palestine and colonialism and the parallels between what white colonizers did
      to Indigenous Australians and what’s happening to the Palestinians today. It wasn’t
      a perfect or super eloquent speech by Taylor’s own admission, but it was passionate
      and it got the point across. At the end she said, “That’s the truth and I thought
      I’d share that today. It was gonna be something way more poetic but that’s just
      what I said; it’s not perfect but I think it’s better to say anything than to
      say nothing at all right now.” More and more people are seeing this when it comes
      to Gaza — that it’s better to say anything than to say nothing at all right now.
      You don’t have to be an expert. You don’t have to know everything there is to
      know about about the apartheid state of Israel and the history of the Zionist
      project. You know what you’re seeing and you know it’s wrong, and that’s enough.
      Don’t let anyone intimidate you into being silent on the defining issue of our
      times. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

    one_sentence_summary: British police are arresting anti-genocide protesters supporting
      Palestine Action, now labeled a terrorist group for their activism, highlighting
      a troubling narrative where peace advocates are criminalized while those perpetrating
      violence are protected.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the recent arrests of anti-genocide protesters
      in Britain for supporting Palestine Action, which has been labeled a terrorist
      group by the UK for its actions against military planes involved in the Gaza conflict.
      It highlights the troubling narrative where peace activists are branded as terrorists,
      while those committing violence are protected. The piece references a Haaretz
      article by historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, who, after witnessing the devastation
      in Gaza with a group of French doctors, underscores the Israeli government's efforts
      to restrict journalist access to conceal its alleged war crimes. The author argues
      that many people struggle to accept the severity of Israel's actions due to a
      lack of awareness about the ongoing situation and the stark contrast between the
      reality on the ground and the narratives presented in the media.

      is the one promulgated by western liberals which holds that all the crimes Israel

      been , from its very inception. This is Israel. This is it. What you’re looking
      at is the only thing Israel could ever have been. What we are seeing from Israel
      today is the inevitable outcome of the ethnosupremacist, hypermilitaristic, psychopathic
      ideology upon which the state was founded. Israel’s horrific abuses in Gaza, the
      West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Iran are the fruits of the tree from a seed that
      was planted after the second world war. Netanyahu didn’t make Israel the way it
      is. The way Israel is made Netanyahu. Netanyahu is Israel in its natural state.

      Everyone’s still talking about Bob Vylan, and rightly so. A crowd full of westerners
      happily being led through a chant of “Death, death to the IDF” at the 2025 Glastonbury
      Festival was a historical landmark moment for the 21st century, and the group’s
      persecution at the hands of western governments is once again highlighting the
      way our society’s purported values of free thought and free expression go right
      out the window wherever Israel is concerned. But one thing that’s not getting
      enough attention is the fact that many, many other acts also spoke out in support
      of Palestine at that same festival, and that the crowd was full of attendees waving
      Palestinian flags. Supporting Palestine and opposing Israel’s genocidal atrocities
      is just what’s cool now. This is a massive cultural development, because it means
      we are seeing the emergence of actual, meaningful rebellion in western counterculture
      for the first time arguably since the Vietnam War. The artists and their fans
      aren’t just talking the talk of sticking it to the establishment anymore. https://x.com/desigotdone/status/1940685023071641733
      For generations the ruling class has been successfully stomping out all politically
      relevant counterculture, first in the form of direct frontal assault by official
      government operations like COINTELPRO , and then by the way all major platforms
      and studios are owned by plutocrats who benefit from the imperial status quo and
      refuse to elevate anyone who might pose a threat to it. There have of course been
      countless artists in every generation who put on a rebellious face and give the
      finger to authority, but they’ve never presented any kind of threat to real power.
      Punk rockers who sing “fuck the man” but never advance any actual tangible causes.
      Satanic panic bands and shock rock superstars scaring church ladies and stirring
      culture wars. Bands voicing criticisms of the Iraq invasion but making it about
      supporting the Democratic Party. Celebrity musicians promoting social justice
      and equality without ever saying anything that might inconvenience the oligarchs
      and empire managers who rule our world. The rich and powerful don’t care if you
      dye your hair or pierce your nose or kiss a member of the same sex or say Hail
      Satan. They don’t care if you support one mainstream political faction over the
      other, or if you yell empty words about anarchy and revolution that aren’t pointed
      toward any real material goals. They care very much, however, if you are undermining
      public consent for military and geopolitical agendas they’ve worked very hard
      to propagandize the public into accepting. The establishment never dropped the
      hammer on Marilyn Manson. Lady Gaga never ran into trouble with the state for
      singing that gay people are Born This Way. Ozzy Osbourne is living in the lap
      of luxury with an estimated net worth of $220 million. But groups like Kneecap
      and Bob Vylan are being subjected to police investigations and visa revocations
      for taking a stand on Palestine. Which, of course, is only going to make their
      position more popular among young people with a defiant streak in them. It’s hard
      to imagine how western governments could make support for Palestine look more
      attractive to western youths, really. Here’s this unimaginably horrific mass atrocity
      that they can all watch unfolding on their phone screens in real time every single
      day of the year, and they’re being told “You’re not allowed to oppose this. We,
      the stuffed shirts in Washington and London, command you to obey. If you think
      unauthorized thoughts and chant unauthorized chants, we are going to get very
      huffy and upset.” I mean, can you think of anything more fun? This is after all
      the generation who’s been told that they need to accept being poorer and sicker
      than their parents and grandparents and that they’ll never own a home no matter
      what they do, knowing full well that the crusty old bastards finger-wagging at
      them for opposing an active genocide are the same freaks who’ve refused to do
      anything to steer their planet’s ecosystem away from looming disaster. They have
      every reason to want to express defiance, and nothing to lose by doing so. A real,
      politically meaningful counterculture has been born in the western world, and
      our rulers are already showing us that they’re afraid of it. This is a fascinating
      time to be alive. __________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the significant cultural shift represented
      by the band Bob Vylan's performance at the 2025 Glastonbury Festival, where a
      large crowd chanted "Death, death to the IDF" in support of Palestine, marking
      a notable moment in contemporary counterculture. This event, alongside other artists
      expressing solidarity with Palestine and attendees waving Palestinian flags, indicates
      a growing rebellion against the establishment, reminiscent of the anti-establishment
      sentiments seen during the Vietnam War. The author argues that this movement reflects
      a meaningful change in how artists and their audiences engage with political issues,
      contrasting it with past generations where rebellious expressions often lacked
      real impact on power structures. The piece highlights the challenges faced by
      artists in a system dominated by wealthy elites who suppress politically relevant
      counterculture, yet suggests that the current wave of support for Palestine signifies
      a potential shift towards more genuine activism in music and popular culture.

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now My God Israel supporters are exhausting.
      I’ve never gotten used to it. “Wahh, Zohran Mamdani wants to murder Jews!” “Wahh,
      the musician hurt the IDF’s feelings!” Shut up. Shut up. Shut the whole entire
      fuck up. Everyone is sick of your bullshit. There is a genocide happening. A genocide.
      Babies are being starved . IDF soldiers are telling the Israeli press that they’re
      being ordered to massacre desperately hungry civilians at aid sites. There are
      vast stretches of the Gaza Strip that now look like the surface of the moon. Trump
      and Netanyahu are openly working to purge the Palestinian territory of Palestinians
      so the land can be permanently taken from them. Your feelings don’t matter. The
      world does not revolve around you and your feelings. Your emotional response to
      whatever made up nonsense you’re choosing to have a melodramatic tantrum about
      today is completely irrelevant. Every single Palestinian who died today, individually,
      matters infinitely more than every feeling you’ve ever felt about every imaginary
      phantom you’ve pretended to feel threatened by. Anyone who has had the misfortune
      of knowing a manipulative narcissist has seen all these patterns before. The self-centeredness.
      The hypocrisy. The horrific abuse, followed by collapsing into blubbering victimhood
      the second the abuse is called out. The aggressive efforts to control the narrative
      and frame all critics and rivals as evil monsters. It’s a very familiar playbook.
      My hope for our world is that we one day become so emotionally and psychologically
      healthy that such cynical manipulations stand out like a white cloud against a
      deep blue sky. That we become so caring, understanding and supportive of our fellow
      human beings that the needful get everything they require to lead a fulfilling
      life, while sociopathy and psychopathy become as alienating and disadvantageous
      as chronic schizophrenia is today. That we become so tender-hearted that genocide
      can never rear its ugly head on this planet again, and all the abusive dynamics
      which made the Gaza holocaust possible fade away like darkness in the rising sun.
      https://x.com/caitoz/status/1940162165996228799 ❖ The real story is not that one
      musical act said “death to the IDF” at Glastonbury Festival, the real story is
      that a huge number of acts spoke out in support of Palestine at Glastonbury Festival.
      They’re just making the story about one of those acts hoping you won’t notice
      that supporting Palestine and opposing Israel is what’s popular and cool now.
      ❖ It’s so funny when people accuse me of “bias” when I talk about Gaza. Like oh
      no I’m not being neutral enough about the active genocide, I’m so sorry. ❖ Israel
      is making it abundantly clear that it’s going to keep doing everything it can
      to instigate a war between the US and Iran, and the Washington swamp is crawling
      with war sluts who are pushing in the same direction. Trump’s cabinet is full
      of Iran hawks , and Trump himself has publicly confessed to being bought and owned
      by the world’s richest Israeli, Miriam Adelson. Israel will not stop pushing for
      a full-scale American regime change war until it gets it. It will keep pushing
      and pushing and pushing, because there’s nothing stopping it from doing so. It
      has too much to gain and too little to lose, since the political layout in Official
      Washington and the parapolitical layout in the unelected deep state largely aligns
      with this goal as well. The warmongers will keep trying, and if they fail next
      time, they will try again. Nobody with any real power is doing anything to permanently
      shut this warmongering down and lock it away; at most they’re just postponing
      it a bit until the next moment of demented brinkmanship occurs. What this means
      is that anyone in the United States who doesn’t want this war to happen needs
      to get much, much more hostile toward all the elements that are seeking to bring
      it about. Support for Israel needs to become politically toxic. A complete abandonment
      of Washington’s status quo approach to the middle east must be demanded. A robust
      peace movement needs to emerge. The people in power aren’t pushing back against
      this mad shove toward war, so the pushback is going to have to come from the American
      people themselves. It will not happen from the top down, so it’s going to have
      to come from the bottom up, or it’s not going to come at all. That’s the only
      thing that will stop this looming nightmare from being inflicted upon our world.

    paragraph_summary: The article expresses frustration with the defensive reactions
      of some Israel supporters in the face of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza,
      emphasizing that the suffering of Palestinians should take precedence over their
      emotional responses. It highlights the severity of the situation, including allegations
      of genocide and the dire conditions faced by civilians, while criticizing the
      self-centeredness and manipulative tactics often employed by those who prioritize
      their feelings over the lives of others. The author calls for a future where empathy
      and understanding prevail, allowing for genuine support for those in need and
      diminishing the influence of sociopathic behaviors in societal discourse.

      Honestly at this point they should just get Netanyahu his own room in the White
      House and a desk in the Oval Office. The prime minister of Israel is taking his
      third trip to the White House in the five months since Trump has been back in
      office. I have immediate blood family members who I love with all my heart and
      visit less often than this. This comes as the Trump administration revokes the
      US visas of British punk rap duo Bob Vylan ahead of a US tour for chanting “Death,
      death to the IDF” at a concert in the UK. Trump’s sycophantic supporters who spent
      years complaining that their free speech rights were under assault appear fine
      with their government deciding what words Americans are allowed to hear in their
      own country. https://x.com/IbaraEleven/status/1939732311769317699 This also comes
      as Trump actively intervenes in the Israeli judicial system to prevent Netanyahu’s
      corruption trial from moving forward. The president has repeatedly taken to social
      media to demand that Israel abandon its corruption case against the prime minister,
      at one point even implying that the US could cut off arms supplies if his trial
      isn’t canceled. “The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year,
      far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel,” Trump said.
      “We are not going to stand for this. We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister
      Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI
      GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!” It’s so revealing what the US government is and
      is not willing to threaten conditioning military supplies on, and what it’s willing
      to interfere in Israel’s affairs to accomplish. Ever since the Gaza holocaust
      began we’ve been hearing lines like “ Israel is a sovereign country ” and “ Israel
      is a sovereign state that makes its own decisions ” when reporters ask why the
      White House doesn’t leverage arms shipments to demand more humanitarian treatment
      for civilians in the Gaza Strip. But the president of the United States is willing
      to leverage those same arms shipments to directly interfere in Israeli legal proceedings
      which have nothing to do with the US government in order to get Netanyahu out
      of trouble. https://x.com/AssalRad/status/1843718880868565333 And it would appear
      that the president’s intervention has been successful; Netanyahu’s corruption
      trial has since been postponed . When it comes to committing genocide using American
      weapons funded by American taxpayers, Israel is a sovereign state upon which the
      US can exert zero leverage or control. When it comes to meddling in the corruption
      trial of a man who is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court,
      the White House pulls no punches in protecting its favorite genocide monster.
      There is no meaningful separation between the US and Israeli governments. They’re
      two member states in the undeclared empire that sprawls across the entire western
      world, and Trump and Netanyahu are two of the most depraved and most consequential
      managers of this empire today. They are thick as thieves. They are partners in
      crime. Call it the Trumpanyahu administration. ________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter

      I still can’t get over how we’re being asked to pretend “Death, death to the IDF”
      is some kind of hate crime at the exact same time IDF soldiers are telling the
      Israeli press they’re being ordered to massacre starving civilians at aid sites.
      I’ve been seeing a number of people arguing that it’s wrong to say “death to the
      IDF” because soldiers aren’t to be blamed for the criminality of their government.
      This framing is only accepted in the west because western soldiers also do evil
      things that our society needs to make up excuses for. As an aside, “Death, death
      to the IDF” is an insanely catchy earworm. Been dancing around in my mind all
      day. ❖ Deliberately starving a civilian population and then setting up aid sites
      as a death trap to massacre starving people trying to get food is too evil to
      wrap your mind around. If we saw a supervillain doing this in a movie we’d think
      it was dumb, because it wouldn’t be believable. ❖ It’s like everyone’s standing
      around watching a man beat a small child to death at a restaurant. “Should we
      do something?” someone asks. “You saw the kid throw food at the guy,” someone
      replies. “The man has a right to defend himself.” “But he’s killing him!” “It’s
      a fight. Bad things happen in a fight.” “Yeah, the boy shouldn’t have started
      a fight he can’t win.” “You’re actually being quite hateful right now.” And sure,
      maybe it’s true the child did set the man off by throwing food at him. Maybe the
      child did so fully knowing that it would send the man into a murderous rage, because
      the man had been horrifically abusing the child his entire life. Maybe instigating
      a physical confrontation in full view of the public was the child’s last desperate
      attempt to expose the man’s depravity, in the hope that everyone would finally
      see what’s happening and do something to stop the abuse. But nobody’s stopping
      it, because the man has spent years charming and befriending everyone in town — or
      frightening and intimidating them if that’s easier. So now everyone’s watching
      a grown man beat a child to death and pretending they’re watching a fight, when
      they all know deep down what they’re really watching is a cold-blooded murder
      by a cold-hearted man, who should have been stopped and locked away a long time
      ago. ❖ The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is saying that Iran
      could probably start enriching uranium again within a few months, which Iran has
      said it plans to do, and which Trump has said will result in another US bombing
      assault. Trumpers tried to argue that the bombing of Iran was a brilliant strategic
      maneuver to avoid full-scale war, when it appears to have only made such a war
      much more likely. Now the president is saying he’ll bomb Iran again if it resumes
      enriching uranium, something it will probably be able to do quite soon, after
      giving Iran every reason to start actively seeking a nuclear weapon. When Iran
      hawks were arguing against the JCPOA (the Iran nuclear deal laid out during the
      Obama administration), one of their most common talking points was that it was
      “ kicking the can down the road ” to a nuclear-armed Iran in the future. In reality
      the JCPOA was a remarkable feat of international diplomacy that could have avoided
      all these needless escalations, and it is Trump and the Iran hawks who have been
      kicking the can down the road to full-scale war with Iran (if Iran doesn’t get
      nukes first). There’s a lot to despise Trump for, but spending both of his terms
      setting the US on a trajectory toward war with Iran ranks right up around the
      top of the list. The JCPOA was working fine, but Trump shredded it in 2018 to
      set us on this path that is only getting darker and darker at a faster and faster
      pace. Trump chose that course of action to implement his “maximum pressure campaign”
      on Iran. Trump chose to assassinate Soleimani. Trump chose to bomb Iran. Everything
      that happens from here on out is Trump’s fault. _____________________ Caitlin’s

      standards in how military actions are perceived, highlighting the absurdity of
      labeling expressions of anger against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) as hate
      crimes while acknowledging their involvement in atrocities against civilians.
      Ultimately, the piece calls for a concerted effort to awaken others to the realities
      of imperialism and to take small, consistent actions toward societal change.

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Israel supporters everywhere have been
      in full blown crisis mode for days because, apparently, antisemitism smears have
      stopped working. Zohran Mamdani has won the Democratic Party primary in the New
      York City mayoral race after a frenetic smear campaign to portray him as an antisemite
      for his pro-Palestinian views, and now all the world’s worst people are freaking
      out about it. I’m seeing some intensely rabid Islamophobia throughout public discourse
      in response to Mamdani’s win, the likes of which I haven’t seen since 9/11. All
      this hatred we’re now seeing directed toward Muslims is going to look pretty weird
      after the imperial crosshairs shift to Beijing and all these same people start
      acting super duper concerned about the plight of Muslims in Xinjiang. I never
      get excited about anything that happens in the Democratic Party anymore, but the
      fact that these smears have lost a lot of their power has some encouraging and
      far-reaching implications for western politics in general. Things have come a
      long way since the psyop against Jeremy Corbyn. ❖ The British government has “strongly
      condemned” a live performance on the BBC by rap duo Bob Vylan in which the crowd
      was led through a chant of “Death, death to the IDF.” British police are investigating
      the incident as a potential criminal offense, and Zionists everywhere are treating
      this incident like a second Holocaust. Inside the western empire it’s considered
      offensive and unacceptable to say “death to” a foreign military comprised entirely
      of armed combatants which is presently committing a genocide in full view of the
      entire world. It is not, however considered offensive and unacceptable to commit
      genocide. So, just to be clear — SAYING “death to” the foreign military which
      is presently committing genocide: wrong, unacceptable, outrageous, no. CAUSING
      death to a civilian population because of their ethnicity by that same foreign
      military force: fine, normal, absolutely, yes. ❖ Israeli is not a religion and
      Jewish is not a nationality and anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism and all decent
      people despise the state of Israel. ❖ Hating Israel is one of the most patriotic
      things Americans can do at this point. It’s clear now that Israel is going to
      keep aggressively pushing for a US war against Iran until they get it, and making
      support for Israel politically toxic in the US may be the only thing that can
      prevent them from succeeding. ❖ I don’t like the far right OR the far left. I
      like things to stay in the moderate center, where genocide is fine and people’s
      healthcare money is given to cruise missile manufacturers. ❖ They’re not going
      to let any journalists into Gaza until the whole thing’s been emptied out and
      they’ve hidden all the evidence of their holocaust —  and then they’ll call you
      an antisemitic conspiracy theorist if you say it happened. ❖ I’ve never understood
      the debate about whether or not support for Israel is commanded in the Bible.
      If you think the Bible commands you to support what’s being done in Gaza, then
      throw your Bible in the trash and get a different religion, because it’s plainly
      false and immoral. It is not legitimate to offload your responsibility for your
      own behavior onto your religion. If your religion commanded you to sexually molest
      children, it would be your moral responsibility as a human being to disobey your
      religion and stop following it. Gaza’s no different. ❖ A charismatic pro-Palestinian
      Muslim becoming the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City. Westerners
      chanting “death to the IDF” and having a great time doing it. Israeli soldiers
      confessing their genocidal atrocities in the Israeli press. Israel’s PR stranglehold

      Sometimes I’ll write a headline that looks odd on its face, but then I’ll lay
      out facts and arguments which allow the reader to understand the validity of the
      claim by the end of the essay. This is not one of those times. This headline is
      just me saying the thing that happened. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      and Defense Minister Israel Katz are publicly denouncing a report from an Israeli
      newspaper quoting Israeli soldiers who describe atrocities they were ordered to
      commit in the Israeli military, accusing the report of “blood libels”. The Israeli
      newspaper Haaretz has published an article titled “ ‘It’s a Killing Field’: IDF
      Soldiers Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian
      Aid ”, subtitled “IDF officers and soldiers told Haaretz they were ordered to
      fire at unarmed crowds near food distribution sites in Gaza, even when no threat
      was present. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, prompting the military
      prosecution to call for a review into possible war crimes.” https://x.com/jasonhickel/status/1938507822120972440
      One Israeli soldier attests that civilians seeking aid are “treated like a hostile
      force — no crowd-control measures, no tear gas — just live fire with everything
      imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars.” “We open fire early
      in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters away,
      and sometimes we just charge at them from close range. But there’s no danger to
      the forces,” the soldier says, adding, “I’m not aware of a single instance of
      return fire. There’s no enemy, no weapons.” IDF sources tell Haaretz that Gaza
      has become “a place with its own set of rules” where they are interacting with
      civilians with whom “your only means of interaction is opening fire”. Deadly military
      weapons are used as crowd control to steer the starving populace wherever it’s
      determined they’re supposed to be, routinely killing desperate aid seekers. Another
      soldier describes being instructed to fire artillery shells at a crowd to keep
      them at a distance, saying, “Every time we fire, there are casualties and deaths,
      and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there’s never a good answer. Sometimes,
      merely asking the question annoys the commanders.” In quote after quote after
      quote we read Israeli soldiers describing atrocities they were ordered to commit
      which they knew were wrong. I guess Israel’s PR machine never counted on some
      of the soldiers they sent in to perpetrate the Gaza holocaust having an actual
      conscience. https://x.com/caitoz/status/1938737242354393414 A joint statement
      from Netanyahu and Katz denounced the report, accusing Haaretz of publishing “blood
      libels”. “The State of Israel absolutely rejects the contemptible blood libels
      that have been published in the Ha’aretz newspaper, according to which ‘IDF Soldiers
      Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian Aid.’
      These are malicious falsehoods designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military
      in the world,” the statement reads. “Blood libel ” refers to the way medieval
      Europeans used to falsely accuse Jews of murdering Christian children in blood
      sacrifices — an early form of atrocity propaganda used to justify the persecution
      of Jews. So again, just to be absolutely clear, the leader of the Israeli government
      is claiming that an Israeli newspaper quoting Israeli soldiers describing their
      own atrocities is antisemitic. And that mountains of testimony from inside the
      IDF is “designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military in the world.” What
      can I even say about that here? It speaks for itself. I have nothing to add. The
      more exposed Israel’s criminality becomes, the more absurd the arguments made
      in its defense are getting. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      Within the storytelling of western politics and punditry there exists a fictional
      type of mental illness which only affects people the US empire doesn’t like. If
      Iran gets a nuclear weapon, its crazy lunatic government will flip out and nuke
      us all. Watch out for Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, those guys are a bunch
      of maniacal antisemites who want to attack Israelis just because they’re Jewish.
      Oh no, Putin is invading Ukraine completely unprovoked because he’s a madman who
      hates freedom and won’t stop until he’s conquered all of Europe. China is building
      up its military because the megalomaniacal Xi Jinping wants to take over the world;
      all those US military bases surrounding China are just a defensive measure to
      contain Beijing’s insanity. Assad just went nuts one day and started slaughtering
      his own people out of nowhere. Gaddafi is a sexual sadist who’s giving Viagra
      to his troops to help them commit mass rapes in Libya. Saddam Hussein is so crazy
      and evil he’s trying to obtain weapons of mass destruction to give Americans another
      9/11. The North Koreans used to be far too insane to be allowed to have nuclear
      weapons because they’d nuke San Francisco immediately, but after they obtained
      nuclear weapons they were miraculously cured of this rare psychological disorder.
      The stories of the western empire ask us to believe that everyone who finds themselves
      in the imperial crosshairs is an irrational actor whose loony behavior can only
      be attributed to some uncontrollable defect within their own minds, or who will
      soon snap and do something nutty if they are not contained by force. One antagonist
      who never appears in these fairy tales of the western empire is the western empire
      itself. In the storytelling of the empire, there is no globe-spanning power structure
      which is constantly inflicting violence and destruction upon populations around
      the world while seeking to crush any nation who disobeys its dictates. It’s just
      a bunch of irrational psychos, seeking nuclear weapons and becoming aggressively
      militaristic for no other reason than because they are crazy, while the totally
      normal alliance led by a totally normal country in North America innocently responds
      to their crazy behavior. That’s the story. In real life, the most aggressive and
      unreasonable actor on the world stage by far is the empire-like power structure
      that is loosely centralized around Washington DC. Nobody else is constantly waging
      wars of aggression around the world. Nobody else is circling the planet with hundreds
      of military bases for the purpose of global domination. Nobody else has spent
      the 21st century killing millions of people and deliberately targeting civilians
      with starvation sanctions in countries on the other side of the planet. Only the
      US-centralized empire has been doing these things. But we are asked to believe
      that this vicious imperial power structure is the only rational actor on earth,
      and that those who resist its aggressions are the crazy ones. And you are told
      that if you can’t see this, then you’re crazy too. You’re a crackpot. A conspiracy
      theorist. A paranoid nutball whose voice should be marginalized and whose ideas
      should be dismissed with a scoff. You are crazy if you don’t believe what the
      world’s craziest power structure says about its enemies being crazy. It is gaslighting
      on a global scale. It is madness, and that is why this civilization has gone mad.
      Let’s hope someone finds a way to protect the world from the insanity of the western
      empire. ______________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the portrayal of foreign leaders and
      nations in Western politics as irrational and dangerous, suggesting that such
      narratives serve to justify aggressive policies and military actions by the US
      and its allies.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the narrative in Western politics that
      portrays adversaries of the U.S. empire as irrational and mentally unstable, suggesting
      that this perspective serves to justify aggressive foreign policies. It highlights
      examples such as Iran, North Korea, and various Middle Eastern groups, framing
      them as "crazy" actors whose actions stem from a supposed psychological defect.
      The author argues that this storytelling conveniently ignores the role of the
      U.S. empire itself as a global power that inflicts violence and seeks to dominate
      other nations, thereby presenting a skewed view of international relations that
      simplifies complex geopolitical dynamics into a tale of good versus evil.

      Dear Israel apologist, There is nothing you can say to me that will make me stop
      opposing Israel’s western-backed atrocities. Call me an antisemite or a Nazi or
      any name you want. The name-calling stopped having any effect a long time ago.
      Babble about October 7 and Hamas and hostages all you wish. I’ve stopped listening
      to you. Pile on as many walls of text as you like explaining why it is actually
      fine and good to bomb hospitals and massacre starving civilians seeking aid. I
      ain’t reading all that, free Palestine. Regurgitate whatever the latest propaganda
      narrative is about Iran or the Houthis or Hezbollah or whichever new war Israel
      is getting ready to start this week. We both know it’s all lies. Parrot whatever’s
      the current hasbara slogan justifying Israel’s genocide in Gaza if you want to.
      Your words have no power here. That’s why your old tricks have stopped working,
      you know: all you have is words. We have truth, facts and morality on our side,
      and you have a bunch of words. We have mountains of raw video footage documenting
      war crimes and mass atrocities. And you have a mountain of words. We have an unshakable
      confidence in our opposition to history’s first live-streamed genocide, and you
      have a river of verbiage. Your weapons don’t work here. This is not a fair fight.
      You are as outmatched as the helpless children being slaughtered by the Israeli
      military. I am going to keep opposing the crimes of Israel and the western sponsors
      of its atrocities. I am going to keep opposing the wars that Israel and its western
      backers are always starting in the middle east. I am going to keep opposing the
      US empire which is fueled by human blood. I am going to keep opposing the western
      media who spread war propaganda and normalize genocide. I am going to keep opposing
      all the systems, institutions and ideologies which have given rise to the Gaza
      holocaust. I am going to keep mocking your manipulations and weakening the power
      of your words. There is nothing you can say to stop me from doing this. There
      is nothing you can say to stop anyone from doing this. Because all you have is
      words. And nobody’s listening anymore. ________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is

      that enable such atrocities.
