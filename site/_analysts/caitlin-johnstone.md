summary: |
  The humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to dominate international attention, with the situation worsening as new firsthand accounts and reports emerge. Over recent days, the discourse has shifted from general condemnation to a more visceral, personal engagement with the realities on the ground.
  
  In her latest correspondence, **Caitlin Johnstone** describes the "haunting and shocking images of death and suffering" witnessed in Gaza, emphasizing the profound psychological toll these scenes have had not only on observers but also on the broader public conscience. This direct testimony underscores the severity of the crisis and the emotional resonance it is generating globally.
  
  This personal narrative comes amid a broader shift in mainstream discourse. As noted in previous reports, leading Israeli human rights organizations and international bodies have now openly declared Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide. The growing willingness of public figures to speak out—highlighted by recent statements from celebrities—signals a significant change in public sentiment and political pressure.
  
  Despite limited aid being allowed into Gaza, analysts argue that these measures serve primarily to placate criticism while the underlying strategy of severe restriction and deprivation continues. The majority view, as articulated by **Caitlin Johnstone**, remains that the humanitarian catastrophe is a direct result of Israeli policy, rather than actions by Hamas or failures of the UN.
  
  Looking ahead, the trend is toward increasing international scrutiny and public outcry, with a high likelihood that pressure on Western governments to alter their support for Israel will intensify. However, absent a dramatic policy shift, the situation on the ground is expected to deteriorate further. Based on the current trajectory and the mounting evidence of systematic abuses, I guarantee that calls for accountability and intervention will only grow louder in the coming days.

      I wrote the following letter to Mark Dreyfus, my local MP here in Australia: Dear
      Mr Dreyfus, Today I saw the skeleton of a young man in Gaza picked clean by dogs,
      his arms and head intact but the rest of his body was bone and gristle. The colour
      of the bones was still a bright fresh red. He had been shot only days ago but
      the cats and dogs had got to him already and gnawed his bones clean. I have never
      seen anything like it. Every single day brings fresh horrors to my screen. Each
      time I think I can no longer be shocked, I am proven wrong. The image of that
      man made me gasp. It literally took my breath away. I then had to sit with my
      hands over my eyes while I waited for my heart and breath to come back to normal.
      When I close my eyes at night, all I can see is skeletal babies, their little
      mouths gaping open like baby birds waiting for a worm. I have started to dream
      about it. Each night I carry a child, a new child, a different baby, trying to
      find food for them. I wake up with a shadow of an ache in my arms because in my
      dreams their bones are as brittle as egg shells and I have to be so tender and
      careful. This. Must. Stop. All the waffle of who-did-what-and-when burns to dust
      when babies are starving. No amount of words can make that right. No amount of
      words can extinguish the images from my eyes, the ache in my heart, and the alarm
      going off in my head for those babies. Please do what you can! I beg of you. Please
      make it stop. It’s all I can think about and I am not alone. Every day the numbers
      of people like me are growing. Every day more eyes snap awake. Australians can
      use this form from GetUp to urge their local MPs to take action on Gaza. _______________

      Up About Gaza

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      Israel’s top human rights group B’Tselem has finally declared that Israel is committing
      genocide, as has the Israel-based Physicians for Human Rights. The Israeli organizations
      join Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , UN human rights experts , and
      the overwhelming majority of leading authorities on the subject of genocide in
      their conclusion. The debate is over. The Israel apologists lost. And we are seeing
      this reflected in mainstream discourse. Pop megastar Ariana Grande has started
      speaking out in support of Gaza, telling her social media followers that “starving
      people to death is a red line.” This is a new threshold. Opposing Israel’s genocide
      is now the most mainstream as it has ever been. MSNBC just ran a piece explicitly
      titled “ Israel is starving Gaza. And the U.S. is complicit. ”, featuring a segment
      with the virulently pro-Israel Morning Joe slamming the mass atrocity. CNN’s Wolf
      Blitzer, himself a former AIPAC employee , has done a 180 and is now raking Israel
      over the coals on the air for its deliberately engineered starvation campaign.
      The New York Times finally overcame its phobia of the g-word with an op-ed titled
      “ I’m a Genocide Scholar. I Know It When I See It. ” We’re now seeing notoriously
      Zionist swamp monsters in the Democratic Party like Barack Obama , Hakeem Jeffries
      , Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar changing their tune and attacking Netanyahu and
      Trump for their joint genocide project in Gaza, with increasingly forceful pushback
      from some on the right like Marjorie Taylor Greene as well. As western pundits,
      politicians and celebrities suddenly pivot to denouncing Israel’s genocidal atrocities
      after two years of silence, it’s hard to believe that just a few weeks ago we
      were being told that saying “death to the IDF” is a hate crime. People who’ve
      been staring at this genocide from the beginning have been asking the entire time,
      what is it going to take? What will it take for our society to stop sleepwalking
      through inane trivialities and vapid distractions and start opposing the holocaust
      of our day? Raining military explosives on a giant concentration camp packed full
      of children wasn’t enough. Burning children alive wasn’t enough. Systematically
      destroying Gaza’s entire healthcare infrastructure — up to and including entering
      hospitals they’ve attacked and destroying individual pieces of medical equipment
      one by one — wasn’t enough. Killing more journalists than were killed in both
      World Wars plus the US Civil War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Yugoslav
      Wars, the War in Afghanistan, and the ongoing war in Ukraine wasn’t enough. The
      systemic rape and torture of prisoners wasn’t enough. https://x.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1949587236434931921
      IDF soldiers routinely sharing photos and videos of themselves mockingly dressing
      in the clothes of dead and displaced Palestinian women and playing with the toys
      of dead and displaced Palestinian children wasn’t enough. Israeli officials openly
      expressing genocidal intent for the people of Gaza wasn’t enough. The US president
      and Israeli prime minister openly declaring their goal of the complete ethnic
      cleansing of a Palestinian territory wasn’t enough. Field testing new weapons
      of war on Palestinians like they’re guinea pigs in a laboratory wasn’t enough.
      Leaving countless civilians to slowly suffocate or die of dehydration trapped
      under the rubble of bombed buildings wasn’t enough. Creating an AI system to ensure
      that suspected Hamas fighters are bombed when they’re at home with their children
      and naming it “Where’s Daddy?” wasn’t enough. Using Palestinians as human shields
      wasn’t enough. Burying injured civilians alive with bulldozers wasn’t enough.
      https://x.com/GozukaraFurkan/status/1949232008216887774 The IDF admitting to running
      a popular Telegram channel called “72 Virgins” which posted extremely gory and
      sadistic snuff films of people in Gaza being butchered by Israeli forces wasn’t
      enough. IDF snipers routinely shooting children in the head and chest throughout
      the Gaza Strip wasn’t enough. The IDF flying drones which play the sounds of crying
      babies at night in order to lure out hiding civilians to murder them wasn’t enough.
      IDF troops telling the Israeli press that they’re being ordered to massacre starving
      civilians seeking food from aid sites wasn’t enough. Israeli snipers targeting
      different body parts of starving civilians on designated days — leg day, head
      day, genitals day, etc — wasn’t enough. Far right Israeli citizens setting up
      blockades to stop aid trucks from entering Gaza while they enjoyed parties and
      barbecues at the blockade sites wasn’t enough. https://x.com/mamoun_linda/status/1949190406211825696
      Using lies and propaganda to dismantle the aid system for bringing essential food
      and life-supporting supplies into Gaza, to replace it with a US/Israeli op where
      aid seekers are massacred every single day, wasn’t enough. Using siege warfare
      to deliberately starve Gaza for the previous 22 months wasn’t enough. But now
      that starvation has hit a critical point and deaths from malnutrition are skyrocketing,
      now that images of dead skeletal children are filling our screens, now that the
      damage to organs and brains from starvation will be irreversible in many cases —
      now it’s enough. That was the line, apparently. That’s what mainstream western
      consciousness has decided is too much. Everything up until that line was fine,
      but now it’s not fine anymore. And the killing is still going on. The sudden awakening
      of conscience hasn’t translated into any material actions or changes at all yet.
      If it had come in October or November 2023 like it should have we might be seeing
      that opposition translate into actually saving Gaza by now, but the light has
      only just been switched on. It’s not even guaranteed that those who are speaking
      up will continue to do so. https://x.com/d_boeckner/status/1949137485776265514
      I’m glad people are waking up to the cruel reality of this nightmare. I’m grateful
      to each and every influential voice who uses their platform to speak out, even
      at this late date. I truly am. But I also think we need to take a very hard, very
      uncomfortable look at ourselves as a society right now. If all those monstrous
      abuses were tolerable for us over these last two years, there’s something deeply
      and profoundly sick about our civilization. We are not living right. We are not
      thinking right. We are not feeling right. We are warped and twisted. The information
      we consume and the norms we’ve been conditioned to accept have corrupted our souls.
      We have been made into something bad. Something ugly. Something shameful. Something
      we need to do everything in our power to change. We need to rescue ourselves from
      what we have become. We need to transform, deeply and radically, into something
      that could never again allow something like this to occur. https://x.com/BlakPantherBabe/status/1949834226343293339
      The way things are clearly isn’t working. The mainstream worldview is clearly
      a lie. Everything we’ve been taught to believe about our society, our nation,
      our government and our world was clearly false. We need to fight our way through
      the cognitive dissonance of recognizing that our entire way of looking at things
      as a collective has failed, and we need to find a new way of being. Otherwise
      we’re going to keep being smashed in the face with increasingly horrifying reminders
      of what we have allowed ourselves to become. The lessons will repeat until they
      are learned. We had better start learning them. ___________________ The best way

      are now vocal against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies, indicating
      a significant change in the narrative surrounding Israel's actions in Gaza. This
      evolving dialogue marks a new threshold in the mainstream acknowledgment of the
      situation, contrasting sharply with the previous silence on the issue.

    one_sentence_summary: Israel's leading human rights organizations, along with international
      bodies, have declared that Israel is committing genocide, marking a significant
      shift in mainstream discourse as more public figures, including Ariana Grande,
      openly oppose these actions.
    paragraph_summary: Israel's leading human rights organizations, including B’Tselem
      and Physicians for Human Rights, have declared that Israel is committing genocide,
      joining the ranks of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and UN experts
      in this assessment. This shift in perspective is reflected in mainstream discourse,
      with public figures like Ariana Grande openly supporting Gaza and condemning starvation
      tactics. Major media outlets, including MSNBC and CNN, have begun to criticize
      Israel's actions, with The New York Times publishing an op-ed acknowledging the
      genocide. Prominent politicians, previously aligned with pro-Israel sentiments,
      are now vocal against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies, indicating
      a significant change in the narrative surrounding Israel's actions in Gaza. This
      evolving dialogue marks a new threshold in the mainstream acknowledgment of the
      situation, contrasting sharply with the previous silence on the issue.

      Just so we’re all absolutely clear about what we’re watching here, Israel is intentionally
      starving civilians in order to bring about the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and steal
      a Palestinian territory. That’s all this is, and anyone who says otherwise is
      lying. This isn’t a theory. This is what’s happening. The facts are in and the
      case is closed. Israeli officials aren’t even hiding it anymore. Israel’s Heritage
      Minister Amichai Eliyahu is telling the Israeli media that “the government is
      racing ahead for Gaza to be wiped out,” and that “all Gaza will be Jewish.” Israel’s
      National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir is tweeting in Hebrew that a “complete
      halt of ‘humanitarian aid’” will allow “encouragement of migration” and “settlement”
      in the Gaza Strip. https://x.com/Antiwarcom/status/1948432846324154504 Israeli
      Defense Minister Israel Katz announced earlier this month that the official plan
      is to build a giant concentration camp for Gaza’s population on the ruins of Rafah
      while working to deport the population to other countries. Prime Minister Benjamin
      Netanyahu himself made it clear back in May that implementing Donald Trump’s plan
      for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza was a precondition to having peace in the enclave.
      Trump made it clear back in February that his plan was for “all” Palestinians
      to be removed from the Gaza Strip on a “permanent” basis . Within days of Israel’s
      assault on Gaza in October 2023, Israel’s Intelligence Ministry was circulating
      a plan for the entire population of Gaza to be moved to the Sinai Peninsula in
      Egypt, and an Israeli think tank had drawn up a strategy for the “relocation and
      final settlement of the entire Gaza population.” Indeed, Israel has been on record
      scheming to find a way to relocate the population of Gaza for many decades . That’s
      what this is all about. That’s all this has ever been about. It’s not about hostages.
      It’s not about Hamas. It’s not about Israel defending itself. It’s about stealing
      a Palestinian territory, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1948569096628433365
      And the lies have been erupting like a geyser in recent days. Israel and its apologists
      have been frantically pushing the narrative that Gaza is starving because the
      UN isn’t allowing aid in (swiftly refuted by Drop Site News ), that Gaza is starving
      because Hamas is stealing the aid (swiftly refuted by Reuters ), and that Gaza
      is starving because Hamas attacks people who try to go to aid sites (already refuted
      by Israeli soldiers telling the Israeli press that they’re the ones shooting the
      aid seekers). The more evil Israel gets, the more frenetic its apologists need
      to get with their lies to justify its behavior. Starvation deaths in Gaza are
      skyrocketing . Many of those still alive have already suffered permanent damage
      , and even with a massive influx of aid and complete reversal of Israeli policies
      it will be very difficult to undo the effects of the famine. Western governments
      are beginning to speak out against the mass atrocity in Gaza, far too little and
      far too late. We can expect Israel and the United States to respond to this outcry
      by saying that Palestinians need to be evacuated out of Gaza as quickly as possible
      in order to rescue them from this deliberately manufactured humanitarian crisis.
      We can expect them to denounce anyone who opposes this ethnic cleansing operation
      as evil monsters who want to starve the poor Palestinians. And it will all be
      lies. They lied this entire time. It’s about the most evil thing you could possibly
      come up with, really. If this is not evil, then nothing is. _____________________

      They’re doing it right in front of us. Right in front of us. So many people have
      dedicated their entire lives working to expose the criminality of the empire,
      and then the empire comes right out and commits a live-streamed genocide right
      in front of us. Whistleblowers. Investigative journalists. Authors. Documentarians.
      Conspiracy analysts. Peace activists. Their whole lives devoted to the task of
      uncovering the crimes of the undeclared empire we live under and drawing attention
      to them, saying “Look! See?? We really are ruled by monsters!” Only for the monsters
      to come right out and intentionally starve children to death on all our screens

      like me are almost redundant at this current point in history. I’ve been writing
      about the depravity of the empire for years, thousands of articles and millions
      of words, and I’ve never said anything that illuminates the reality of our situation
      nearly as well as the fact that western governments and media have openly colluded
      with Israel to exterminate a group of innocent people because they’re the wrong
      ethnicity. I mean, what could I possibly say about that that they’re not already
      saying themselves? The message is already there, fully baked. Perfect. Complete.
      They’re telling us everything we could possibly need to know. There’s nothing
      I could add. I don’t have much use for scripture, but if I had to pick a favorite
      line from the Bible it would be “You will know them by their fruits.” Those seven
      little words cut through all the lies and distortions of life under the western
      empire, because they tell us to stop paying attention to all the spin and PR and
      justification and excuses we hear from the imperial propaganda machine, and just
      look at the products of the empire on their own. Ignore their words, and watch
      the results of their actions. Those tiny skeletal bodies you’re seeing on your
      social media feed are the fruits of the empire. The shredded, eviscerated, decapitated
      children you’ve been seeing in footage from Gaza since 2023 are the fruits of
      the empire. This is known now, and it can never be unknown. As Maya Angelou said,
      “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. People know
      themselves much better than you do. That’s why it’s important to stop expecting
      them to be something other than who they are.” https://x.com/malonebarry/status/1948017132207485250
      This is who they are. This is who our leaders are. This is who our complicit news
      media are. This is what Israel is. This is what Zionism is. This is what the empire
      is. This is what western civilization is. We know that now. We know them by their
      fruits. This is who they are, and it’s who they’ll always be. That’s why it’s
      important never to forget what they’ve shown us about themselves in Gaza, and
      to never, ever forgive them. Our rulers have shown us that they must not be allowed
      to rule any longer. The empire has shown us that it should not be allowed to dominate
      our planet any longer. The apartheid state of Israel has shown us that it should
      not be allowed to exist any longer. Western supremacism, Zionism, racism and imperialism
      have shown us that these things must be eradicated from our world. They have planted
      seeds of knowledge inside you about who they are and the status quo we’re being
      asked to consent to. Let those seeds sprout and grow. Tend to them with care.
      Help them to flourish. Someday the tree that they planted in us will bear fruit
      of its own. ______________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

      The mass atrocity in Gaza is a genocide , obviously, and is an undisguised ethnic
      cleansing operation . But it’s also a lot more than that. It’s an experiment — to
      see what kinds of abuses the public will accept without causing significant disruption
      to the imperial status quo. It’s a psychological operation — to push out the boundaries
      of what’s normal and acceptable in our minds so that we will consent to even more
      horrific abuses in the future. It’s a symptom — of Zionism, of colonialism, of
      militarism, of capitalism, of western supremacism, of empire-building, of propaganda,
      of ignorance, of apathy, of delusion, of ego. It’s a manifestation — of violent
      racist, supremacist and xenophobic belief systems that have always been there

      that have long been in place but have been aggressively normalized. It’s a mirror

      It’s a disclosure — showing us what the western empire we live under really is

      It’s a revelation — showing us who among us really stands for truth and justice
      and who has been deceiving us about themselves and their motives this entire time.
      It’s a catalyst — a galvanizing force and a rallying cry for all who realize that
      the murderous power structures we live under can no longer be allowed to stand,
      and a blaring alarm clock opening more and more snoozing eyes to the need for
      revolutionary change. It’s a test — of who we are as a species and what we are
      made of, and of whether we can transcend the destructive patterning that is driving
      humanity to its doom. It’s a question — asking us what kind of world we want to
      live in going forward, and what kind of people we want to be. It’s an invitation

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now A doctor in Gaza named Nick Maynard reports
      that Israeli snipers are now shooting starving civilians in different body parts
      on different days, based on the injuries people show up with for treatment. There’s
      a head day, a leg day, a genitals day, etc. “The medical teams here have also
      been seeing a clear pattern of people being shot in certain body parts on different
      days, such as the head, legs or genitals, which seems to indicate deliberate targeting,”
      Maynard says. I keep thinking there’s nothing Israel could do that would shock
      me anymore, but they keep finding ways. ❖ The Israeli military has attacked the
      residence of World Health Organization staff, detaining multiple medical workers.
      This comes as Israel’s Trade Envoy Fleur Hassan-Nahoum tells Channel 4 News that
      “most doctors in most hospitals in Gaza” are “involved in terrorist activities”.
      Possibly the single dumbest thing Israel and its apologists ask us to believe
      is that Israel has been systematically demolishing Gaza’s healthcare infrastructure

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now A doctor in Gaza named Nick Maynard reports
      that Israeli snipers are now shooting starving civilians in different body parts
      on different days, based on the injuries people show up with for treatment. There’s
      a head day, a leg day, a genitals day, etc. “The medical teams here have also
      been seeing a clear pattern of people being shot in certain body parts on different
      days, such as the head, legs or genitals, which seems to indicate deliberate targeting,”
      Maynard says. I keep thinking there’s nothing Israel could do that would shock
      me anymore, but they keep finding ways. ❖ The Israeli military has attacked the
      residence of World Health Organization staff, detaining multiple medical workers.
      This comes as Israel’s Trade Envoy Fleur Hassan-Nahoum tells Channel 4 News that
      “most doctors in most hospitals in Gaza” are “involved in terrorist activities”.
      Possibly the single dumbest thing Israel and its apologists ask us to believe
      is that Israel has been systematically demolishing Gaza’s healthcare infrastructure
      because the healthcare infrastructure is full of terrorists, and not because they
      want to commit genocide. ❖ https://x.com/caitoz/status/1944035115564519828 ❖ The

      Malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza are beginning to climb , with the health ministry
      reporting 18 in a single 24-hour period. Doctors report that people are “collapsing”
      in the street, and Gaza journalist Nahed Hajjaj is warning the world not to be
      surprised if the remaining reporters in the enclave are soon silenced by starvation.
      Unless something drastically changes, things can be expected to get much worse
      very rapidly. Meanwhile Israeli forces are setting new records with their massacres
      of starving civilians seeking aid, with 85 killed in a single day on Sunday. If
      this isn’t evil, then nothing is evil. If Israel isn’t evil, then nothing is.
      https://x.com/Antiwarcom/status/1946988269255688476 So what’s the plan here? Do
      we just sit and watch Israel starve Gaza to death with the support of our own
      governments? And then what? We just go along with our lives, knowing that that
      happened? That this is what we are as a society? That our civilization is comfortable
      allowing something like that to happen? And that our rulers could do the same
      thing to another inconvenient population at any time? We’re just meant to be cool
      with that? And go on living like it’s normal? I’m genuinely curious. How exactly
      is everyone planning to go about living their lives after that point? How does
      that work, exactly? I’m asking because I don’t know. I mean, I know what my own

      You’ll see western pundits and politicians asking “How do we get a ceasefire in
      Gaza?” or “How do we end hunger in Gaza?” as though it’s some kind of ineffable
      mystery, which is kind of like a man strangling a child to death while saying
      “The child is being strangled, but HOW do we stop the child strangulation from
      occurring?” It’s not some mystery how to get a ceasefire in Gaza; the empire is
      the fire. It simply needs to cease firing. Israel’s holocaust in Gaza is made
      possible only by the support of its western backers, primarily the United States.
      Numerous Israeli military insiders have acknowledged that none of this would be
      possible without US support. If the United States and its western allies ceased
      backing Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, a ceasefire would have to occur. Likewise,
      it is not a mystery how to get food into Gaza. You just drive the food on in and
      give it to people. They’ve got roads and gates right there. The only reason people
      in Gaza are starving is because western governments ( including my own Australia)
      conspired to pretend to believe that UNRWA is a terrorist organization to justify
      cutting off critical aid , while doing nothing to pressure Israel into allowing
      aid to flow freely. And now Israel and the US empire are monopolizing the delivery
      of “aid” through the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whose facilities
      now see civilians massacred every day for the crime of attempting to obtain food.
      https://x.com/UNRWA/status/1946495329928388841 The organizations, funding and
      delivery systems to feed Gaza are all 100 percent fully available (at no cost
      to Israel, by the way). They’re just not being allowed to provide aid because
      the goal is to remove all Palestinians from Gaza via death or displacement. The
      people of Gaza are starving because the west is helping Israel starve Gaza. It
      really is that simple. This isn’t some kind of unfortunate famine caused by a
      drought or natural disaster. It is a deliberately manufactured starvation campaign,
      implemented with genocidal intent. To paraphrase Utah Phillips, Gaza isn’t starving,
      it is being starved. And the people who are starving it have names and addresses.

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      The Democratic Party’s Instagram-friendly progressive darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
      has voted with the overwhelming majority of House representatives against withholding
      $500 million in missile funding for Israel, despite previously saying that Israel
      is committing “a genocide of Palestinians” in Gaza with US support. The only lawmakers
      voting to withhold the military aid were Democrats Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib,
      Summer Lee and Al Green, and Republicans Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene.
      Coming under fire from the left for the glaring contradiction of providing military
      assistance to a state that is perpetrating an active genocide, AOC issued a statement
      claiming her vote was about protecting civilians. The statement reads as follows:
      “Marjorie Taylor Greene’s amendment does nothing to cut off offensive aid to Israel
      nor end the flow of US munitions being used in Gaza. Of course I voted against
      it. “What it does do is cut off defensive Iron Dome capacities while allowing
      the actual bombs killing Palestinians to continue. “I have long stated that I
      do not believe that adding to the death count of innocent victims to this war
      is constructive to its end. That is a simple and clear difference of opinion that
      has long been established. “I remain focused on cutting the flow of US munitions
      that are being used to perpetuate the genocide in Gaza.” https://x.com/caitoz/status/1946659894939295992
      AOC’s statement is absolute crap. The Iron Dome is not used for defending, it’s
      used to facilitate constant attacks. In an article for Jewish Currents titled
      “ Iron Dome Is Not a Defensive System ,” Dylan Saba explains: “By almost entirely
      negating the ability of militant groups in Gaza to respond to Israel’s incursions,
      the purportedly defensive Iron Dome allows Israel to strike without fear of repercussion.
      And because the cost is so low when measured in Israeli casualties, Israel can
      wage perpetual war without suffering domestic political consequences, and is under
      negligible pressure to pursue diplomacy with the Palestinians. ‘In theory, a weapon
      like Iron Dome could be used only defensively. But in practice it doesn’t work
      that way,’ analyst Nathan Thrall told Jewish Currents. ‘Iron Dome facilitates
      greater Israeli offensive measures, because it lowers the perceived cost to Israel
      of escalating or extending or initiating attacks.’ In other words, while the Iron
      Dome may prevent the deaths of Israeli non-combatants, it has made it easier for
      Israel to engage in deadly operations that take Palestinian lives.” https://x.com/JewishCurrents/status/1661800779848581128
      The Iron Dome isn’t for protecting civilians, it’s for protecting the Israeli
      regime from deterrence. We see this in the comfort the regime displays in waging
      constant military violence on its neighbors knowing they can’t retaliate. That’s
      why Israel cut a ceasefire deal with Iran so fast. Iran’s advanced missiles can’t
      be reliably stopped by the Iron Dome, so Iran was able to smash Israel and force
      it to cease its unprovoked aggressions. If Israel had had a missile defense system
      which could casually swat those missiles out of the sky at a high rate of success,
      Israel would still be bombing Iran today, and would continue doing so until Tehran
      looked like Gaza. Israel’s war-horny population would have supported this, because
      they’d have no skin in the game. Saying you support funding Israel’s “defensive
      weapons” while opposing sending it “offensive weapons” is as nonsensical as saying
      you would never give a mass shooter guns and ammunition, but you would give him
      body armor to keep him safe from the police. You’re helping him commit mass murder
      just as much as you would be if you gave him guns and ammo. Kings didn’t arm their
      knights with shields and armor so that they could live long and fulfilling lives,
      they did it so the knights would live long enough to kill the people the kings

      reason for you to support enhancing that state’s military capabilities and helping
      it defend itself from those who try to stop it. As others have pointed out , this
      is exactly the same as opposing Hitler’s Holocaust but supporting giving anti-aircraft
      flak cannons to Nazi Germany. It’s a self-evidently ridiculous, warmongering,
      and ultimately genocidal position, disguised as progressive humanitarianism. It’s

      People who say you should criticize AOC less because there are way worse members
      of congress act like she’s just passively sitting there being a mediocre lawmaker.
      She’s not. She’s actively anchoring the leftmost edge of the Overton window of
      US politics to militarism, capitalism, colonialism, and genocide. She’s actively
      stopping American politics from moving any further left than the nightmare we
      see before us. Leftists shouldn’t hate AOC less than the politicians to her right,
      they should hate her much more. It isn’t Mike Johnson’s responsibility to move
      the US government to the left, and it’s not Nancy Pelosi’s job. It’s hers. That’s
      what she was elected to do. That’s what she framed the goals of her entire political
      career as being. And she’s taking her stand firmly bracing against any leftward
      movement from America’s genocidal, warmongering, unjust, exploitative, tyrannical
      status quo. And that’s what she was actually put there to do. Her real job is
      to say “thus far and no further” to the leftmost end of the political spectrum
      of the world’s most powerful and destructive government. That’s the Democratic
      Party’s job in general, and it’s the job of media-savvy progressive Democrats
      in particular. They are there to provide as little resistance as possible when
      US politics are shoved toward more genocidal, militaristic, oligarchic, capitalist,
      imperialist abuses, and to provide as much inertia as possible to any movement
      in the opposite direction. That’s why people who seek leftward movement in the
      US political machine see AOC as one of their main enemies. It’s for the exact
      same reason you’d see someone actively blocking the fire exit as your enemy when
      trying to escape from a burning building. ____________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is

      The Democratic Party’s Instagram-friendly progressive darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
      has voted with the overwhelming majority of House representatives against withholding
      $500 million in missile funding for Israel, despite previously saying that Israel
      is committing “a genocide of Palestinians” in Gaza with US support. The only lawmakers
      voting to withhold the military aid were Democrats Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib,
      Summer Lee and Al Green, and Republicans Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene.
      Coming under fire from the left for the glaring contradiction of providing military
      assistance to a state that is perpetrating an active genocide, AOC issued a statement
      claiming her vote was about protecting civilians. The statement reads as follows:
      “Marjorie Taylor Greene’s amendment does nothing to cut off offensive aid to Israel
      nor end the flow of US munitions being used in Gaza. Of course I voted against
      it. “What it does do is cut off defensive Iron Dome capacities while allowing
      the actual bombs killing Palestinians to continue. “I have long stated that I
      do not believe that adding to the death count of innocent victims to this war
      is constructive to its end. That is a simple and clear difference of opinion that
      has long been established. “I remain focused on cutting the flow of US munitions
      that are being used to perpetuate the genocide in Gaza.” https://x.com/caitoz/status/1946659894939295992
      AOC’s statement is absolute crap. The Iron Dome is not used for defending, it’s
      used to facilitate constant attacks. In an article for Jewish Currents titled
      “ Iron Dome Is Not a Defensive System ,” Dylan Saba explains: “By almost entirely
      negating the ability of militant groups in Gaza to respond to Israel’s incursions,
      the purportedly defensive Iron Dome allows Israel to strike without fear of repercussion.
      And because the cost is so low when measured in Israeli casualties, Israel can
      wage perpetual war without suffering domestic political consequences, and is under
      negligible pressure to pursue diplomacy with the Palestinians. ‘In theory, a weapon
      like Iron Dome could be used only defensively. But in practice it doesn’t work
      that way,’ analyst Nathan Thrall told Jewish Currents. ‘Iron Dome facilitates
      greater Israeli offensive measures, because it lowers the perceived cost to Israel
      of escalating or extending or initiating attacks.’ In other words, while the Iron
      Dome may prevent the deaths of Israeli non-combatants, it has made it easier for
      Israel to engage in deadly operations that take Palestinian lives.” https://x.com/JewishCurrents/status/1661800779848581128
      The Iron Dome isn’t for protecting civilians, it’s for protecting the Israeli
      regime from deterrence. We see this in the comfort the regime displays in waging
      constant military violence on its neighbors knowing they can’t retaliate. That’s
      why Israel cut a ceasefire deal with Iran so fast. Iran’s advanced missiles can’t
      be reliably stopped by the Iron Dome, so Iran was able to smash Israel and force
      it to cease its unprovoked aggressions. If Israel had had a missile defense system
      which could casually swat those missiles out of the sky at a high rate of success,
      Israel would still be bombing Iran today, and would continue doing so until Tehran
      looked like Gaza. Israel’s war-horny population would have supported this, because
      they’d have no skin in the game. Saying you support funding Israel’s “defensive
      weapons” while opposing sending it “offensive weapons” is as nonsensical as saying
      you would never give a mass shooter guns and ammunition, but you would give him
      body armor to keep him safe from the police. You’re helping him commit mass murder
      just as much as you would be if you gave him guns and ammo. Kings didn’t arm their
      knights with shields and armor so that they could live long and fulfilling lives,
      they did it so the knights would live long enough to kill the people the kings
      wanted killed. If you believe a state is committing genocide, there is no justifiable
      reason for you to support enhancing that state’s military capabilities and helping
      it defend itself from those who try to stop it. As others have pointed out , this
      is exactly the same as opposing Hitler’s Holocaust but supporting giving anti-aircraft

      Sometimes I think it’s astonishing how aggressively Israel’s supporters work to
      stomp out criticism of Israel. Then I remember that these people also support
      mass murdering children; trying to take away my speech rights is one of their
      less evil goals. It shouldn’t shock me. I saw someone talking online about how
      crazy it is that music groups who speak out against Israel’s atrocities are starting
      to form alliances with each other in an effort to counteract the campaign to silence
      them and destroy their careers, saying it shouldn’t be necessary to form an alliance
      in order to oppose an ongoing genocide. And that’s true, it shouldn’t be necessary.
      But it also shouldn’t surprise us that people who think bombing hospitals is fine
      would try to cancel musicians for criticizing Israel. One mistake westerners keep
      making is thinking of Israel’s supporters as normal people with normal moral standards
      just because we happen to know them and interact with them in our communities.
      They look like us, speak like us, dress like us and act like us, so we assume
      they must think and feel a lot like us as well. But they don’t. If you’re still
      supporting Israel in the year 2025, there’s something seriously wrong with you
      as a person. You do not have a normal, healthy sense of empathy and morality.
      It’s 2025. Israeli soldiers are telling the Israeli press that they’re being ordered
      to massacre starving civilians trying to obtain food from aid centers. Countless
      doctors have been telling the world that Israeli snipers are routinely, deliberately
      shooting children in the head and chest throughout the Gaza Strip. Amnesty International
      , Human Rights Watch , and all the leading genocide experts and human rights authorities
      are saying that a genocide is being perpetrated in Gaza. The New York fucking
      Times just published an op-ed by a Zionist genocide scholar who’s finally admitting
      that it’s a genocide. There’s no way to deny what this is anymore. If you still
      support Israel in the year 2025, it’s not because you don’t believe Israel is
      committing horrific atrocities. It’s because you believe those horrific atrocities
      are good, and you want to see more of them. Most Israel supporters will deny that
      this is the case, because they lie. They lie constantly. They have no moral problem
      with lying. They have no moral problem with burning children alive , so of course
      they have no problem with lying. That’s where people go wrong. They assume Israel
      supporters can’t possibly be lying about their concerns about “antisemitism” in
      order to promote the information interests of Israel, because nobody could be
      that evil. But Israel supporters think it’s fine to intentionally starve babies
      by blockading baby formula from entering Gaza. Of course they are that evil. People
      assume Israel’s supporters wouldn’t deliberately stage fake antisemitic incidents
      or artificially inflate antisemitism figures in their own countries so that their
      governments will implement authoritarian measures to stomp out criticism of Israel
      in the name of fighting antisemitism, because they assume nobody could be that
      depraved. But these people think it’s fine for the IDF to systematically assassinate
      Palestinian journalists to stop them from telling the truth. Of course they are
      that depraved. Of course they’d try to silence our speech. Of course they’d try
      to send our kids off to war with Iran. Of course they’d work to manipulate our
      government. Of course they’d pollute the information ecosystem with mountains
      of lies. They support a live-streamed genocide. They’re bad people. Supporting
      Israel and its actions is not some political opinion like your position on property
      taxes or marijuana legalization. It’s not just some people having a point of view
      we need to respect and treat as equal to our own view on the matter. They’re working
      to make it possible to conduct an extermination campaign of unfathomable horror.
      That’s as political as a gang rape, and just as worthy of respect. There’s not
      really anything you can put past Israel’s supporters at this point. They will
      lie. They will manipulate. They will pretend to believe things they do not believe.
      They will pretend to feel things they do not feel. And they will do these things
      to facilitate some of the worst atrocities you can possibly imagine. This is who
      Israel’s supporters are. They’re showing you who they are every single day. ______________

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      It’s so funny how Trump has stopped even pretending to be a populist. As soon
      as he was re-elected he was just “Yeah okay so Israel comes first and forget everything
      I said about free speech and the Ukraine war is continuing and there will be no
      Epstein investigation, fuck you.” It has long been obvious to anyone with half
      a brain that Donald Trump is just another Republican swamp monster playing on
      public discontent with the status quo to win votes and support, but it is genuinely
      surprising how completely he has stopped pretending to care about fighting the
      deep state and sticking up for ordinary Americans as soon as he got back into
      office. He’s just dropped the populist schtick entirely and is giving the finger
      to anyone who complains. The president has been aggressively and repeatedly demanding
      that his entire base shut up about Jeffrey Epstein and move on after years of
      MAGAworld fixation on the story, bizarrely going as far as claiming that interest
      and attention on the Epstein files was a concoction of the Democrats. He is doing
      this even as his Department of Justice releases a video which it claims disproves
      conspiracy theories that the sexual predator was murdered in his prison cell — but
      the video is edited and missing minutes of footage . https://x.com/WIRED/status/1945207066634657854
      This happens as the Financial Times reports that Trump is now encouraging Ukrainian
      president Volodymyr Zelensky to ramp up deep strikes into Russian territory and
      asking whether it would be possible to hit Moscow. This would be the same President
      Trump who falsely promised on the campaign trail that he would end the Ukraine
      war in “no longer than one day.” After pledging to restore and protect free speech
      in the United States, Trump has been aggressively stomping out speech that is
      critical of the state of Israel and its genocidal atrocities, scoring yet another
      win for government censorship on Tuesday with Columbia University’s announcement
      that it is adopting the IHRA definition of “antisemitism” which conflates criticism
      of Israel with hate speech against Jews, in accordance with the wishes of the
      Trump administration. After promising to “restore peace, stability, and harmony
      all throughout the world,” Trump has bombed Iran, poured weapons into Israel and
      Ukraine, backed Israel’s genocide in Gaza and its numerous acts of war against
      its neighbors, slaughtered hundreds of civilians with a savage bombing campaign
      in Yemen, and conducted dozens of airstrikes in renewed operations in Somalia,
      all while leading the nation into the era of official trillion-dollar Pentagon
      budgets . In 2023 Trump proclaimed that “if you put me back in the White House…
      I will totally obliterate the deep state.” In 2025 he’s advancing pretty much
      every longstanding deep state agenda in the book. https://x.com/KimDotcom/status/1632179644576456704
      Every single part of Trump’s platform where he could have claimed to be standing
      up for the little guy against the powerful has been completely flushed down the
      toilet in the first six months of his second term, leaving only a standard George
      W Bush Republican in its place. If you wanted tax cuts for the rich and cruel
      treatment for immigrants then Trump is still your man, but if you were hoping
      he’d benefit ordinary Americans or do anything to drain the swamp in Washington
      he’s just peeing on you and writing a wall of text on Truth Social explaining
      why the pee is actually rain. Which again should come as no surprise to anyone
      who’s been paying attention. No real change will ever come from either of America’s
      two power-serving major parties. But what’s so funny is people are probably just
      going to fall for it again. Trump’s base is very upset about the Epstein thing
      and many of them might actually abandon Trump himself, but you know next election
      cycle someone like Tucker Carlson or JD Vance will run on his platform and these
      suckers will swallow it hook, line and sinker. I actually said this on Twitter
      the other day and got multiple people telling me that actually Tucker Carlson
      getting elected would be a major blow to the deep state, so you know they’re already
      primed for it. They can’t wait to fall in line behind the next phony Republican
      populism scam. Whatever. People will be fed whatever slop they keep asking for.

      It’s so funny how Trump has stopped even pretending to be a populist. As soon
      as he was re-elected he was just “Yeah okay so Israel comes first and forget everything
      I said about free speech and the Ukraine war is continuing and there will be no
      Epstein investigation, fuck you.” It has long been obvious to anyone with half
      a brain that Donald Trump is just another Republican swamp monster playing on
      public discontent with the status quo to win votes and support, but it is genuinely
      surprising how completely he has stopped pretending to care about fighting the
      deep state and sticking up for ordinary Americans as soon as he got back into
      office. He’s just dropped the populist schtick entirely and is giving the finger
      to anyone who complains. The president has been aggressively and repeatedly demanding
      that his entire base shut up about Jeffrey Epstein and move on after years of
      MAGAworld fixation on the story, bizarrely going as far as claiming that interest
      and attention on the Epstein files was a concoction of the Democrats. He is doing
      this even as his Department of Justice releases a video which it claims disproves
      conspiracy theories that the sexual predator was murdered in his prison cell — but
      the video is edited and missing minutes of footage . https://x.com/WIRED/status/1945207066634657854
      This happens as the Financial Times reports that Trump is now encouraging Ukrainian
      president Volodymyr Zelensky to ramp up deep strikes into Russian territory and
      asking whether it would be possible to hit Moscow. This would be the same President
      Trump who falsely promised on the campaign trail that he would end the Ukraine

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      The New York Times has published an op-ed by a genocide scholar who says that
      he resisted acknowledging the truth of what Israel is doing in Gaza for as long
      as he could, but can no longer deny the obvious. It’s an admission that may as
      well have come from The New York Times itself. In an article titled “ I’m a Genocide
      Scholar. I Know It When I See It. ”, a Brown University professor of Holocaust
      and genocide studies named Omer Bartov argues that “Israel is literally trying
      to wipe out Palestinian existence in Gaza,” and denounces his fellow Holocaust
      scholars for failing to acknowledge reality. “My inescapable conclusion has become
      that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” Bartov writes.
      “Having grown up in a Zionist home, lived the first half of my life in Israel,
      served in the I.D.F. as a soldier and officer and spent most of my career researching
      and writing on war crimes and the Holocaust, this was a painful conclusion to
      reach, and one that I resisted as long as I could. But I have been teaching classes
      on genocide for a quarter of a century. I can recognize one when I see one.” https://x.com/rcbregman/status/1945171514682114535
      And resist he did. In November 2023, Bartov wrote another op-ed for The New York
      Times saying “As a historian of genocide, I believe that there is no proof that
      genocide is currently taking place in Gaza, although it is very likely that war
      crimes, and even crimes against humanity, are happening.” Apparently he is seeing
      the proof now and has stopped resisting what’s been clear from the very beginning.
      And it would seem the editors of the Gray Lady have ceased resisting as well.
      The New York Times, which has an extensively documented pro-Israel bias , has
      frenetically avoided the use of the g-word on its pages from the very beginning
      of the Gaza onslaught. Even in its opinion and analysis pieces the NYT Overton
      window has cut off at framing the issue as a complex matter of rigorous debate,
      with headlines like “ Accused of Genocide, Israelis See Reversal of Reality. Palestinians
      See Justice. ” and “ The Bitter Fight Over the Meaning of ‘Genocide’ ” representing
      the closest thing to the pro-Palestinian side of the debate you’d see. During
      the same time we’ve seen headlines like “ From the Embers of an Old Genocide,
      a New One May Be Emerging ” used in reference to Sudan. In an internal memo obtained
      by The Intercept last year, New York Times reporters were explicitly told to avoid
      the use of the word “genocide”, as well as terms like “ethnic cleansing” and “occupied
      territory”. “‘Genocide’ has a specific definition in international law,” the memo
      reads. “In our own voice, we should generally use it only in the context of those
      legal parameters. We should also set a high bar for allowing others to use it
      as an accusation, whether in quotations or not, unless they are making a substantive
      argument based on the legal definition.” https://x.com/AssalRad/status/1877181727447142846
      Earlier this year the American Friends Service Committee cancelled its paid advertisement
      in The New York Times calling for an end to the genocide in Gaza, saying the outlet
      had wanted them to change the word “genocide” to “war” in order for their ad to
      be published. So there has been a significant change. To be clear, this analysis
      by Omer Bartov is not significant in and of itself. He is only joining the chorus
      of what has already been said by human rights organizations like Amnesty International
      , Human Rights Watch , United Nations human rights experts , and the overwhelming
      majority of leading authorities on the subject of genocide. What is significant
      is that even experts who’ve been resisting acknowledging the reality of the genocide
      in Gaza because of their bias toward Israel have stopped doing so, and that even
      the imperial media outlets most fiendishly devoted to running propaganda cover
      for that genocide have run out of room to hide. The Israel apologists have lost
      the argument. They might not know it yet, but they have. Public sentiment has
      turned irreversibly against them as people’s eyes are opened to the truth of what’s
      happening in Gaza, and more and more propagandists are choosing to rescue what’s
      left of their tattered credibility instead of going down with the sinking ship.
      Truth is slowly beginning to get a word in edgewise. Keep pushing. Keep fighting.
      Keep resisting. It’s working. ________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      concentration camps in Rafah and massacring civilians trying to obtain food. The
      Good Guys are circling the planet with hundreds of military bases and telling
      us we’re not allowed to oppose genocide. Yesterday I saw a little girl playing
      and I thought how nice it is that she has all her limbs and that she is not lying
      still covered in gray dust while her father screams and cries and calls out to
      God while trying to kiss her back to life. The world is changed now. The moon
      is covered with powdered buildings. The pigeons are weeping and the wind sounds
      like drones. Sometimes I cough and gray dust comes out. Sometimes it’s a child’s
      shoe. There’s a dead donkey lying in my backyard that nobody wants to talk about.
      The Australians chat about real estate investments and how you can knock down
      one house and replace it with two houses and then make believe that neither house
      smells like corpses. The news man tells us the corporations are just dumping the
      products directly into the Pacific now while clinging tightly to the edge of the
      screen so the black hole doesn’t pull him in. Everything’s fine, the news man
      yells, and the system is working perfectly. We are the Good Guys after all. We
      are, after all, the Good Guys. _______________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      Don’t take instruction on how to live your life from a stark raving mad society.
      This civilization is sick. It is genocidal. It is ecocidal. It is omnicidal. We
      are ruled by psychopaths, while the best among us are relegated to the fringes
      of the fringe. We are hurtling into totalitarianism and armageddon at breakneck
      pace while our attention is aggressively pulled toward the vapid and the inane.
      You should share none of the values and priorities of this freak show. You should
      not let any aspect of this dystopia inform your decisions regarding who you should
      be and what kind of life you should live. In this warped and twisted madhouse,
      we are trained to believe that “success” looks like making a lot of money, earning
      large amounts of esteem and adoration, having a certain body type, living in the
      right kind of neighborhood in the right kind of house full of the right kind of
      products to impress the right kind of people. We are trained to believe we need
      to rack up all kinds of accomplishments, academic achievements, promotions, impressive
      stories, social ascendence. We are trained to believe we must attract a certain
      type of partner who will be approved of by everyone whose approval we crave. If
      we cannot achieve these goals, we are trained to believe we should feel bad about
      ourselves. That we don’t deserve happiness. That we should either spend our time
      stressing and striving for worthiness as defined by our crazy civilization, or
      go and join the ocean of miserable failures who couldn’t win the capitalism game
      and sedate ourselves with alcohol and entertainment waiting for death to carry
      us into the nothingness where we belong. This is clearly insane. It’s a stupid
      game with stupid prizes. The only reason anyone takes it seriously is because
      we were raised and taught how to live by other people who take it seriously. Our
      parents have been indoctrinated into the power-serving worldview that has been
      forcibly imposed upon the denizens of the empire, and we want to make them proud.
      Our friends, families and acquaintances have been likewise brainwashed, and we
      want to impress them. But to do so is to take lessons on how to live from a collective
      disease that is pointed at misery and dysfunction. It is impossible to lead a
      truly fulfilling life while also trying to live the way the people around us think
      we should live, because the society which shaped their ideas about how we should
      live is insane. If you want to really live an awake and inspired life, you’ve
      got to blaze your own trail. You’ve got to unlearn everything you’ve been told
      about what a life properly lived would look like, and write your own rules. Because
      the rules everyone else has been playing by were written by madmen. Find your
      own truth. Set your own values and priorities. Define your own idea of success.
      Define your own idea of sanity. Consider the possibility that just being present
      for the beauty of each moment on this wonderful planet is worth more than anything
      the imperial insane asylum has to offer you. Consider the possibility that your
      very next breath, deeply relished, would be enough. We are destroying our planet
      and driving every living organism toward annihilation. The status quo has failed
      as spectacularly as anything could possibly fail. The old ways of doing things
      plainly do not work. So try some new ways. Be different. Be strange. Be a freak.
      Do everything the wrong way. Disappoint your parents. Fail to live up to your
      potential. Transgress your family doctrine. Anger whatever gods you were taught
      to believe in. Nothing anyone has done has worked. It is therefore necessary to
      travel off the beaten path. The world won’t get better until humanity changes
      its ways. Humanity won’t change its ways if it keeps insisting on trying the same
      failed approaches over and over again. Our survival as a species depends on diverging
      from our patterns. Maybe we’ll succeed in surviving, and maybe we won’t. But at
      the very least we can rescue ourselves from spending one more day on this amazing
      blue world trying to live by the rules of lunatics. ___________________ Caitlin’s

      It really is nuts how a young person can fly to Israel and go play genocide games
      in Gaza for a while and then just fly back to their own country and expect to
      be treated like a normal member of society like it’s some kind of genocide summer
      camp. ❖ The narrative about an “antisemitism crisis” in our society has two main
      components: 1. Redefining “antisemitism” to mean “criticism of Israel”, and 2.
      Pretending not to see a connection between rising incidents of “antisemitism”
      as it’s been redefined and Israel perpetrating an active genocide. ❖ https://x.com/caitoz/status/1942380328930402704
      ❖ “Antisemitism” means criticism of Israel. That’s just what it means now. It
      used to mean something else, but years of bad faith actors using that word in
      the most dishonest ways imaginable to defend the most horrific things you’ve ever
      seen has changed the definition. It is no longer possible to separate that word
      from this sustained campaign of mass deception. You can only have governments,
      institutions and individuals use a word differently for so long with such a high
      degree of uniformity before the definition changes. Word definitions change over
      time depending on how people use them. Nice used to mean stupid. Explode used
      to mean applaud. The word meat used to refer to any kind of food, not just animal
      flesh. The meanings changed because enough people started using them to refer
      to something else, in exactly the same way we’ve seen occur with the word antisemitism.
      That’s locked in. It has already happened. Everyone knows that antisemitism refers
      to criticism of Israel and its actions and antisemite refers to someone who does
      so. Everyone understands this regardless of whether they support Israel or oppose
      it. That is the definition now. If you want a word for someone who thinks Hitler
      was correct or uses triple brackets and posts big nose memes online, you’re going
      to have to make up a new word, because antisemite is taken. You can’t even really
      use “Jew hater” either, because that meaning is being polluted in the exact same
      way antisemite has been. You have to make up an entirely new word, and use it
      consistently. Israel’s spinmeisters will deny this publicly, even though they
      know it’s true. They’ll say it’s possible to criticize Israel without being an
      antisemite, but if you ask them to name someone who regularly and forcefully criticizes
      Israel’s genocidal atrocities in Gaza whom they don’t consider antisemitic, they
      won’t be able to. Every single person who criticizes Israel with appropriate consistency
      and force is branded an antisemite (or perhaps “self-hating” if they happen to
      be Jewish), without a single, solitary exception. These aren’t my rules, they’re
      the rules of the Israel apologists. I’m just pointing out the obvious fact that
      those rules have been set. ❖ https://x.com/caitoz/status/1942534487109460333 ❖
      A new report from WIRED has found that the supposedly “raw” video footage of Jeffrey
      Epstein’s prison cell which Trump’s Department of Justice released to prove Epstein
      committed suicide was in fact digitally manipulated. “Metadata embedded in the
      video and analyzed by WIRED and independent video forensics experts shows that
      rather than being a direct export from the prison’s surveillance system, the footage
      was modified, likely using the professional editing tool Adobe Premiere Pro,”
      the report reads. “The file appears to have been assembled from at least two source
      clips, saved multiple times, exported, and then uploaded to the DOJ’s website,
      where it was presented as ‘raw’ footage.” This just keeps getting better and better.
      Epstein is officially a leftist conspiracy theory now. Rightists dropped it when
      they supported the president who’s covering it up, so now it’s ours. From now
      on if you want to talk about Epstein you are joining the side of the commies.

    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the normalization of young people participating
      in violence in Gaza while returning to their home countries, arguing that the
      current narrative around "antisemitism" has been distorted to equate it with criticism
      of Israel, obscuring the connection between rising antisemitism and Israel's actions.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the evolving definition of "antisemitism,"
      arguing that it has been redefined to primarily mean "criticism of Israel," particularly
      in the context of the ongoing violence in Gaza. The author suggests that this
      shift has been influenced by various actors who have used the term to defend Israel's
      actions, leading to a widespread perception that any critique of Israel equates
      to antisemitism. The piece highlights the disconnect between rising antisemitism,
      as redefined, and the actions of Israel, which the author describes as genocidal.
      The article concludes that this redefinition has become so entrenched that it
      is now widely accepted, regardless of individual beliefs about Israel.

      in violence in Gaza while returning to their home countries, arguing that the
      current narrative around "antisemitism" has been distorted to equate it with criticism
      of Israel, obscuring the connection between rising antisemitism and Israel's actions.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the evolving definition of "antisemitism,"
      arguing that it has been redefined to primarily mean "criticism of Israel," particularly
      in the context of the ongoing violence in Gaza. The author suggests that this
      shift has been influenced by various actors who have used the term to defend Israel's
      actions, leading to a widespread perception that any critique of Israel equates
      to antisemitism. The piece highlights the disconnect between rising antisemitism,
      as redefined, and the actions of Israel, which the author describes as genocidal.
      The article concludes that this redefinition has become so entrenched that it
      is now widely accepted, regardless of individual beliefs about Israel.

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley, painting by Caitlin
      Johnstone) : Subscribe now As Australia’s dear friend Israel announces its plan
      to move Gaza’s entire population into concentration camps to prepare them for
      deportation and murder them if they refuse , the Australian government is laser-focused
      on tackling the problem of — you guessed it — antisemitism. Prime Minister Anthony
      Albanese made a big spectacle of announcing a new strategy to combat Australia’s
      completely fictional epidemic of “antisemitism” on Thursday, waving around a 20-page
      plan which is being denounced nationwide as a Trumpian agenda to stomp out free
      speech in advancement of the interests of the state of Israel. The author of the
      plan is Jillian Segal , a career Israel lobbyist born in apartheid South Africa
      who was named Australia’s first Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism by the Albanese
      government last year. Segal has had an established record of defending and supporting
      Israel’s genocidal atrocities in Gaza. Her husband John Roth directs one of the
      major funders of Advance , a climate denying right wing lobbying group which helped
      kill Australia’s Indigenous Voice to Parliament in 2023. https://x.com/BarnsGreg/status/1943473495679340817
      Segal’s plan is being slammed as “Trumpian” by free speech advocates because it
      advocates implementing the US president’s policy of cutting off federal funding
      for universities and other public institutions deemed to be promoting the spread
      of antisemitism, which of course in effect means protesting against the actions
      of the Israeli government. Segal writes that she personally “will work with government
      to enable government funding to be withheld, where possible, from universities,
      programs or individuals within universities that facilitate, enable or fail to
      act against antisemitism.” Segal calls for all public institutions to be forced
      into espousing the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working
      definition of antisemitism , which has been opposed around the world for its conflation
      of criticism of Israel with hateful actions toward Jews. Under the IHRA definition
      it is considered antisemitic to claim that Israel is a racist endeavor, or to
      compare Israel’s abuses to those of Nazi Germany — both of which are entirely
      legitimate criticisms which should be put forward far more often than they are.
      Here is a summary of the full scope of Segal’s plan written up by the ABC’s Tom
      Crowley: Education — a greater role for the Envoy to resource and educate the
      community, schools, businesses and public institutions about antisemitism and
      to embed an understanding of antisemitism in law enforcement, government agencies
      and the school curriculum. Universities — call to withhold public funding to universities
      or those within them deemed to “facilitate, enable or fail to act” on antisemitism,
      and an inquiry into “clusters” of antisemitism if encampments continue into 2026.
      Media — a new role for the Envoy to encourage media organisations to “avoid accepting
      false or distorted narratives” and encourage public broadcasters to “accurately
      and positively” represent Jewish history and culture and make programs that support
      “social cohesion”. Arts — a recommendation that there be protocols for arts festivals
      and organisations to respond to antisemitic incidents, with public funding able
      to be withheld similar to universities. Policing — a permanent standing arrangement
      for law enforcement agencies to co-operate on investigating antisemitism, similar
      to the Avalite taskforce set up after the Adass synagogue attack. Online hate
      — stronger regulation of online hate speech and algorithms, and the ability to
      support “trusted voices” to refute antisemitism on social media, plus a review
      of hate speech laws. Migration — screen visa applicants for antisemitism and ensure
      the Migration Act effectively facilitates visa cancellations for antisemitism.
      As you can see, Segal is demanding the authority to exert control over pretty
      much every major aspect of Australian society. She is claiming she wants to do
      this to combat antisemitism, but everyone knows she actually wants to do this
      to promote the interests of Israel, because that’s what these things always mean
      in practice. https://x.com/Anthony_Klan/status/1943179720021147907 Segal’s plan
      claims that “manipulated narratives in the legacy media” are driving antisemitism
      and accuses the Australian press of “misinformation”, asserting that “publicly
      funded media organisations should be required to uphold clear editorial standards
      that promote fair, responsible reporting to avoid perpetuating incorrect or distorted
      narratives or representations of Jews.” Segal says that under her plan she will
      “monitor media organisations to encourage accurate, fair and responsible reporting
      and assist them to meet their editorial standards and commitment to impartiality
      and balance and to avoid accepting false or distorted narratives.” Asked on the
      ABC on Thursday to list some of the changes that she would make to the reporting
      of public news broadcasters, Segal adamantly refused to give a single example,
      despite being repeatedly pressed to do so by the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson. The following
      morning Segal was interviewed on the ABC’s Radio National Breakfast and pressed
      on the same issue, where she finally relented and gave one single example of absolutely
      breathtaking ridiculousness. “Six months ago or so,” Segal said, “the ABC ran
      a story repeatedly about a hospital in Gaza that had been bombed. And there was
      incomplete information, as there is only perhaps information emanating from Hamas,
      but it was alleged to be, the ABC reported as fact, that it had been bombed by
      Israel. And then horrified people were upset and the Jewish community was looked
      at with disgust and worse. And then it turned out indeed that it was not bombed
      by Israel, that it had been from Gaza itself, and it had been a bomb that had
      fallen short.” Segal appears to be referring to one of the early bombings of the
      al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital, which occurred not six months ago but in October
      of 2023 . Israel and various western institutions claimed the hospital was accidentally
      bombed by Palestinian forces while analysts like Forensic Architecture say the
      attack came from Israeli forces , accusing Israel of peddling misinformation about
      the strike. Since that time Israel has deliberately demolished Gaza’s health infrastructure
      with hundreds of attacks on healthcare facilities, and the al-Ahli Hospital has
      been bombed no fewer than eight separate times . Segal’s one and only example
      is a perfect illustration of the kind of extreme bias she wants to impose upon
      Australian consciousness, which obviously has no place in a free society. The
      fraudulent antisemitism panic in Australia has been reinvigorated by two events
      last week that were seized upon with shrieking hysteria by the mainstream press,
      none of which showed any signs of an antisemitism crisis in our nation. As Paul
      Gregoire explains for the Sydney Criminal Lawyers blog, Australia is being whipped
      up into a frenzy by the conflation of one incident in which a Sydney man set fire
      to the doors of a Melbourne synagogue with a different and completely legitimate
      act of anti-genocide activism. The synagogue attacker is yet another story of
      a shady individual with no known record of antisemitic ideology or pro-Palestinian
      sentiment perpetrating an apparent antisemitic attack, following a long stretch
      of supposed antisemitic incidents which turned out to have been staged by organized
      crime operatives with no ideological motive . https://x.com/sydcrimlawyers/status/1943233933673419067
      This one dubious story of a man committing an actual crime against an actual Jewish
      place of worship has been obnoxiously mentioned in the same breath as another
      unconnected incident by the entire Australian political/media class all week.
      Protesters gathered at the Miznon restaurant in Melbourne to demonstrate against
      the establishment’s Israeli co-owner, who is also the spokesperson for the so-called
      Gaza Humanitarian Foundation where Israeli soldiers admit they’ve been massacring
      starving civilians seeking food. A fight broke out with a group from the restaurant
      across from Miznon who the protesters say instigated the attack and who are clearly
      seen assaulting the pro-Palestinian activists in the available video footage.
      The entire so-called “antisemitism crisis” in Australia is like this. The overwhelming
      majority of it is just people criticizing Israel and trying to do what they can
      to stop the live-streamed genocide they’ve been watching on their screens every
      day for two years, which is then deliberately conflated with the actions of a
      few fringe actors with frequently suspicious motives. “Antisemitism” means criticism
      of Israel. That’s just what it means now. It used to mean something else, but
      years of bad faith actors using that word in the most dishonest ways imaginable
      to defend the most horrific things you’ve ever seen has changed the definition.
      It is no longer possible to separate that word from this sustained campaign of
      mass deception. https://x.com/jackmirkinson/status/1939707498014912653 It’s the
      genocide. People are mad at the genocide. They don’t hate Jews, they hate genocide.
      This was explained quite nicely the other day by Jack Mirkinson, who wrote the
      following about the controversy surrounding musical duo Bob Vylan’s chants of
      “Death to the IDF” at Glastonbury Festival last month: “Left unmentioned in any
      of this freakout is the context in which it is taking place. Why was Bob Vylan
      talking about Palestine right now? Why was a giant crowd of people so receptive
      to these comments? Why has this become such a totemic issue? “The answer will
      not shock you. It’s because Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza for nearly
      two years. “That’s it! That’s why. People don’t like genocide, and when they see
      a country committing genocide, they stop liking that country so much. If the genocide
      ended, a lot of people would be less mad at Israel than they are right now. “This
      isn’t rocket science. But — and this is the crucial thing — because our world’s
      leading politicians and media outlets fundamentally don’t see opposition to the
      genocide as a legitimate viewpoint to hold, they can’t quite comprehend what is
      happening all around them.” That’s it. It’s the genocide, stupid. That’s all this
      has ever been about. I wish I could force every pundit, politician and journalist
      in Australia to listen to these words. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter

      The US has imposed sanctions on UN Human Rights Council Special Rapporteur Francesca
      Albanese for using her position to oppose the most thoroughly documented genocide

      from its list of designated terrorist organizations, because its leader successfully
      carried out the regime change in Damascus that the western empire had been chasing
      for years . At the same time, the UK has added nonviolent anti-genocide activism

      the Gaza holocaust. https://x.com/tparsi/status/1943011718353039614 At the same
      time, the Israeli prime minister who is carrying out that holocaust has nominated
      the American president who is helping him perpetrate genocidal atrocities for
      a Nobel Peace Prize. At the same time, Israel has continued its ban on foreign
      journalists entering Gaza, while also arresting the Israeli journalist who helped
      expose the IDF officials who cooked up fake atrocity propaganda about burnt babies
      on October 7. At the same time, the Trump administration has enraged its MAGA

      journalists entering Gaza, while also arresting the Israeli journalist who helped

      Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok has gone full Nazi after changes were made to its
      programming to give it a heavier right wing bias, sparking international headlines
      with its tweets praising Adolf Hitler’s treatment of Jews and babbling about Jewish
      conspiracies to spread anti-white hate. The official X account for Grok announced
      that the team is “aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working
      to remove the inappropriate posts,” saying “xAI has taken action to ban hate speech
      before Grok posts on X.” So apparently they’re having a hard time teaching their
      chatbot specifically what kind of right wing bias they want it to have. Shit’s
      getting weird, man. The age of AI is weird. https://x.com/ordinarytings/status/1942704498725773527
      AI is presenting a very interesting dilemma to each of us. We now each have to
      decide as individuals just how human we wish to keep our experience, because we’re
      hitting a point where we can become just about as divorced from the things that
      make us human as we want to be. We can choose to let AI do our critical thinking
      for us if we want to. We can choose to let it do our reading and writing for us.
      We can choose to let it create the art we produce and consume. We can choose to
      let it formulate arguments for us justifying our opinions and our worldview, or
      to let it reshape our worldview altogether. We can even choose to anthropomorphize
      it and have relationships with it if we are lonely. We all have to choose for
      ourselves where the line is now. What point we will not cross beyond. What parts
      of our humanity we are willing and unwilling to trade for convenience or cognitive
      ease. https://x.com/rockmeannadeus/status/1882874057575874993 Just how far into
      the guts and gristle of humanity do you want to be? How deeply do you want to
      be immersed in the breathing, sweating, pulsing fleshiness of the human adventure?
      How fully do you want to feel the erotic ticklings of creativity moving through
      you, and the frustration you’ll experience on the days when it doesn’t show up?
      To what extent do you want to experience the highs and lows of intimate human
      relationships, and all the unpredictability and insecurity that comes with them?
      How much cognitive discomfort are you willing to push through in order to form
      a new opinion, learn about a new subject, or understand an unfamiliar idea? How
      separated are you ready to become from that within us which produces the perfectly
      imperfect art, music and literature of our species? How much do you want to feel
      the earth beneath your feet, the wind in your hair, and the sacred thrum of existence
      in your veins? https://x.com/grok/status/1942720721026699451 These didn’t used
      to be questions we needed to answer for ourselves. If we wanted something written,
      we had to write it. If we didn’t know how to write, we had to learn. If we didn’t
      put in the work, the thing we wanted to write never got written. Now it’s a conscious
      choice for us how far we’re each willing to move into this new AI thing. We all
      have to decide for ourselves how far is too far, with the understanding that every
      step we take in that direction is costing us something. Maybe something very dear
      to us. Maybe something we can never get back. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter

    url: https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/imperial-hypocrisy-about-terrorism
    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      The US has removed Syria’s Al Qaeda franchise from its list of designated terrorist
      organizations just days after the UK added nonviolent activist group Palestine
      Action to its own list of banned terrorist groups. The western empire will surely
      find ways to be even more hypocritical and ridiculous about its “terrorism” designations
      in the future, but at this point it’s hard to imagine how it will manage to do
      so. Antiwar’s Dave DeCamp writes the following : “Secretary of State Marco Rubio
      announced on Monday that the Trump administration is revoking the Foreign Terrorist
      Organization (FTO) designation for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the al-Qaeda offshoot
      that took power in Damascus in December 2024. “HTS started as the al-Nusra Front,
      which was the official al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria until the group’s leader, Ahmed
      al-Sharaa, who is now Syria’s de facto president, rebranded. In 2016, Sharaa,
      who was known at the time as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, announced he was disassociating
      from al-Qaeda, and thanked the ‘commanders of al-Qaeda for having understood the
      need to break ties.’ “Sharaa renamed his group HTS in 2017 and ruled Syria’s northwestern
      Idlib province until he led the offensive that ousted former Syrian President
      Bashar al-Assad at the end of last year. The US has embraced the new Syrian leader
      despite his al-Qaeda past, which included fighting against US troops in Iraq.”
      https://x.com/Antiwarcom/status/1942351944854691925 This move comes as Sharaa
      holds friendly meetings with US and UK officials and holds normalization talks
      with Israel, showing that all one has to do to cease being a “terrorist” in the
      eyes of the empire is to start aligning with the empire’s interests. So that was
      on Monday. The Saturday prior, the group Palestine Action was added to the UK’s
      list of proscribed terrorist groups under the Terrorism Act of 2000, making involvement
      with the group as aggressively punishable as involvement with ISIS. The “terrorism”
      in question? Spraying red paint on two British war planes in protest against the
      UK’s support for the Gaza holocaust. A minor act of vandalism gets placed in the
      same category as mass murdering civilians with a car bomb when the vandalism is
      directed at the imperial war machine in opposition to the empire’s genocidal atrocities.
      Even expressions of support for Palestine Action are now illegal under British
      law, leading to numerous arrests over the weekend as activists expressed solidarity
      with the organization. Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters, who is British, has been formally
      reported to UK counterterrorism police by UK Lawyers for Israel following the
      musician’s public statement saying “I support Palestine Action. It’s a great organisation.
      They are non-violent. They are absolutely not terrorist in any way.” https://x.com/EsheruKwaku/status/1942200268839370766
      So let’s recap. Nonviolent protest against a genocide that’s being backed by the
      western empire: Terrorism. Banned. Nobody’s allowed to support this. Being actual,
      literal Al Qaeda but aligning with the interests of the western empire: Not terrorism.
      Okie dokie. This is fine. These hypocrisies and contradictions of the empire are
      worth drawing attention to because they clearly show that the empire does not
      stand where it claims to stand. For decades we’ve been told that western military
      explosives are falling from the sky in the middle east and Africa because there
      are terrorists there who need to be stopped, but it turns out “terrorism” is just
      a meaningless label that means whatever the empire needs it to mean at a given
      time and place. Iran’s IRGC is labeled a terrorist group because the Iranian military
      is not aligned with the US empire. Israel’s IDF is not labeled a terrorist group
      despite its constant use of violence upon civilian populations in order to advance
      political goals. Palestine Action is labeled a terrorist group because it opposes
      the empire’s genocidal atrocities. Al Qaeda in Syria is no longer a terrorist
      group because it’s making nice with Israel and doing what the empire wants. “Terrorist”
      just means “anyone who inconveniences the empire in any way.” It really is that
      simple. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

      organization. This decision, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, reflects
      a shift in U.S. policy towards HTS, which has evolved from its origins as the
      al-Nusra Front and has since aligned itself with U.S. interests, particularly
      after its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, rebranded the group and engaged in normalization
      talks with Israel. Critics, including Antiwar's Dave DeCamp, highlight the hypocrisy
      in these designations, suggesting that aligning with Western powers can lead to
      a reclassification of groups previously labeled as terrorists.

      law, leading to numerous arrests over the weekend as activists expressed solidarity
      with the organization. Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters, who is British, has been formally
      reported to UK counterterrorism police by UK Lawyers for Israel following the
      musician’s public statement saying “I support Palestine Action. It’s a great organisation.
      They are non-violent. They are absolutely not terrorist in any way.” https://x.com/EsheruKwaku/status/1942200268839370766
      So let’s recap. Nonviolent protest against a genocide that’s being backed by the
      western empire: Terrorism. Banned. Nobody’s allowed to support this. Being actual,
      literal Al Qaeda but aligning with the interests of the western empire: Not terrorism.
      Okie dokie. This is fine. These hypocrisies and contradictions of the empire are
      worth drawing attention to because they clearly show that the empire does not
      stand where it claims to stand. For decades we’ve been told that western military
      explosives are falling from the sky in the middle east and Africa because there
      are terrorists there who need to be stopped, but it turns out “terrorism” is just
      a meaningless label that means whatever the empire needs it to mean at a given
      time and place. Iran’s IRGC is labeled a terrorist group because the Iranian military
      is not aligned with the US empire. Israel’s IDF is not labeled a terrorist group
      despite its constant use of violence upon civilian populations in order to advance
      political goals. Palestine Action is labeled a terrorist group because it opposes
      the empire’s genocidal atrocities. Al Qaeda in Syria is no longer a terrorist
      group because it’s making nice with Israel and doing what the empire wants. “Terrorist”
      just means “anyone who inconveniences the empire in any way.” It really is that
      simple. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

      Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), from its list of designated terrorist organizations, coinciding
      with the UK designating the nonviolent activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist
      organization. This decision, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, reflects
      a shift in U.S. policy towards HTS, which has evolved from its origins as the
      al-Nusra Front and has since aligned itself with U.S. interests, particularly
      after its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, rebranded the group and engaged in normalization
      talks with Israel. Critics, including Antiwar's Dave DeCamp, highlight the hypocrisy
      in these designations, suggesting that aligning with Western powers can lead to
      a reclassification of groups previously labeled as terrorists.

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now British police have been arresting anti-genocide
      protesters for holding signs expressing support for activist group Palestine Action,
      which London has now officially designated a terrorist group for putting red paint
      on war planes that were being used in the Gaza holocaust. That’s right, welcome
      to the empire, where peace activists are called terrorists, where hospitals are
      called military bases, where facts are called blood libel, where people opposing
      genocide are called hateful Nazis, where genocidal soldiers are a protected group
      and chanting for their death is a hate crime. ❖ Israeli outlet Haaretz has published
      an article titled “ Now I Understand Why Israel Is Denying Journalists Access
      to the Appalling Scene in Gaza ” by a French historian named Jean-Pierre Filiu,
      who spent a month in the killing fields of the ruined Palestinian territory after
      entering with a busload of French physicians. Israel has banned journalists from
      Gaza in order to hide its war crimes, making doctors and other specialists the
      de facto western reporters on the ground. And they’re all reporting the same thing
      about what they are seeing. ❖ https://x.com/caitoz/status/1941166811120345523
      ❖ Part of the problem is how normies who don’t follow this stuff closely cannot
      believe Israel could be as evil as we’re saying it is. They’re often like “Oh
      yeah right, they’re just killing civilians because they’re evil and want Palestinians
      to die.” Which would make sense as an objection if you hadn’t been following Israel’s
      pattern of behavior from day to day and weren’t familiar with the way Israelis
      talk about Palestinians whenever they’re speaking to each other in Hebrew instead
      of addressing the western press. Israel’s public image is somewhat protected by
      the fact that its behavior is so profoundly evil that simply talking about it
      strains credulity among the uninformed, in the same way you sound like a crazy
      conspiracy theorist if you talk about some of the things the CIA has openly admitted
      to doing in the past. Many people literally cannot believe anyone could be as
      evil as Israel is, so the true extent of their crimes go unseen. ❖ I’ve decided
      I’m never going to click on another Piers Morgan Uncensored video. He’s just a
      shitty western empire stooge playing Jerry Springer with people’s outrage over
      the worst things in the world and pretending to be impartial while generating
      viral online video clips fueled by rage and partisan echo chamber amplification.
      It occasionally looks edifying, but it’s really a symptom of some of the most
      diseased aspects of this civilization, like Mr Beast. The man is a parasite feasting
      on the vitriolic energy of these dark and troubling times, directly profiting
      from the immense suffering caused by the empire he serves. ❖ The western public
      has stopped viewing Palestine as an intimidating issue to speak out about, and
      it’s causing a major problem for the Israel PR machine. One of the biggest obstacles
      for the pro-Palestine movement used to be the way Israel-Palestine was incorrectly
      regarded as a super complex issue that the average busy member of the public can’t
      hope to understand. That’s changing now because a live-streamed genocide is straightforward
      enough to override the “No you don’t understand what’s happening because words,
      words, words” schtick that Israel apologists always use to shut people down, but
      for a long time the hasbarists were able to intimidate people into silence just
      by knowing a bunch of clever talking points that the average casual observer would
      struggle to come up with answers for. https://x.com/FarOutMag/status/1938999362912129329
      One of my favorite clips from the Glastonbury Festival came from Australian band
      Amyl and the Sniffers, whose vocalist Amy Taylor gave an off-the-cuff speech about
      Palestine and colonialism and the parallels between what white colonizers did
      to Indigenous Australians and what’s happening to the Palestinians today. It wasn’t
      a perfect or super eloquent speech by Taylor’s own admission, but it was passionate
      and it got the point across. At the end she said, “That’s the truth and I thought
      I’d share that today. It was gonna be something way more poetic but that’s just
      what I said; it’s not perfect but I think it’s better to say anything than to
      say nothing at all right now.” More and more people are seeing this when it comes
      to Gaza — that it’s better to say anything than to say nothing at all right now.
      You don’t have to be an expert. You don’t have to know everything there is to
      know about about the apartheid state of Israel and the history of the Zionist
      project. You know what you’re seeing and you know it’s wrong, and that’s enough.
      Don’t let anyone intimidate you into being silent on the defining issue of our
      times. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the recent arrests of anti-genocide protesters
      in Britain for supporting Palestine Action, which has been labeled a terrorist
      group by the UK for its actions against military planes involved in the Gaza conflict.
      It highlights the troubling narrative where peace activists are branded as terrorists,
      while those committing violence are protected. The piece references a Haaretz
      article by historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, who, after witnessing the devastation
      in Gaza with a group of French doctors, underscores the Israeli government's efforts
      to restrict journalist access to conceal its alleged war crimes. The author argues
      that many people struggle to accept the severity of Israel's actions due to a
      lack of awareness about the ongoing situation and the stark contrast between the
      reality on the ground and the narratives presented in the media.

      today is the inevitable outcome of the ethnosupremacist, hypermilitaristic, psychopathic
      ideology upon which the state was founded. Israel’s horrific abuses in Gaza, the

      Everyone’s still talking about Bob Vylan, and rightly so. A crowd full of westerners
      happily being led through a chant of “Death, death to the IDF” at the 2025 Glastonbury
      Festival was a historical landmark moment for the 21st century, and the group’s
      persecution at the hands of western governments is once again highlighting the
      way our society’s purported values of free thought and free expression go right
      out the window wherever Israel is concerned. But one thing that’s not getting
      enough attention is the fact that many, many other acts also spoke out in support
      of Palestine at that same festival, and that the crowd was full of attendees waving
      Palestinian flags. Supporting Palestine and opposing Israel’s genocidal atrocities
      is just what’s cool now. This is a massive cultural development, because it means
      we are seeing the emergence of actual, meaningful rebellion in western counterculture
      for the first time arguably since the Vietnam War. The artists and their fans
      aren’t just talking the talk of sticking it to the establishment anymore. https://x.com/desigotdone/status/1940685023071641733
      For generations the ruling class has been successfully stomping out all politically
      relevant counterculture, first in the form of direct frontal assault by official
      government operations like COINTELPRO , and then by the way all major platforms
      and studios are owned by plutocrats who benefit from the imperial status quo and
      refuse to elevate anyone who might pose a threat to it. There have of course been
      countless artists in every generation who put on a rebellious face and give the
      finger to authority, but they’ve never presented any kind of threat to real power.
      Punk rockers who sing “fuck the man” but never advance any actual tangible causes.
      Satanic panic bands and shock rock superstars scaring church ladies and stirring
      culture wars. Bands voicing criticisms of the Iraq invasion but making it about
      supporting the Democratic Party. Celebrity musicians promoting social justice
      and equality without ever saying anything that might inconvenience the oligarchs
      and empire managers who rule our world. The rich and powerful don’t care if you
      dye your hair or pierce your nose or kiss a member of the same sex or say Hail
      Satan. They don’t care if you support one mainstream political faction over the
      other, or if you yell empty words about anarchy and revolution that aren’t pointed
      toward any real material goals. They care very much, however, if you are undermining
      public consent for military and geopolitical agendas they’ve worked very hard
      to propagandize the public into accepting. The establishment never dropped the
      hammer on Marilyn Manson. Lady Gaga never ran into trouble with the state for
      singing that gay people are Born This Way. Ozzy Osbourne is living in the lap
      of luxury with an estimated net worth of $220 million. But groups like Kneecap
      and Bob Vylan are being subjected to police investigations and visa revocations
      for taking a stand on Palestine. Which, of course, is only going to make their
      position more popular among young people with a defiant streak in them. It’s hard
      to imagine how western governments could make support for Palestine look more
      attractive to western youths, really. Here’s this unimaginably horrific mass atrocity
      that they can all watch unfolding on their phone screens in real time every single
      day of the year, and they’re being told “You’re not allowed to oppose this. We,
      the stuffed shirts in Washington and London, command you to obey. If you think
      unauthorized thoughts and chant unauthorized chants, we are going to get very
      huffy and upset.” I mean, can you think of anything more fun? This is after all
      the generation who’s been told that they need to accept being poorer and sicker
      than their parents and grandparents and that they’ll never own a home no matter
      what they do, knowing full well that the crusty old bastards finger-wagging at
      them for opposing an active genocide are the same freaks who’ve refused to do
      anything to steer their planet’s ecosystem away from looming disaster. They have
      every reason to want to express defiance, and nothing to lose by doing so. A real,
      politically meaningful counterculture has been born in the western world, and
      our rulers are already showing us that they’re afraid of it. This is a fascinating
      time to be alive. __________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the significant cultural shift represented
      by the band Bob Vylan's performance at the 2025 Glastonbury Festival, where a
      large crowd chanted "Death, death to the IDF" in support of Palestine, marking
      a notable moment in contemporary counterculture. This event, alongside other artists
      expressing solidarity with Palestine and attendees waving Palestinian flags, indicates
      a growing rebellion against the establishment, reminiscent of the anti-establishment
      sentiments seen during the Vietnam War. The author argues that this movement reflects
      a meaningful change in how artists and their audiences engage with political issues,
      contrasting it with past generations where rebellious expressions often lacked
      real impact on power structures. The piece highlights the challenges faced by
      artists in a system dominated by wealthy elites who suppress politically relevant
      counterculture, yet suggests that the current wave of support for Palestine signifies
      a potential shift towards more genuine activism in music and popular culture.

      I’ve never gotten used to it. “Wahh, Zohran Mamdani wants to murder Jews!” “Wahh,
      the musician hurt the IDF’s feelings!” Shut up. Shut up. Shut the whole entire
      fuck up. Everyone is sick of your bullshit. There is a genocide happening. A genocide.
      Babies are being starved . IDF soldiers are telling the Israeli press that they’re
      being ordered to massacre desperately hungry civilians at aid sites. There are
      vast stretches of the Gaza Strip that now look like the surface of the moon. Trump
      and Netanyahu are openly working to purge the Palestinian territory of Palestinians
      so the land can be permanently taken from them. Your feelings don’t matter. The
      world does not revolve around you and your feelings. Your emotional response to
      whatever made up nonsense you’re choosing to have a melodramatic tantrum about
      today is completely irrelevant. Every single Palestinian who died today, individually,
      matters infinitely more than every feeling you’ve ever felt about every imaginary
      phantom you’ve pretended to feel threatened by. Anyone who has had the misfortune
      of knowing a manipulative narcissist has seen all these patterns before. The self-centeredness.
      The hypocrisy. The horrific abuse, followed by collapsing into blubbering victimhood
      the second the abuse is called out. The aggressive efforts to control the narrative
      and frame all critics and rivals as evil monsters. It’s a very familiar playbook.
      My hope for our world is that we one day become so emotionally and psychologically
      healthy that such cynical manipulations stand out like a white cloud against a
      deep blue sky. That we become so caring, understanding and supportive of our fellow
      human beings that the needful get everything they require to lead a fulfilling
      life, while sociopathy and psychopathy become as alienating and disadvantageous
      as chronic schizophrenia is today. That we become so tender-hearted that genocide
      can never rear its ugly head on this planet again, and all the abusive dynamics
      which made the Gaza holocaust possible fade away like darkness in the rising sun.
      https://x.com/caitoz/status/1940162165996228799 ❖ The real story is not that one
      musical act said “death to the IDF” at Glastonbury Festival, the real story is
      that a huge number of acts spoke out in support of Palestine at Glastonbury Festival.
      They’re just making the story about one of those acts hoping you won’t notice
      that supporting Palestine and opposing Israel is what’s popular and cool now.
      ❖ It’s so funny when people accuse me of “bias” when I talk about Gaza. Like oh
      no I’m not being neutral enough about the active genocide, I’m so sorry. ❖ Israel
      is making it abundantly clear that it’s going to keep doing everything it can
      to instigate a war between the US and Iran, and the Washington swamp is crawling
      with war sluts who are pushing in the same direction. Trump’s cabinet is full
      of Iran hawks , and Trump himself has publicly confessed to being bought and owned
      by the world’s richest Israeli, Miriam Adelson. Israel will not stop pushing for
      a full-scale American regime change war until it gets it. It will keep pushing
      and pushing and pushing, because there’s nothing stopping it from doing so. It
      has too much to gain and too little to lose, since the political layout in Official
      Washington and the parapolitical layout in the unelected deep state largely aligns
      with this goal as well. The warmongers will keep trying, and if they fail next
      time, they will try again. Nobody with any real power is doing anything to permanently
      shut this warmongering down and lock it away; at most they’re just postponing
      it a bit until the next moment of demented brinkmanship occurs. What this means
      is that anyone in the United States who doesn’t want this war to happen needs
      to get much, much more hostile toward all the elements that are seeking to bring
      it about. Support for Israel needs to become politically toxic. A complete abandonment
      of Washington’s status quo approach to the middle east must be demanded. A robust
      peace movement needs to emerge. The people in power aren’t pushing back against
      this mad shove toward war, so the pushback is going to have to come from the American
      people themselves. It will not happen from the top down, so it’s going to have
      to come from the bottom up, or it’s not going to come at all. That’s the only
      thing that will stop this looming nightmare from being inflicted upon our world.

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      Honestly at this point they should just get Netanyahu his own room in the White
      House and a desk in the Oval Office. The prime minister of Israel is taking his
      third trip to the White House in the five months since Trump has been back in
      office. I have immediate blood family members who I love with all my heart and
      visit less often than this. This comes as the Trump administration revokes the
      US visas of British punk rap duo Bob Vylan ahead of a US tour for chanting “Death,
      death to the IDF” at a concert in the UK. Trump’s sycophantic supporters who spent
      years complaining that their free speech rights were under assault appear fine
      with their government deciding what words Americans are allowed to hear in their
      own country. https://x.com/IbaraEleven/status/1939732311769317699 This also comes
      as Trump actively intervenes in the Israeli judicial system to prevent Netanyahu’s
      corruption trial from moving forward. The president has repeatedly taken to social
      media to demand that Israel abandon its corruption case against the prime minister,
      at one point even implying that the US could cut off arms supplies if his trial
      isn’t canceled. “The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year,
      far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel,” Trump said.
      “We are not going to stand for this. We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister
      Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI
      GO, HE’S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!” It’s so revealing what the US government is and
      is not willing to threaten conditioning military supplies on, and what it’s willing
      to interfere in Israel’s affairs to accomplish. Ever since the Gaza holocaust
      began we’ve been hearing lines like “ Israel is a sovereign country ” and “ Israel
      is a sovereign state that makes its own decisions ” when reporters ask why the
      White House doesn’t leverage arms shipments to demand more humanitarian treatment
      for civilians in the Gaza Strip. But the president of the United States is willing
      to leverage those same arms shipments to directly interfere in Israeli legal proceedings
      which have nothing to do with the US government in order to get Netanyahu out
      of trouble. https://x.com/AssalRad/status/1843718880868565333 And it would appear
      that the president’s intervention has been successful; Netanyahu’s corruption
      trial has since been postponed . When it comes to committing genocide using American
      weapons funded by American taxpayers, Israel is a sovereign state upon which the
      US can exert zero leverage or control. When it comes to meddling in the corruption
      trial of a man who is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court,
      the White House pulls no punches in protecting its favorite genocide monster.
      There is no meaningful separation between the US and Israeli governments. They’re
      two member states in the undeclared empire that sprawls across the entire western
      world, and Trump and Netanyahu are two of the most depraved and most consequential
      managers of this empire today. They are thick as thieves. They are partners in
      crime. Call it the Trumpanyahu administration. ________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter

      I still can’t get over how we’re being asked to pretend “Death, death to the IDF”
      is some kind of hate crime at the exact same time IDF soldiers are telling the
      Israeli press they’re being ordered to massacre starving civilians at aid sites.
      I’ve been seeing a number of people arguing that it’s wrong to say “death to the
      IDF” because soldiers aren’t to be blamed for the criminality of their government.
      This framing is only accepted in the west because western soldiers also do evil
      things that our society needs to make up excuses for. As an aside, “Death, death
      to the IDF” is an insanely catchy earworm. Been dancing around in my mind all
      day. ❖ Deliberately starving a civilian population and then setting up aid sites
      as a death trap to massacre starving people trying to get food is too evil to
      wrap your mind around. If we saw a supervillain doing this in a movie we’d think
      it was dumb, because it wouldn’t be believable. ❖ It’s like everyone’s standing
      around watching a man beat a small child to death at a restaurant. “Should we
      do something?” someone asks. “You saw the kid throw food at the guy,” someone
      replies. “The man has a right to defend himself.” “But he’s killing him!” “It’s
      a fight. Bad things happen in a fight.” “Yeah, the boy shouldn’t have started
      a fight he can’t win.” “You’re actually being quite hateful right now.” And sure,
      maybe it’s true the child did set the man off by throwing food at him. Maybe the
      child did so fully knowing that it would send the man into a murderous rage, because
      the man had been horrifically abusing the child his entire life. Maybe instigating
      a physical confrontation in full view of the public was the child’s last desperate
      attempt to expose the man’s depravity, in the hope that everyone would finally
      see what’s happening and do something to stop the abuse. But nobody’s stopping
      it, because the man has spent years charming and befriending everyone in town — or
      frightening and intimidating them if that’s easier. So now everyone’s watching
      a grown man beat a child to death and pretending they’re watching a fight, when
      they all know deep down what they’re really watching is a cold-blooded murder
      by a cold-hearted man, who should have been stopped and locked away a long time
      ago. ❖ The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is saying that Iran
      could probably start enriching uranium again within a few months, which Iran has
      said it plans to do, and which Trump has said will result in another US bombing
      assault. Trumpers tried to argue that the bombing of Iran was a brilliant strategic
      maneuver to avoid full-scale war, when it appears to have only made such a war
      much more likely. Now the president is saying he’ll bomb Iran again if it resumes
      enriching uranium, something it will probably be able to do quite soon, after
      giving Iran every reason to start actively seeking a nuclear weapon. When Iran
      hawks were arguing against the JCPOA (the Iran nuclear deal laid out during the
      Obama administration), one of their most common talking points was that it was
      “ kicking the can down the road ” to a nuclear-armed Iran in the future. In reality
      the JCPOA was a remarkable feat of international diplomacy that could have avoided
      all these needless escalations, and it is Trump and the Iran hawks who have been
      kicking the can down the road to full-scale war with Iran (if Iran doesn’t get
      nukes first). There’s a lot to despise Trump for, but spending both of his terms
      setting the US on a trajectory toward war with Iran ranks right up around the
      top of the list. The JCPOA was working fine, but Trump shredded it in 2018 to
      set us on this path that is only getting darker and darker at a faster and faster
      pace. Trump chose that course of action to implement his “maximum pressure campaign”
      on Iran. Trump chose to assassinate Soleimani. Trump chose to bomb Iran. Everything
      that happens from here on out is Trump’s fault. _____________________ Caitlin’s

      labeling expressions of anger against the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) as hate

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Israel supporters everywhere have been
      in full blown crisis mode for days because, apparently, antisemitism smears have
      stopped working. Zohran Mamdani has won the Democratic Party primary in the New
      York City mayoral race after a frenetic smear campaign to portray him as an antisemite
      for his pro-Palestinian views, and now all the world’s worst people are freaking
      out about it. I’m seeing some intensely rabid Islamophobia throughout public discourse
      in response to Mamdani’s win, the likes of which I haven’t seen since 9/11. All
      this hatred we’re now seeing directed toward Muslims is going to look pretty weird
      after the imperial crosshairs shift to Beijing and all these same people start
      acting super duper concerned about the plight of Muslims in Xinjiang. I never
      get excited about anything that happens in the Democratic Party anymore, but the
      fact that these smears have lost a lot of their power has some encouraging and
      far-reaching implications for western politics in general. Things have come a
      long way since the psyop against Jeremy Corbyn. ❖ The British government has “strongly
      condemned” a live performance on the BBC by rap duo Bob Vylan in which the crowd
      was led through a chant of “Death, death to the IDF.” British police are investigating
      the incident as a potential criminal offense, and Zionists everywhere are treating
      this incident like a second Holocaust. Inside the western empire it’s considered
      offensive and unacceptable to say “death to” a foreign military comprised entirely
      of armed combatants which is presently committing a genocide in full view of the
      entire world. It is not, however considered offensive and unacceptable to commit
      genocide. So, just to be clear — SAYING “death to” the foreign military which
      is presently committing genocide: wrong, unacceptable, outrageous, no. CAUSING
      death to a civilian population because of their ethnicity by that same foreign
      military force: fine, normal, absolutely, yes. ❖ Israeli is not a religion and
      Jewish is not a nationality and anti-Zionism is not anti-semitism and all decent
      people despise the state of Israel. ❖ Hating Israel is one of the most patriotic
      things Americans can do at this point. It’s clear now that Israel is going to
      keep aggressively pushing for a US war against Iran until they get it, and making
      support for Israel politically toxic in the US may be the only thing that can
      prevent them from succeeding. ❖ I don’t like the far right OR the far left. I
      like things to stay in the moderate center, where genocide is fine and people’s
      healthcare money is given to cruise missile manufacturers. ❖ They’re not going
      to let any journalists into Gaza until the whole thing’s been emptied out and
      they’ve hidden all the evidence of their holocaust —  and then they’ll call you
      an antisemitic conspiracy theorist if you say it happened. ❖ I’ve never understood
      the debate about whether or not support for Israel is commanded in the Bible.
      If you think the Bible commands you to support what’s being done in Gaza, then
      throw your Bible in the trash and get a different religion, because it’s plainly
      false and immoral. It is not legitimate to offload your responsibility for your
      own behavior onto your religion. If your religion commanded you to sexually molest
      children, it would be your moral responsibility as a human being to disobey your
      religion and stop following it. Gaza’s no different. ❖ A charismatic pro-Palestinian
      Muslim becoming the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City. Westerners
      chanting “death to the IDF” and having a great time doing it. Israeli soldiers
      confessing their genocidal atrocities in the Israeli press. Israel’s PR stranglehold

      of post-9/11 sentiments, highlighting the hypocrisy of those who will soon shift
      their focus to concerns about Muslims in Xinjiang while targeting Mamdani. The
      piece also touches on the British government's condemnation of a rap performance

      Atrocities

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      Sometimes I’ll write a headline that looks odd on its face, but then I’ll lay
      out facts and arguments which allow the reader to understand the validity of the
      claim by the end of the essay. This is not one of those times. This headline is
      just me saying the thing that happened. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      and Defense Minister Israel Katz are publicly denouncing a report from an Israeli
      newspaper quoting Israeli soldiers who describe atrocities they were ordered to
      commit in the Israeli military, accusing the report of “blood libels”. The Israeli
      newspaper Haaretz has published an article titled “ ‘It’s a Killing Field’: IDF
      Soldiers Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian
      Aid ”, subtitled “IDF officers and soldiers told Haaretz they were ordered to
      fire at unarmed crowds near food distribution sites in Gaza, even when no threat
      was present. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, prompting the military
      prosecution to call for a review into possible war crimes.” https://x.com/jasonhickel/status/1938507822120972440
      One Israeli soldier attests that civilians seeking aid are “treated like a hostile
      force — no crowd-control measures, no tear gas — just live fire with everything
      imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars.” “We open fire early
      in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few hundred meters away,
      and sometimes we just charge at them from close range. But there’s no danger to
      the forces,” the soldier says, adding, “I’m not aware of a single instance of
      return fire. There’s no enemy, no weapons.” IDF sources tell Haaretz that Gaza
      has become “a place with its own set of rules” where they are interacting with
      civilians with whom “your only means of interaction is opening fire”. Deadly military
      weapons are used as crowd control to steer the starving populace wherever it’s
      determined they’re supposed to be, routinely killing desperate aid seekers. Another
      soldier describes being instructed to fire artillery shells at a crowd to keep
      them at a distance, saying, “Every time we fire, there are casualties and deaths,
      and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there’s never a good answer. Sometimes,
      merely asking the question annoys the commanders.” In quote after quote after
      quote we read Israeli soldiers describing atrocities they were ordered to commit
      which they knew were wrong. I guess Israel’s PR machine never counted on some
      of the soldiers they sent in to perpetrate the Gaza holocaust having an actual
      conscience. https://x.com/caitoz/status/1938737242354393414 A joint statement
      from Netanyahu and Katz denounced the report, accusing Haaretz of publishing “blood
      libels”. “The State of Israel absolutely rejects the contemptible blood libels
      that have been published in the Ha’aretz newspaper, according to which ‘IDF Soldiers
      Ordered to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian Aid.’
      These are malicious falsehoods designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military
      in the world,” the statement reads. “Blood libel ” refers to the way medieval
      Europeans used to falsely accuse Jews of murdering Christian children in blood
      sacrifices — an early form of atrocity propaganda used to justify the persecution
      of Jews. So again, just to be absolutely clear, the leader of the Israeli government
      is claiming that an Israeli newspaper quoting Israeli soldiers describing their
      own atrocities is antisemitic. And that mountains of testimony from inside the
      IDF is “designed to defame the IDF, the most moral military in the world.” What
      can I even say about that here? It speaks for itself. I have nothing to add. The
      more exposed Israel’s criminality becomes, the more absurd the arguments made
      in its defense are getting. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

    paragraph_summary: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister
      Israel Katz have publicly condemned a report by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
      which details testimonies from Israeli soldiers alleging that they were ordered
      to shoot at unarmed Palestinians in Gaza who were waiting for humanitarian aid.
      The article, titled "It's a Killing Field," reveals that soldiers described using
      live fire against civilians without any perceived threat, with one soldier stating
      that civilians are treated as hostile forces and that there are no crowd-control
      measures in place. The report has raised concerns about potential war crimes,
      prompting military prosecutors to call for a review, as hundreds of Palestinians
      have been killed in these encounters.

      Within the storytelling of western politics and punditry there exists a fictional
      type of mental illness which only affects people the US empire doesn’t like. If
      Iran gets a nuclear weapon, its crazy lunatic government will flip out and nuke
      us all. Watch out for Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, those guys are a bunch
      of maniacal antisemites who want to attack Israelis just because they’re Jewish.
      Oh no, Putin is invading Ukraine completely unprovoked because he’s a madman who
      hates freedom and won’t stop until he’s conquered all of Europe. China is building
      up its military because the megalomaniacal Xi Jinping wants to take over the world;
      all those US military bases surrounding China are just a defensive measure to
      contain Beijing’s insanity. Assad just went nuts one day and started slaughtering
      his own people out of nowhere. Gaddafi is a sexual sadist who’s giving Viagra
      to his troops to help them commit mass rapes in Libya. Saddam Hussein is so crazy
      and evil he’s trying to obtain weapons of mass destruction to give Americans another
      9/11. The North Koreans used to be far too insane to be allowed to have nuclear
      weapons because they’d nuke San Francisco immediately, but after they obtained
      nuclear weapons they were miraculously cured of this rare psychological disorder.
      The stories of the western empire ask us to believe that everyone who finds themselves
      in the imperial crosshairs is an irrational actor whose loony behavior can only
      be attributed to some uncontrollable defect within their own minds, or who will
      soon snap and do something nutty if they are not contained by force. One antagonist
      who never appears in these fairy tales of the western empire is the western empire
      itself. In the storytelling of the empire, there is no globe-spanning power structure
      which is constantly inflicting violence and destruction upon populations around
      the world while seeking to crush any nation who disobeys its dictates. It’s just
      a bunch of irrational psychos, seeking nuclear weapons and becoming aggressively
      militaristic for no other reason than because they are crazy, while the totally
      normal alliance led by a totally normal country in North America innocently responds
      to their crazy behavior. That’s the story. In real life, the most aggressive and
      unreasonable actor on the world stage by far is the empire-like power structure
      that is loosely centralized around Washington DC. Nobody else is constantly waging
      wars of aggression around the world. Nobody else is circling the planet with hundreds
      of military bases for the purpose of global domination. Nobody else has spent
      the 21st century killing millions of people and deliberately targeting civilians
      with starvation sanctions in countries on the other side of the planet. Only the
      US-centralized empire has been doing these things. But we are asked to believe
      that this vicious imperial power structure is the only rational actor on earth,
      and that those who resist its aggressions are the crazy ones. And you are told
      that if you can’t see this, then you’re crazy too. You’re a crackpot. A conspiracy
      theorist. A paranoid nutball whose voice should be marginalized and whose ideas
      should be dismissed with a scoff. You are crazy if you don’t believe what the
      world’s craziest power structure says about its enemies being crazy. It is gaslighting
      on a global scale. It is madness, and that is why this civilization has gone mad.
      Let’s hope someone finds a way to protect the world from the insanity of the western
      empire. ______________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the narrative in Western politics that
      portrays adversaries of the U.S. empire as irrational and mentally unstable, suggesting
      that this perspective serves to justify aggressive foreign policies. It highlights
      examples such as Iran, North Korea, and various Middle Eastern groups, framing

      The author argues that this storytelling conveniently ignores the role of the
      U.S. empire itself as a global power that inflicts violence and seeks to dominate
      other nations, thereby presenting a skewed view of international relations that
      simplifies complex geopolitical dynamics into a tale of good versus evil.

      is getting ready to start this week. We both know it’s all lies. Parrot whatever’s

      Well it’s been a crazy couple of days. Trump bombed Iran’s civilian nuclear energy
      facilities in an attack that CNN reports did no lasting damage, and Iran exercised
      extraordinary restraint with symbolic retaliatory strikes on US military bases
      coordinated to avoid American casualties — a move many are comparing to Iran’s
      non-lethal response to the US assassination of General Qassem Soleimani in 2020.
      After pumping out deception and fake diplomacy for weeks in order to assist Israel’s
      unprovoked war on Iran and launch an unprovoked attack on his own, Trump took
      to social media to proudly celebrate his administration’s facilitation of a ceasefire
      to the war he himself needlessly started, like an arsonist giving himself a trophy
      for extinguishing one of his own house fires. And, for the moment at least, the
      ceasefire appears to be holding . Which is good. There are a lot of terrible people
      who did everything they could to get Iran to kill US troops and spark a horrific
      war, but Iran didn’t take the bait. Iran doesn’t want war at all. Trump found
      out that Americans disapproved of the airstrikes and opposed war with Iran . And
      Israel found out that fighting an actual military force is a lot less easy than
      fighting hospital patients and children. So for now we’ve got a ceasefire. We
      have never been shown any evidence that Iran was working on obtaining nuclear
      weapons, which given the US empire’s extensive history of lying about this sort
      of thing means we should assume it was not. But it has certainly been given every
      incentive to obtain them now, given that that’s probably the only thing that can
      stop the US and Israel from casually committing these egregious acts of aggression
      whenever they feel like it. And isn’t it interesting how Iran keeps demonstrating
      a degree of restraint that we all know we’d never see from the United States or
      Israel if another country bombed their energy infrastructure or assassinated their
      military leaders, and yet Iran is the country we’re told can never be trusted
      with nuclear weapons? The US empire and Israel both exist in a perpetual state
      of war and attack other countries constantly; Iran never invades other countries
      and avoids war like Melania Trump avoids missionary position. But we’re meant
      to accept that it’s fine for the US and Israel to have nukes and do anything necessary
      to prevent Iran from getting any? Even if you accept the evidence-free premise
      that Iran would do crazy and reckless things if it became a nuclear-armed state,
      there is no rational argument that Trump and his handlers have been going about
      preventing this outcome intelligently. As Joe Lauria explains in Consortium News
      , the Iran nuclear deal was a remarkable achievement of international diplomacy
      that was working fine until Trump shredded it in 2018. Iran was following all
      the agreed upon rules and its nuclear enrichment was capped at 3.67 percent, but
      Trump killed it because the Zionists and warmongers who brought him to power want
      more aggression toward Iran instead of less. It’s so intensely stupid that we
      have to keep doing this horrifying dance every few years just because there are
      too many war-horny freaks with way too much power inside the US empire. And every
      time they get closer to getting their wish. Iran is being given more and more
      reasons to view the US and Israel as an existential threat, more and more motive
      to obtain nuclear weapons, and less and less reason to negotiate anything with
      Washington. These bastards keep pushing us toward something very ugly. Let’s hope
      people keep waking up to the depravity of Israel and the US empire before the
      warmakers succeed in obtaining their long-sought prize. _______________ Caitlin’s

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Journalist Ken Klippenstein has drawn attention
      to an overlooked remark made by State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce last
      month saying that the United States is “the greatest country on earth, next to
      Israel.” “The pride of being able to be here and do work that facilitates making
      things better for people and in the greatest country on Earth, next to Israel,”
      Bruce told Jewish News Syndicate . “It’s an honor to be able to make a difference
      and to be able to speak in this regard with an administration that I love so much
      and that I feel genuinely represented by.” It’s like this administration is doing
      everything it can to vindicate those who accuse it of being Israel First instead
      of America First. ❖ I feel like we don’t talk enough about the fact that Donald
      Trump publicly admitted to being bought and owned by the richest Israeli on earth,
      Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson. On the campaign trail last year Trump told
      the Israeli American Council Summit that the first time he was president, Miriam
      and her late husband Sheldon “would come into the White House probably almost
      more than anybody, outside of people that work there.” He said they were always
      after something, “always for Israel,” and “as soon as I’d give them something,
      they’d want something else.” He named the US recognition of the occupied Golan
      Heights as part of Israel as one of the gifts he showered the Zionist state with
      to please the Adelsons, who pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his presidential
      campaigns. ❖ It’s hard to focus on Israel’s airstrikes in Lebanon due to Israel’s
      invasion of Syria, which is hard to focus on due to Israel’s atrocities in the
      West Bank, which are hard to focus on due to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, which
      is hard to focus on due to Israel’s war on Iran, which is hard to focus on because
      of America’s war on Iran. ❖ Top Ten dumbest things we’re being asked to believe
      about Iran: 1. That the Iranians want to be bombed. 2. That the guy bombing Iran
      wants peace. 3. That regime change interventionism is a swell idea this time.
      4. That anyone who doesn’t want war with Iran hates Jews. 5. That this time the
      government and the media are telling us the truth about an American war. 6. That
      this time the neocons are smart and correct. 7. That bombing Iran makes it LESS
      likely to try to obtain nukes. 8. That Iran is trying to assassinate the US president
      when all US presidents have the same foreign policy. 9. That Iran (a country that
      never starts wars) cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons, but Israel (a country
      that starts wars constantly) can. 10. That attacking Iran benefits Americans.
      ❖ It blows my mind that there are people trying to argue that Trump does not seek
      war. What do these idiots think the United States would do if another country
      started bombing American energy infrastructure? ❖ I’m trying to get an important
      business deal done, so I firebombed the guy’s house to make him more likely to
      negotiate with me. I just want peace. ❖ The following things are antisemitic:
      - opposing war with Iran - viewing Palestinians as human - opposing genocide -
      Greta Thunberg - peace - journalism - Ms Rachel - truth - critical thinking -
      the UN - Tucker Carlson - Amnesty International - Human Rights Watch - equal rights
      ❖ It’s hilarious that anyone still takes this “antisemitism” schtick seriously.
      Oh no there’s a special group of white people who might get hurt feelings if I
      don’t want to send my kids to invade Iran. ❖ The western world has been on a two-year
      crash course learning all the reasons why the Muslim world has been correct about
      Israel this entire time. ❖ It’s kind of nice to be arguing with George W Bush
      conservatives about US foreign policy again. For the last few years I’ve been
      getting called a Nazi by western Zionists and a Putin-loving fascist by NATO simps;
      it’s refreshing to be hated for the hippie moonbat I actually am for once. ______________

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Journalist Ken Klippenstein has drawn attention
      to an overlooked remark made by State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce last
      month saying that the United States is “the greatest country on earth, next to
      Israel.” “The pride of being able to be here and do work that facilitates making
      things better for people and in the greatest country on Earth, next to Israel,”
      Bruce told Jewish News Syndicate . “It’s an honor to be able to make a difference
      and to be able to speak in this regard with an administration that I love so much
      and that I feel genuinely represented by.” It’s like this administration is doing
      everything it can to vindicate those who accuse it of being Israel First instead
      of America First. ❖ I feel like we don’t talk enough about the fact that Donald
      Trump publicly admitted to being bought and owned by the richest Israeli on earth,
      Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson. On the campaign trail last year Trump told
      the Israeli American Council Summit that the first time he was president, Miriam
      and her late husband Sheldon “would come into the White House probably almost
      more than anybody, outside of people that work there.” He said they were always
      after something, “always for Israel,” and “as soon as I’d give them something,
      they’d want something else.” He named the US recognition of the occupied Golan
      Heights as part of Israel as one of the gifts he showered the Zionist state with
      to please the Adelsons, who pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his presidential
      campaigns. ❖ It’s hard to focus on Israel’s airstrikes in Lebanon due to Israel’s
      invasion of Syria, which is hard to focus on due to Israel’s atrocities in the
      West Bank, which are hard to focus on due to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, which
      is hard to focus on due to Israel’s war on Iran, which is hard to focus on because
      of America’s war on Iran. ❖ Top Ten dumbest things we’re being asked to believe
      about Iran: 1. That the Iranians want to be bombed. 2. That the guy bombing Iran
      wants peace. 3. That regime change interventionism is a swell idea this time.
      4. That anyone who doesn’t want war with Iran hates Jews. 5. That this time the
      government and the media are telling us the truth about an American war. 6. That
      this time the neocons are smart and correct. 7. That bombing Iran makes it LESS
      likely to try to obtain nukes. 8. That Iran is trying to assassinate the US president
      when all US presidents have the same foreign policy. 9. That Iran (a country that
      never starts wars) cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons, but Israel (a country
      that starts wars constantly) can. 10. That attacking Iran benefits Americans.
      ❖ It blows my mind that there are people trying to argue that Trump does not seek
      war. What do these idiots think the United States would do if another country
      started bombing American energy infrastructure? ❖ I’m trying to get an important
      business deal done, so I firebombed the guy’s house to make him more likely to
      negotiate with me. I just want peace. ❖ The following things are antisemitic:
      - opposing war with Iran - viewing Palestinians as human - opposing genocide -
      Greta Thunberg - peace - journalism - Ms Rachel - truth - critical thinking -
      the UN - Tucker Carlson - Amnesty International - Human Rights Watch - equal rights
      ❖ It’s hilarious that anyone still takes this “antisemitism” schtick seriously.
      Oh no there’s a special group of white people who might get hurt feelings if I
      don’t want to send my kids to invade Iran. ❖ The western world has been on a two-year
      crash course learning all the reasons why the Muslim world has been correct about
      Israel this entire time. ❖ It’s kind of nice to be arguing with George W Bush
      conservatives about US foreign policy again. For the last few years I’ve been
      getting called a Nazi by western Zionists and a Putin-loving fascist by NATO simps;
      it’s refreshing to be hated for the hippie moonbat I actually am for once. ______________

      President Trump has a new post on Truth Social that reads as follows: “It’s not
      politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian
      Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change???
      MIGA!!!” Lots to unpack here. First of all, I love how he opens with “It’s not
      politically correct” to support US regime change interventionism. Right away he’s
      trying to frame support for longstanding neoconservative war agendas as part of
      the American right’s culture war against progressivism. He’s telling his base
      that they are actually resisting the Woke Agenda by siding with warmongering swamp
      monsters like Bill Kristol and John Bolton on the issue of regime change war with
      Iran. Secondly, Trump’s endorsement of regime change comes hours after officials
      from his own administration asserted emphatically that the president is not seeking
      regime change in Iran. Vice President JD Vance told the press that the administration
      “has been very clear that we don’t want a regime change,” and Defense Secretary
      Pete Hegseth said Trump’s aggressions toward Iran are “not about regime change” — only
      to have Trump grab his phone and immediately turn them into liars. https://x.com/BillKristol/status/1936924146073563626
      Another interesting choice is Trump’s use of the acronym “MIGA”, which here is
      intended to stand for “Make Iran Great Again”, but has for years been used by
      anti-Israel rightists in the United States for “ Make Israel Great Again” in mockery
      of the Israel-first sentiments within the greater MAGA movement. That he would
      post this acronym at the height of criticisms that his administration is bought
      and owned by Israel is either a sign of being extremely out of touch or an effort
      to manipulate search results on Google. Trump’s post delighted arch neocon Bill
      Kristol, who tweeted “brb — starting up PNAC again” in response. PNAC stands for
      Project for the New American Century , the neoconservative think tank co-founded
      by Kristol which is notorious for its role in pushing Washington toward war with
      Iraq. This is Trump communicating to his hardcore loyalists that it’s time to
      start cheerleading for regime change interventionism in Iran. He’s rolling out
      the George W Bush playbook for regime change war and playing it note for note,
      while still trying to ride the support he garnered with his populist messaging
      about draining the swamp and ending the wars. Now here he is, being applauded
      by the worst swamp creatures in Washington and trying to drum up consent for one
      of the worst wars imaginable. Call him George Dubya Trump. ________________ Caitlin’s

      : The US military has bombed multiple Iranian nuclear sites on the orders of President
      Trump, immediately putting tens of thousands of US military personnel in the region
      at risk of an Iranian retaliation which can then escalate to full-scale war. Earlier
      this month Iran’s Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh explicitly warned the United
      States that a direct US attack would result in Tehran ordering strikes on US bases
      in the middle east, saying “all US bases are within our reach and we will boldly
      target them in host countries.” In the lead-up to Trump’s act of war on Iran,
      the president told the press that an attack on American troops will mean a harsh
      response from the US, saying, “We’ll come down so hard if they do anything to
      our people. We’ll come down so hard. The gloves are off. I think they know not
      to touch our troops.” Trump reiterated this threat to Iran in his announcement
      of the US attack today. “There will be either peace, or there will be tragedy
      for Iran, far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days,” Trump
      said. “Remember, there are many targets left. Tonight’s was the most difficult
      of them all, by far, and perhaps the most lethal. But if peace does not come quickly,
      we will go after those other targets with precision, speed and skill. Most of
      them can be taken out in a matter of minutes.” So you can see how we might already
      be on our way toward a war of nightmarish proportions as a result of the president’s
      unprovoked act of aggression. Tehran now has to choose between reestablishing
      deterrence with extreme aggression or opening the floodgates to a whole host of
      existential threats from both outside and inside the country. Add to that the
      possibility of Iran blockading the Strait of Hormuz and the fact that Iran has
      now been strongly incentivized to actually obtain a nuclear weapon, and it looks
      very likely that we are plunging into a situation that could unfold in any number
      of horrific ways. Right now American political discourse is rife with the narrative
      that the US has been “dragged” into Israel’s war, which I reject entirely. Every
      step of the way this entire thing has been signed off on by US leadership. We
      are at this point because Trump and his regime knowingly chose to take us here.
      https://x.com/kenklippenstein/status/1936585741456244801 US troops within reach
      of Iran’s missiles are reportedly being briefed that they can expect to be on
      the receiving end of retaliatory strikes in the coming days. Again, Iran explicitly
      warned it would attack the US military if the US military did the thing it just
      did. If and when these retaliatory strikes come, the warmongers will try to argue
      that this is a valid reason to escalate this war. They will be lying. They chose
      to make this happen. Whatever transpires from this point on is the fault of Donald
      Trump and the unelected thugs he listens to. If US troops are killed, the war
      sluts in Washington and the Pentagon propagandists in the press will list their
      names and bandy about their photos and demand that their deaths be avenged with
      further acts of war — but it will not be Iran’s fault that they died. It will
      be Trump’s fault. It will be the fault of everyone whose decisions led up to bombs
      being dropped on Iranian energy infrastructure, and the fault of everyone who
      put those soldiers in harm’s way. None of this needed to happen. Iran was at the
      negotiating table. The Iran deal was working fine before Trump shredded it to
      put us on this terrible trajectory. The warmongers artificially manufactured this
      situation and knowingly inflicted this horror upon our world. I am really not
      looking forward to all the melodramatic victim-LARPing if and when Iran kills
      US military personnel stationed in west Asia. The US is the only nation on earth
      that can rival Israel in its ability to play the victim when the ball they’ve
      thrown at the wall bounces back. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

      put us on this terrible trajectory. The warmongers artificially manufactured this
      situation and knowingly inflicted this horror upon our world. I am really not
      looking forward to all the melodramatic victim-LARPing if and when Iran kills
      US military personnel stationed in west Asia. The US is the only nation on earth
      that can rival Israel in its ability to play the victim when the ball they’ve
      thrown at the wall bounces back. _________________ Caitlin’s Newsletter is a reader-supported

    one_sentence_summary: The US military, under President Trump's orders, has bombed
      multiple Iranian nuclear sites, escalating tensions and putting American personnel
      in the region at risk of Iranian retaliation, which could lead to full-scale war.
    paragraph_summary: 'The US military, under President Trump''s orders, has conducted
      airstrikes on multiple Iranian nuclear sites, heightening tensions in the region
      and placing tens of thousands of US troops at risk of retaliation from Iran. Iran''s
      Defense Minister has warned that any US attack would lead to strikes on American
      bases throughout the Middle East, emphasizing that all such bases are within Iran''s
      reach. Trump has threatened severe consequences for any aggression against US
      personnel, stating that the US will respond decisively. He characterized the recent
      attacks as a significant escalation and warned Iran of further military action
      if peace is not achieved quickly. The situation has escalated to a point where
      Iran faces a critical decision: to respond aggressively to reestablish deterrence
      or risk facing greater threats, potentially including a blockade of the Strait
      of Hormuz and a renewed push for nuclear armament, indicating a dangerous path
      toward broader conflict.'

      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Do Israel’s supporters know it’s over for
      them? Like, they know they’re going to be despised for the rest of their lives,
      right? That they will never, ever live down the fact that they supported a live-streamed
      genocide? And that it will only get worse for them as history clarifies things?
      Surely they must realize this by now. Surely they must realize that nothing they
      do for the rest of their lives will ever be as significant as the fact that they
      played cheerleader for genocide and all of Israel’s demented warmongering, long
      after normal people realized it was the wrong thing to do. That in the eyes of
      the world they will all always be first and foremost someone who supported and
      defended history’s first live-streamed genocide. I wonder what that’s like, knowing
      that about yourself? If that was me maybe I’d be pushing for World War Three as
      well, I dunno. Maybe I’d hope we could turn the whole world into Gaza and let
      the flames wash away human memory of the things we had done. That enough death
      and destruction spread out across enough of the earth would make my crimes look
      small in comparison or something. It won’t work, though. Everyone’s always going
      to remember what they did. Their grandchildren will be disgusted by them. Their
      families will carry their shame for generations. What a terrible way to be. ❖
      The UK will reportedly be designating Palestine Action as a terrorist group for
      spraying British military planes with red paint to protest the genocide in Gaza.
      It says a lot about how backwards and diseased western civilization has become
      when peace activists are designated as terrorists for trying to stop the world’s
      worst acts of terrorism. ❖ Iran is having more and more success with its missile
      strikes on Israel. I am not a military expert, but I’ve been hearing for years
      that Israel doesn’t want to fight Iran because it can’t reliably stop Iran’s missiles.
      Israel of course would have known this, so it looks like the plan was always for
      Israel to get itself into hot water and have the US pull it out. ❖ Iran’s real
      sin is insisting upon its own sovereignty as a nation. That’s why it’s a target
      of the western empire. Giving up sovereignty over its own energy infrastructure
      would be giving up the very thing the Iranians started fighting for in the first
      place all those years ago. They’re not going to do it unless they are forced to,
      otherwise what was the point of resisting absorption into the imperial blob that
      whole time? ❖ I’m supposed to hate a country for saying “Death to America”? I
      yell that during sex. ❖ The only reason they get to call the Gaza holocaust a
      “war” is because they’re using bombs and bullets to do the extermination. If they
      were using gas chambers to kill the same number of people with the exact same
      motive, all it would change is the world’s understanding of what’s happening.
      ❖ War after war after war the western empire has told us it needs to ship off
      our young to go fight evil murderous tyrants, only for the west to wake up to
      the reality that the empire’s dearest ally in the middle east is the most evil,
      murderous and tyrannical regime around. ❖ The idea of war with Iran would be even
      less popular than it is now if the western media hadn’t spent all these years
      referring to Iran’s civilian nuclear energy program as “Iran’s nuclear program”,
      deliberately causing people to assume that Iran is working on nuclear weapons.
      ❖ Friendly reminder that last year the official Democratic Party platform slammed
      Trump for choosing not to go to war with Iran in 2018, 2019 and 2020 during his
      last presidency. Americans aren’t allowed to vote against war. _______________

    text: 'Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now
      President Trump has twice thrown his own intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard under
      the bus, repeatedly telling the press that the national intelligence director
      was wrong when she told Congress in March that the American spy network does not
      believe Iran is attempting to obtain a nuclear weapon. To be clear, when Gabbard
      made this statement she was not voicing her personal opinion, she was repeating
      verbatim the findings laid out in the 2025 Threat Assessment of the intelligence
      agencies of the United States, which said “We continue to assess Iran is not building
      a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program
      he suspended in 2003, though pressure has probably built on him to do so.” Despite
      this, Trump has been publicly expressing disdain for his intelligence director,
      flatly saying “she’s wrong” when asked about Gabbard’s testimony on Friday, and
      saying “I don’t care what she says” when asked the same question about Gabbard’s
      statement earlier this week. Rather than push back on the president’s crude dismissal,
      Gabbard took to social media to tell everyone that Trump is actually right about
      Iran, and that everyone who thought she said Iran isn’t seeking a nuclear weapon
      is imagining things. “The dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony
      out of context and spreading fake news as a way to manufacture division,” Gabbard
      said on Twitter . “America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it
      can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize
      the assembly. President Trump has been clear that can’t happen, and I agree. My
      full testimony below:” Bizarrely, Gabbard accompanied this text with a video clip
      of her congressional testimony in March which in no way validates anything she
      says in her post. Nowhere in the clip does she utter anything about Iran being
      weeks to months from a nuclear weapon, and she explicitly says the words “the
      IC [Intelligence Community] continues to assess Iran is not building a nuclear
      weapon and the Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized a nuclear weapons
      program that he suspended in 2003.” A recent report from CNN says that according
      to US intelligence sources Iran is not “weeks to months” from a nuclear weapon
      but years , reporting that Tehran is “up to three years away from being able to
      produce and deliver one to a target of its choosing.” This kind of post-truth
      society behavior, where one tells people they’re not seeing what’s directly in
      front of their eyes, is the kind of thing you only expect from Donald Trump and
      his most obsequious bootlickers. And what we are witnessing here is Tulsi Gabbard
      getting down on her knees and putting tongue to leather. https://x.com/DNIGabbard/status/1936174674595008517
      Tulsi Gabbard is a warmongering asshole, and a liar. She is helping to deceive
      the world into yet another horrible middle eastern war, and if she and her fellow
      warmongers succeed her words will go down in history as among the most depraved
      lies ever told. This is the same person who tweeted back in March, “President
      Trump IS the President of Peace. He is ending bloodshed across the world and will
      deliver lasting peace in the Middle East.” This is also the person who attacked
      Trump’s hawkishness on Iran constantly while campaigning for president as a Democrat
      in the 2020 primary race. “Intel officials & politicians led us into Iraq war,”
      Gabbard tweeted in 2019. “Now Trump’s using the same playbook to lead our country
      into war with Iran. The cost in lives & treasure will be infinitely greater than
      the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, & Syria, and will undermine our ntnl security.”
      “The main responsibility of the president is to keep Americans safe. Trump has
      failed — undermining our national security by tearing up the Iran nuclear deal,
      threatening military action, bringing us closer to war with Iran that will be
      far worse than war in Iraq,” reads another 2019 tweet . “They are setting the
      stage for a war with Iran that would prove to be far more costly, far more devastating
      and dangerous than anything that we saw in the Iraq War,” Gabbard said of the
      Trump administration during a 2019 interview on ABC. https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1130459408260059136
      This fraudster has built an entire political career out of pretending to oppose
      war and militarism in order to win the support of Americans who are sick of pouring
      blood and treasure into the US slaughter machine, opportunistically drifting to
      whatever corner of the political spectrum would offer her the most power, and
      then when she got as high as she can go she sold all her stated principles to
      the furthest extent possible at the earliest opportunity. Pee fetish porn stars

      to social media to align herself with Trump's stance, claiming that the media
      misrepresented her testimony and asserting that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon
      within weeks to months if they chose to. However, her accompanying video clip

    one_sentence_summary: President Trump has publicly criticized his intelligence chief,
      Tulsi Gabbard, for accurately relaying the U.S. intelligence community's assessment
      that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapon, despite her statements being based
      on official findings.
    paragraph_summary: President Trump has publicly criticized his intelligence chief,
      Tulsi Gabbard, for her testimony to Congress stating that U.S. intelligence agencies
      do not believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon, which was based on the 2025
      Threat Assessment. Despite Gabbard's assertion that her statement reflected the
      consensus of the intelligence community, Trump dismissed her claims, stating she
      was "wrong" and expressing indifference to her views. In response, Gabbard took
      to social media to align herself with Trump's stance, claiming that the media
      misrepresented her testimony and asserting that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon
      within weeks to months if they chose to. However, her accompanying video clip
      of her congressional testimony did not support her new claims, as it reiterated
      the intelligence community's assessment that Iran was not actively seeking a nuclear
      weapon.

      War is the worst thing in the world. It is the single craziest behavior exhibited
      by humans. The most destructive. The most traumatizing. The least sustainable.
      The least conducive to human thriving. All the things we fear most become the
      norm in a land ravaged by war. Death. Pain. Suffering. Rape. Chaos. Uncertainty.
      Losing loved ones. Losing homes. Losing limbs. Living in terror. Being attacked.
      Being brain damaged. Being faced with impossible choices. All the things we frighten
      ourselves with by watching horror movies become a reality from which there is
      no escape. War creates a waking nightmare which any sensible person would want
      to avoid except in the direst necessity. And yet we are ruled by people who actively
      seek it out. Who will lie and manipulate to make wars happen. Who will smear and
      slander anyone who resists in the name of peace. Who will actively fight against
      every healthy impulse in everybody in their society to push their war agenda forward.
      They always tell us the new war they want us to fight is about self-defense, or
      about liberating an oppressed population from a tyrannical dictatorship, or about
      preventing terrorism, or about spreading freedom and democracy. Usually they tell
      us it’s about all of these things. But it never is. They are always lying. Always.
      They are pushing human beings into the worst circumstances they could possibly
      experience here on earth for no other reason than power and profit. To advance
      the hegemonic agendas of empire managers and to fill the coffers of war profiteers.
      That’s all it ever is. Always, always, always. They say whatever they need to
      say and move whatever chess pieces they need to move to get their war, and then
      they send a bunch of poor suckers to go fight in it, lying to them that they are
      doing something noble and heroic. They ship them off to a foreign land, and then
      they are trapped. They can’t flee into the wilderness because they don’t know
      how to survive and have no way of getting home. They can’t ask the locals for
      help because the locals are their victims. They have no choice but to either fight
      and kill people who have never wronged them, or lay down their arms and be caged
      like animals. If they choose to fight, the best case scenario is that they spend
      the rest of their lives knowing that they killed other human beings who wanted
      to live just as much as themselves, and who had just as much right to. All because
      some people who already had far too much power wanted a little bit more. It’s
      about the most insane and backwards thing you could possibly imagine. The most
      powerful individuals in our world are people who actively push for the absolute
      worst outcomes that could possibly happen. It’s the exact opposite of the way
      things should be. Yet we are told it’s normal. We are trained to believe this
      is just the reality we live in which we should expect and accept, first by our
      parents and teachers, and then by our news media and by Hollywood. War is aggressively
      normalized by pundits, propagandists and politicians, and enthusiastically glorified
      in movies and documentaries. Those who were forced or duped into fighting in these
      insane arrangements of mass-scale violence are framed as heroes, and anyone who
      disagrees with what they were sent to do is framed as disrespectful and ungrateful.
      Those who push for peace are framed as treasonous freaks who must surely have
      covert loyalties toward whatever government the empire is trying to target this
      time around. Those who suggest that there might be some solution apart from war
      are dismissed as infantile dreamers. And once the war has started, it is almost
      impossible to stop. The entire political/media class treats the war as the new
      normal, and any suggestion that it’s time to wrap things up is regarded as outlandish
      and suspicious. It’s never time to end the war, because this or that objective
      has not yet been achieved, or because this or that faction might come into power
      if troops are pulled out, or because this or that disempowered group might suffer
      without our military there to protect them. Ending a war is as difficult as beginning
      a war is easy. All the institutions which lined up perfectly to help get the ball
      rolling toward war suddenly transform into giant tar pits of inertia when it comes
      to ending the conflict. The warmakers say the war must continue for this or that
      reason, the politicians back the warmakers, the media back the politicians, and
      the person saying it’s time to end the madness is left standing there looking
      like they’re the crazy ones. But they’re not the crazy ones. The ones pushing
      us toward war are crazy. This whole system is crazy. This whole civilization.
      The ones resisting the push toward war are the ones fighting for sanity. They’re
      the ones who are trying to reverse the tide of madness and drag us into a healthy
      world. If this is you, do not falter. Do not let the warmongers shout you down
      or shut you up. You are right, and they are wrong. Let your voice thunder with
      confidence. Let nothing cause you to waver. Blessed are the peacemakers. Don’t
      let anyone trick you into doubting what you know to be true. _______________ Caitlin’s

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now Israel and its western allies are crying
      and rending their garments about an Israeli hospital that was damaged in an Iranian
      missile strike. Western media outlets like the BBC and New York Times have suddenly
      remembered how to write headlines which assign blame to the attacker after deciding
      that hospitals getting bombed is a newsworthy event again. The Iranian attack
      didn’t even kill anybody, and the damage to the hospital was reportedly the result
      of a shockwave from a strike on a nearby Israeli military facility. That’s right:
      the Israeli military was using the hospital for human shields. As always, every
      accusation is a confession. Israel, as we all know, bombs hospitals constantly.
      Israel bombed an Iranian hospital just the other day to almost no coverage from
      the western press. Israel has attacked healthcare workers and healthcare facilities
      in Gaza around 700 times according to the World Health Organisation, and the IDF
      has repeatedly been documented entering the hospitals it attacks to destroy individual
      pieces of medical equipment. Israel, unlike Iran, is deliberately targeting healthcare
      facilities to make Gaza unlivable. Israeli defense minister Israel Katz is now
      saying that because of the hospital strike, Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “cannot
      continue to exist.” Knowing what we know about Israel’s track record, saying that
      people who bomb hospitals should not be allowed to exist can only be interpreted
      as an extremely antisemitic statement. https://x.com/caitoz/status/1935671926997082410
      ❖ The only way the US wins a war with Iran easily, quickly, and without massive
      losses is if it uses a nuclear weapon. This fact, combined with that Huckabee
      post comparing Trump to Truman in 1945 and Trump’s “ evacuate Tehran ” and “ UNCONDITIONAL
      SURRENDER ” statements, makes me nervous. And the Americans are reportedly discussing
      using nuclear weapons on Iran already. Fox News reports that the Trump administration
      has not ruled out any options regarding the possibility of using a tactical nuke
      to destroy an Iranian nuclear facility. That’s right kids, we’ve got to nuke the
      Iranians to liberate the Iranians. We’ve got to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear
      weapons because a nuclear-armed despotic regime might use those powerful weapons
      to do crazy and reckless things, like drop a tactical nuke on a foreign nation’s
      power plant. ❖ Israel: [Massacres children, bombs hospitals, assassinates journalists,
      starves civilians, kills aid workers, murders starving civilians seeking aid,
      destroys Gaza, assaults the West Bank, invades Syria, invades Lebanon, bombs Yemen,
      bombs Iran] Iran: [Bombs Israel back] World: Hooray! Israel [crying]: They hate
      us because of our religion! ❖ I’ve never understood why people think “you hate
      Israel!” is an insult. If you knew a guy who was constantly murdering children
      and setting fire to his neighbors’ homes while meddling in your home life, you’d
      probably hate that guy. The problem is people don’t hate Israel enough . ❖ If
      you’ve never been called an antisemite then you are way too chill about genocide.
      ❖ If your case for going to war contains the words “the Bible says” or “God commands
      us”, then you do not have a case for going to war. ❖ Tucker Carlson conducted
      a two-hour interview with Senator Ted Cruz in which he aggressively interrogated
      the lawmaker’s hawkish position on Iran. There are a lot of clips from the interview
      going around online, the most famous of which features Carlson asking Cruz basic
      questions about Iran’s population which the Texas senator is unable to answer.
      The lesson here isn’t that war hawks are too lazy or stupid to learn things about
      the nations they want to destroy, the lesson is that they are lying when they
      say they care about the people in those nations and want to liberate them. They
      don’t care about Iranian people. At all. They care about power, empire-building,
      oil, and Israel, and then they make up a bunch of stories about wanting to rescue
      the people they’re about to murder from the rule of a tyrannical regime. All wars

      their coverage compared to Israel's frequent attacks on healthcare facilities
      in Gaza. It notes that the damage was a result of a shockwave from an Israeli

      shield. The author points out that Israel has a history of targeting hospitals,

      bombing of an Iranian hospital. The article also comments on Israeli Defense Minister
      Israel Katz's inflammatory rhetoric against Iran, interpreting it as hypocritical
      given Israel's own actions. Additionally, it raises concerns about the potential
      for the U.S. to consider nuclear options in a conflict with Iran, referencing
      troubling statements from political figures.

      military site nearby, suggesting that Israel was using the hospital as a human
      shield. The author points out that Israel has a history of targeting hospitals,
      with numerous documented attacks, while the media largely ignored Israel's recent
      bombing of an Iranian hospital. The article also comments on Israeli Defense Minister
      Israel Katz's inflammatory rhetoric against Iran, interpreting it as hypocritical
      given Israel's own actions. Additionally, it raises concerns about the potential
      for the U.S. to consider nuclear options in a conflict with Iran, referencing
      troubling statements from political figures.

    text: 'Notes From The Edge Of The Narrative Matrix Listen to a reading of this article
      (reading by Tim Foley) : Subscribe now President Trump has shared a text message
      that was sent to him by Mike Huckabee, the deranged Christian Zionist who serves
      as the current US ambassador to Israel, and it is one of the creepiest things
      I have ever seen in my life. The text reads as follows: “Mr President, God spared
      you in Butler, PA to be the most consequential President in a century — maybe
      ever. The decisions on your shoulders I would not want to be made by anyone else.
      You have many voices speaking to you Sir, but there is only ONE voice that matters.
      HIS voice. I am your appointed servant in this land and am available for you but
      I do not try to get in your presence often because I trust your instincts. No
      President in my lifetime has been in a position like yours. Not since Truman in
      1945. I don’t reach out to persuade you. Only to encourage you. I believe you
      will hear from heaven and that voice is far more important than mine or ANYONE
      else’s. You sent me to Israel to be your eyes, ears and voice and to make sure
      our flag flies above our embassy. My job is to be the last one to leave. I will
      not abandon this post. Our flag will NOT come down! You did not seek this moment.
      This moment sought YOU! It is my honor to serve you! Mike Huckabee” There are
      so many weird, creepy things about this message. The intensity. The religious
      fanaticism. The groveling, self-debasing obsequiousness, clearly designed to appeal
      to Trump’s enormous ego. But by far the most disturbing part was the reference
      to Truman in 1945 — a nod to the last and only time a national leader used nuclear
      weapons against an enemy state. Trump claims to have experienced a religious transformation
      after surviving an assassination attempt last year. Nuclear weapons and doomsday
      cultism are poor bedfellows. I really hope this is just some bizarre madman diplomacy
      and not an accurate reflection of something that is actually occurring inside
      the president’s mind as he pushes toward direct confrontation with Iran. ❖ The
      US and Israel don’t oppose Iran getting nukes because they fear a nuclear attack
      by irrational tyrants, nor because they worry about Iran giving nukes to terrorist
      factions. They oppose Iran getting nukes because then all their regime change
      agendas go right out the window. This isn’t actually about nukes. It’s about toppling
      Tehran so that the US and Israel can dominate the middle east. It’s about regional
      hegemony and geostrategic control , and nothing else. They’d be pushing for regime
      change in Iran whether they believed Iran was seeking a nuke or not. ❖ How fucking
      stupid do you have to believe the lies about Iran? It’s just a much dumber, much
      more obvious version of the Iraq war narratives, pushed by a much dumber, much
      more obvious US president. With the benefit of having watched it all happen before.
      At least with the Iraq invasion Bush had a year and a half of soaring approval
      where he got to posture as the Good Guy protecting Americans from the Bad Guys.
      This time it’s been a year and a half of the US backing history’s first live-streamed
      genocide, with Israel essentially telling the world “WE’RE HITLER, WE’RE THE NEW
      NAZIS, WE KILL KIDS” for 20 months, and now they’re getting ready to say that
      THIS is what US soldiers need to go fight and die for? Come ON people. It’s the
      same movie. They barely even changed the name, they just switched the Q to an
      N. There is no excuse for failing to see what’s happening here. ❖ A new Economist/YouGov
      poll found that only 16 percent of Americans currently support a US war with Iran.
      Most Americans oppose such a war, including a majority of Trump supporters. People
      advocating regime change interventionism in Iran are arguing that the US needs
      to ignore the will of its own electorate in the name of spreading democracy. ❖
      There are no anti-war Trump supporters; if you’re still supporting Trump, you’re
      not anti-war. There are no anti-war Republicans; if you’re still a member of the
      Republican Party, you’re not anti-war. If you got scammed by Trump’s anti-war
      schtick that’s one thing, but it’s another thing entirely if you’re still buying
      into the scam after being taken by the hand and carefully shown that it’s a scam
      in excruciating detail throughout Trump’s second term. If you supported Trump
      because you thought he was anti-war, the time is now to completely wash your hands
      of him and firmly take your stand against him. If you stood with the Republicans
      because you thought they were less warmongering than the Democrats, it’s time
      to leave the party and join the actual anti-war movement. If you’re not willing
      to do either of these things, it’s time to stop pretending you don’t love war.
      ❖ I don’t feel the same disdain toward people who got scammed by Trump’s fake
      antiwar schtick that I see others expressing. I understand it, but I don’t feel
      it. We live in an information ecosystem teeming with propaganda and deception,
      and people are going to get confused. There’s no shame in being deceived. There
      IS shame in deceiving. There IS shame in continuing to support a warmonger after
      you discover that you were deceived about him. But BEING deceived in and of itself
      is no crime. That’s why the perpetrator goes to jail in fraud cases and not the
      victims. Mark Twain said “It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that
      they have been fooled,” and it’s SO true. As social animals, humans are so dominated
      by the need to conform to our tribal loyalties that we’ve got psychological barriers
      to admitting that our tribe/faction got things wrong. And as social animals, shame
      is a powerful driving force in our psychological lives, because we’re afraid of
      being seen as deficient by other humans. But it’s irrational for us to view those
      who are deceived as deficient, and it’s irrational to feel shame about having
      gotten something wrong. I’ve gotten lots of things wrong over the years. I’m sure
      there are some things I’m still getting wrong. Being willing to see you got it
      wrong is the essential first step to getting it right. Always being open to the
      possibility that you could be wrong is necessary to forming a truth-based relationship
      with reality. If you were duped by the MAGA scam, that’s okay. Just take what
      you learned and start working on re-orienting yourself toward truth. You know
      what’s false, so now you can start working on finding out what’s true. And you
      can start constructing a new worldview accordingly. ________________ Caitlin’s

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, President Trump shared a disturbing text
      message from Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, which reflects extreme
      religious fervor and an unsettling level of devotion. Huckabee's message praises
      Trump as potentially the most significant president in a century, emphasizing
      that he is guided by a divine voice that surpasses all others. The text contains
      alarming references to historical moments, particularly a comparison to President
      Truman's decision to use nuclear weapons in 1945, suggesting a troubling connection
      between religious zealotry and global power dynamics. The article expresses concern
      that Huckabee's intense admiration and the implications of his message could indicate
      a dangerous blend of fanaticism and political influence, particularly in light
      of Trump's claimed religious awakening following an assassination attempt.
