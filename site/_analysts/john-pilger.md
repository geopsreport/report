summary: |
  The international response to Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza continues to escalate, with new collective measures emerging from a coalition of states. In the past 24 hours, the most significant development has been the announcement of a joint action plan by 12 countries meeting in Bogota, aimed at confronting what they describe as Israel’s genocide in Gaza. **Mick Hall** reports that the United States is now actively pressuring other nations not to endorse this plan, signaling a deepening rift between Washington and a growing bloc of states demanding accountability.
  
  This diplomatic maneuvering comes as mainstream Western media, notably The New York Times, have begun to openly use the term “genocide” in reference to Israeli actions. **Caitlin Johnstone** observes that the editorial shift at the Times reflects mounting evidence and a broader unwillingness to ignore the scale of civilian suffering, a change that could influence public opinion and policy debates in the U.S. and Europe.
  
  Meanwhile, legal and political battles over pro-Palestinian activism are intensifying in the UK. **Craig Murray** details how the government’s attempt to designate the non-violent group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization is being challenged in court, highlighting the growing criminalization of dissent and the contested boundaries of legitimate protest.
  
  The trend is clear: international pressure on Israel is mounting, both diplomatically and in the media, while Western governments face increasing scrutiny over their responses to pro-Palestinian activism. If current trajectories hold, it is quite likely that more states will join collective actions against Israel, despite U.S. resistance. The shift in media language suggests a high chance of further erosion in public support for unconditional Western backing of Israeli policy. I guarantee that legal and political challenges to the suppression of pro-Palestinian activism in the West will continue to intensify in the coming weeks.
