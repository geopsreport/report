  **Geops Report – July 6, 2025, Evening Edition**
  
  **Context:**  
  The geopolitical landscape remains volatile across the Southern Caucasus, the Middle East, and the broader Eurasian region. Recent developments highlight the shifting allegiances, diplomatic challenges, and the enduring impact of Western interventions.
  
  **Armenia’s Diplomatic Isolation Deepens**  
  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s recent admission of territorial loss marks a significant shift in Yerevan’s political narrative. Speaking at Yerevan State University, Pashinyan acknowledged the loss of part of Armenia’s homeland but asserted the survival of Armenian statehood. According to **Larry C. Johnson**, Pashinyan’s rise was facilitated by a Western-backed movement intended to reduce Russian influence in the region. However, the anticipated Western support has not materialized, leaving Armenia “diplomatically isolated and pressured to make concessions regarding Nagorno-Karabakh.” This has resulted in a weakened and demoralized Armenia, facing internal discontent and external threats, with no clear path to recovery.
  
  **Global Misunderstandings Over Zionism and Israel**  
  A new analysis by **Larry C. Johnson** underscores the profound cultural and religious disconnect shaping global perceptions of Zionism and U.S. support for Israel. The article notes that the majority of the world’s population, particularly in Asia, lacks familiarity with the eschatological beliefs that underpin Western narratives about Israel’s legitimacy. This ignorance complicates international dialogue and fuels misunderstandings, as “most of the world’s population don’t have a clue about Zionism,” especially in populous nations like India and China. The piece suggests that this disconnect is a major barrier to consensus on Middle Eastern issues at the global level.
  
  **Trends and Expected Outcomes:**  
  - Armenia’s continued diplomatic isolation is likely to exacerbate internal instability and may prompt further concessions in the face of external pressure, particularly over Nagorno-Karabakh.
  - The lack of global understanding regarding the religious and ideological foundations of Zionism will persist, complicating efforts to build international consensus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
  - The broader trend remains one of shifting alliances and growing skepticism toward Western interventionism, as regional actors reassess their strategies amid uncertain support from traditional partners.
  
  As the situation evolves, the Southern Caucasus and Middle East will remain flashpoints, with local actors increasingly forced to navigate a complex and often unsupportive international environment.

  - title: Armenia’s Prime Minister is Trapped
    url: https://sonar21.com/armenias-prime-minister-is-trapped/
    text: 'On June 4, 2025, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated , in response
      to a wide-ranging student question during a talk given at Yerevan State University,
      “We have lost part of our homeland, but we have gained a state.” We must assume
      that before having “lost part of our homeland,” Armenia wasn’t a state. Armenia
      was more of a sovereign entity before Pashinyan was ushered into power in 2018,
      and today, Armenia is caught in a diplomatic trap. Why is this? Critical analysts
      generate hypotheses in pursuing explanations for political events based on unbiased
      evaluation of available evidence. Looking back at events that may not initially
      appear significant sometimes creates the basis for hypotheses when viewed across
      a longer timeline. Hypotheses are required because most observers and analysts
      cannot access privileged information. A contemporary example of this might be
      whether US President Trump is kept in the dark about clandestine events he should
      know about or does not care about significant events. Few know the real explanation;
      the rest suggest hypotheses. The leading hypothesis to be examined here is: Pashinyan’s
      ascent to power was a light-color revolution encouraged by the West to reduce
      Russia’s footprint in the Southern Caucasus. The suggested quid pro quo was the
      West would support a Pashinyan ascendancy to power, replacing pro-Russia incumbents,
      but the piper must be paid. Once Russian influence was reduced, any promises or
      assurances given Armenia never materialized, leaving diplomatically-challenged
      Armenia to fend for itself. Armenians were told by Western states and their own
      ‘analysts’ that Armenia would have to make concessions on Nagorno-Karabakh to
      achieve peace with its neighbors. No Armenian government could unilaterally concede
      Nagorno-Karabakh and survive. However, with targeted framing that persists to
      this day, Armenians fought, were defeated, and emerged in a significantly weakened
      and demoralized state, with more than four thousand young soldiers dead. Armenia
      participated in an engineered defeat of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, followed by
      the 2023 Azerbaijani ethnic cleansing of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, negating
      the mandate of a Russian peace-keeping contingent in the region. Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh
      ceased to exist as an entity. While peace remains elusive, the Armenian regime
      is doing its best not to appear patriotic, attacking national symbols, including
      the Armenian church, and kowtowing to the dictates of Baku in their never-ending
      cascade of concessions, all intended to reduce Armenian sovereignty. Direct proof
      doesn’t exist to prove or contradict this hypothesis. However, the US Deep State
      is demonstrably in pursuit of the dismemberment of Russia via proxies. Pashinyan
      was convicted of political libel in 1999. He was fined and given a one-year suspended
      sentence. In 2008, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the
      2008 post-election violence. He was released in May 2011 as part of a general
      amnesty. Both of these events took place under the leadership of pro-Russian governments.
      Pashinyan was a classic candidate for fulfilling a Western anti-Russian agenda
      in Armenia. The West’s Deep State Ukrainian proxy war against Russia has not resulted
      in a Russian disintegration but rather quite the opposite. Subsequently, Armenia
      painted itself into a corner; it neither has peace nor is the absence of war the
      equivalent of peace. Turkey and Azerbaijan, especially the latter, after the successful
      conquest of Nagorno-Karabakh, are attempting to reduce Armenian sovereignty incrementally.
      Currently, the Azerbaijani military units occupy about two hundred fifteen sq
      km of Armenia’s internationally recognized territory, and over thirty Armenian
      villages are now abandoned. Rather than for Armenia to plan for the worst, it
      hoped for the best, and hope doesn’t spring eternal in geopolitics. The West using
      Minsk I and II agreements to further arm Ukraine as a proxy fighting Russia should
      have been a hint. However, for this and other events to be recognized for what
      they represent, such as Georgia’s Saakashvili hoping for NATO intervention in
      the 2008 Georgian-Russian war, these lessons should have encouraged Armenia to
      develop strategic goals rather than being reduced to transactional processes that
      serve the interests of others while keeping the Pashinyan regime in power. Much
      of the US Deep State’s activities serve the disintegration of Russia. Thus, anything
      that supports that policy would be under active consideration. This includes opening
      more than just a Ukrainian front against Russian interests. One need only read
      the Rand Corporation’s recommendations in Extending Russia and note on page 117
      how “the United States could try to induce Armenia to break with Russia” and on
      118, “While the principal aim of these policies would be to extend Russia, closer
      relationships with Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Armenia might yield important secondary
      benefits for the United States.” The following is a sampling of the evidence that
      supports the stated hypothesis. As seen on Wikileaks, US diplomatic cables suggest
      a consistent, strategic push from Washington for Armenia to prepare public opinion
      to accept compromises on Nagorno-Karabakh, including territorial concessions,
      to reach peace. There is a recurring, subtly but firmly framed message that peace
      cannot come without concessions on Nagorno-Karabakh’s status. The number of current
      Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) registered in Armenia remains elusive. While
      Armenia’s official count as of 2019 stood at 4,222 NGOs and 1,120 foundations,
      a claim made by Russian sources in the fall of 2023 estimated the number of NGOs
      in Armenia to be around 9,000. This number of NGOs is considered excessive in
      a country of about three million people. The role of Western-sponsored NGOs in
      color revolutions is widely recognized. Nikol Pashinyan stated that his ascendancy
      was on the backs of NGOs, a classic method used in all Western-inspired color
      revolutions. In 2017, Nikol Pashinyan’s party proposed Armenia’s exit from the
      Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) to the Armenian Parliament, signaling a shift away
      from closer integration with Russia. Since assuming power in 2018, Pashinyan has
      had five Directors of the National Security Service, and six state officials have
      died under circumstances deemed suspicious. Additionally, four different Ministers
      of Defense have served under Pashinyan since 2018. Such frequent changes in key
      ministries hinder coherent policy implementation. In July 2018, shortly after
      his election, Pashinyan charged Yuri Khachaturov, who served as the head of the
      Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), with “subverting public
      order” in 2008. In the months leading up to the 2020 war, Pashinyan appointed
      individuals known for their loyalty to his administration to key positions within
      the Armenian Constitutional Court. These appointments were seen as a move to consolidate
      power and influence within the judiciary, particularly given Pashinyan’s assumption
      of extraordinary powers during and immediately after the 2020 Karabakh War. Approximately
      10,000 diasporan Armenians volunteered as soldiers in the 2020 Karabakh War, despite
      many being informed that their assistance on the battlefield was not required.
      Following a series of phone conversations between Pashinyan and Russian President
      Putin and between Azerbaijani President Aliyev and Putin in mid-October 2020 ,
      a proposal was made to end the fighting. The proposal involved Armenians maintaining
      control over much of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region from the Soviet era,
      along with bordering regions. It included the deployment of Russian peacekeepers
      to Nagorno-Karabakh. However, Pashinyan refused the proposal, arguing it would
      amount to surrender. An engineered defeat of this 2020 war was the goal; such
      a rejection would be necessary. On February 25, 2021, Armenia’s general staff
      demanded Pashinyan’s resignation, citing indecisiveness during and after the 2020
      Karabakh War. In retaliation, Pashinyan dismissed the Chief of the General Staff
      and his first deputy. He also dismissed or arrested several combat generals from
      Armenia and Karabakh. Aired on December 19, 2023, on Armenian TV 1 , Pashinyan
      claimed that the resources meant to strengthen Armenia were always diverted to
      support the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. He also stated that he was elected prime
      minister of Armenia, not Nagorno-Karabakh. The interview implied that the burden
      of Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh was lifted, bringing economic benefits to Armenia.
      A quick review can be read here . On February 1, 2024, Armenia’s ratification
      of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court came into effect. This
      ratification means that Armenia has agreed to abide by the jurisdiction of the
      International Criminal Court, potentially allowing for the prosecution of individuals
      accused of committing international crimes, including heads of state. Under the
      Rome Statute, the ICC claims jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity,
      war crimes, and the crime of aggression. As a result, there is the possibility
      that Russian President Putin could face arrest if he enters Armenia and is accused
      of committing such crimes. By the end of February 2024, Armenia had frozen its
      membership in the CSTO, signaling a significant shift in its foreign policy or
      security strategy. This decision raised questions about Armenia’s relationship
      with other CSTO member states and its broader geopolitical stance. In a March
      8, 2024 interview , Armenian Foreign Minister Mirzoyan stated that Armenia is
      actively discussing the possibility of joining the EU. On March 18, 2024, “NATO
      Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reportedly praised on Monday Azerbaijan’s close
      military ties with NATO member Turkey, which helped it to win the 2020 war in
      Nagorno-Karabakh.” Pashinyan explicitly stated , on September 18, 2024, that (1)
      others wrote Armenian history, and (2) Patriotism is destructive and does not
      envision a ‘real’ homeland. On June 18, 2025, Russian-Armenian businessman and
      philanthropist Samvel Karapetyan was charged with making public calls to seize
      state power . The legal action against Karapetyan only began after he publicly
      denounced the government, accusing Pashinyan of orchestrating a targeted campaign
      against the Armenian Church. Just hours after Karapetyan’s remarks, Pashinyan
      publicly floated the confiscation of the Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA), the
      country’s main power distribution company, owned by Karapetyan’s Tashir Group.
      The Public Services Regulatory Commission has fined Electric Networks of Armenia
      $25,000 for documented technical and commercial violations. The government is
      conducting inspections at thirty public dining establishments owned by Pizza Tashir.
      Armen Abazyan, the director of Armenia’s National Security Service, was dismissed
      the day after his officers failed to arrest Samvel Karapetyan swiftly. The 1648
      Westphalian definition of a state is rooted in the principle of sovereignty, where
      each state has exclusive control over its territory and domestic affairs without
      external interference. The following elements define a sovereign state under international
      law and were outlined in frameworks such as the 1933 Montevideo Convention on
      the Rights and Duties of States. First, a sovereign state must possess a clearly
      defined territory. This includes a specific geographical area with recognized
      borders over which the state exercises exclusive control, including land, airspace,
      and natural resources. Second, a permanent population is necessary. This refers
      to a group of people who reside within the state’s territory, regardless of whether
      they are citizens or non-citizens, as long as the population is stable and identifiable.
      Third, the presence of an organized government is essential. The government is
      the central authority that creates and enforces laws, maintains order, manages
      public affairs, and represents the state internally and externally. Fourth, the
      state must have independence or autonomy. This means it can make its laws, policies,
      and decisions without interference from external powers, affirming its self-governing
      status. Fifth, recognition by other states and international organizations. Recognition
      can be formal or practical, allowing the state to participate in the global community
      as a legitimate and equal actor. Lastly, a sovereign state must have the capacity
      to enter into relations with other states. This involves engaging in diplomacy,
      signing treaties, forming alliances, and participating in global institutions
      and negotiations. Together, these elements form the foundation of what constitutes
      a sovereign state under international law. Not only has Pashinyan succumbed to
      the suggested quid pro quo on Nagorno-Karabakh, but since Azerbaijan’s conquest
      of Nagorno-Karabakh, Pashinyan has engaged in reducing Armenia’s sovereignty even
      further by insulting the Armenian Church and its leadership , amending Armenia’s
      constitution, challenging Armenian symbols that contain Mt Ararat , etc., items
      demanded by Baku and a lesser extent Turkey as preconditions for a treaty with
      Armenia. There is no indication that Baku will not demand more concessions from
      Armenia if all the current demands are met. Not only has the Pashinyan regime
      served the anti-Russia interests of the collective West, it has been forced to
      serve the interests of both Turkey and Azerbaijan in reducing Armenia’s identity
      and sovereignty. There are no genuine friends in international relations, only
      shifting alliances based on mutual interests. The regional players include Russia,
      Iran, and the Azerbaijan-Turkey “one nation, two states.” Blaming Russia for the
      loss of Nagorno-Karabakh and subsequently cooling relations is a diplomatic loss
      for Armenia. Iran should be a natural ally of Armenia, especially technologically
      and militarily. Of all three regional powers, only Iran has demanded that Armenian
      sovereignty not be interfered with . Surely, this policy is in their interest,
      as is Armenia’s. The collective West (the US and the EU) is a player, but at a
      distance, as is China, yet the latter has a place. These regional and global powers
      have parochial interests, which Armenia should understand and deal with. Armenia
      must establish strategic goals and methods to achieve them. What will Armenia
      do with no hard allies if the current Israeli-Iranian war spills over into Armenia?
      Would the US or EU send troops into Armenia? No. Armenian officials’ eyes are
      dazzled when invited to EU events. Yet neither the EU nor the US will come to
      Armenia’s defense, nor will Armenia ever enter the EU, considering after almost
      two decades, Georgia, to the north of Armenia, gave up its ascension activities.
      As a result of the 2018 light color regime change, Armenia has trapped itself
      in a conundrum of its creation. It has strained relations with Russia and stagnated
      closer ties with Iran, as closer relations would horrify the West. It is being
      cornered by never-ending demands by Azerbaijan and, to a lesser extent, Turkey.
      Jumping on the illusionary Western bandwagon is not a strategic goal; its operational
      definition is the Pashinyan trap. Like a small kid in a schoolyard not wanting
      to cross a bully, Pashinyan’s government is engaging in national self-deprecation.
      This sorry state of affairs began in May of 2018 as Pashinyan came to power in
      a light-colored revolution only to see its sovereignty degenerate to a point where
      Pashinyan and supporters equate losing 11,500 sq km of “Armenian homeland” with
      gaining a state. Yerevan, Armenia David Davidian is a Lecturer at the American

  - title: Why Most of the World’s Population Don’t Have a Clue About Zionism
    url: https://sonar21.com/why-most-of-the-worlds-population-dont-have-a-clue-about-zionism/
    text: 'Sometimes we are captive to our own cultural prejudices and assume the rest
      of the world understands or perceives an issue in the same way that we do. I started
      thinking about this after my conversation on Friday with Jyotishman … I realized
      that I had assumed that most people are familiar with the eschatological beliefs
      of Jews, and Christians, which is the foundation of Zionism. The truth of the
      matter is otherwise… The majority of the world’s population doesn’t have a clue
      about how the current support for Israel in the United States rests on a foundation
      of religious beliefs about the end of the world and the return of the Messiah.
      Let’s start with some facts (courtesy of Perplexity AI ): About 59% of the world’s
      population lives in Asia, including India. As of 2025, approximately 35.4% of
      the world’s population lives in China and India combined. Specifically, about
      17.5% live in China and 17.9% live in India. About 2.3% of India’s population
      is Christian, while the Jewish population is extremely small—less than 0.01%.
      Christians make up about 2–5% of China’s population, while Jews represent less
      than 0.01%. While I am sure that university educated people in Asia have some
      superficial familiarity with Jewish/Christian eschatology, most are not steeped
      in the details and do not understand how emotionally charged the issue is if someone,
      me in this case, dares to challenge the narrative that the Jews are God’s chosen
      people and have a divine right to inhabit the portion of the Levant known as Israel,
      Gaza and the West Bank. Here are just two examples of comments made in response
      to my chat with Jyotishman: While the CREATOR did Choose for HIMSELF a Covenant
      People, HE also embraces all People who take hold of HIS Covenant (Isaiah 56:6-8).
      Moreover, it is impossible for these Ashkenazi Europeans to be of the seed of
      Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. GOD called Abraham from out of “Ur of the CHALDEES”
      a place where once Black People lived. Therefore, these so-called White Jews are
      IMPOSTORS! Do the research! Johnson, just like “Zionist Christians,” are [sic]
      not interested in the truth: “IF ONLY YOU FULLY OBEY THE LORD YOUR GOD and are
      careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today. For the Lord your
      God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will
      borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.”
      Deuteronomy 15:5 No Matter, Larry Johnson, as well as Satanic Zionist Jews, will
      continue to lie about the Word of God, because it suits them to do so……the time
      is short. Most Christians and religious Jews accept the Old Testament/Torah as
      the divine word of God, even though it was written by Jewish scholars in the 6th
      Century BCE. I don’t. Turning to Perplexity AI again, I asked: When was the Torah
      written: The Torah —the foundational text of Judaism, comprising the first five
      books of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy)—was
      written over a long period, and its exact date of composition is a subject of
      both religious tradition and scholarly debate. Traditional Jewish View • Traditional
      belief: The Torah was written by Moses around the 13th century BCE (approximately
      1200–1300 BCE), during the Israelites’ journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.
      Scholarly (Academic) View • Modern scholarship: Most historians and biblical scholars
      believe the Torah was composed and compiled over several centuries. • Estimated
      timeline: • Earliest sources: Some material may date back to the 10th–9th centuries
      BCE. • Main composition and compilation: Most scholars suggest the Torah reached
      its near-final form between the 7th and 5th centuries BCE (c. 700–400 BCE), during
      and after the Babylonian Exile. • Final editing: The text was likely finalized
      in the 5th century BCE. This was a book compiled by Jewish scholars primarily
      during their captivity in Babylon, under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar II. It
      is a story told initially, drawing on oral traditions, by Jewish scholars who
      assembled a narrative that put Judaism at the center of their religious world.
      While Jewish longing for a return to Zion (Jerusalem and the Land of Israel) has
      existed for centuries, modern Zionism arose in Europe in response to rising antisemitism
      and nationalist movements. The movement was most notably organized by Theodor
      Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian journalist and political activist. Here’s the irony…
      Theodor Herzl was not a religious Jew in the traditional sense. He was born into
      a secular, assimilated Jewish family in Budapest and later lived in Vienna. Herzl’s
      upbringing and personal beliefs were shaped by the secular, intellectual culture
      of 19th-century Central Europe. So here is a guy who does not believe that the
      promises contained in the Torah were written by Moses as dictated to him by a
      divine being. I have deliberately declined to discuss the Islamic eschatology,
      because that opens a whole new can of worms . I will simply note that religious
      Muslims deeply revere Jerusalem and the Holy Land for their association with the
      Prophet Muhammad’s Night Journey, their mention as a blessed land in the Qur’an,
      and their connection to many prophets. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is the
      third holiest site in Islam, and the city holds great spiritual, historical, and
      religious significance for Muslims worldwide. I am not suggesting that other factors,
      such as the control of oil resources in the region and historical grievances,
      play no role in the genocidal war being waged against the Palestinian people.
      However, the religious foundations of this struggle should not be ignored. Here’s
      another twist. Tel Aviv University linguist, Paul Wexler, has written two books
      that offer an alternative narrative: i.e., The Non-Jewish Origins of the Sephardic
      Jews and The Ashkenazic Jews: A Slavo-Turkic People in Search of a Jewish Identity
      . Using linguistic analysis, Wexler concludes that neither of the main branches
      of modern Judaism can claim they are the descendants from the Jewish tribes of
      biblical times. Rather, they descend from disparate populations that converted
      during a vigorous proselytizing campaign traditional Judaism undertook around
      the Mediterranean to counter the rise of Christianity. That sort of worked for
      a while until Islam swamped them both across MENA and, finally, even Spain. Of
      the Ashkenazim, who make up the vast bulk of today’s Jewry and led the Jewish
      takeover of Palestine, he writes: “… contemporary Judaism is best defined not
      as the continuation of the Judaism which served as an antecedent of Christianity
      and Islam, but as a newly Judaized variant of European (mainly Slavic) paganism
      and Christianity…most of the features of Old Palestinian Judaism and Semitic Hebrew
      to be found in Ashkenazic ‘Judaism’ and Medieval Ashkenazic/Modern Israeli ‘Hebrew’
      were latter borrowings rather than original inheritance.” Martin Cohen (Jewish
      Institute of Religion, NYC) wrote in the American Historical Review (Feb. 1999):
      “Wexler’s insights…may possibly startle some readers but in my opinion, they are
      soundly and irrefutably presented”. The upshot of Wexler’s and others’ work, including
      reams of genetic studies, is that there was no Diaspora . The Jews of Palestine,
      for the most part, stayed where they were, mixing with others as empires rose
      and fell and eventually converted to Islam. Today’s Palestinians may be the best
      candidate population of any size to claim an ethnic heritage from the biblical
      Israelites. Don’t get mad at me for suggesting that the narrative spun among the
      Christian West about the righteousness of the Zionist cause may be a fraud. Just

      about global understanding of issues, particularly highlighting that many people,
      especially outside the U.S., are unaware that American support for Israel is deeply
      rooted in specific religious beliefs about eschatology.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the author's realization of the cultural
      biases that shape perceptions of global issues, particularly regarding the eschatological
      beliefs of Jews and Christians that underpin Zionism and the U.S. support for
      Israel. The author notes that a significant portion of the world's population,
      especially in Asia, lacks a deep understanding of these religious narratives,
      which can lead to misunderstandings about the emotional weight of discussions
      surrounding Israel's legitimacy. Highlighting demographic facts, the author emphasizes
      that the majority of people in countries like India and China are not familiar
      with the intricacies of Jewish and Christian eschatology, which complicates dialogues
      about Israel's divine right to the land. The article concludes with examples of
      comments reflecting a lack of awareness about these beliefs and the complexities
      of identity related to the Jewish population.

    text: 'International law has been abolished and never before have events been so
      deliberately misrepresented. A failed attack on Iran, a response from Tehran that
      almost broke Israel’s neck. The painful birth pangs of new political realities
      – the war of two worlds. Introduction US President Trump does what he wants, his
      opinion changes hourly and his actions break both American and international law.
      We already reported on the American attack on Iran in “ Trump has decided and
      is attacking Iran – this will have consequences – for the whole world? ” on June
      22. Now we have some new insights. In this article, we look at the complete military
      and strategic failure of Israel’s and the US’s attacks on Iran, the response of
      the attacked country that brought Israel to the brink of destruction, the “ceasefire”,
      the reasons why Iran spared Israel from possible total destruction. Twelve days
      that had it all. Israel and the US have failed Regime change failed – Iranian
      people united The war against Iran, jointly planned and instigated by the US and
      Israel, was lost by both. Even non-political contemporaries are increasingly amazed
      at the simple-mindedness with which the West, which once dominated the world,
      maneuvers entire regions into a new catastrophe time and time again, lacks any
      humanity in the pursuit of its goals and tramples on the rules it has set itself.
      No matter from which perspective you look at this adventure, it had no chance
      of success. Reza Pahlevi as the new Shah – a spoiled brat seeks money The eldest
      son of the last Shah left Iran with his father’s family at the beginning of 1979.
      The billions stolen enabled the multiple university dropout to lead a more than
      comfortable life. This money seems to have been running out for years. This is
      shown by lawsuits in the US in which he fought with employees and managers over
      money. He is therefore broke and looking for a new livelihood. Pahlevi has spent
      his whole life in the US, has never cared about the welfare of his country and
      is now being used as a puppet by the US, the British and Israel – with the prospect
      of a lot of money. His father had already come to power as an illegal puppet.
      The Iranian people democratically elected the liberal Professor Mohammad Mossadegh.
      After he curtailed the power of the British and American oil giants in order to
      transfer the gigantic oil wealth to his people, the British and Americans reacted
      promptly. With the secret service operation Ajax , MI-6 and the CIA staged a coup
      against Mossadegh and installed the Shah as a puppet. He reversed the democratic
      achievements and returned the wealth to the US and Great Britain. The Americans,
      for their part, forced the British out of business. Business is business. The
      Shah was paid handsomely for this whoring service. Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh
      – Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Another unsavory step: in order to keep the Shah
      in power, the Mossad was hired to set up the notorious SAVAK secret police for
      the new masters. In doing so, it used the support of Gestapo and SS specialists
      who had been disempowered in Germany in 1945. Against the background of this history,
      the West seeks to install this unsavory puppet in Iran, in the unrealistic belief
      that it can repeat the Ajax campaign. So Pahlevi was allowed to appeal to his
      people in Paris – nota bene in English. A speech to the British parliament is
      also planned. These dirty tricks are used to get the Western populations used
      to the desired ruler. The Iranian people have nothing to say about this – or so
      the Western powers think. The following picture shows the young Shah during a
      visit to Israel on April 17, 2023 with Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Intelligence
      Minister Gila Gamliel. From left to right: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
      Reza Pahlavi, Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel The perverse strategy of the
      West in one picture: After the last democratic president was ousted with the father
      of the would-be Shah, the cloned son embarks on a similar adventure, nota bene
      in minne with Netanyahu, who wanted to bomb the way to regime change in Tehran
      a few days ago, killing scientists and military personnel as well as many civilians
      in Iran. My sources in Iran just shake their heads: no one in Iran, young or old,
      even those who liked the old Shah, would want this little boy. Relatively little
      damage in Iran, but many deaths Iran is geographically almost as large as Western
      Europe, 75 times larger than Israel and has a population ten times that of Israel.
      It is therefore logical that the damage in Iran in the military exchange of blows
      with Israel was relatively minor compared to the Jewish state, which is very small
      in terms of area. The nuclear program was literally and figuratively only touched
      on the surface, entrances to underground objects and bunkers were destroyed; symbolic
      damage. Trump’s reports of victory are so inaccurate that even the American secret
      services did not remain loyal to their supreme leader in their announcements and
      were more inclined towards the Iranian view of things. It is difficult to assess
      the extent to which the decapitation strikes against scientists and military leaders
      have weakened Iran’s scientific and military capabilities. In any case, these
      attacks have had exactly the opposite effect on the Iranian people to that intended
      by the West: The Iranian people are united now behind their leadership, including
      the group of young people who want to see the society modernized domestically.
      The attack has therefore not only failed militarily, but also in terms of society.
      Israel on the brink of disaster Huge damage – photos and reports prohibited Overview
      Our colleague and friend Larry Johnson of Sonar21 – a former CIA analyst – compiled
      the following overview of the damage inflicted on Israel. Overview of Iranian
      military strikes against Israel Tel Aviv If you searched for images of destruction
      on X a few days ago, you would find what you were looking for. The following image
      of the complete destruction of Tel Aviv (left) comes from a video that we wanted
      to use for this article. We are not surprised that the video has been removed
      – what remains is a screenshot. The photo on the left shows Tel Aviv and the one
      on the right shows Berlin in 1945. Apart from the fact that the picture of Tel
      Aviv is in color and the one of Berlin is in black and white, there is no difference
      in the extent of the destruction. We are not surprised that the Israeli authorities
      have banned the taking or distribution of photos of the destruction under threat
      of several years’ imprisonment – albeit with modest success. Needless to say,
      such photos cannot be found in the Western media. left: Tel Aviv – June 2025;
      right: Berlin – 1945 Israeli defense companies The Iranians have also successfully
      attacked Israeli arms companies. The state-owned arms company “Rafael”, which
      was attacked, is the crown jewel of the Israeli arms industry. Its production
      program ranges from anti-tank weapons to cruise missiles, marine drones and key
      elements of the “Iron Dome” and “David’s Sling”, Israeli strategic missile defence
      systems. Source: Sonar21.com Rafael operates internationally and also has a subsidiary
      in Germany, Dynamit Nobel Defence . Infrastructure The country has three important
      ports: Haifa, Eilat and Ashdod. The Yemeni Houthis “shut down” Eilat months ago
      by blocking the Bab-al-Mandab Strait, the entrance from the Gulf of Aden into
      the Red Sea for ships bound for or coming from Israel. The port has been dead
      ever since. Since June 13, 2025, the port facilities of Haifa have been so badly
      destroyed by Iran in response to the Israeli attacks on Iran that this largest
      port in Israel will probably only be of very limited use for a long time. This
      also applies to the oil refinery located in the port area. Both infrastructure
      objects are core elements of the Israeli economy. Over 30 percent of Israel’s
      foreign trade is handled via Haifa. The refinery’s share of the Israeli market
      is probably even higher. This is the famous port of Haifa. When Iranians claimed
      they’ve completely destroyed it, I was one of those who silently said, “come on!”
      But there we are. This is the Port of Haifa, in Israel. Just look at the extent
      of damage – as if the structures have been melted in acid.… pic.twitter.com/ShWpRlslOD

      Israel’s third major port, was also so badly affected that American observers
      assume that it only has an effective capacity of 40-50 percent. BREAKING: Rocket

      6, 2024 Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv, another important gateway to the world,
      has also been largely destroyed. But the destruction – and this surprised many
      – also affected the military infrastructure. Israel moved its fighter planes to
      a British base on Cyprus before June 13, 2025. Without this option, the expensive
      aircraft would almost certainly have been destroyed as well as the military airfields.
      Iran speaks of major personnel losses on the Israeli side The West diligently
      propagates how many Iranian scientists and officers were eliminated. The Israelis
      remain silent about their own losses. Iranian sources report the following: An
      Israeli security website had been hacked. Information about Israel’s losses was
      provided there as follows: 6 high-ranking generals; 32 Mossad agents; 78 Shin
      Bet (domestic intelligence) personnel; 27 naval officers; 198 air force officers;
      462 soldiers. We have not been able to verify this information, but it does not
      seem implausible. 40% of Tel Aviv is destroyed – Israel is out of munitions American
      analysts such as Douglas Macgregor assume that 40% of Tel Aviv has been destroyed.
      Destroyed, not damaged. The pictures above show the difference between “damaged”
      and “destroyed”. The Israelis’ much-vaunted “Iron Dome” has failed. Given the
      extent of the damage, the attribute “pathetic” to describe this miracle shield
      (Iron Dome) is not far-fetched. What’s more, Israel has been shot out: credible
      sources told us that the Israelis have practically run out of ammunition. In those
      12 days of war, Israel used up as many defensive missiles as the US can produce
      in two years. So not only does the system not work as advertised, but its production
      capacity means that it cannot be used sustainably. Financially unsustainable system
      If you look at the weapons used in this system, it becomes clear that the Iron
      Dome cannot be operated in a financially sustainable manner in an actual attack.
      The Iron Dome consists of various components; we illustrate some examples. Patriot
      – American According to Reuters, the Patriot system costs 400 million dollars
      without missiles. The unit price of a missile ranges from 3.4 to 8 million dollars,
      depending on the version. Patriot System – Quelle: New York Times Thaad – American
      The cost of a single complete Thaad system (Thaad stands for “Terminal High Altitude
      Area Defense”) is estimated at around three billion dollars for one system. A
      system comprises six launchers, a combat kit of 48 missiles, a radar system and
      a command vehicle. Thaad – Quelle: Wikipedia The costs for the heart of the system
      , the interceptor missiles, are not publicly communicated. In Russian sources,
      we found almost fabulous figures: One missile can cost between 45 and 500 million
      dollars, depending on the design in the export version (e.g. for Saudi Arabia
      or South Korea). One missile. Arrow – Israeli In addition to the aforementioned
      “Thaad” and ‘Patriot’ systems, Israel developed its own missile, the “ Arrow”
      , due to the inadequate performance of the Patriot system. The costs for this
      system amounted to approx. 1.5 billion US dollars, one missile costs approx. 2
      million US dollars . Arrow – Quelle: Wikipedia It is not known how many rockets
      of all systems were fired during these 12 days, but it is likely to have been
      thousands. A prolonged conflict – apart from the fact that the necessary quantities
      of rockets are not available and have very limited functionality – will result
      in Israel’s bankruptcy. “Ceasefire” No agreement The announcement of the end of
      hostilities between Israel and Iran came as a surprise to many. But a detailed
      look at the 12 days of the war sheds light on the alleged darkness. The longer
      the mutual bombardment lasted, the more visibly and tangibly Israel ran out of
      strength, which is not surprising given the geographical and demographic circumstances.
      Iran is 75 times larger and damage is therefore spread over a much larger area;
      the population factor of 10 also comes into play. In contrast, Iran had reorganized
      its command structures after the decapitation strikes of the first few days, which
      was just as visible and, above all, painfully tangible for Israel. The ceasefire
      announced by US President Trump on the night of June 25 is not an official agreement.
      The current state of calm is therefore not a ceasefire, but at best a temporary
      silencing of the guns. Who initiated the ceasefire – and why? According to Larry
      Johnson, the request to cease hostilities came from Netanyahu. The reasons are
      simple and convincing: Israel could not take any longer. The destruction of even
      the most sensitive objects is unprecedented in Israeli history. Will the “ceasefire”
      hold? This question is relatively easy to answer based on the behavior of Israel
      and the US so far. If Israel and the US come to the conclusion that they can achieve
      their goals with a further strike, they will strike. What Mr. Netanyahu and Mr.
      Trump will say before such an attack is completely irrelevant. We have already
      explained why Donald Trump’s word is worthless in our article “ Diplomacy on his
      deathbed – from peace president to warmonger ”. The fact that Israel and the US
      made a complete miscalculation before the first strike will also be irrelevant
      in the decision-making process. Netanyahu must continue to attack, otherwise he
      will end up in prison and Trump will probably believe that he must always win,
      as his character does not allow him to admit mistakes. These imponderables combined
      with Western hubris will probably result in the war continuing and the “ceasefire”
      merely being interpreted as a breather for the Israelis. I very much hope that
      I am wrong. Israel possibly at the end of the line Israeli refugees and internally
      displaced persons According to the Times of Israel, around half a million Israelis
      left the country after October 7, 2023. The newspaper refers to official figures
      from the Israeli Settlement and Immigration Administration. American sources even
      speak of up to 1.5 million, although it is not known whether these people only
      left the country temporarily or permanently. To these figures must be added the
      Israeli internally displaced persons as a result of the fighting with Hamas and
      Hezbollah, whose number amounted to around 100,000 in July 2024 according to the
      “Jüdische Allgemeine Zeitung” . In view of the Iranian response to the Israeli-American
      attack on June 13, 2025, another large number of refugees were added. After the
      Israeli authorities banned Israeli citizens from leaving the country, many simply
      chartered boats to leave the country by sea. We found no official figures, but
      there are unofficial reports of up to another 200,000-250,000 Israelis who are
      said to have left their country. Refugee flows are on the one hand a reaction
      to current events. However, they also reflect political and social problems and
      cause considerable economic and demographic problems. Israel is not exempt from
      this. There is currently not much sign of the much-vaunted patriotism. Those who
      trust their leadership never leave their homeland. Direct and indirect consequences
      The infrastructure and economy have been permanently damaged. It is impossible
      to predict how much time the country will need to rebuild if the ceasefire holds.
      Israel’s economy has not only been suffering since this conflict, but was already
      not in the best of shape in October 2023. In the last two years – i.e. up to June
      13, 2025 – up to 1.5 million Israelis have already left the country – a catastrophe
      for a population of just 9 million. If you also take into account the fact that
      it is mainly those people who can afford to leave a country due to the financial
      circumstances, this figure is even more alarming, as well-educated, wealthy Israelis
      who would be essential for reconstruction are now missing. A further indication
      of how disastrous the situation is is the travel ban imposed by Israeli Transport
      Minister Miri Regev – a comparison with Ukraine comes to mind. The information
      is vague, but the exit ban is in force, even if no details can be found on the
      website of the Israeli embassy in Berlin. The demographic consequences of this
      exodus could be fatal for Israel. Official Israel is always keen to portray the
      country as a land of Jews, in which the majority of residents are Jews. However,
      millions of Arabs also live in the country. Their birth rate is significantly
      higher than that of Jewish Israelis. The waves of refugees following the war and
      the demographic development will sooner or later result in more non-Jews (Muslims,
      Christians) living in the country than Jews, which will foreseeably render the
      Zionist strategy absurd. In addition, there is probably no passport in the world
      at the moment that is less attractive. The losers will be those who only have
      an Israeli passport. It is also difficult to imagine that anyone will move to
      this promised land. Who wants to live in a country where over 50% of the population
      is in favor of genocide? A passport that nobody wants to hold in their hands –
      Source: Süddeutsche Zeitung We will comment on the genocidal character of the
      majority of the Israeli population in a follow-up article. Why did the Iranians
      stop the attacks? Given the circumstances, this is a compelling question. In order
      to gain some clarity, it is necessary to look beyond the region. Military mistake?
      Our sources assume that a continuation of the Iranian barrage would have resulted
      in the collapse or even the downfall of Israel within days or weeks. Thus, from
      a purely military point of view, an opportunity to neutralize Israel in the long
      term was missed. All those directly and indirectly involved and affected were
      certainly aware of such a scenario. There must therefore have been serious and
      very compelling reasons why this historic opportunity was not seized or postponed.Geopolitische
      Considerations by China and Russia Iran has probably suspended hostilities under
      the influence of Russia and China. When weighing up all interests, the disadvantages
      for Russia, China and ultimately Iran appear to have outweighed the foreseeable
      advantages, at least for the time being. The following thoughts should be evaluated
      as such, as we have not been able to gain insight into the Russian and Chinese
      decision-making process. As a matter of principle, Russia and China do not let
      us look at their cards: Firstly, Russia – always de-escalating – must take into
      account the interests of Israelis of Russian descent. At around 2 million, their
      number is considerable. Secondly, a continuation of hostilities would very probably
      have forced Russia to become more involved due to the existing treaty of principle
      on strategic cooperation, even if there is no mention of obligatory military support
      in the event of war in the treaty. There was therefore a risk of becoming a de
      facto participant in the war against a country whose population has extensive
      connections to Russia and a large proportion of whom speak Russian. In addition,
      Russia is making great military progress in Ukraine and does not want to disperse
      its forces. Thirdly, remember the patience that Russia exercised towards Israel
      during the Syrian war, despite the loss of material and, above all, human lives.
      For example, Israeli warplanes deliberately used a Russian unarmed aircrafts as
      cover against Syrian air defenses. Fourthly, a further indication of Russia’s
      reticence towards Israel is the fact that the involvement of the Mossad in the
      Ukrainian drone attack against military airfields in Russia is still not officially
      mentioned in Russia, although many Russian blogs report on it and the facts leave
      little room for interpretation in view of comparable attacks by the Israelis in
      Iran. Fifthly, a full-scale war in Iran would also come at an inopportune time
      for Russia in economic terms. The north-south transport corridor from St. Petersburg
      via the Caucasus and Iran to India is nearing completion and is of considerable
      importance to both countries. China’s interest is more obvious. It is primarily
      concerned with economic reasons. A war in Iran would have severely disrupted the
      Chinese in the realization of their Belt and Road project, in which Iran plays
      a major role and represents an important link in its further expansion to Africa
      and Europe. The Chinese also purchase a great deal of natural gas and oil from
      Iran. An escalation would have severely damaged China’s economic interests. For
      example, immediately after the ceasefire began, the US contractually allowed China
      to purchase oil and gas from Iran without sanctions. This provides Iran with income
      and China with planning security, if one can speak of reliability and security
      in agreements with the Trump administration. The current resurgence of social
      media reports from the White House about 500% secondary sanctions against Russia’s
      trading partners sends its regards. Part of the gas and oil that China receives
      will be used by Iran – another agreement that was reached very quickly after June
      25, 2025 – as payment for modern Chinese fighter jets. Previously, China insisted
      on cash payment, which delayed the realization of the project for a long time.
      Interest of the US We assume that Iran, Russia and China have been given something
      by the US in return for arms silence: Firstly, the US is allowing China to officially
      purchase gas and oil from Iran, as already described. In return, the US now appears
      to have regained access to rare earths from China. This is of paramount interest
      to the US, especially for the defense industry. Rare earths are not rare and the
      US also has significant deposits. However, the US does not have the complete production
      cycle from mining to refining, while China does. Russia has probably obtained
      American concessions with regard to Ukraine – the details are not known, but the
      news on Ukraine certainly suggests this. Trump has already admitted that Iran
      has hit Israel hard and those responsible in the White House and the Pentagon
      are well aware that a continuation of the Iranian attacks would have completely
      destroyed Israel. As a result, the US would have lost even more face than it already
      has. From its imperial perspective, it would have been forced to launch further
      military strikes against Iran, for which the US is neither economically nor militarily
      (lack of ammunition) prepared. A few B2 bombers would not have been enough, because
      Iran cannot be dealt with militarily with bombs and missiles alone. Any further
      attack by the US on Iran would in turn have forced Iran to attack the US bases
      in the Persian Gulf. And then what? It seems that not only Israel has been shot
      out, but that the Americans simply do not have enough ammunition either. Three
      reasons for this: firstly, for three years the US has been emptying its stockpiles
      for Ukraine, despite the lack of successes. It is therefore not surprising that
      the US announced yesterday that it would not be supplying any more weapons to
      Ukraine. Second, since October 7, 2023, the US has been supplying vast quantities
      of ammunition for the genocide in Gaza. Thirdly, the US’s production capacities
      are anything but sufficient to meet demand. As mentioned above, Israel used as
      many air defense missiles in the 12 days of the war with Iran as the US is able
      to produce in two years. The need is now so great that the production of Patriot
      missiles, for example, is also taking place in other countries. Germany, for example,
      will produce 1000 of these missiles . However, there is no mention of how long
      this will take. In a report dated 20 July 2024 , the Russian newspaper Kommersant
      , referring to the US Department of Defense, writes about the increase in annual
      production of missiles for the Patriot missile defence system from 500 to 750
      units. To put the figures mentioned here into context: To defend against an Iranian
      missile, the Israeli air defense system fired up to 25 of these missiles at the
      target. This figure is extreme and certainly due to specific circumstances. But
      as a rule of thumb: for every missile that attacks – and Iran has thousands of
      them – there are at least two interceptor missiles. Conclusion The destruction
      of Israel is in full swing. The reconstruction of partially destroyed Israel (Tel
      Aviv, ports, airports and arms factories) will take years, but requires that the
      ceasefire holds, which is completely uncertain as the protagonists are behaving
      so unreliably. This will result in the owners concerned not putting up any money
      in the current situation. Would you rebuild an office building if there was a
      50% chance that it would be destroyed again tomorrow? It is highly questionable
      whether the Israelis who have fled will return in the foreseeable future. Since
      October 2023, Israel has probably lost almost a third of its population, namely
      the part that is well educated, wealthy and therefore essential for reconstruction.
      It is also possible that many of those who have left the country are not part
      of the genocidal majority of the population – another reason not to return. There
      are no indications that would allow us to predict the future of this conflict.
      It is possible that the war will break out again tomorrow – or not. What we expect
      with certainty, however, is that the War of Two Worlds, which we have already
      described in a series of articles , will continue – possibly in a new location,
      but it will remain bloody. The only assessment we can make with certainty is that
      neither the US nor Israel can be trusted. In terms of reliability and respect
      for international law, these two countries are on a par with Nazi Germany. Peter

      The piece criticizes the simplistic and inhumane strategies employed by the West
      in their pursuit of regime change, which ultimately united the Iranian people
      against foreign aggression. Additionally, it touches on the plight of Reza Pahlavi,
      the son of the last Shah of Iran, who is depicted as financially struggling and
      disconnected from the realities of his homeland. Overall, the article portrays
      a significant shift in political dynamics and the ineffectiveness of Western interventions
      in the region.

    text: 'Since it is the Fourth of July, I suppose the most apt metaphor to describe
      Donald Trump’s foreign policy is a fireworks display. For those of you who live
      overseas, it is tradition in America to detonate fireworks to commemorate the
      signing of the Declaration of Independence. Trump’s fireworks display is not like
      those professional spectacles you see when New Year’s Eve is celebrated — i.e.,
      highly scripted, well-organized and impressive. Nope. Trump is like that guy in
      your neighborhood who is convinced he invented firecrackers and spurting flaming
      fountains, and he is going to show the neighbors how it’s done. The problem is
      that he almost sets himself ablaze; he fires some errant bottle rockets into the
      neighbor’s home and starts a real fire; some of the Roman candles don’t ignite;
      but he manages to salvage a blazing finale because he accidentally detonates the
      propane-gas tank that heats his hot tub. He then turns to his neighbors and proclaims,
      “That was the biggest, most magnificent display in history.” And he truly believes
      it. So let’s start with potential, promising developments with respect to Gaza.
      Netanyahu’s popularity reportedly has soared in Israel and his Likud party now
      believes they can win a snap election and will no longer have to cater to the
      Zionist crazies, like Ben Gvir and Smotrich. Trump’s intervention with the Israeli
      court seems to have removed, at least temporarily, the legal sword of Damocles
      hanging over Bibi’s noggin. How is this good news for the Palestinians? Because
      Bibi reportedly is now willing to entertain a ceasefire, accompanied by a release
      of hostages on both sides, and Hamas reportedly is favorably considering the deal.
      However, the deal ain’t done and there are still points of disagreement between
      Hamas and Israel. Specifically: – The withdrawal of the Israeli army from key
      positions in the Gaza Strip. – Changing the mechanism for humanitarian aid. –
      Guarantees for the continuation of negotiations. And there are other disturbing
      signs that Israel is just trying to buy time. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
      reportedly has asked his war cabinet to prepare an “evacuation plan” of the Palestinian
      population from the north of the Gaza Strip to Rafah, the very south of the strip.
      Likud Ministers also are urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to annex the West Bank
      as the time is just “ripe” following Israel’s victories abroad, according to Israeli
      Channel 12’s Amit Segal. I think these are two issues that Netanyahu will discuss
      with Donald Trump on Monday, during his trip to Washington. Trump being Trump,
      I expect Bibi will persuade him that this is the best policy to pursue. So, hopes
      of even a temporary ceasefire and the establishment of a reliable, safe flow of
      humanitarian aid to the residents of Gaza are dim at best. Turning to Trump’s
      relations with Putin, Trump continues to insist that the war in Ukraine ain’t
      his fault — it is Joe Biden’s — and that he is disappointed that Vladimir Putin
      won’t kiss his ass like the NATO Secretary General did a week ago. Trump reportedly
      spent almost two hours on the phone with Ukraine’s Zelensky today, and both sides
      seem pleased with the call. Trump even said he would see what he could do to get
      Ukraine some more air defense. Zelensky offered a more upbeat assessment : We
      discussed air defense capabilities and agreed that we will work to increase air
      defense. We agreed on a corresponding meeting of our teams. Instead of confronting
      Zelensky with the hard truth that the US cupboards are bare and that Russia is
      beating the tar out of Ukraine, Trump opted for the coward’s way out and played
      along with Zelensky’s delusions. Trump may think he is very clever with these
      tactics, but he is just perpetuating the war… one he could end in short order
      if he eliminated all support to Ukraine. I started by Friday morning chatting
      with Jyotishman, who is currently in Beijing. We had a fascinating chat about
      the eschatological nonsense that governs US policy in West Asia: And then there
      is Nima. We are at war … he’s showing up with better shirts than me. Actually,
      our chuckles about wardrobe are a nice diversion from the grim news we covered
      with respect to the Palestinians, Iran and the war in Ukraine: I thank you for

    paragraph_summary: The article uses the metaphor of a chaotic fireworks display
      to describe Donald Trump's foreign policy, likening it to an unorganized and reckless
      attempt at showcasing power rather than a well-planned strategy. It highlights
      recent developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noting that Israeli Prime
      Minister Netanyahu's popularity has surged, potentially allowing him to pursue
      a ceasefire with Hamas, which is also considering a deal. However, the article
      emphasizes that significant disagreements remain between the two sides regarding
      military withdrawal, humanitarian aid mechanisms, and negotiation guarantees,
      indicating that while there are promising signs, the situation is still precarious
      and unresolved.

    url: https://sonar21.com/the-importance-of-todays-chat-between-putin-and-trump/
    text: 'My, my, what a difference 10 days makes. Remember what Donald Trump said
      on June 24 about Putin’s offer to help with Iran? Donald Trump publicly rejected
      President Vladimir Putin’s offer to help with the Iran conflict, specifically
      the escalating situation between Israel and Iran. Trump told reporters that when
      Putin called and asked, “Can I help you with Iran?” Trump replied, “No, I don’t
      need help with Iran. I need help with you.” He redirected the conversation to
      focus on the ongoing war in Ukraine, emphasizing that resolving the Russia-Ukraine
      conflict was his priority rather than accepting Russian mediation in the Middle
      East. Trump further clarified his stance by telling Putin, “Do me a favor, mediate
      your own. Let’s mediate Russia first. You can worry about this later.” He expressed
      that the United States was more interested in working with Russia to settle the
      Ukraine conflict, citing the high number of casualties and the continued fighting
      as unacceptable. Now we learn that Trump apparently has had a change of heart
      regarding Russia’s ability to help with Iran. Today, Putin and Trump had a conversation
      — Yuri Ushakov, the special representative of the Russian president, explained
      the main points of their dialogue : — Trump raised the issue of an early end to
      military action in Ukraine in his conversation with Putin; — Putin and Trump did
      not discuss a possible personal meeting; — Trump informed Putin about the successful
      passage of the bill on tax and immigration reform in the Senate; — Putin congratulated
      Trump on the upcoming US Independence Day; — Putin noted in his conversation with
      Trump that Russia played an important role in the development of American statehood;
      — Putin and Trump discussed in detail the situation around Iran and the Middle
      East in general; — Putin and Trump touched on the developments in Syria during
      their conversation; Moscow and Washington will continue their dialogue on this
      topic; — Putin and Trump discussed a number of promising joint economic projects
      in energy and space exploration; — Putin and Trump will continue to communicate
      with each other. The presidents can pick up the phone at any time during the day
      if they need to talk to each other; — Putin told Trump that Russia continues to
      seek a negotiated solution to the Ukrainian conflict; — Putin told Trump that
      Russia will not back down from its goals to eliminate the causes of the conflict
      in Ukraine. This was a friendly, but frank conversation. Putin took the high road
      by acknowledging America’s Fourth of July celebration and reminding President
      Trump of Russia’s friendship with the newly formed United States. Actually, I
      don’t think Trump knows that history, but Putin was sending a clear message that
      Russia’s intent is to be a friend, not an enemy of Russia. What caught my eye
      was that Trump discussed the situation in Iran with Putin… a volte face from his
      remarks on June 24. Trump insisted in remarks to the press that, “President Putin
      offered to help mediate the tensions with Iran, but I told him my priority is
      ending the war in Ukraine. I said, ‘Let’s focus on peace in Europe first.’” I
      think Russia’s account of what was said is more accurate–i.e., “… they discussed
      in detail the situation around Iran.” What details? For example, I think Trump
      realizes that he has zero chance of persuading Iran to allow IAEA inspections
      without Russia’s help. Iran does not trust the US, but it will listen to Putin
      and Lavrov, who are encouraging Iran not to abandon the Non-Proliferation Treaty
      (NPT). I think that Trump’s narcissism prevents him from admitting he asked Russia
      for help. Putin, for his part, has a very precise goal — prevent a further exchange
      of bombs and missiles between Iran and Israel. Also worth noting that Syria was
      discussed. I am pretty sure that Putin expressed concern about the current actions
      of the US-backed Syrian government, which is killing Christians and Alawites.
      Putin’s position on Ukraine, and ending the war, remains firm. It is not just
      about defeating Ukraine on the battlefield; it is ultimately about getting NATO
      to reverse its aggressive policy towards Russia and accepting that Russia has
      legitimate security concerns that must be addressed. The good news is that Putin
      and Trump agreed to continue talking to each other. I think Trump’s decision,
      which was announced yesterday, to halt sending weapons to Ukraine was intended
      as an olive branch to Putin. Here is a better translation of what Putin said to
      Trump: Our president also said that Russia will achieve its goals, that is, the
      elimination of all the root causes that led to the current state of affairs, to
      the current confrontation. And Russia will not back down from these goals. Quite
      clear. Trump had to be in a very good mood given his success in getting Congress
      to pass the Big, Beautiful Bill and, uncharacteristically, shied away from posting
      any outlandish or disparaging comments on TruthSocial about his conversation with
      Putin. Now, to the videos. Scott Ritter filled in for Ray McGovern today on The
      Roundtable with Judge Napolitano. Ray is attending a conference in Germany… my
      old friend is racking up some hellacious frequent-flyer miles. I also spoke with
      Garland Nixon. Last, I was interviewed a few days ago on Iranian TV, and received
      the video late last night. I thank you for your invaluable support by taking time

    one_sentence_summary: In a significant shift, Donald Trump initially rejected Vladimir
      Putin's offer to mediate the Iran conflict, prioritizing the resolution of the
      Russia-Ukraine war instead, but recent developments suggest a change in his stance.
    paragraph_summary: In a notable shift from his previous stance, Donald Trump recently
      engaged in a conversation with Vladimir Putin where they discussed the situation
      in Iran and the Middle East, a topic Trump had previously dismissed in favor of
      focusing on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Just ten days earlier, Trump had rejected
      Putin's offer to assist with Iran, stating that he needed help with Ukraine instead.
      However, during their latest dialogue, they explored various issues including
      the potential for an early end to military actions in Ukraine, developments in
      Syria, and the importance of continued communication between Moscow and Washington.
      This change in Trump's approach suggests a growing openness to Russian involvement
      in Middle Eastern affairs, contrasting sharply with his earlier priorities.

      Barack Obama spoke about the National Security Agency (NSA) and intelligence agencies
      surveillance techniques at the US Department of Justice in Washington, DC, January
      17, 2014. Obama trimmed the powers of the secretive US eavesdropping agency Friday
      by calling for new privacy safeguards, but allowed bulk phone data sweeps to continue
      as an anti-terror tool. In a long-awaited speech outlining changes to programs
      exposed by Edward Snowden, Obama also said he had halted National Security Agency
      (NSA) spy taps targeting friendly world leaders.   AFP PHOTO / Jim WATSON        (Photo
      credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) Yes, I am going to say, “I told
      you so.” The New York Post report on a new CIA review of the December 2016 Intelligence
      Community Assessment on Russian Election Interference (ICA) , reminds me of Claude
      Rains, who played the police captain in Casablanca … He was shocked to discover
      gambling in the casino. A bombshell new CIA review of the Obama administration’s
      spy agencies’ assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election
      to help Donald Trump was deliberately corrupted by then-CIA Director John Brennan,
      FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper,
      who were “excessively involved” in its drafting, and rushed its completion in
      a “chaotic,” “atypical” and “markedly unconventional” process that raised questions
      of a “potential political motive.” Further, Brennan’s decision to include the
      discredited Steele dossier, over the objections of the CIA’s most senior Russia
      experts, “undermined the credibility” of the assessment. The “Tradecraft Review
      of the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment [ICA] on Russian Election Interference”
      was conducted by career professionals at the CIA’s Directorate of Analysis and
      was commissioned by CIA Director John Ratcliffe in May. Here is the link to the
      CIA report on Russiagate . So, I am taking this opportunity for a victory lap.
      I wrote an article debunking the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian
      Election Interference (ICA), in January 2017 on Pat Lang’s blog, but it is now
      inactive and I can’t find the link. However, thanks to Perplexity AI , here’s
      an accurate summary of what I wrote eight years ago: Larry Johnson is a former
      CIA analyst and commentator who has written critically about the U.S. intelligence
      community’s assessment of Russian activities and intentions in recent U.S. elections,
      particularly regarding the 2016 presidential election. In his writings, Johnson
      has challenged the conclusions of the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment
      (ICA) titled “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections.”
      He argues that the report is politically motivated, lacks solid evidence, and
      is based on subjective judgments rather than hard intelligence. Key points from
      Larry Johnson’s perspective include: • Skepticism of the ICA’s Conclusions: Johnson
      asserts that the ICA, which assessed with “high confidence” that Russia sought
      to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process and favored Donald Trump,
      is not supported by concrete evidence. He contends that the report relies heavily
      on assumptions and analytic judgments rather than verifiable intelligence. • Critique
      of Methodology: Johnson has argued that the ICA was not a consensus product of
      all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, as sometimes claimed, but rather the work of
      a handpicked group of analysts from three agencies (CIA, FBI, NSA) under the direction
      of then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. • Political Influence
      Alleged: He suggests that the assessment was shaped by political bias within the
      intelligence leadership during the Obama administration, and that dissenting views
      were excluded from the final report. • Lack of Technical Evidence: Johnson points
      out that the ICA did not present technical forensic evidence to substantiate claims
      of Russian hacking or direct coordination with the Trump campaign. I nailed the
      fact that the ICA was, “ the work of a handpicked group of analysts from three
      agencies (CIA, FBI, NSA) under the direction of then-Director of National Intelligence
      James Clapper ,” eight years ago. Glad the media finally caught up. I was interviewed
      on Tuesday by Glenn Diesen about the Iran/Israel war. During the interview, I
      made a mistake on the timeline regarding when the battleship New Jersey launched
      shells into the Bekaa Valley and the bombing of the Marines in October 1983. What
      I should have said, to be more precise, was that the US Marines were supporting
      the Lebanese factions that were killing Shia. My basic point still holds–we provoked
      that. Anyway, enjoy the chat: I thank you for your invaluable support by taking

  - title: Looks Like Trump is Walking Away from the Ukrainian Military Casino
    url: https://sonar21.com/looks-like-trump-is-walking-away-from-the-ukrainian-military-casino/
    text: 'THAAD Launcher Today, the Pentagon announced that the Ukrainian party is
      over : The U.S. is halting some shipments of weapons to Ukraine amid concerns
      that its own stockpiles have declined too much, officials said Tuesday, a setback
      for the country as it tries to fend off escalating attacks from Russia . Certain
      munitions were previously promised to Ukraine under the Biden administration to
      aid its defenses during the more than three-year-old war . The pause reflects
      a new set of priorities under President Donald Trump and came after Defense Department
      officials scrutinized current U.S. stockpiles and raised concerns. This means
      that Ukraine WON’T be getting any more: PAC3 Patriot missiles 155mm artillery
      shells GMLRS rockets Stinger, AIM-7, and Hellfire missiles While the White House
      insisted that it is just “putting American interests first,” the move reveals
      that the US has a serious problem in manufacturing certain weapon systems and
      that supplies are at or near critical levels. Consider that has happened with
      the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, aka THAAD , which was deployed
      to Israel. The United States currently produces about 50–60 THAAD missiles (interceptors)
      per year at a price of $13 million per missile. The production number reflects
      recent production rates as of 2025, which have increased to meet both domestic
      and international demand. Lockheed Martin, the primary manufacturer, previously
      reported manufacturing as many as eight missiles per month, which would equate
      to a maximum of 96 per year, but more recent and widely cited estimates place
      the annual output closer to 50–60 interceptors. Let me repeat that… 50–60 a year.
      This production rate is significant given the high cost and limited global stockpile
      of THAAD missiles. During a the 12-day war with Iran, the US expended 15–20% of
      its global THAAD arsenal supporting Israel, highlighting both the high operational
      demand and the relatively slow pace at which these interceptors can be replenished.
      Had the war continued another two weeks, it is likely that the US would have exhausted
      its supply of THAADs . We have witnessed a similar shortage with the GBU-57 Massive
      Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bombs, which were dropped on Iranian nuclear sites on
      June 22. Although the precise number in the US inventory is not publicly disclosed,
      experts believe that the current US stockpile is likely fewer than 50 units. However,
      Boeing, in partnership with the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma, currently
      is building between 72 and 96 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) per year.
      This is based on a recent production expansion completed in mid-2024, which increased
      output from two bombs per month (24 per year) to at least six, and potentially
      up to eight, bombs per month. Therefore, the new annual production rate is estimated
      at 72 to 96 units. And then there are the Patriot missiles. Lockheed Martin has
      that contract as well and reportedly produces 550 missiles per year. A Patriot
      missile launcher can carry a different number of missiles depending on the missile
      type: • PAC-2 missiles: Up to 4 missiles per launcher. • PAC-3 CRI missiles: Up
      to 16 missiles per launcher. • PAC-3 MSE missiles: Up to 12 missiles per launcher.
      Usually, there are at least two Patriot missiles fired for every approaching threat,
      such as a missile or drone. Two days ago, Russia fired over 500 missiles and drones
      into Ukraine. If Ukraine still had functioning Patriot missile launchers and a
      supply of missiles, that Russian attack would have depleted both the US and Ukraine’s
      supply of missiles. Has anyone in Washington learned a damn thing from the war
      in Ukraine? Do they now understand that the US is incapable of matching the Russians
      or the Chinese in the production of weapons expended on the battlefield? I don’t
      think so. Trump keeps pounding his chest, while insisting America has the greatest
      military in the world. Here is a newsflash, Don: No, you don’t. Meanwhile in Moscow,
      there is a glimmer of hope that not all European leaders are insane. Putin and
      Macron chatted by phone on July 1 and it seemed to go well. Here is the Kremlin
      readout: The two leaders held a detailed discussion on the situation in the Middle
      East in the context of the Iran-Israel confrontation and the recent U.S. strikes
      on Iranian nuclear facilities. Putin and Macron emphasized the special responsibility
      of Russia and France as permanent members of the UN Security Council in maintaining
      global peace and security, particularly in the Middle East, as well as in upholding
      the nuclear non-proliferation regime. They underscored the importance of respecting
      Iran’s legitimate right to develop a peaceful nuclear program and to continue
      fulfilling its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, including cooperation
      with the IAEA. Both leaders advocated resolving the Iranian nuclear crisis — as
      well as other regional conflicts — exclusively through political and diplomatic
      means. They agreed to stay in contact to possibly coordinate positions. Discussing
      the situation in Ukraine, Putin reiterated that the conflict is a direct result
      of Western policies, which for years ignored Russia’s security interests, fostered
      an anti-Russian foothold in Ukraine, and encouraged violations of the rights of
      Russian-speaking populations. He noted that the West continues to prolong hostilities
      by supplying modern weapons to Kiev. Regarding prospects for peace, the Russian
      president reaffirmed Russia’s fundamental stance: any potential agreements must
      be comprehensive, long-term, and address the root causes of the conflict while
      reflecting the new territorial realities. The conversation between Putin and Macron
      was substantive. Putin did not budge an inch as far as Russia’s terms for a negotiated
      end to the war. This marked the first polite conversation between the two since
      September 2022. Putin and Macron discussed their respective roles on the UN Security
      Council. Based on my brief experience there in April 2024, I can state without
      reservation that the French representative is a total prick. So the fact that
      Putin and Macron are talking about how the UNSC can play a more constructive role
      could indicate that the French ambassador is going to be instructed to start acting
      and speaking like a diplomat. What do you think Trump’s reaction will be when
      he finds out that Putin and Macron are chatting? My guess is that he will be upset
      that he is no longer the only world leader in Putin’s life. However, did you catch
      what Putin said about Western responsibility? He noted that the West continues
      to prolong hostilities by supplying modern weapons to Kiev. Could it be that the
      Pentagon’s announcement that it is no longer supplying “modern weapons” to Ukraine
      was a signal to Putin that the US is ending its role in Ukraine? Very interesting.

    paragraph_summary: The Pentagon has announced a halt to certain weapon shipments
      to Ukraine, citing concerns over dwindling U.S. stockpiles amid the ongoing conflict
      with Russia. This decision, which reflects a shift in priorities under President
      Trump, means Ukraine will no longer receive key munitions such as PAC3 Patriot
      missiles, 155mm artillery shells, and various missile types. The White House claims
      this move prioritizes American interests, but it underscores significant issues
      in U.S. military manufacturing capabilities, particularly for systems like the
      THAAD missile defense system, which produces only 50-60 interceptors annually
      at a high cost. The limited production capacity and high operational demand were
      highlighted during recent military engagements, raising alarms about the sustainability
      of U.S. defense support for allies.

      War'

    text: 'THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN BY A READER OF SONAR21 WHO WISHES TO REMAIN
      ANONYMOUS “And everybody praised the Duke Who this great fight did win.” “But
      what good came of it at last?” Quoth little Peterkin. “Why that I cannot tell,”
      said he, “But ’twas a famous victory.” After Blemheim Robert Southey 1796 On June
      22, 2025, the United States launched Operation Midnight Hammer, an “obliterating”
      attack on Iran’s nuclear program that has so far been peaceful. This happened
      despite the fact that the IAEA had not produced any concrete evidence that any
      enriched uranium had been diverted to weaponization. Iran’s possible responses
      to such an unjustifiable attack had been gamed out. Possibilities included a devastating
      missile salvo on US bases in the Persian Gulf, further attacks on Israeli infrastructure,
      closure of the Strait of Hormuz, mobilization of Hezbollah in Lebanon, drones
      from Ansar Allah from Yemen, and further resistance from Hamas in Gaza. Such events
      could have collapsed the world economy. But apart from a few token missiles launched
      by Iran at the Al Udeid base southwest of Doha, Qatar that killed no one, the
      war seems to be on hold. There is a pause in hostilities without an actual ceasefire.
      What is going on here? Several different viewpoints have emerged. Scott Ritter
      seems to think that the Israeli attacks on Iran widely shown in the Western media
      must have been quite painful for Iran. After all, for a country under so many
      sanctions, it is not easy to rebuild after destruction. The death of 935 people
      in Iran puts pressure on the Islamic Republic. It suggests that the government
      cannot defend its own people and undermines its credibility. This could lead to
      the decapitation and collapse scenario that had been dream of the Neocons prior
      to the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. After all, if Iran had been in a dominant
      position, it would not have agreed to stop. A Native American Muslim has written
      on Sonar21 that the reason for pause in hostilities can be found in the Quran
      that the Iranians adhere to strictly. If the enemy stops its attack, the Muslims
      must also do the same, even if they hold a winning hand. Laith Marouf thinks that
      the reason Iran stopped their attack was because Iran had brought Israel to the
      brink of collapse. Benjamin Netanyahu was begging the US to help against the Persian
      onslaught by joining the conflict. If the conflict had continued, Israel would
      have no other option other than the Samson Option, i.e., use of nuclear weapons
      against Iran, and possibly other states in the region. I personally think that
      Laith Marouf is the closest to the calculations in the minds of the IRGC. The
      Samson Option is the ultimate nightmare scenario for West Asia. The preferred
      option for the Persians is the so-called Samsonite Option. In other words, the
      settlers pack their Samsonites and head back to Brooklyn. Such a scenario can
      only be achieved in stages. The Israeli economy has to be slowly strangled using
      war and other coercive measures. The settlers have no real connection to the land
      they occupy. At least a million out of the 7 million settlers hold dual citizenship
      and would have no problem immigrating. Many others can find work visas in other
      countries or claim refugee status. The number of people who have left Israel after
      October 7, 2023 is thought to be at least in the hundreds of thousands. It is
      not unusual to find estimates exceeding 1 million on the internet, but reliability
      of such estimates is questionable. It is therefore very likely that the Samsonite
      scenario is already at least partially in operation. So, what should Israel be
      doing at this time? They could change course and accept a two-state solution.
      But that would mean telling the half a million settlers in the West Bank to move
      into Israel proper. These settlers are armed with automatic weapons given to them
      by the Israeli state. If they are uprooted, the civil strife in Israel is likely
      to include a lot of spilt blood. Whether Israel can survive that remains questionable.
      The entire strategy of Israel has been to make a two-state solution impossible.
      Here they have succeeded. Israel could also begin negotiations with Hezbollah
      or Hamas to find a modus vivendi. In war, that would seem impossible. Without
      war, Netanyahu cannot survive and would go to jail. Without war, Al-Aqsa cannot
      be destroyed and the Third Temple cannot be built. The hard-liners in Israel would
      never accept that, and they remain in power. Just as September 11, 2001 launched
      a series of responses from the US that have ultimately weakened its global position,
      October 7, 2023 has launched a series of responses from Israel that have limited
      its geostrategic options. So, what should Iran be doing at this time? It has been
      argued that they have been deceived into negotiating with the West and delayed
      signing the mutual defense treaty with Russia. It has been argued that the Western-aligned
      liberals who support Javad Zarif and Masoud Pezeshkian will do anything to gain
      approval of the Europeans, including not aligning with Russia. Although this point
      of view may be partially correct, it ignores a fundamental fact of Israel. At
      least 1 million Jews in Israel are of Russian origin, most holding dual Russian
      citizenship. When Russia annexed Crimea, Vladimir Putin stated on March 18, 2024:
      “If we are talking about the protection of our citizens, the protection of Russian-speaking
      people, the protection of Russian compatriots, Russia will always do this, and
      we will do it by all available means, including military force.” The entire war
      in Ukraine is based upon this principle that Russia would defend Russian-speaking
      people of the Donbass if they were attacked by the Ukrainian government. So why
      would Russian not defend the Russian citizens in Israel if they were attacked
      by Iran? What was the exact wording of the proposed agreement that Russia gave
      to Iran to sign? Surprisingly, the Russian Jews living in Israel have little affinity
      for Russia itself. Despite the fact that Germany perpetrated the Holocaust and
      Russia saved the Jews by defeating Germany, Jews have much warmer feeling for
      Germany than Russia. This is said to be because Germany has accepted its responsibility
      for the Holocaust, but Russia has never accepted its responsibility for its historic
      antisemitism under Stalin. Such is the ill-will against Russia that many of the
      Jewish Neocons have targeted Russia for destruction in their works for various
      think tanks. The current war in Ukraine has been supported by Mossad with collaboration
      in intelligence and drones. Therefore, Israel can even be considered a hostile
      nation by Russia. So, both Russia and Iran have to tread carefully. Iran cannot
      sign a mutual defense treaty with Russian that would hamstring its ability to
      wage war with Israel if the hostilities commence again. Russia must stay true
      to its commitment to protect Russian-speaking people even if they are hostile
      to it. Iran must very carefully navigate between the Samson Option and the Samsonite
      Option. Russia must not appear to take sides against Israel openly. There are
      two kinds of information that will become publicly available in the next few weeks
      and months that would be of great interest to me. The first would be battle damage
      assessment from Israel and Iran that would tell us how close to the Samson Option
      Israel was, and how much pressure the Islamic Republic was feeling being unable
      to protect its citizens. The second would be what level of military cooperation
      Iran and Russia agree to, and whether it includes any protections for Russian
      Jews. And the war continues, each side looking for that “famous victory” with
      our future children destined to find things under the rubble that are “large,
      smooth, and round.” I thank you for your invaluable support by taking time to

      inflicted considerable damage, undermining the Iranian government's credibility
      and leading to internal pressures. This situation has prompted various interpretations,

      reflects its weakened position rather than a strategic choice.

  - title: The Empire of Lies Must Fall
    url: https://sonar21.com/the-empire-of-lies-must-fall/
    text: 'A Call for Revolution of Consciousness for the New Dawn of Humanity “For
      what’s been “normal” can still change, If our love expands its range. So let’s
      unmask Empire’s spin, And build a world worth living in.” “The Empire” – The Frontier
      Man The Lie Always Comes First Before the bombs fall, before the sanctions choke,
      before the drone strike turns a wedding into a crater—there is a story. The story
      that says: We are the good guys. This is the first crime of the Empire: the lie
      that cloaks its violence in virtue. Not just the violence itself—but the ease
      with which it is made invisible, the speed with which it is turned into entertainment.
      The American Empire is not merely a machine of war. It is a factory of myths.
      Myths so seductive, so immersive, that they turn complicity with murder into identity.
      This is not just domination—it is sorcery. A kind of psychic conquest that replaces
      reality with ritual, conscience with costume. An empire whose power does not rest
      only on military supremacy, but on narrative supremacy: the ability to make injustice
      feel like order, exploitation feel like generosity, and war feel like safety.
      It is not just that this Empire kills. It teaches its people to cheer for the
      killing. To wave flags while children in Gaza suffocate under rubble. To post
      patriotic memes while Yemeni families bury their dead in desperate silence. To
      recite slogans about liberty while applauding the starvation of whole nations
      through economic warfare. This is not simply propaganda—it is the construction
      of a moral architecture in which an atrocity becomes acceptable, and then—inevitably—unnoticeable.
      This Empire does not only commit atrocities; it manufactures accomplices. Through
      screens that romanticize war. Through slogans that bury genocide in euphemisms.
      Through silence that drowns any cry from the oppressed. The Empire has perfected
      a kind of violence that needs no chains—only belief. The most effective Empire
      is not the one that enslaves bodies, but the one that colonizes minds. American
      imperialism has done something few empires in history have managed: it has taught
      people to identify with their own propaganda. Its greatest triumph is psychological.
      It convinces its citizens to not only tolerate violence, but to demand it. To
      not only ignore suffering, but to justify it. To not only believe lies—but to
      depend on them. This conditioning begins in childhood—through textbooks, national
      holidays, and tales of “exceptionalism.” The Myth of Exceptionalism and the Logic
      of Violence “Exceptionalism” is the sacred myth at the heart of the Empire—the
      belief that one nation, one people, one way of life is inherently superior to
      all others. It is a story told not as aspiration, but as destiny. This belief
      is not benign; it is the ideological engine that justifies domination and subjugation.
      For if a people are exceptional, then what they do is not subject to the same
      moral standards as others. Their wars are not wars of aggression, but of liberation.
      Their wealth is not exploitation, but reward. Their control is not tyranny, but
      stewardship. But the logic of exceptionalism always leads to murder. It creates
      a moral hierarchy in which the lives of others—those who do not belong to the
      “exceptional” group—are worth less, or nothing at all. The Other becomes expendable.
      Bombed villages become “collateral damage.” Sanction-starved children become “strategic
      costs.” Every crime becomes an act of righteousness when committed by the “exceptional.”
      This myth disables empathy. It transforms suffering into statistics and tragedy
      into tactics. When people are taught that their nation is uniquely virtuous, they
      are less likely to question its actions, less willing to listen to those it harms,
      and more inclined to see its violence as necessary or even noble. Exceptionalism
      breeds a spiritual blindness—a belief that the world must conform to one vision,
      and that those who resist must be corrected, punished, or erased. In this way,
      the myth of moral superiority becomes the psychological groundwork for war. It
      does not just make killing permissible—it makes it justified and invisible. And
      worst of all, it makes killing feel like virtue. It is reinforced by a compliant
      mainstream media machine that floods the public with stories of heroism, never
      horror. The American public is not evil. But it has been heavily propagandized
      and trained to comply—trained to feel pride instead of guilt, superiority instead
      of humility, and fear instead of love and compassion. Empires thrive on fear—the
      fear of scarcity, of irrelevance, of the Other. In this way, Empire sustains itself
      not by the iron fist, but through the velvet glove of myths. Myths strong enough
      to maintain a system of global cruelty without ever having to name it or to understand
      it. The Seduction of Comfort There is a reason why the American Empire is more
      dangerous than the dictatorships it condemns: because it does not need to suppress
      dissent by force. It has learned how to make people believe their silence is noble,
      their apathy is wisdom, and their complicity is patriotism. It teaches obedience
      through comfort. It rewards loyalty with ease. And in doing so, it turns citizens
      into caretakers of Empire—even as it destroys everything that once made their
      lives worth living: their love, empathy, curiosity, and connection to humanity.
      The Empire’s brilliance lies in making people think they are free, even while
      they remain shackled to a worldview that demands the constant death of others
      to sustain itself. But no lie lasts forever. The stories that justified centuries
      of war and plunder are beginning to crack. The myth of moral supremacy no longer
      holds in a world where mobile phone cameras are everywhere, and the dead can speak
      through a phone screen. The truth, long buried beneath Hollywood scripts and sanitized
      history, is resurfacing. And when it does, it doesn’t just threaten the Empire’s
      dominance—it reveals its corrupt and inhumane soul. Because when people awaken
      from indoctrination, what dies first is the illusion of virtue. And that fall—that
      loss of imagined righteousness—shakes harder than any economic collapse or military
      defeat ever could. A New Revolution of Consciousness But what rises from those
      ruins? What comes after the Empire of Lies has fallen—not just as a system, but
      as a story? What lies ahead is not merely political upheaval but an existential
      reckoning with the crimes of the Empire and with the culture that enabled them.
      The danger was never just in drones or dollars, but in the deep psychic investment
      in a narrative of false benevolence. When that story breaks, so too does the veil
      that shielded the Empire from accountability. The fall of such an Empire will
      not be a spectacle of fire—it will be a collapse of certainty. A rupture in the
      myths that have animated a nation. It will be an awakening, painful and profound,
      in which the true cost of false beliefs is finally revealed. And in that awakening,
      the world may discover not just justice, but clarity. But what follows clarity?
      What replaces a culture built on fear, conquest, and obedience? The answer must
      be nothing less than a reimagining of the human project—a new revolution of consciousness.
      A society built not on conquest and dominance, but on love, compassion, and dignity.
      Not on fear of the Other, but reverence for our shared humanity. A society that
      recognizes that strength lies not in death and destruction, but in understanding
      and peaceful cooperation. That true freedom is not the license to dominate, but
      the capacity to live and love without needing to. That radical, unselfish love
      is not sentimental weakness, but the most resilient force we’ve ever known. A
      humane society does not turn away from suffering because it is inconvenient or
      distant. It listens. It mourns what must be mourned, and protects what must be
      protected—not because it is profitable, but because it is just. It sees the beautiful
      child behind every death statistic, the family behind every bombing, the human
      soul behind every border. Such a society would view each person not as a citizen
      of Empire, but as a member of a global human family. It would understand that
      strength is in restraint, and power is in healing, not in harm. It would tell
      the truth about history, so that it may finally stop repeating itself. This society
      would not mistake war for justice, or conquest for civilization. It would not
      starve the children of one nation to comfort the adults of another. It would not
      weaponize language and call it diplomacy. It would know that to build peace, we
      must dismantle the walls within ourselves. It is a world where cooperation displaces
      coercion, where compassion exceeds conquest, where education enlightens and liberates
      rather than indoctrinates. A world that teaches history truthfully, that fosters
      critical thought, that upholds humanity above ideology. Such a world is not a
      fantasy or utopia—it is the only way out of the moral abyss we find ourselves
      in. For us to survive and thrive on this planet demands empathy, cooperation,
      and a commitment to human dignity. It requires a society that teaches its children
      to question rather than obey, to listen rather than dominate, to care for others
      not because it is rewarded, but because it is the right thing to do. The Fall
      of The Empire of Lies is the New Dawn of Humanity When the Empire of Lies falls—and
      it will—it will not be the end of America, or any people. It will be the end of
      a lie that cloaked its violence in virtue. That fall will shake the world. But
      it will also clear the ground for something honest and beautiful to grow. For
      the first time in centuries, humanity may have the chance to build not on the
      ruins of delusion, but on the solid foundation of truth. And if we choose love
      over fear, understanding over ignorance, compassion over compliance, and peace
      and cooperation over conquest—then something truly astonishing becomes possible:
      Not just the end of the Empire of Lies, but the new Dawn of Humanity. The Frontier

    text: Mind you, I am not complaining… I had a busy day flapping my gums. The primary
      focus remains on the aftermath of the Iran / Israel war. But there is action on
      a new front — Azerbaijan — that I believe represents another Western-supported
      effort to create trouble for Russia by exploiting ethnic tensions between Russia
      and the Azeris. On Monday, Azerbaijan detained Russian journalists and raided
      the offices of Russia’s state-funded news outlet Sputnik in Baku. The immediate
      trigger was the deaths of two ethnic Azerbaijanis during a Russian police operation
      in Yekaterinburg last week against an organized crime group in the Russian city
      of Yekaterinburg, composed of Russian nationals of Azerbaijani origin. Azerbaijani
      authorities denounced the “brutal killings” and accused Russian law enforcement
      of acting with ethnic bias. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that
      Sputnik had continued operating in the country through “unauthorized funding”
      even after its accreditation was revoked in February 2025. During the raid, police
      detained several individuals, including Sputnik’s local editor-in-chief and director,
      and Azerbaijani media reported that some of those detained were suspected of being
      connected to Russian intelligence. The Azerbaijani government also canceled Russian
      cultural events and withdrew from scheduled bilateral meetings with Russia in
      protest of the treatment of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Russia. Russia, in response,
      summoned Azerbaijan’s ambassador and condemned the detentions as “unfriendly actions”
      and “illegal detention of Russian journalists.” But there may be more to this
      story — Azerbaijan is used by both the Mossad and the CIA for clandestine operations
      against Iran. Israel used Azerbaijan air space to launch missiles and drones into
      Iran during the latest conflict. So, is this flare-up between Russia and Azerbaijan
      just about the Yekaterinburg incident, or is Azerbaijan now making a turn to the
      West in order to put pressure on Russia? I think it is the latter. I don’t believe
      in coincidence. Keep your eye on Azerbaijan. Monday morning started with my regularly
      scheduled chats with Nima and with Judge Napolitano. As soon as I signed off with
      the Judge, I jumped on Deep Dive with Danny Davis , who just returned from a week

    text: 'I managed to snag my globe-trot ter friend, Pepe Escobar, for a video chat
      on Friday. Pepe had just returned to Paris from the St. Petersburg International
      Economic Forum (SPIEF). SPIEF is an amazing experience. I was fortunate to attend
      last year. It is an annual event, held in June during the White Nights of St.
      Petersburg. Representatives from more than 130 countries attended. As a result
      of Russia’s Special Military Operation (SMO) and the ensuing flood of Western
      economic sanctions, Russia and China have accelerated their economic cooperation
      and integration. Although India, Brazil and South Africa were founding members
      of BRICS, Russia and China remain the major players in driving efforts to create
      an alternative to the US-led financial system. Countries like Indonesia, Malaysia
      and Vietnam are expected to play a more critical role as BRICS expands in the
      Global South. Iran is a full member of BRICS, and I believe that is one of the
      underlying reasons for the US-supported attack on Iran on June 13. Iran’s enrichment
      of uranium is just a sideshow. The real objective is to remove the existing government
      and replace it with one committed to upholding the primacy of the US dollar, especially
      in oil transactions. One development to keep your eye on is the Cross-Border Interbank
      Payment System ( CIPS ). CIPS is a payment infrastructure launched by the People’s
      Bank of China in 2015 to facilitate and streamline cross-border transactions denominated
      in Chinese yuan ( RMB ). Unlike SWIFT , which primarily acts as a messaging network,
      CIPS provides both clearing and settlement services, making RMB transactions faster,
      more cost-effective, and more secure. CIPS operates as a wholesale payment system,
      enabling direct onshore settlement of international RMB payments within China’s
      domestic financial system. Financial institutions can join CIPS as either direct
      or indirect participants: Direct participants are typically large banks that hold
      accounts directly with the PBOC and can settle payments for themselves and others,
      while indirect participants access CIPS services through a corresponding direct
      participant. As of early 2025, CIPS had 170 direct participants and nearly 1,500
      indirect participants, connecting banks in over 119 countries and regions. The
      system plays a key role in internationalizing the RMB , supporting cross-border
      trade and investment, and reducing reliance on the US dollar. It also supports
      China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the development of Shanghai as an international
      financial center. CIPS processes millions of transactions annually, with trillions
      of yuan settled through its network. Key Improvements of CIPS : Direct Clearing
      and Settlement : • CIPS processes and settles RMB transactions onshore in real
      time or near real time, reducing reliance on intermediary banks and eliminating
      delays associated with correspondent banking models. • SWIFT does not provide
      settlement services; it only transmits payment messages, which then require additional
      clearing and settlement steps through other systems. Speed and Efficiency : •
      CIPS achieves average settlement times of around 300 milliseconds for direct participants,
      making transactions much faster than traditional SWIFT-based RMB transfers. •
      SWIFT -based transactions can take up to 48 hours when routed through offshore
      RMB clearing hubs. Cost Reduction : • CIPS transaction fees average 0.01%—a fraction
      of SWIFT’s costs—making RMB trade settlements significantly cheaper, especially
      for Belt and Road Initiative countries. • CIPS reduces the need for multiple correspondent
      banks and associated foreign exchange costs. Operational Features : • CIPS operates
      24/7, supporting global business needs, and is integrated with advanced features
      like Delivery Versus Payment ( DVP ) for securities and Payment Versus Payment
      ( PVP ) for forex. • CIPS also offers ISO 20022 messaging and is piloting integration
      with the digital yuan (e-CNY), enabling faster and more secure cross-border transfers.
      • Promotion of RMB Internationalization: • By making cross-border RMB payments
      more efficient and accessible, CIPS supports the broader international use of
      the Chinese yuan, reducing reliance on the US dollar. I am not suggesting that
      SWIFT is going to disappear anytime soon, but it is an archaic technology. The
      events of the last three years have persuaded both Russia and China that they
      can no longer risk being held hostage to a US-controlled financial system. I think
      CIPS will play a growing role in weaning nations of the Global South from being
      controlled by the US dollar. As with all wars, it is largely about money and who
      controls it. Pepe provides an excellent summary of SPIEF and the current status

    paragraph_summary: In a recent video chat, Pepe Escobar shared insights from the
      St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), an annual event that attracts
      representatives from over 130 countries. He noted that due to Russia's Special

      Russia and China has intensified, positioning them as key players in the BRICS
      coalition, which also includes India, Brazil, and South Africa. The expansion
      of BRICS is expected to involve countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam,
      while Iran's membership is seen as a factor in the US's recent military actions
      against it, aimed at maintaining the dominance of the US dollar in oil transactions.
      Escobar highlighted the significance of China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment
      System (CIPS), which enhances the efficiency and security of transactions in Chinese

  - title: How Islam is Governing Iran’s Response to Israel and the United States
    url: https://sonar21.com/how-islam-is-governing-irans-response-to-israel-and-the-united-states/
    text: 'I have received a couple of very insightful messages from two readers — one
      is a convert to Islam and the other is a scholar, currently living in Asia. Both
      wrote to challenge my view that Iran rejected a mutual defense pact with Russia
      because moderates in Iran still hoped to curry favor with the US. After reading
      their thoughtful, detailed explanations, I think they present a perspective worth
      considering. Since the establishment of Iran’s Islamic Republic in 1979, Iran
      has not invaded another country. However, Iran was invaded by Iraq with the full
      encouragement and support of the United States. What most Americans do not know
      is that Israel was helping Iran fight Iraq. Israel began supplying weapons to
      Iran in early 1980, shortly after the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War. The first
      documented sale was of tires for the F-4 Phantom fighter jet, which occurred after
      Iran, unable to secure military equipment from the United States, reached out
      to Israel through back channels. Substantial and large-scale arms sales began
      in 1981, including the transfer of significant military equipment such as antitank
      guns, artillery shells, spare parts for tanks and aircraft, and TOW missiles as
      part of what was known as Operation Seashell . These sales continued throughout
      the early 1980s, with Israel becoming a major supplier of arms to Iran during
      the conflict. That came to an inglorious end with the Iran – Contra debacle. Iran
      suffered significantly as a result of the US-backed Iran-Iraq war. Most credible
      academic and historical sources estimate that between 500,000 and 750,000 Iranians
      died, but official Iranian figures are considerably lower, generally in the range
      of 155,000 to 183,000 for direct military deaths, with some studies counting up
      to 183,000–184,000 documented fatalities. And Americans wonder why Iranians would
      chant, Death to America . So, let me present the enlightening essay by my new
      friend — he is a native American who converted to Islam. I have not asked his
      permission to publish this, which is why I am not naming him. However, what he
      wrote is very compelling and I want to share it with you. BEGIN ESSAY FROM A NATIVE
      AMERICAN CONVERT TO ISLAM: Iran’s military response to Israel was governed by
      the following theological constraints: 1) the Iranian Military was NOT allowed
      Islamically to do preemptive strikes, 2)  they were NOT allowed Islamically to
      continue fighting whenever the enemy wishes to stop fighting, and 3) they are
      ONLY allowed to fight defense battles… wars of aggression are Islamically forbidden.
      I will also add that 4) harming innocent men, women, and children, during times
      of war is FORBIDDEN and caution must be strictly adhered to!  Although, I mentioned
      these truths, I was negligent in presenting the corresponding evidences to my
      statements, and God-willing this brief email will rectify that. Now then, I would
      like to begin this email by mentioning a verse from the Holy Qur’an in which it
      says: “Verily those who believe, and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabians,
      whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and is a doer of good, then for them
      their reward is with their Lord, and no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they
      grieve.” [Qur’an 2:62] The reason I quoted this verse is because it refutes the
      false notion, put forth by Benjamin Netanyahu, and others, that Iranians, and/or
      any other Muslims, for that matter, are antisemites. This is obviously an absurd
      notion. The issue between Iran and Israel has little to do with Islam versus Judaism,
      but more to do with oppression, and opposing it. It is mentioned in the Holy Bible:
      “Learn to do good: seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless,
      plead the widow’s cause.” [Isaiah 1:17] And Jesus (peace be upon him) said: “…He
      has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight of the
      blind, to set liberty those who are oppressed.” [Luke 4:18] Based upon what I
      just quoted above, in addition to common sense, it is incumbent upon not only
      the Muslims, but also the Christians, to oppose oppression, no matter who the
      oppressor is, and to help the oppressed, no matter who the oppressed are. Furthermore,
      I don’t think I need to emphasize the fact that, the Iranian and Yemeni “Shi’ites”
      are the only Muslim nations helping their “Sunni” brothers and sisters, i.e. the
      Palestinians. The question could be asked: Where are the other “Sunni” Nations?
      Also, the above verse of the Holy Qur’an exemplifies the “real” view that Islam
      has on other divine religions. I don’t think I need to explain the verse, nor
      is there any issues with its context, its very clear how Islam views Christianity
      and Judaism, and it is NOT with hostility. In any case, before I continue, God-willing,
      I would like to quickly mention that I am NOT Iranian…I am American…in fact, I
      am Native American. My maternal grandfather was full blooded Cherokee, and my
      maternal grandmother was a Cherokee /Caucasian mix, from the North Carolina/Tennessee
      area. On my paternal side, my grandparents were African American with a heavy
      dose of Cherokee as well from the Alabama Area. Although my mother was born in
      North Carolina, I was born and raised in Upstate New York, in a suburban town
      called Spring Valley, in Rockland County, about 25 minutes outside of New York
      City. With that being said, due to my facial features, and my name change in 2005,
      not to mention the fact that I am easily identifiable as Muslim due my wardrobe
      choices, many consider me a foreigner. I embraced Islam in 1999 and was initially
      a part of the radical Salafi Sect of Islam, until I converted to Shia Islam in
      2005. As of yet, I have not had the privilege, or honor, to study abroad in Qum,
      Iran, or Najaf, Iraq, but by the grace of God, I spent time in a seminary here
      in the states, and I was also honored with being personally tutored by several
      renown mid level scholars, some of which were, and still are, teachers in Qum,
      and Najaf. First, I would like to expound a bit on the concept of Wilayatul-Faqih,
      and the role of the Supreme Leader. No matter what the “educated dummies” may
      say, the role of Ayatollah Khamenei is simple…his job is to ensure that whatever
      the government of Iran does, whether domestic, or foreign…in peace time, or war…does
      not contradict, or undermine, in any way shape or form, the Islamic morals and
      codes of ethics. This is why the Iranian military has been considered weak, and
      this why certain bills, etc. take so long to pass, because they have to abide
      by the Islamic code of ethics. Obviously, a large majority of Iranians are not
      very religious, to say the least, and would prefer a more western standard. In
      simple terms, the Iranian Army has to “play fair”, whereas its opponents are known
      for cheating! Everything that the Iranians do, or don’t do, has a definite precedent
      in Islamic history, unbeknownst to the western world. I mentioned to you, that
      the Iranians are not allowed to continue fighting when their opponents have stopped,
      even if they are on the verge of victory. It is written in the Holy Qur’an: “Fight
      in the way of Allah those who fight you, but do not exceed the limits; Surely
      Allah does not like those who exceed the limits” [Qur’an 2:190] This verse also
      makes it clear that retaliations must be proportional, and blowing up a city block
      in order to kill one person is most certainly unacceptable and forbidden! Not
      to mention, it implicitly condemns preemptive strikes. And there is a clear and
      simple precedent for this. A person cannot be punished for something he/she hasn’t
      done yet! “Fight them until there is no more oppression…but if they cease, then
      let there be no hostilities except on the oppressors.” [Qur’an 2:193] This particular
      verse makes it clear that, when the enemy stops fighting, you must also stop fighting.
      Furthermore, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) explicitly commanded his followers
      to NEVER harm innocent men, women, and children, during warfare. This is why the
      Iranian military is diligent in their trying to limit casualties, focusing on
      military, and infrastructure targets. The Iranians, although hated by the west,
      are displaying honor on the battle field. The saying that, “all is fair in love
      and war”, is an incorrect statement with the Iranians (Muslims). There are rules
      of engagement, not just militarily, but also ethically and morally. The Holy Prophet
      Muhammad (S) said: “The strong man isn’t the one who could conquer the people,
      the strong man is he who can conquer himself!” Mr. Johnson, this is the month
      of Muharram, which is a very important month in Islamic History for Shi’ite Muslims,
      and to make a  long story short, prophet Muhammad’s grandson, Imam Husayn (A)
      was denied water for three days in the blazing desert! A Muslim could NEVER deny
      anyone water, or stop their water flow, no matter if they are staunch enemies…this
      would be horrendous. The reason that I am telling you this, is because this is
      a reality that is hidden from mainstream media… they are viewing honorable traits
      as weakness, and higher morals and ethics as stupidity. A country being considered
      “weak” because it is trying to balance modern warfare with a higher level of morals
      and ethics. A country being considered an enemy because it opposes oppression.
      And although I keep referring to the Iranians, these are” Islamic” Morals and
      ethics that ALL Muslims should be upholding. Furthermore, even when It comes to
      Russia, China, and their relationship with Iran, there is also precedent in the
      Islamic morals and ethics. It has been said by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S):
      “Your friends are three (3), and your enemies are three (3): Your friend is your
      friend, your friend’s friend is your friend, and your enemy’s enemy is your friend.
      Likewise, your enemy is your enemy, your enemy’s friend is your enemy, and your
      friend’s enemy is your enemy.” It is very advantageous for you, for me, and for
      everyone, that you add to your arsenal of information, a bit more understanding
      of the Islamic thought process, especially here in America where Islamophobia
      is increasing rapidly, and running rampant. On another note, Bibi Netanyahu once
      mentioned that he would like to follow the “Libyan Model” when dealing with Iran.
      Perhaps, you are familiar with him saying this. I would like to ask you this:
      Is it safe to say, or am I completely delusional, that the quote unquote “model”
      that the Israelis have adopted in the systematic oppression of the Palestinians
      is based upon the “Native American Model” that was used to deal with my ancestors,
      i.e. the Native Americans? From my perspective the operations are identical! The
      Israelis received a modest parcel of land in Palestine, and ultimately took over
      the entire state and relocated the Palestinians to a small enclosed area, i.e.
      Gaza. Similarly, the colonials acquired a modest parcel of land from the Native
      Americans, and ultimately took over the entire state, and relocated the Indians
      to a small enclosed area, i.e. Reservations. Whereas the Palestinians were oppressed
      and fought back, and continue this fight today, the Indians were made complacent
      through alcohol and gambling. If what I mention is actually true, and their is
      definite connection, then it would be more understandable as to why many Americans
      turn a blind eye to the plight of the Palestinians…because if they condemn it,
      then they will have to condemn what they did to the Native Americans here. In
      any case, I hope that at least one thing that I mentioned gave you a personal
      better understanding of the Iranian (Islamic) thought process, which will resonate
      with your audience. Some of what I have mentioned has been noticed, but not explained
      as I have explained it, and some of what I have mentioned will become clear later
      on. As far as the Iranian people are concerned, they are generally very patriotic,
      but the people that have the taste for Islam, and the Islamic Republic in general,
      is slowly dissipating, I am ashamed to say. I hope that, when you put all of the
      espionage aside, all of the military aspects aside, all of the nuclear issues
      aside, all of the realigning of alliances aside, that you can see a nation that
      wasn’t bent on world domination…a nation that wasn’t trying to control the precious
      materials of other countries, and rape, pillage, and plunder them…just a nation,
      maybe the last nation, that simply believed in something and tried diligently
      to keep it alive…i.e. being conscious of God. Just for the record, all of the
      terrorists groups were/are “Sunni”, and many were supported, and trained by the
      United States. Hizbullah, Hamas, and Ansarullah, were only trying to defend the
      Palestinians. Imagine an old lady getting mugged, and when a stranger comes to
      her rescue he is considered the “bad guy” and called a terrorist! what a world
      we live in! Thank you again Mr. Johnson for allowing me this honor. May God continue
      to enlighten you and continue to use you as a vessel to enlighten others! I appreciate
      all that you do…take care. I thank you for your invaluable support by taking time

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses insights from two readers—a convert to
      Islam and a scholar living in Asia—who challenge the author's view that Iran rejected
      a mutual defense pact with Russia due to hopes of improving relations with the
      US. They argue that since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Iran
      has not invaded another country, while it was itself invaded by Iraq with US support.
      The article highlights that Israel, contrary to common perceptions, aided Iran
      during the Iran-Iraq War by supplying weapons after the US cut off military support.
      This assistance, which included significant arms sales, continued until the Iran-Contra
      affair. The author notes the heavy toll of the war on Iran, with estimates of
      Iranian casualties ranging from 500,000 to 750,000, which helps explain the animosity
      some Iranians feel towards the US. The piece concludes by introducing an enlightening
      essay from the convert, emphasizing the complexity of Iran's historical context.
