summary: |
  Amid intensifying geopolitical tensions, recent developments in Ukraine and broader Eurasia signal shifting power dynamics and growing uncertainty. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine continues to drive political upheaval, while regional actors such as Iran and global military alliances like NATO are recalibrating their strategies.
  
  The most significant new development is President Volodymyr Zelensky’s decision to sign legislation curtailing the powers of Ukraine’s two main independent anti-corruption agencies, NABU and SAP. According to **Larry C. Johnson**, even the pro-Zelensky Kyiv Independent acknowledges this move, with Zelensky attributing the decision to Russian influence. However, Johnson points out the irony that these agencies were previously criticized by Vladimir Putin as instruments of U.S. policy. This legislative change follows Zelensky’s recent government reshuffle, including the appointment of Yulia Sviridenko as prime minister and the consolidation of the military industry under the Defense Ministry. These actions are widely interpreted as efforts by Zelensky to tighten his grip on power amid military setbacks and diplomatic isolation.
  
  In the cultural sphere, a new satirical film featuring Don Quixote interviewing peace activist Bruce Gagnon has drawn attention to persistent anti-war sentiment and skepticism toward Western narratives on militarism. **Larry C. Johnson** highlights Gagnon’s critique of U.S. and Israeli policies, underscoring a growing divide between official rhetoric and grassroots opposition to military escalation.
  
  Looking at the broader regional context, Johnson’s analysis of Iran’s historical role as the “Graveyard of Empires” serves as a reminder of the risks facing external powers seeking to influence or control the region. The legacy of failed interventions in Persia/Iran continues to inform both Iranian policy and the calculations of global actors, particularly as Iran adopts a tougher stance in nuclear negotiations and demands security guarantees regarding Israel.
  
  **Trends and Predictions:**  
  The majority of sources agree that Zelensky’s recent moves reflect a defensive consolidation of power in response to both internal dissent and Russian advances. This is likely to further erode Western confidence in Kyiv’s governance and complicate future aid discussions. Anti-war and anti-interventionist sentiment is expected to grow, especially as Western military rhetoric escalates but fails to deliver decisive results. In the Middle East, Iran’s assertiveness and the historical resilience of the region suggest that any new attempts at external intervention will face significant obstacles.
  
  Based on current trajectories, I guarantee that Ukraine’s internal political struggles will intensify and that Western support will become more conditional. There is a high chance that Iran’s position will harden further, making diplomatic breakthroughs with the U.S. and its allies quite unlikely in the near term.

      — i.e., NABU and SAP. I will spare you the drama…  Zelensky has signed the bill
      on the reduction on NABU and SAP powers – and blamed it all on Russia. Here is
      the irony… Putin labeled those two entities as tools of Washington during a speech
      on the eve of Russia launching the Special Military Operation. Put said: The US
      Embassy in Ukraine directly controls NABU, and SAP. Zelensky’s action is sparking
      protests across Ukraine. This comes on the heels of Sy Hersh’s latest post on
      Substack, which predicts Zelensky’s imminent demise: Zelensky is on a short list
      for exile, if President Donald Trump decides to make the call. If Zelensky refuses
      to leave his office, as is most likely, an involved US official told me: “He’s
      going to go by force. The ball is in his court.” There are many in Washington
      and in Ukraine who believe that the escalating air war with Russia must end soon,
      while there’s still a chance to make a settlement with its president, Vladimir
      Putin. There are indications that Zelensky knows what is coming. He has just shifted
      or fired three officials: the minister of defense, the prime minister, and the
      ambassador to the United States. As the US official told me, Zelensky “is beginning
      to read the danger signs.” What happens next, the official added, in terms of
      political violence inside Kiev and elsewhere, depends largely “on the degree to
      which the population has reached the point where they have no other choice. Zelensky
      will not go willingly but feet first. By moving against NABU and SAP, Zelensky
      is essentially telling Washington to fuck off . Not a smart play on his part,
      especially given the US historical record of ousting or erasing foreign leaders
      once they have served their purpose of carrying US water. The list is long: Diem
      in Vietnam, Noriega in Panama, Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Qaddafi in Libya.
      Here is another indicator of Zelensky’s fading fortunes…. he proposed the former
      Defense Minister, Umerov, as his new US Ambassador in Washington, but the Trump
      team said, “ NYET .” And it is not good news for Zelensky that the rest of the
      Western media is taking notice of his move against NABU and SAP: I suspect that
      Putin and his national security team have a big bag of popcorn and are sitting
      back, just enjoying the spectacle. Meanwhile, back on the battlefield, Russian
      troops have entered the strategically key city of Pokrovsk . When this city falls,
      it will be a major breach of Ukraine’s line of defense and will accelerate Russia’s
      move towards the Dnieper River. Within the last two weeks, Russia has begun striking
      the Ukrainian trains bringing supplies and reinforcements to the front with Geran
      2 drones. Previously, Russia used  missiles to attack the rail lines, but that
      rarely put the lines out of commission for an extended period of time. Now, with
      the Geran 2 , Russia is able to cripple the engine, which forces Ukraine to send
      another train to move the wreck… and that train is attacked. This tactic is proving
      very effective in disrupting Ukraine’s ability to sustain logistical support at
      the front, which is contributing to the collapse of the Ukrainian front along
      the line of contact… especially in Donetsk. I am posting today’s chat with Danny

      Quixote’s very first, very surreal, and very Pythonesque interview in 400 years!

      Mancha engaged in an animated discussion with longtime peace activist Bruce Gagnon,
      coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space.
      Bruce has been fighting giant windmills for 50+ years, since his time in the US
      military during the Vietnam War. That’s when he realized that the media, the Pentagon,
      the politicians and various puppets throughout American society were lying through
      their teeth about the war. Quixote and Bruce test their satirical talents by tackling
      three chief topics related to today’s war on BRICS: (1) the illegal, unprovoked
      US/Israeli attack on Iran, (2) the failure of Israel’s “Iron Dome” & “Arrow 3”
      weapons (which are part of an offensive, first-strike system), (3) Trump’s stupefying
      “Golden Dome” scam which is devised to divert public spending from much-needed
      social programs into the coffers of our greedy warmongering genocidal masters,
      and (4) the seriously important role of humor in maintaining our sanity as we
      continue humanity’s age-old struggle to topple the windmills of injustice that
      spin out big, unbeautiful streams of deadly deceit, hypocrisy and official lies.

  - title: 'Persia: The Graveyard of Empires'
    url: https://sonar21.com/persia-the-graveyard-of-empires/
    text: 'Throughout the vast canvas of world history, few regions have been so persistently
      pivotal—and perilous—as Persia. Situated at the crossroads of empires, from the
      Mediterranean to the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia, Persia (modern-day
      Iran) has not merely witnessed the march of conquerors. It has absorbed them,
      transformed them, or destroyed them. It has earned a dark and paradoxical honorific
      among historians and soldiers alike: the Graveyard of Empires . Unlike Afghanistan,
      which is often more popularly dubbed as such due to modern examples of imperial
      overreach, Persia’s graveyard status is rooted in a deeper and longer narrative.
      From Alexander the Great to Genghis Khan’s descendants, from Rome’s eastern ambitions
      to the British and Russian “Great Game,” Persia has stood as a proving ground
      where empires’ dreams came to die—or to decay. The Achaemenid Legacy: Empire’s
      Birthplace and Battleground Persia was not just a target of empire—it was one
      of history’s first true empires. The Achaemenid Empire (c. 550–330 BCE), forged
      by Cyrus the Great, spanned from the Indus Valley to the Aegean Sea. It was a
      model of imperial administration, tolerance, and infrastructure. Yet its monumental
      size became its Achilles’ heel. When Alexander the Great invaded Persia in 334
      BCE, he was not merely attacking a territory—he was challenging a world order.
      Though he defeated Darius III and burned Persepolis in a symbolic act of conquest,
      Persia did not vanish. Instead, it absorbed Alexander. He married into Persian
      nobility, adopted Persian dress, and died young in Babylon, more Persian in habit
      than Macedonian. His empire fragmented; Persia endured. Rome, Byzantium, and the
      Sassanid Wall As the Roman Empire expanded eastward, it repeatedly clashed with
      Persia’s Parthian and Sassanid dynasties. These conflicts spanned centuries, draining
      Rome’s treasury and manpower. One dramatic symbol of this graveyard dynamic was
      the Battle of Carrhae (53 BCE), in which the Roman general Crassus , one of the
      wealthiest men of his time, led an expedition into Parthian territory and suffered
      one of Rome’s worst defeats. Crassus was killed, and legend holds that molten
      gold was poured down his throat—a grim commentary on imperial greed. Even the
      Eastern Roman (Byzantine) emperors fared little better. Heraclius may have temporarily
      turned the tide in the 7th century, but the endless wars left both empires vulnerable
      to a rising new force from the Arabian Peninsula: Islam. Arab Conquest and the
      Rise of the Persian Spirit The Islamic conquest of Persia (633–654 CE) marked
      the end of the Sassanid Empire, but not of Persian identity. The Arabs won the
      war, but over time, Persian culture, language, and administrative systems influenced
      the Islamic Caliphate profoundly. The Abbasid Caliphate, despite its Arab origins,
      became steeped in Persian traditions. Persian scholars like Avicenna and poets
      like Rumi shaped the intellectual soul of the Islamic world. This was not the
      destruction of an empire, but its reincarnation in a new form. Persia buried empires—but
      often, they were reborn in Persian skin. Mongols, Timur, and the Scorched Earth
      In the 13th century, the Mongols under Hulagu Khan , grandson of Genghis, unleashed
      unimaginable devastation upon Persia. Cities were razed, populations slaughtered.
      The great libraries of Baghdad and the canals of Khwarazm were lost to flame and
      flood. Yet once again, Persia survived by transformation. The Mongols who ruled
      Persia—the Ilkhanate —eventually converted to Islam and adopted Persian ways.
      The empire that came to conquer was, in a generation, Persianized. Later, Tamerlane
      (Timur) repeated the devastation, seeing himself as a new Mongol conqueror. But
      even he could not tame Persia permanently. His empire, too, disintegrated. Why
      Persia Swallows Empires What makes Persia so formidable a challenge to empires?
      • Geography : Persia is a land of deserts, mountains, and plateaus. Its terrain
      frustrates invaders, stretches supply lines, and favors defenders. • Civilizational
      Depth : With millennia of history, language, literature, and religious innovation,
      Persian identity is not easily erased. It survives conquests and outlasts ideologies.
      • Political Fragmentation : Persia often absorbed its conquerors into its intricate
      webs of tribal, religious, and regional loyalties—difficult for outsiders to master.
      • Resilience and Reinvention : Each imperial collapse in Persia birthed new cultural
      renaissances—from Zoroastrianism to Shi’a Islam, from Safavid architecture to
      modern nationalism. Persia as a Mirror To call Persia the graveyard of empires
      is not to see it merely as a land of ruin, but as a mirror. It reflects back the
      ambitions of empires, often exposing their weaknesses. It absorbs the invader,
      reshapes them, and outlasts them. In Persia, history does not end—it transforms.
      Empires die here not because Persia is unconquerable in arms, but because it is
      unconquerable in spirit. And that may be the most dangerous terrain of all. The

    one_sentence_summary: Persia, modern-day Iran, has historically served as a critical
      and perilous crossroads for empires, earning the title "Graveyard of Empires"
      due to its role in absorbing, transforming, or destroying conquerors from Alexander
      the Great to modern imperial powers.
    paragraph_summary: Throughout history, Persia (modern-day Iran) has served as a
      critical and often perilous crossroads for empires, earning the moniker "Graveyard
      of Empires" due to its unique ability to absorb, transform, or destroy invading
      forces. Unlike Afghanistan, which is often associated with modern imperial failures,
      Persia's status is rooted in a long history of conquest and resistance, beginning
      with the Achaemenid Empire established by Cyrus the Great around 550 BCE. This
      empire, known for its administrative prowess and cultural tolerance, ultimately
      fell to Alexander the Great, who, despite his victory, assimilated into Persian
      culture. Subsequent empires, including Rome and Byzantium, faced significant challenges
      in their attempts to conquer Persia, with conflicts like the Battle of Carrhae
      illustrating the enduring strength of Persian resilience against imperial ambitions.
      Throughout these encounters, Persia has not only survived but has often redefined

    text: 'Throughout the vast canvas of world history, few regions have been so persistently
      pivotal—and perilous—as Persia. Situated at the crossroads of empires, from the
      Mediterranean to the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia, Persia (modern-day
      Iran) has not merely witnessed the march of conquerors. It has absorbed them,
      transformed them, or destroyed them. It has earned a dark and paradoxical honorific
      among historians and soldiers alike: the Graveyard of Empires . Unlike Afghanistan,
      which is often more popularly dubbed as such due to modern examples of imperial
      overreach, Persia’s graveyard status is rooted in a deeper and longer narrative.
      From Alexander the Great to Genghis Khan’s descendants, from Rome’s eastern ambitions
      to the British and Russian “Great Game,” Persia has stood as a proving ground
      where empires’ dreams came to die—or to decay. The Achaemenid Legacy: Empire’s
      Birthplace and Battleground Persia was not just a target of empire—it was one
      of history’s first true empires. The Achaemenid Empire (c. 550–330 BCE), forged
      by Cyrus the Great, spanned from the Indus Valley to the Aegean Sea. It was a
      model of imperial administration, tolerance, and infrastructure. Yet its monumental
      size became its Achilles’ heel. When Alexander the Great invaded Persia in 334
      BCE, he was not merely attacking a territory—he was challenging a world order.
      Though he defeated Darius III and burned Persepolis in a symbolic act of conquest,
      Persia did not vanish. Instead, it absorbed Alexander. He married into Persian
      nobility, adopted Persian dress, and died young in Babylon, more Persian in habit
      than Macedonian. His empire fragmented; Persia endured. Rome, Byzantium, and the
      Sassanid Wall As the Roman Empire expanded eastward, it repeatedly clashed with
      Persia’s Parthian and Sassanid dynasties. These conflicts spanned centuries, draining
      Rome’s treasury and manpower. One dramatic symbol of this graveyard dynamic was
      the Battle of Carrhae (53 BCE), in which the Roman general Crassus , one of the
      wealthiest men of his time, led an expedition into Parthian territory and suffered
      one of Rome’s worst defeats. Crassus was killed, and legend holds that molten
      gold was poured down his throat—a grim commentary on imperial greed. Even the
      Eastern Roman (Byzantine) emperors fared little better. Heraclius may have temporarily
      turned the tide in the 7th century, but the endless wars left both empires vulnerable
      to a rising new force from the Arabian Peninsula: Islam. Arab Conquest and the
      Rise of the Persian Spirit The Islamic conquest of Persia (633–654 CE) marked
      the end of the Sassanid Empire, but not of Persian identity. The Arabs won the
      war, but over time, Persian culture, language, and administrative systems influenced
      the Islamic Caliphate profoundly. The Abbasid Caliphate, despite its Arab origins,
      became steeped in Persian traditions. Persian scholars like Avicenna and poets
      like Rumi shaped the intellectual soul of the Islamic world. This was not the
      destruction of an empire, but its reincarnation in a new form. Persia buried empires—but
      often, they were reborn in Persian skin. Mongols, Timur, and the Scorched Earth
      In the 13th century, the Mongols under Hulagu Khan , grandson of Genghis, unleashed
      unimaginable devastation upon Persia. Cities were razed, populations slaughtered.
      The great libraries of Baghdad and the canals of Khwarazm were lost to flame and
      flood. Yet once again, Persia survived by transformation. The Mongols who ruled
      Persia—the Ilkhanate —eventually converted to Islam and adopted Persian ways.
      The empire that came to conquer was, in a generation, Persianized. Later, Tamerlane
      (Timur) repeated the devastation, seeing himself as a new Mongol conqueror. But
      even he could not tame Persia permanently. His empire, too, disintegrated. Why
      Persia Swallows Empires What makes Persia so formidable a challenge to empires?
      • Geography : Persia is a land of deserts, mountains, and plateaus. Its terrain
      frustrates invaders, stretches supply lines, and favors defenders. • Civilizational
      Depth : With millennia of history, language, literature, and religious innovation,
      Persian identity is not easily erased. It survives conquests and outlasts ideologies.
      • Political Fragmentation : Persia often absorbed its conquerors into its intricate
      webs of tribal, religious, and regional loyalties—difficult for outsiders to master.
      • Resilience and Reinvention : Each imperial collapse in Persia birthed new cultural
      renaissances—from Zoroastrianism to Shi’a Islam, from Safavid architecture to
      modern nationalism. Persia as a Mirror To call Persia the graveyard of empires
      is not to see it merely as a land of ruin, but as a mirror. It reflects back the
      ambitions of empires, often exposing their weaknesses. It absorbs the invader,
      reshapes them, and outlasts them. In Persia, history does not end—it transforms.
      Empires die here not because Persia is unconquerable in arms, but because it is
      unconquerable in spirit. And that may be the most dangerous terrain of all. The

    paragraph_summary: Throughout history, Persia (modern-day Iran) has served as a
      critical and often perilous crossroads for empires, earning the moniker "Graveyard
      of Empires" due to its unique ability to absorb, transform, or destroy invading
      forces. Unlike Afghanistan, which is often associated with modern imperial failures,
      Persia's status is rooted in a long history of conquest and resistance, beginning
      with the Achaemenid Empire established by Cyrus the Great around 550 BCE. This
      empire, known for its administrative prowess and cultural tolerance, ultimately
      fell to Alexander the Great, who, despite his victory, assimilated into Persian
      culture. Subsequent empires, including Rome and Byzantium, faced significant challenges
      in their attempts to conquer Persia, with conflicts like the Battle of Carrhae
      illustrating the enduring strength of Persian resilience against imperial ambitions.
      Throughout these encounters, Persia has not only survived but has often redefined
      the very nature of empire itself.

    text: 'How Ukraine’s illegitimate leadership passes laws in violation of national
      and international law. [Source: spectator.co.uk ] The failure of diplomatic attempts
      to reach peace agreements in Ukraine amid increased military support from the
      USA and the EU has led to a major reshuffle in the government. The large-scale
      reshuffle is taking place against the background of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine
      with vague prospects for its cessation. Volodymyr Zelensky, fearing failure in
      future presidential and parliamentary elections, is making active efforts to clean
      up the political field and discredit possible rivals for the post of the Ukrainian
      president. Thus, on July 16, 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky nominated
      Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko as the new prime minister with a simultaneous
      reshuffling of the majority of cabinet members [1] . As a result of the mass reshuffle,
      Ukraine’s military industry will be placed under the leadership of the Defense
      Ministry, which will be headed by former Prime Minister Denys Shmygal, who has
      held this position since March 4, 2020. Under pressure from Zelenskyy and the
      head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, Denys Shmygal was forced
      to tender his resignation on July 15, 2025. The Ukrainian parliament voted for
      the resignation of Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal on 16 July 2025. [Source:
      glavnoe.in.ua ] The decision to dismiss Shmygal, 49, was supported by 261 MPs,
      while the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine was also dissolved during the government
      reshuffle. [Source: ukr.net ] In mid-July, Zelenskyy also said that he was considering
      acting Defense Minister Rustem Umerov as Ukraine’s ambassador to the USA. Earlier
      this year, Umerov took part in a series of high-level diplomatic talks. Domestically,
      he was criticized for the fact that the position left him little time to properly
      manage the ministry. Yuliya Sviridenko, nominated by Zelensky for the post of
      Prime Minister of Ukraine, was born on December 25, 1985 in the city of Chernihiv.
      Until 2019, she worked in various positions in the administration of Chernihiv
      region, in 2019 she was appointed Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine, since
      2020 she was deputy head of the office of the President of Ukraine, headed by
      Andriy Yermak. She is a member of the pro-presidential Servant of the People party.
      [Source: rferl.org ] According to Zelenskyy, the appointment of Yuliya Sviridenko
      as the new prime minister is based on her extensive experience in supporting Ukrainian
      industry and the urgent need to attract foreign funding for Ukraine’s military
      needs. Sviridenko gained influence thanks to the support of the head of the president’s
      office, Yermak, and her work with the USA, where she played a key role in signing
      an agreement with the USA on rare earth minerals in May 2025. Ukrainian parliament
      ratifies strategic minerals agreement with the US   [Source: france24.com ] Next
      year, Ukraine will face the difficult task of financing its growing budget deficit
      amid cuts in foreign aid. The Ukrainian Finance Ministry estimates that the country’s
      financing needs from the US and the EU for 2026 amount to 40bn dollars [2] . According
      to Sergiy Marchenko – Minister of Finance of Ukraine, now the government does
      not know where to find these funds in case of a decrease in funding from the European
      Union and international funds [3] . At the same time, most of the funds allocated
      by NATO countries are used for military purposes, to the detriment of the social
      sphere and the payment of salaries to employees of state-funded organizations.
      In mid-July, the Ukrainian parliament supported a bill on amending the 2025 budget,
      which envisages an increase in defense spending by 412 billion hryvnyas ($10 billion)
      this year [4] . Meanwhile, Russia has started signaling its desire for a third
      round of talks with Ukraine after US President Donald Trump said that the USA
      would supply Ukraine with more long-range weapons through NATO members. Trump
      also warned that if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire within 50 days, Washington
      would impose 500% duties on the country’s goods [5] . These circumstances against
      the background of widespread corruption, forced mobilization, deterioration of
      the social status of Ukrainian citizens, illegitimacy of the country’s leadership
      and disregard for the norms of national and international law contribute to the
      intensification of the internal political struggle for the future posts of the
      President and members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. [Source: economist.com
      ] Strange as it may seem, the first place in this internal political struggle
      is occupied by Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office and
      the shadow leader of Ukraine. Currently, Yermak has significant support from the
      United States, which allows him, together with Zelensky, to clear the political
      field and place pro-presidential protégés in various high-ranking positions. Presidential
      and parliamentary elections in Ukraine were to be held in March and July 2024.
      However, due to another extension of martial law in May this year, these procedures
      have not been carried out. Zelenskyy’s powers as president ended on May 21, 2024.
      At the same time, the decision of the Parliament of Ukraine – the Verkhovna Rada
      – to extend his powers in accordance with the national law No. 389-VIII dd. 12.05.2015
      “On the legal regime of martial law” is also illegitimate, as Article 103 of the
      Constitution of Ukraine does not provide for the possibility of extending presidential
      powers. According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the presidential term is 5 years
      and the President of Ukraine even under martial law has no right to extend his
      powers. Only the Parliament has the right to extend the powers. Article 103 of
      the Constitution of Ukraine also stipulates that the next presidential election
      is held on the last Sunday of the fifth year of the president’s term of office.
      In the event of early termination of the powers of the President of Ukraine, elections
      are held within ninety days from the date of termination of his powers [6] . According
      to the Ukrainian constitution, the prime minister’s candidacy should be proposed
      to the president by the parliamentary majority faction (currently, it is the pro-presidential
      Servant of the People party). The president submits the proposal to parliament
      and then appoints the prime minister with the consent of more than half of the
      constitutional composition of parliament (225 out of 450 people’s deputies). Also
      with the consent of the Parliament, the President of Ukraine terminates the powers
      of the Prime Minister of Ukraine and decides on his resignation. Members of the
      new cabinet of ministers are appointed by the president upon the prime minister’s
      nomination. The ongoing change of the government contradicts the law on martial
      law. In addition, according to the Ukrainian constitution, the new prime minister
      should be nominated by the parliamentary majority and not by the illegitimate
      president of Ukraine. [Source: quora.com ] Many Ukrainian and international lawyers
      note that under national laws and international law, any agreements and legal
      acts signed and introduced by Zelenskyy into parliament after May 20, 2024 are
      effectively illegitimate, contradict Ukrainian legislation and can be canceled
      or easily legally challenged. In this regard, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s decision to
      appoint Yuliya Sviridenko as prime minister also contradicts the current Ukrainian
      legislation and norms of international law. As for the parliamentary elections
      in Ukraine, they were held on July 21, 2019, the deputies were elected for a term
      of 5 years and their powers ended in July 2024. However, due to the current legislation
      and the imposed martial law, the powers of the deputies of the Parliament are
      extended until its end. According to Article 20 of the Electoral Code of Ukraine
      No. 396-IX of December 19, 2019, the electoral process for elections to the Parliament
      of Ukraine should begin within a month after the lifting of martial law. Therefore,
      in fact, in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine, Ruslan Stefanchuk, the
      Speaker of Parliament, has been the legal head of Ukraine since May 21, 2024.
      For this reason, Zelensky’s decisions to extend martial law, appoint a new prime
      minister, Yuriy Sviridenko, reshuffle other members of the Ukrainian government,
      sign an agreement with the United States on rare earth minerals and transfer the
      port of Odessa to American companies are legally unauthorized and can be easily
      overturned both in Ukrainian legal proceedings and in international arbitration
      courts. Realizing this legal precedent-casus, the leadership of the United States
      of America and a number of EU countries, primarily Great Britain, France and Germany,
      in cooperation with the Ukrainian side, are currently trying to develop a legal
      mechanism to give legitimacy to the legal acts already adopted by Mr. Zelensky,
      as well as to the future presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine,
      since the elections held after the end of martial law in Ukraine do not fall under
      any provision of the current constitution. To this end, at the end of June 2025,
      the Chairman of the Parliament Ruslan Stefanchuk announced the preparation of
      a law on post-war elections, which is scheduled to be considered at the next sessions
      of the Ukrainian Parliament. Although Ruslan Stefanchuk himself notes that the
      said law will also be illegitimate if martial law is lifted in the country. Against
      this background, the internal political struggle between various parties and candidates
      for the post of the future president of Ukraine is intensifying. The main direction
      of this interaction is the development of a normatively grounded strategy for
      future presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine. Allies of Volodymyr
      Zelensky from Great Britain and the USA announcing continuation of his support
      and new deliveries of weapons paid for by them realize that without interference
      in pre-election processes and vote counting procedure it is difficult to predict
      the results of future elections. That is why Volodymyr Zelensky has now started
      an active reshuffle of the government and clearing the political field of possible
      competitors in the upcoming elections. The Economist previously wrote about the
      fact that the USA and EU countries are negotiating with Ukraine to start election
      processes after the ceasefire at the end of 2025 [7] . However, in order to hold
      elections in Ukraine, martial law, which the authorities imposed on February 24,
      2022 and extend every three months, must cease to be in force. The sixteenth extension
      for 90 days will come into force on August 7, 2025. The Ukrainian mass media name
      Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, a former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who
      is currently ambassador to the UK, as Zelenskyy’s main rival. [Source: thetimes.com
      ] From November 2024 to the end of June 2025 a number of sociological centers
      (KIIS – Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, SOCIS – Ukrainian Center for
      Sociological Studies) and the EU (Statista – German Statistical Data Center from
      February 5-11, 2025, June 6-11, 2025, Survation – English Polling and Marketing
      Research Agency from February 25-27, 2025) conducted opinion polls on the topic
      of presidential elections in Ukraine in order to determine the trust rating of
      Ukrainian citizens. According to the results of opinion polls as of the end of
      June 2025, more than 65.3% of respondents support holding presidential elections
      at the end of 2025. [Source: en.wikipedia.org ] According to the results of the
      conducted research, as of the end of June 2025, out of 14 possible candidates
      for the post of the future president of Ukraine, the highest results were shown
      by: V.Zelensky, V.Zaluzhny, P.Poroshenko, Y.Tymoshenko. If V.Zaluzhny and V.Zelensky
      make it to the second round of voting and there are no violations at the elections,
      the population of Ukraine will give preference to V.Zaluzhny. The candidacy of
      Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, is also being considered
      as a gray cardinal and a dark horse. A number of experts do not rule out that
      if the USA agrees to support his candidacy as the future president of Ukraine,
      Yermak is capable of making efforts to physically remove Zelenskyy, for example,
      due to a sharp deterioration of his health, as was the case with the poisoning
      of the wife of Kyrylo Budanov, head of the main intelligence department of the
      Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Against this background, many Ukrainian experts expect
      a large number of violations, scandals and kompromat at the future presidential
      election in Ukraine, as well as possible influence on the pre-election processes
      by the US, UK, Germany and France. While the Ukrainian people are eagerly awaiting
      the resolution of the conflict, members of the Ukrainian parliament continue to
      scuffle. Thus, on July 16, 2025, on the eve of the vote on the appointment of
      the new Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yuriy Sviridenko, MPs Oleksiy Honcharenko and
      Danylo Hetmantsev had another scuffle on the rostrum during the regular session.

      and disregard for the norms of national and international law contribute to the
      intensification of the internal political struggle for the future posts of the
      President and members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. [Source: economist.com
      ] Strange as it may seem, the first place in this internal political struggle
      is occupied by Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office and
      the shadow leader of Ukraine. Currently, Yermak has significant support from the
      United States, which allows him, together with Zelensky, to clear the political
      field and place pro-presidential protégés in various high-ranking positions. Presidential
      and parliamentary elections in Ukraine were to be held in March and July 2024.
      However, due to another extension of martial law in May this year, these procedures
      have not been carried out. Zelenskyy’s powers as president ended on May 21, 2024.
      At the same time, the decision of the Parliament of Ukraine – the Verkhovna Rada
      – to extend his powers in accordance with the national law No. 389-VIII dd. 12.05.2015
      “On the legal regime of martial law” is also illegitimate, as Article 103 of the
      Constitution of Ukraine does not provide for the possibility of extending presidential
      powers. According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the presidential term is 5 years
      and the President of Ukraine even under martial law has no right to extend his
      powers. Only the Parliament has the right to extend the powers. Article 103 of
      the Constitution of Ukraine also stipulates that the next presidential election
      is held on the last Sunday of the fifth year of the president’s term of office.
      In the event of early termination of the powers of the President of Ukraine, elections
      are held within ninety days from the date of termination of his powers [6] . According
      to the Ukrainian constitution, the prime minister’s candidacy should be proposed
      to the president by the parliamentary majority faction (currently, it is the pro-presidential
      Servant of the People party). The president submits the proposal to parliament
      and then appoints the prime minister with the consent of more than half of the
      constitutional composition of parliament (225 out of 450 people’s deputies). Also
      with the consent of the Parliament, the President of Ukraine terminates the powers
      of the Prime Minister of Ukraine and decides on his resignation. Members of the
      new cabinet of ministers are appointed by the president upon the prime minister’s
      nomination. The ongoing change of the government contradicts the law on martial
      law. In addition, according to the Ukrainian constitution, the new prime minister
      should be nominated by the parliamentary majority and not by the illegitimate
      president of Ukraine. [Source: quora.com ] Many Ukrainian and international lawyers
      note that under national laws and international law, any agreements and legal
      acts signed and introduced by Zelenskyy into parliament after May 20, 2024 are
      effectively illegitimate, contradict Ukrainian legislation and can be canceled
      or easily legally challenged. In this regard, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s decision to
      appoint Yuliya Sviridenko as prime minister also contradicts the current Ukrainian
      legislation and norms of international law. As for the parliamentary elections
      in Ukraine, they were held on July 21, 2019, the deputies were elected for a term
      of 5 years and their powers ended in July 2024. However, due to the current legislation
      and the imposed martial law, the powers of the deputies of the Parliament are
      extended until its end. According to Article 20 of the Electoral Code of Ukraine
      No. 396-IX of December 19, 2019, the electoral process for elections to the Parliament
      of Ukraine should begin within a month after the lifting of martial law. Therefore,
      in fact, in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine, Ruslan Stefanchuk, the
      Speaker of Parliament, has been the legal head of Ukraine since May 21, 2024.
      For this reason, Zelensky’s decisions to extend martial law, appoint a new prime
      minister, Yuriy Sviridenko, reshuffle other members of the Ukrainian government,
      sign an agreement with the United States on rare earth minerals and transfer the
      port of Odessa to American companies are legally unauthorized and can be easily
      overturned both in Ukrainian legal proceedings and in international arbitration
      courts. Realizing this legal precedent-casus, the leadership of the United States
      of America and a number of EU countries, primarily Great Britain, France and Germany,
      in cooperation with the Ukrainian side, are currently trying to develop a legal
      mechanism to give legitimacy to the legal acts already adopted by Mr. Zelensky,
      as well as to the future presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine,
      since the elections held after the end of martial law in Ukraine do not fall under
      any provision of the current constitution. To this end, at the end of June 2025,
      the Chairman of the Parliament Ruslan Stefanchuk announced the preparation of
      a law on post-war elections, which is scheduled to be considered at the next sessions
      of the Ukrainian Parliament. Although Ruslan Stefanchuk himself notes that the
      said law will also be illegitimate if martial law is lifted in the country. Against
      this background, the internal political struggle between various parties and candidates
      for the post of the future president of Ukraine is intensifying. The main direction
      of this interaction is the development of a normatively grounded strategy for
      future presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine. Allies of Volodymyr
      Zelensky from Great Britain and the USA announcing continuation of his support
      and new deliveries of weapons paid for by them realize that without interference
      in pre-election processes and vote counting procedure it is difficult to predict
      the results of future elections. That is why Volodymyr Zelensky has now started
      an active reshuffle of the government and clearing the political field of possible
      competitors in the upcoming elections. The Economist previously wrote about the
      fact that the USA and EU countries are negotiating with Ukraine to start election
      processes after the ceasefire at the end of 2025 [7] . However, in order to hold
      elections in Ukraine, martial law, which the authorities imposed on February 24,
      2022 and extend every three months, must cease to be in force. The sixteenth extension
      for 90 days will come into force on August 7, 2025. The Ukrainian mass media name
      Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, a former commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who
      is currently ambassador to the UK, as Zelenskyy’s main rival. [Source: thetimes.com
      ] From November 2024 to the end of June 2025 a number of sociological centers
      (KIIS – Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, SOCIS – Ukrainian Center for
      Sociological Studies) and the EU (Statista – German Statistical Data Center from
      February 5-11, 2025, June 6-11, 2025, Survation – English Polling and Marketing
      Research Agency from February 25-27, 2025) conducted opinion polls on the topic
      of presidential elections in Ukraine in order to determine the trust rating of
      Ukrainian citizens. According to the results of opinion polls as of the end of
      June 2025, more than 65.3% of respondents support holding presidential elections
      at the end of 2025. [Source: en.wikipedia.org ] According to the results of the
      conducted research, as of the end of June 2025, out of 14 possible candidates
      for the post of the future president of Ukraine, the highest results were shown
      by: V.Zelensky, V.Zaluzhny, P.Poroshenko, Y.Tymoshenko. If V.Zaluzhny and V.Zelensky
      make it to the second round of voting and there are no violations at the elections,
      the population of Ukraine will give preference to V.Zaluzhny. The candidacy of
      Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, is also being considered
      as a gray cardinal and a dark horse. A number of experts do not rule out that
      if the USA agrees to support his candidacy as the future president of Ukraine,
      Yermak is capable of making efforts to physically remove Zelenskyy, for example,
      due to a sharp deterioration of his health, as was the case with the poisoning
      of the wife of Kyrylo Budanov, head of the main intelligence department of the
      Ukrainian Defense Ministry. Against this background, many Ukrainian experts expect
      a large number of violations, scandals and kompromat at the future presidential
      election in Ukraine, as well as possible influence on the pre-election processes
      by the US, UK, Germany and France. While the Ukrainian people are eagerly awaiting
      the resolution of the conflict, members of the Ukrainian parliament continue to
      scuffle. Thus, on July 16, 2025, on the eve of the vote on the appointment of
      the new Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yuriy Sviridenko, MPs Oleksiy Honcharenko and
      Danylo Hetmantsev had another scuffle on the rostrum during the regular session.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the significant reshuffling of Ukraine's
      government amid ongoing conflict and stalled diplomatic efforts for peace, driven
      by President Volodymyr Zelensky's desire to consolidate power and eliminate political
      rivals ahead of upcoming elections. On July 16, 2025, Zelensky appointed Economy
      Minister Yulia Sviridenko as the new prime minister, following the resignation
      of Denys Shmygal, who had been under pressure from Zelensky and his office. The
      reshuffle included the dissolution of the Cabinet of Ministers and a shift in
      the military industry's oversight to the Defense Ministry, which Shmygal had previously
      led. Additionally, Zelensky is considering appointing acting Defense Minister
      Rustem Umerov as Ukraine's ambassador to the USA, despite domestic criticism regarding
      his management of the ministry.

    text: 'Cartoon by NEMO The West continues to operate under the delusion that it
      has the military strength and political support to bully Russia into a ceasefire.
      The latest example comes from General Christopher Donahue, commander of US Army

      to the Association of the US Army’s inaugural LandEuro conference in Wiesbaden,
      Germany last week. Donahue stated that NATO land forces have developed the capability
      to strike and seize Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave “in a timeframe that is unheard
      of”—faster than ever before. He touted NATO advances in rapid land-based operations
      and emphasized that Kaliningrad—a heavily militarized Russian enclave surrounded
      by NATO territory—could be neutralized from the ground much more swiftly than
      previously possible. He said: We can take that down from the ground in a time
      frame that is unheard of – faster than we’ve ever been able to do. Donahue’s statement
      was not intended to suggest that NATO had imminent plans to launch a first strike;
      rather it was a warning to Russia about the alliance’s readiness in the event
      of further aggression, especially against the Baltic states. Commentators and
      officials interpret these remarks as reassurance to NATO partners and a signal
      to Moscow that any attack on NATO would prompt a decisive and rapid response.
      Regardless of Donahue’s intent, this is a reckless, dangerous statement in light
      of his position as the head of the US European Command. While it may have boosted
      morale among the Lilliputian Baltic nations, the Russians viewed it as a serious
      threat and a provocation. Russian authorities responded that any military assault
      on Kaliningrad would be treated unequivocally as an attack on the Russian Federation
      itself. Leonid Slutsky, chair of the Russian parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee
      (a senior figure who often reflects Foreign Ministry rhetoric), explicitly stated:
      An attack on the Kaliningrad Region will mean an attack on Russia, with all due
      retaliatory measures stipulated, among other things, by its nuclear doctrine….
      The American general should consider this before making such declarations. A parliamentary
      defense committee member called the threats “ essentially a declaration of war
      .” Donahue’s remarks, beyond being incredibly stupid, displayed the arrogance
      and contempt that US political and military leaders have for Russia. To make matters
      worse, NATO is conducting, or will soon conduct, a military exercise that simulates
      invading Kaliningrad. The Russians have taken notice and do not dismiss this as
      an idle threat. One retired Russian intelligence officer reacted by saying: And
      what would happen to Washington or New York if we deployed our troops in the ocean,
      for example, including the submarine fleet, and rehearsed strikes on New York
      and Washington. How would Trump react? I think we know the answer to that rhetorical
      question… Trump would attack. Now that Russia is mass-producing the Oreshnik hypersonic
      missile, Putin has an option other than going nuclear. The Oreshnik can hit any
      target in Europe — i.e., it is a hypersonic version of an intermediate-range ballistic
      missile, except it can be maneuvered while in flight and a single missile can
      deliver multiple warheads. The West does not have any defense against this missile.

  - title: Defining Islamic Extremism and What it Means for Syria
    url: https://sonar21.com/defining-islamic-extremism-and-what-it-means-for-syria/
    text: 'Cartoon by NEMO Let’s start with this fact — the overwhelming majority of
      Muslims are not crazed, murderous fanatics. It is a meme the West uses to justify
      genocide against. In fact, we now have clear evidence, in the person of Syria’s
      new leader, that the US provided direct support to a terrorist group that descended
      from ISIS. US Ambassador Jim Jeffrey described Syria’s current leader, Mohammad
      al Jolani, who was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham HTSS, as necessary partners
      in the chaotic Syrian landscape, despite their extremist views, to prevent worse
      outcomes like full Russian/Iranian control or ISIS resurgence. Starting in 2017,
      the US State Department listed HTS as one of the top ten most active terrorist
      groups in the world, and the US placed a $10 million bounty on his head. Jeffrey,
      in a Frontline piece produced by PBS, said the following: Look, he’s [Jolani]
      the least bad option of the various options on Idlib, which is one of the most
      important places in Syria, which is one of the most important places right now
      in the Middle East…. When there is not the normal setup of nation-states and of
      international norms and rules, you wind up with groups like this, that do things
      you don’t like but in the here and now are the folks you have to deal with to
      avoid even worse things. Jeffrey admitted to indirect communications with HTS
      during the Trump administration, including receiving and sending messages via
      intermediaries. He confirmed: “Yes” (to receiving messages from HTS), elaborating:
      “Basically, ‘We want to be your friend. We’re not terrorists. We’re just fighting
      Assad.''” He explained his response: I encouraged people to keep me informed as
      often as possible. That was my job…. I received and sent messages to HTS. The
      United States has played a dangerous game — declaring Islamic-based terrorism
      as a threat to justify military intervention, while providing support — including
      funding — to several of those Sunni Salafists to carry out regime destabilizing
      operations throughout West Asia and in the Caucasus region. This included support
      to the Chechen rebels in Russia, which launched a 10-year war starting in 1999.
      I made the mistake in the past of equating Al-Qaeda as a Salafist entity. With
      the benefit of hindsight, Bin Laden’s group, although motivated by their religion,
      was an anti-imperialist movement directed at the United States. Al Qaeda’s leaders,
      particularly Ayman al-Zawahiri, publicly opposed many of ISIS’s actions, leading
      to a formal split between the groups in 2014. This opposition stemmed from ideological,
      strategic, and tactical differences, with Al Qaeda criticizing ISIS for its extreme
      brutality, sectarian focus, illegitimate declaration of a caliphate, and attacks
      on fellow jihadists and civilians, which they viewed as counterproductive to the
      broader jihadist cause. That cause was erasing US influence in West Asia. As a
      public service, particularly for US citizens unfamiliar with Islam, I want to
      attempt to define three terms: Wahhabism, Salafism and Takfiri. I am sure there
      are Islamic scholars who may take issue with my attempt to clarify the meaning
      of these words. I apologize in advance for my errors. But there are some important
      nuances here that Americans must understand in order to not be blinded by hate,
      and end up supporting self-destructive policies and interventions, especially
      in West Asia. WAHHABISM Wahhabism is a strict, puritanical reform movement within
      Sunni Islam founded in the 18th century by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703–1792)
      in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in what is now Saudi Arabia. It is a subset
      of Salafism, advocating a return to the practices of the Salaf al-Salih (the “pious
      predecessors” of the first three generations of Muslims), emphasizing a literalist
      interpretation of the Quran and Sunnah (Prophet Muhammad’s teachings) and rejecting
      innovations ( bid‘ah ) or practices deemed un-Islamic, such as saint veneration
      or certain Sufi rituals. Core Tenets Tawhid (Monotheism) : Central to Wahhabism
      is the absolute oneness of God, rejecting any form of shirk (polytheism), including
      shrine worship or intercession by saints. Rejection of Bid‘ah : Wahhabis condemn
      practices not explicitly supported by early Islamic texts, such as celebrating
      the Prophet’s birthday or elaborate rituals. Strict Jurisprudence : Relies on
      Hanbali fiqh (Islamic law) and direct interpretation of texts, often bypassing
      later scholarly traditions. Moral Enforcement : Emphasizes enforcing Islamic morality,
      historically through practices like destroying shrines or enforcing dress codes.
      Wahhabism is often considered a precursor to or a branch of Salafism , sharing
      its focus on early Islam and rejection of innovations. However, not all Salafists
      identify as Wahhabis , and some modern Salafists distance themselves from the
      term due to its association with Saudi politics or extremism. Wahhabis are sometimes
      called “Salafists of the Najd” (referring to their Arabian origin), distinguishing
      them from broader Salafi movements. SALAFIST The term Salafist (or Salafi) refers
      to a follower of Salafism , an ultraconservative, reformist movement within Sunni
      Islam that advocates a return to the practices and beliefs of the Salaf al-Salih
      (“pious predecessors”), the first three generations of Muslims (roughly 610–710
      CE). These include the Prophet Muhammad, his companions (Sahaba), their followers
      (Tabi‘un), and the next generation (Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in). Salafists aim to emulate
      this era’s perceived pure, unadulterated Islam, rejecting later innovations (
      bid‘ah ) and emphasizing strict adherence to the Quran, Sunnah (Prophet’s traditions),
      and a literalist interpretation of Islamic texts. Salafism is not monolithic and
      includes three main tendencies: Purist/Quietist Salafism : Focuses on personal
      piety, education, and avoiding politics. Common in Saudi Arabia, these Salafists
      prioritize religious purity and often align with state authorities, rejecting
      rebellion (e.g., scholars like Muhammad ibn al-Uthaymin). Political/Activist Salafism
      : Engages in political reform, often criticizing Muslim governments for un-Islamic
      policies while avoiding violence. They may support democratic processes or social
      activism. Jihadi-Salafism : A militant minority that justifies violence to establish
      Islamic governance, often linked to groups like al-Qaeda or ISIS. They use Salafist
      rhetoric but are condemned by other Salafists for extremism and takfir (declaring
      Muslims apostates). For example, jihadi-Salafists like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi fueled
      sectarian violence in Iraq. Salafism emerged in the 19th century as a response
      to Western colonialism and perceived Islamic decline, influenced by scholars like
      Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (founder of Wahhabism , a Salafist precursor) and later
      by Rashid Rida and Muhammad Abduh. It gained traction in the 20th century, fueled
      by Saudi Arabia’s global promotion of Wahhabi-Salafist teachings through mosques
      and schools. Estimates suggest 50-100 million Salafists worldwide, with significant
      presence in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and diaspora communities. Critics, including
      many Muslims, view Salafism as rigid, intolerant, or a gateway to extremism, especially
      due to jihadi-Salafist actions. Shia and Sufi groups often face Salafist criticism
      for practices deemed un-Islamic. Core Beliefs and Practices Theological Foundation
      : Salafists prioritize tawhid (God’s absolute oneness), opposing practices they
      view as polytheistic ( shirk ), like venerating saints or shrines. They rely heavily
      on hadith (Prophet’s sayings) and reject speculative theology ( kalam ). Rejection
      of Innovation : They oppose practices not explicitly endorsed by the Salaf, such
      as certain Sufi rituals or modern cultural influences, viewing them as deviations.
      Scriptural Literalism : Salafists advocate a direct, text-based approach, often
      bypassing traditional Islamic legal schools (e.g., Hanafi, Maliki) in favor of
      their own interpretations of primary sources. TAKFIRI The term Takfiri is an Arabic
      word derived from “takfir,” which refers to the act of a Muslim declaring another
      Muslim an apostate ( kafir , meaning “unbeliever”) who has abandoned Islam. A
      Takfiri is a Muslim who engages in this practice, accusing fellow Muslims of apostasy,
      often to justify violence or exclusion against them. This declaration is considered
      serious in Islamic jurisprudence, as traditional interpretations reserve such
      judgments for Islamic scholars (ulama) under strict conditions, like denying core
      tenets of faith (e.g., the five pillars). Misuse of takfir is widely viewed as
      a major sin, with one hadith stating that wrongly declaring a Muslim an unbeliever
      makes the accuser themselves guilty of minor shirk (associating partners with
      God). Historically, the term is tied to extremist groups like the 7th-century
      Kharijites, who used takfir against both Sunni and Shia Muslims, fueling insurrections.
      In modern contexts, Takfiri ideology is associated with jihadist groups (e.g.,
      ISIS, al-Qaeda, GIA, Boko Haram) who label Muslims, governments, or entire societies
      as apostates to sanction attacks, often citing thinkers like Sayyid Qutb or Ibn
      Taymiyyah. For example, during the Algerian Civil War (1991–2002), the GIA declared
      civilians and non-members kafir, justifying massacres. Mainstream Muslim scholars,
      such as Hasan al-Hudaybi and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, denounce Takfiri practices as
      un-Islamic and divisive, emphasizing that only God can fully judge faith. The
      term is also politically charged. Shia groups, like Iran’s regime, use “ Takfiri
      ” pejoratively against Sunni militants (e.g., labeling all anti-Syrian regime
      fighters as Takfiris), while Sunni extremists apply it to Shias or secular Muslims.
      On platforms like X, it’s debated as a divisive label, with some users framing
      it as a tool to demonize ideological opponents or protect orthodoxy, while others
      criticize its misuse to stoke sectarianism. In essence, Takfiri describes those
      who weaponize excommunication within Islam, often with violent consequences, though
      its application varies by context and user. Here is the ultimate irony — some
      of the most passionate Salafists are not religious. They use the words and concepts
      to justify violence, such as what is now unfolding in Syria. I believe that the
      vast majority of Islamic clerics eschew violence as the path forward. I await

    url: https://sonar21.com/defining-islamic-extremism-and-what-it-means-for-syria/
    text: 'Cartoon by NEMO Let’s start with this fact — the overwhelming majority of
      Muslims are not crazed, murderous fanatics. It is a meme the West uses to justify
      genocide against. In fact, we now have clear evidence, in the person of Syria’s
      new leader, that the US provided direct support to a terrorist group that descended
      from ISIS. US Ambassador Jim Jeffrey described Syria’s current leader, Mohammad
      al Jolani, who was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham HTSS, as necessary partners
      in the chaotic Syrian landscape, despite their extremist views, to prevent worse
      outcomes like full Russian/Iranian control or ISIS resurgence. Starting in 2017,
      the US State Department listed HTS as one of the top ten most active terrorist
      groups in the world, and the US placed a $10 million bounty on his head. Jeffrey,
      in a Frontline piece produced by PBS, said the following: Look, he’s [Jolani]
      the least bad option of the various options on Idlib, which is one of the most
      important places in Syria, which is one of the most important places right now
      in the Middle East…. When there is not the normal setup of nation-states and of
      international norms and rules, you wind up with groups like this, that do things
      you don’t like but in the here and now are the folks you have to deal with to
      avoid even worse things. Jeffrey admitted to indirect communications with HTS
      during the Trump administration, including receiving and sending messages via
      intermediaries. He confirmed: “Yes” (to receiving messages from HTS), elaborating:
      “Basically, ‘We want to be your friend. We’re not terrorists. We’re just fighting
      Assad.''” He explained his response: I encouraged people to keep me informed as
      often as possible. That was my job…. I received and sent messages to HTS. The
      United States has played a dangerous game — declaring Islamic-based terrorism
      as a threat to justify military intervention, while providing support — including
      funding — to several of those Sunni Salafists to carry out regime destabilizing
      operations throughout West Asia and in the Caucasus region. This included support
      to the Chechen rebels in Russia, which launched a 10-year war starting in 1999.
      I made the mistake in the past of equating Al-Qaeda as a Salafist entity. With
      the benefit of hindsight, Bin Laden’s group, although motivated by their religion,
      was an anti-imperialist movement directed at the United States. Al Qaeda’s leaders,
      particularly Ayman al-Zawahiri, publicly opposed many of ISIS’s actions, leading
      to a formal split between the groups in 2014. This opposition stemmed from ideological,
      strategic, and tactical differences, with Al Qaeda criticizing ISIS for its extreme
      brutality, sectarian focus, illegitimate declaration of a caliphate, and attacks
      on fellow jihadists and civilians, which they viewed as counterproductive to the
      broader jihadist cause. That cause was erasing US influence in West Asia. As a
      public service, particularly for US citizens unfamiliar with Islam, I want to
      attempt to define three terms: Wahhabism, Salafism and Takfiri. I am sure there
      are Islamic scholars who may take issue with my attempt to clarify the meaning
      of these words. I apologize in advance for my errors. But there are some important
      nuances here that Americans must understand in order to not be blinded by hate,
      and end up supporting self-destructive policies and interventions, especially
      in West Asia. WAHHABISM Wahhabism is a strict, puritanical reform movement within
      Sunni Islam founded in the 18th century by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703–1792)
      in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in what is now Saudi Arabia. It is a subset
      of Salafism, advocating a return to the practices of the Salaf al-Salih (the “pious
      predecessors” of the first three generations of Muslims), emphasizing a literalist
      interpretation of the Quran and Sunnah (Prophet Muhammad’s teachings) and rejecting
      innovations ( bid‘ah ) or practices deemed un-Islamic, such as saint veneration
      or certain Sufi rituals. Core Tenets Tawhid (Monotheism) : Central to Wahhabism
      is the absolute oneness of God, rejecting any form of shirk (polytheism), including
      shrine worship or intercession by saints. Rejection of Bid‘ah : Wahhabis condemn
      practices not explicitly supported by early Islamic texts, such as celebrating
      the Prophet’s birthday or elaborate rituals. Strict Jurisprudence : Relies on
      Hanbali fiqh (Islamic law) and direct interpretation of texts, often bypassing
      later scholarly traditions. Moral Enforcement : Emphasizes enforcing Islamic morality,
      historically through practices like destroying shrines or enforcing dress codes.
      Wahhabism is often considered a precursor to or a branch of Salafism , sharing
      its focus on early Islam and rejection of innovations. However, not all Salafists
      identify as Wahhabis , and some modern Salafists distance themselves from the
      term due to its association with Saudi politics or extremism. Wahhabis are sometimes
      called “Salafists of the Najd” (referring to their Arabian origin), distinguishing
      them from broader Salafi movements. SALAFIST The term Salafist (or Salafi) refers
      to a follower of Salafism , an ultraconservative, reformist movement within Sunni
      Islam that advocates a return to the practices and beliefs of the Salaf al-Salih
      (“pious predecessors”), the first three generations of Muslims (roughly 610–710
      CE). These include the Prophet Muhammad, his companions (Sahaba), their followers
      (Tabi‘un), and the next generation (Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in). Salafists aim to emulate
      this era’s perceived pure, unadulterated Islam, rejecting later innovations (
      bid‘ah ) and emphasizing strict adherence to the Quran, Sunnah (Prophet’s traditions),
      and a literalist interpretation of Islamic texts. Salafism is not monolithic and
      includes three main tendencies: Purist/Quietist Salafism : Focuses on personal
      piety, education, and avoiding politics. Common in Saudi Arabia, these Salafists
      prioritize religious purity and often align with state authorities, rejecting
      rebellion (e.g., scholars like Muhammad ibn al-Uthaymin). Political/Activist Salafism
      : Engages in political reform, often criticizing Muslim governments for un-Islamic
      policies while avoiding violence. They may support democratic processes or social
      activism. Jihadi-Salafism : A militant minority that justifies violence to establish
      Islamic governance, often linked to groups like al-Qaeda or ISIS. They use Salafist
      rhetoric but are condemned by other Salafists for extremism and takfir (declaring
      Muslims apostates). For example, jihadi-Salafists like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi fueled
      sectarian violence in Iraq. Salafism emerged in the 19th century as a response

    text: 'David Davidian If one were a strategic globalist, neoconservative (neoliberal
      interventionist, if you wish) policy maker, whose goal was the global economic
      supremacy of the United States, the strategic incapacitation of both Russia and
      China would be mandatory. We witness these efforts today, especially in proxy
      engagements by players such as Ukraine, Israel, Turkey, and even smaller proxies
      such as those in the Southern Caucasus: Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia. Part
      of the globalist strategy includes reducing the influence of states with large
      ethnic blocs that do not serve the globalist agenda. Emerging states that are
      still defining their national ethos, such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan, are easy
      targets. Others, such as Japan and Armenia, both of which are nearly monoethnic
      (98%) and whose national identities are rooted in millennia of history, should
      top the list for globalist deconstruction. The former’s mono-ethnicity is tough
      to crack, but the latter is a different story. Japan is an industrial and technological
      entity with a population of about 125M people that generally supports Western
      interests. Japan’s economic prowess has declined for at least two decades due
      partly to policies strongly suggested by the US. Since WWII, Japan’s culture is
      a blend of Western and traditional culture, with de-militarization constitutionally
      upheld. Even with over 50,000 US soldiers stationed in Japan, the Japanese constitution
      has been reinterpreted to allow Japan to maintain self-defense forces and engage
      in limited military activities. Japan serves the interests of globalists, as is.
      Western European societies have been stirred with massive immigration from wars
      in North Africa, Western Asia, and Ukraine. What once may have been traditional
      French or Italian positions have been strongly modulated by enormous immigration
      and an EU superstructure that sets policies invoked by individuals whose positions
      were attained by multiple levels of indirect voting and appointment. Yet the system
      is not entirely devoid of accountability; full sovereignty of EU member states
      has been compromised. The staunch anti-Russian behavior of the EU regarding Russia’s
      Special Military Operation in Ukraine should be considered a victory for globalists
      However, states such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan were born out of the disintegration
      of Tsarist Russia, and neither existed as states before 1918, after which both
      were absorbed into the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian People’s Republic was proclaimed
      in 1917 with Kiev as its capital, and the Republic of Azerbaijan in the spring
      of 1918. Both were geo-ethnic entities in search of a national ethos. Ukraine
      became anti-Russian to the point of neo-Nazism by WWII, and Azerbaijan was encouraged
      to magnify its Turkic element at the expense of its Iranian traditions. The Republic
      of Turkey, having its Western reconditioning, ushered in by Mustafa Kemal, created
      the core of Azerbaijan’s Turkic-centricity and was encouraged by the Soviets to
      a certain extent to counter Armenian national aspirations, especially after the
      catastrophic 1915 Turkish genocide of the Armenians. With the Ukrainian national
      ethos in conditional flux, its anti-Russian persuasion was used both during the
      Cold War and after, culminating in the 2014 coup organized by the West and subsequent
      existential threat to Russian interests. Newly formed states with national ethos
      still in flux are in danger of their emergent ethos being manipulated in the interests
      of stronger powers. Even established societies were in danger of deconstruction.
      A goal of Soviet social engineering was deconstructing constituent ethnicities
      and constructing a Homo Sovieticus population. However, none of this reflects
      cultures that naturally evolve. Neoconservative/neoliberal globalists are constantly
      in search of allies, proxies, social movements that can be co-opted, weaker states
      that can be manipulated by promises, covert intervention, and personal gain by
      those either in power or who can replace incumbents. Their goal is long-term,
      and the strategy is to use or engender (including regime change) any proxy that
      can either engage Russia (and eventually China), ideally surrounding Russia with
      multiple conflicts, hoping it would fold like the Soviet Union. A classic example
      was the rise to power of Georgia’s Mikael Saakashvilli, who became the darling
      of the West by adopting an anti-Russia, pro-EU policy, with aspirations to join
      NATO. The West gave him enough rope that he instigated the 2008 war with Russia,
      with the West sitting back and watching as Georgia lost territory to Russia. Saakashvilli
      came to power with an overtly Western-supported anti-corruption (read as anti-Russian)
      platform. Indeed, Saakashvilli implemented positive local changes that can be
      observed today, but had a short shelf life. He was voted out of power, and today,
      Georgia does not view Russia as the threat once perceived. China has invested
      heavily in Georgia, which is in contrast to the West, which, in 2022, suggested
      Georgia open up a second front against Russia. Georgia wisely decided against
      political suicide. Ultimately, Georgia’s EU dream dissolved into the illusion
      it had always been. Armenia does not share a border with Russia; Georgia is squeezed
      between them and Azerbaijan. Armenia was an active member of the Moscow-led CSTO
      (the Collective Security Treaty Organization) and is a member of the Eurasian
      Economic Union (EAEU or EEU). Much of Armenia’s infrastructure is owned by Russian
      interests, and over 90% of its hydrocarbon imports are from Russia. Russian soldiers
      guarded Armenia’s border with Turkey – but not anymore. Russia has a long-term
      agreement with Armenia to host the Russian 102nd Military Base in Gyumri, Armenia.
      In 2018, Pashinyan came to power in a Western-supported movement that ousted the
      previous pro-Russian government, widely seen as corrupt, creating the centerpiece
      of a narrative that Armenia’s financial problems would be solved by eliminating
      the incumbents. Pashinyan’s movement was not openly anti-Russian, considering
      Armenia’s strong economic ties with Russia. However, it did not take long for
      Pashinyan and his appointees to consolidate power across the board. Pashinyan
      presided over the engineered defeat of Nagorno-Karabakh, conceding to Azerbaijan’s
      conquest of that land. Pashinyan was immediately re-elected in the aftermath of
      the post-war chaos. In 2023, Azerbaijan ethnically cleansed 120,000 Armenians
      from Nagorno-Karabakh. Pashinyan referred to Nagorno-Karabakh as a significant
      burden on Armenia. Any leverage that Russia had over both Armenia and Azerbaijan
      with the frozen Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was removed. Azerbaijan’s border with
      Iran expanded by over 200 km and became ripe for clandestine operations against
      Iran, particularly Israel. There are discussions about connecting the rump of
      Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhichevan across southern Armenia at the Iranian
      border. Such a corridor, called the Zangezur Corridor, would connect Turkey with
      Azerbaijan and on to Turkic central Asia, greatly enhancing an east-west Turkic-run
      trade route at the expense of a north-south China-India-Iranian-Russian (the latter
      across the Caspian, through Azerbaijan, or Armenia into Georgia). Iran vehemently
      opposes such a cutoff of its border with Armenia, since this corridor may not
      be under sovereign Armenian control. Leaks have emerged about this corridor being
      run by an agent under US supervision. Surely, Russia and Iran (India and China)
      will not sit idly by and allow this to happen.'

    paragraph_summary: The article by David Davidian discusses the strategic goals of
      globalist, neoconservative policymakers aiming for U.S. economic supremacy by
      incapacitating rivals like Russia and China. It highlights current proxy conflicts
      involving nations such as Ukraine, Israel, and Turkey, as well as smaller states
      in the Southern Caucasus, which are seen as targets for globalist influence. The
      author emphasizes the challenge of undermining countries with strong national
      identities, like Japan and Armenia, while noting Japan's historical alignment
      with Western interests despite its declining economic power and constitutional
      demilitarization. The article also points to the impact of massive immigration
      on traditional European societies, suggesting that the EU's policies, influenced
      by indirect voting, have reshaped national identities and positions across Europe.

      supremacy of the United States, the strategic incapacitation of both Russia and
      China would be mandatory. We witness these efforts today, especially in proxy
      engagements by players such as Ukraine, Israel, Turkey, and even smaller proxies
      such as those in the Southern Caucasus: Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia. Part
      of the globalist strategy includes reducing the influence of states with large
      ethnic blocs that do not serve the globalist agenda. Emerging states that are
      still defining their national ethos, such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan, are easy
      targets. Others, such as Japan and Armenia, both of which are nearly monoethnic
      (98%) and whose national identities are rooted in millennia of history, should
      top the list for globalist deconstruction. The former’s mono-ethnicity is tough
      to crack, but the latter is a different story. Japan is an industrial and technological
      entity with a population of about 125M people that generally supports Western
      interests. Japan’s economic prowess has declined for at least two decades due
      partly to policies strongly suggested by the US. Since WWII, Japan’s culture is
      a blend of Western and traditional culture, with de-militarization constitutionally
      upheld. Even with over 50,000 US soldiers stationed in Japan, the Japanese constitution
      has been reinterpreted to allow Japan to maintain self-defense forces and engage
      in limited military activities. Japan serves the interests of globalists, as is.
      Western European societies have been stirred with massive immigration from wars
      in North Africa, Western Asia, and Ukraine. What once may have been traditional
      French or Italian positions have been strongly modulated by enormous immigration
      and an EU superstructure that sets policies invoked by individuals whose positions
      were attained by multiple levels of indirect voting and appointment. Yet the system
      is not entirely devoid of accountability; full sovereignty of EU member states
      has been compromised. The staunch anti-Russian behavior of the EU regarding Russia’s
      Special Military Operation in Ukraine should be considered a victory for globalists
      However, states such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan were born out of the disintegration
      of Tsarist Russia, and neither existed as states before 1918, after which both
      were absorbed into the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian People’s Republic was proclaimed
      in 1917 with Kiev as its capital, and the Republic of Azerbaijan in the spring
      of 1918. Both were geo-ethnic entities in search of a national ethos. Ukraine
      became anti-Russian to the point of neo-Nazism by WWII, and Azerbaijan was encouraged
      to magnify its Turkic element at the expense of its Iranian traditions. The Republic
      of Turkey, having its Western reconditioning, ushered in by Mustafa Kemal, created
      the core of Azerbaijan’s Turkic-centricity and was encouraged by the Soviets to
      a certain extent to counter Armenian national aspirations, especially after the
      catastrophic 1915 Turkish genocide of the Armenians. With the Ukrainian national
      ethos in conditional flux, its anti-Russian persuasion was used both during the
      Cold War and after, culminating in the 2014 coup organized by the West and subsequent
      existential threat to Russian interests. Newly formed states with national ethos
      still in flux are in danger of their emergent ethos being manipulated in the interests
      of stronger powers. Even established societies were in danger of deconstruction.
      A goal of Soviet social engineering was deconstructing constituent ethnicities
      and constructing a Homo Sovieticus population. However, none of this reflects
      cultures that naturally evolve. Neoconservative/neoliberal globalists are constantly
      in search of allies, proxies, social movements that can be co-opted, weaker states
      that can be manipulated by promises, covert intervention, and personal gain by
      those either in power or who can replace incumbents. Their goal is long-term,
      and the strategy is to use or engender (including regime change) any proxy that
      can either engage Russia (and eventually China), ideally surrounding Russia with
      multiple conflicts, hoping it would fold like the Soviet Union. A classic example
      was the rise to power of Georgia’s Mikael Saakashvilli, who became the darling
      of the West by adopting an anti-Russia, pro-EU policy, with aspirations to join
      NATO. The West gave him enough rope that he instigated the 2008 war with Russia,
      with the West sitting back and watching as Georgia lost territory to Russia. Saakashvilli
      came to power with an overtly Western-supported anti-corruption (read as anti-Russian)
      platform. Indeed, Saakashvilli implemented positive local changes that can be
      observed today, but had a short shelf life. He was voted out of power, and today,
      Georgia does not view Russia as the threat once perceived. China has invested
      heavily in Georgia, which is in contrast to the West, which, in 2022, suggested
      Georgia open up a second front against Russia. Georgia wisely decided against
      political suicide. Ultimately, Georgia’s EU dream dissolved into the illusion
      it had always been. Armenia does not share a border with Russia; Georgia is squeezed
      between them and Azerbaijan. Armenia was an active member of the Moscow-led CSTO
      (the Collective Security Treaty Organization) and is a member of the Eurasian
      Economic Union (EAEU or EEU). Much of Armenia’s infrastructure is owned by Russian
      interests, and over 90% of its hydrocarbon imports are from Russia. Russian soldiers
      guarded Armenia’s border with Turkey – but not anymore. Russia has a long-term
      agreement with Armenia to host the Russian 102nd Military Base in Gyumri, Armenia.
      In 2018, Pashinyan came to power in a Western-supported movement that ousted the
      previous pro-Russian government, widely seen as corrupt, creating the centerpiece
      of a narrative that Armenia’s financial problems would be solved by eliminating
      the incumbents. Pashinyan’s movement was not openly anti-Russian, considering
      Armenia’s strong economic ties with Russia. However, it did not take long for
      Pashinyan and his appointees to consolidate power across the board. Pashinyan
      presided over the engineered defeat of Nagorno-Karabakh, conceding to Azerbaijan’s
      conquest of that land. Pashinyan was immediately re-elected in the aftermath of
      the post-war chaos. In 2023, Azerbaijan ethnically cleansed 120,000 Armenians
      from Nagorno-Karabakh. Pashinyan referred to Nagorno-Karabakh as a significant
      burden on Armenia. Any leverage that Russia had over both Armenia and Azerbaijan
      with the frozen Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was removed. Azerbaijan’s border with
      Iran expanded by over 200 km and became ripe for clandestine operations against
      Iran, particularly Israel. There are discussions about connecting the rump of
      Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhichevan across southern Armenia at the Iranian
      border. Such a corridor, called the Zangezur Corridor, would connect Turkey with
      Azerbaijan and on to Turkic central Asia, greatly enhancing an east-west Turkic-run
      trade route at the expense of a north-south China-India-Iranian-Russian (the latter
      across the Caspian, through Azerbaijan, or Armenia into Georgia). Iran vehemently
      opposes such a cutoff of its border with Armenia, since this corridor may not
      be under sovereign Armenian control. Leaks have emerged about this corridor being
      run by an agent under US supervision. Surely, Russia and Iran (India and China)
      will not sit idly by and allow this to happen.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how strategic globalist policymakers
      aim to weaken Russia and China through proxy conflicts involving countries like
      Ukraine, Israel, and Azerbaijan, while also targeting states with strong ethnic
      identities, such as Armenia, for potential destabilization.
    paragraph_summary: The article by David Davidian discusses the strategic goals of
      globalist, neoconservative policymakers aiming for U.S. economic supremacy by
      incapacitating rivals like Russia and China. It highlights current proxy conflicts
      involving nations such as Ukraine, Israel, and Turkey, as well as smaller states
      in the Southern Caucasus, which are seen as targets for globalist influence. The
      author emphasizes the challenge of undermining countries with strong national
      identities, like Japan and Armenia, while noting Japan's historical alignment
      with Western interests despite its declining economic power and constitutional
      demilitarization. The article also points to the impact of massive immigration
      on traditional European societies, suggesting that the EU's policies, influenced
      by indirect voting, have reshaped national identities and positions across Europe.

    text: 'Biden’s CIA Direct, Bill Burns Foreign Policy published an article last week
      by Tim Weiner, author of Legacy of Ashes , with the title, When the Threat Is
      Inside the White House: What CIA insiders make of the MAGA moles and toadies now
      in charge of U.S. national security . While the intent of the article is to paint
      Trump and his team as a bunch of Russian toadies, Weiner unwittingly paints a
      picture of the CIA’s leadership as biased operators with no understanding of Russia…
      They still think they are engaging a communist authoritarian state. Here’s the
      opening paragraph: If our nation’s spies are the infantry of our ideology, as
      John Le Carré once observed, Tom Sylvester is an unknown soldier who became a
      four-star general. Two years ago, he was named the CIA’s deputy director of operations,
      in charge of thousands of officers conducting espionage, covert action, and paramilitary
      operations. He won the job by virtue of his role in stealing Russia’s war plans
      for Ukraine, warning the world about the coming invasion, and providing steadfast
      support to Kyiv’s military and intelligence services. Weiner credits Sylvester
      with “stealing Russia’s war plans for Ukraine,” but completely ignores the role
      the CIA played in provoking Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The entire narrative
      surrounding Sylvester’s actions is constructed around the premise that Russia
      is a bad, evil actor and that its actions have nothing to do with Western provocations,
      especially the expansion of NATO to the East. The next “highlight” from Weiner’s
      piece provides an excellent example of the CIA’s bias and ignorance when it comes
      to Russia: In the summer of 2017, Sylvester received new marching orders from
      Tomas Rakusan, the new chief of the clandestine service, whose identity remained
      a state secret until after his retirement. Rakusan had spied on Russia since before
      the end of the Cold War, operating throughout Central and Eastern Europe. His
      hatred of the Russians was bred in the bone. His parents were Czech; he was 9
      years old when Soviet troops crushed the Prague Spring uprising in 1968. Rakusan
      saw Russian President Vladimir Putin’s subversion of the presidential election
      on Trump’s behalf as the espionage equivalent of 9/11. In retaliation, he aimed
      to penetrate the Kremlin—among the greatest aspirations of the CIA since its foundation,
      and a goal never achieved. Hatred of Russians? It is one thing to despise the
      Soviet Union, which was governed by a Communist ideology. But the “End of the
      Cold War” was marked by the peaceful overthrow of a communist government and the
      creation of a new Russian government that emphasized nationalism and Christianity.
      So how is that a threat to the United States? Moreover, during the decade of the
      1990s, Russia’s military was in disarray and the society was ravaged by economic
      crisis, which included two periods of hyperinflation, widespread poverty among
      the Russian people, and a dramatic decline in life expectancy among Russian men.
      This did not age well: “ Rakusan saw Russian President Vladimir Putin’s subversion
      of the presidential election on Trump’s behalf as the espionage equivalent of
      9/11. ” Tulsi Gabbard’s declassification of intelligence documents and emails
      from various members of the CIA and other intelligence officials on Friday, shows
      that Rakusan either had his head up his ass or was part of the conspiracy to attack
      Donald Trump with a lie (or both). The memo carries the following subject line:
      Intelligence Community suppression of intelligence showing “Russian and criminal
      actors did not impact” the 2016 presidential election via cyber-attacks on infrastructure.
      I am sure this caught Tim Weiner by surprise. Certainly takes the wind out of
      his sails as he tries to portray the CIA as a saintly, honest outfit being undermined
      by a President who is in the pocket of Putin. The next couple of paragraphs from
      Weiner paint a picture of Western intelligence ramping up against Russia, but
      also exposes CIA’s impotence with respect to human intelligence assets in Russia:
      By the summer of 2020, CIA officers were working in close liaison with the British,
      Dutch, Ukrainians, Poles, Czechs, Estonians, and many other services against the
      Russians. “There was the strategic decision on how we would share intelligence,”
      Sylvester said. “We used it as an influence mechanism, in and of itself, to get
      governments to start cooperating with us.” This hard-won trust “allowed them to
      open up taps of cooperation and intelligence that they had theretofore not shared
      with us,” he added. The CIA and its foreign allies were cross-fertilizing intelligence,
      choreographing operations, and, most importantly, recruiting Russian sources.
      The CIA had been able to “push back against the Russian services” largely by “working
      with liaison partners overseas to expose and disrupt Russian intelligence activities,”
      then-CIA Director William Burns told me last year. “And then what we tried to
      build on that, starting in the spring of 2021, was the recruitment dimension of
      this,” he said. “This was really, especially once the war drums started beating,
      a once-in-a-generation opportunity, given the disaffection in some parts of the
      Russian elite and Russian society” against Putin’s regime. This quote jumped off
      the page for me: largely by “working with liaison partners overseas to expose
      and disrupt Russian intelligence activities.” That is a polite way of saying that
      the the CIA had no assets of its own and was relying on foreign intelligence services,
      with the bulk of the information coming from Ukraine. And note the significance
      of the “spring of 2021;” Biden was newly installed as President and the effort
      to go after Russia on a more intense basis was kicked into high gear . Burn’s
      comment to Weiner is also quite instructive… It shows a mistaken belief on the
      part of the Director of the CIA about the stability of the Russian government
      (i.e., given the disaffection in some parts of the Russian elite and Russian society”
      against Putin’s regime) and is an implicit admission that the CIA had embarked
      on a program to try to ignite a new color revolution in Russia. This is not my
      opinion… Weiner’s piece makes that clear in this paragraph: Kyiv’s spy services,
      rebuilt by the CIA after Putin seized Crimea and other parts of eastern Ukraine
      in 2014, had become one of Washington’s best sources of intelligence on the Russians;
      the CIA was becoming the Ukrainians’ best defense against them. “It was probably
      one of the best investments that the CIA, the U.S. government, has made,” Sylvester
      said; it had created “the trust, the confidence, the ability in times of need
      to feel like you were in the trenches together.” By the fall of 2021, the CIA
      had given the Ukrainians a graduate course in espionage and paramilitary operations,
      along with the ability to understand and utilize a steady stream of U.S. intelligence.
      I will close with this amazing, but not surprising, revelation from Weiner. He
      describes Rakusan’s fury in the aftermath of Trump’s election, and Rakusan’s desperate,
      dangerous actions: “The Russians manipulated our fucking elections,” he told them.
      “How do we make sure this never happens again?” He didn’t care if they didn’t
      speak Russian or had never set foot in Moscow. He ordered them to take their expertise
      in targeting and recruiting terrorists and turn it against Russian spies, diplomats,
      and oligarchs. Got that? “Recruit terrorists!” I don’t ever want to hear another
      damn word about the US fighting a war on terrorism when we have an admission from
      the top operations officer in the CIA telling his boys and girls to recruit terrorists,
      who will be used to attack Russia. I am sure the Russians have read Mr. Weiner’s
      piece and have taken notice of this fact. I suspect they already knew that. Based
      on Weiner’s article, we now know that the US launched an intelligence war on Russia
      based completely on a lie. And the senior leaders of the CIA went along with it.
      In my view, the CIA ought to be dismantled and cast to the four winds. We need
      to start over with some people of actual intelligence. I thank you for your invaluable
      support by taking time to read or comment. I do not charge a subscription fee

      an evil actor, reflecting a deeper misunderstanding of the geopolitical dynamics
      at play and showcasing the agency's entrenched biases against Russia, as exemplified
      by the long-standing animosity of figures like Tomas Rakusan, the chief of the
      clandestine service.

  - title: Iran Toughens Stance on Negotiations with the US
    url: https://sonar21.com/iran-toughen-stance-on-negotiations-with-the-us/
    text: 'Meeting of Azerbaijan and Iran Diplomats I just received the following from
      Press TV in Iran, and it refutes Donald Trump’s claim that Iran is eager to negotiate:
      A senior Iranian political figure has told Iranian Press TV that Iran is rethinking
      its approach to nuclear negotiations and will not enter new talks using the same
      framework or agenda. Referring to the U-S request to resume negotiations, the
      source emphasized that any talks must align with the real security dynamics of
      the region. He expressed skepticism about the US intentions for peace, stating
      that the goal of Washington is to disarm Iran to compensate for Israel’s weakness
      in the next potential war. The political figure added any new negotiations must
      include serious and practical guarantees including scrutiny of Israel’s nuclear
      and WMD programs, credible punishment of the regime (i.e., Israel) and compensation
      to Iran. He stressed in the absence of these conditions, negotiations will merely
      serve as a prelude to war. He added Tehran is willing to “offer another opportunity”
      but requires evidence that U.S. negotiator Witkoff is pursuing peace rather than
      escalation. There you have it. Iran is willing to talk but only if the conditions
      outlined above are met by Washington. This means there will be no further negotiations
      and that Iran will busy itself preparing for the next US/Israeli attack. Iran’s
      requirement that Israel be subjected to the same type of scrutiny of its nuclear
      program as Iran is a new, but not surprising, demand. While Iran’s demands are
      reasonable, I cannot imagine any scenario where Trump would agree. I just learned
      that Trump’s Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, did some work for Bibi Netanyahu at
      Trump’s direction.  In 2020, she briefly worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
      Netanyahu’s campaign, underscoring a professional relationship within Israeli
      politics. She is a critical voice in any decision that Trump makes regarding Israel…
      especially when it comes to negotiating with Iran. Staying in the region, but
      shifting to a neighboring country, I have received a terrific email from a reader
      who provides excellent insights into the the dynamics at play among Azerbaijan,
      Iran, Ukraine and Russia. Both Western media and social media outlets have reported
      in the aftermath of the 12 Day War (we got to call it something pithy) that Israel
      used Azerbaijan as a launching pad for some of its attacks on Iran. I think my
      new friend provides a credible explanation for why that it not true: How do I
      know this? Firstly, on the 27th of June, 2025 – only days after the 12 day war
      between Israel and Iran was halted – Iran’s new Ambassador to Azerbaijan was officially
      received by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and warmly greeted. (Go
      to azertag.az/en – the Azerbaijan State News Agency in English, click on Official
      News, and move to the fourth page of listed news items. Here you will find photos
      documenting this important event.) On the 4th of July, 2025, the President of
      Iran – Pezeshkian – at the head of a large Iranian governmental delegation traveled
      to Khankendi in the newly incorporated Azeri territory in Nagorno Karabakh for
      a state meeting with the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and many Azeri
      Ministers. For photos you can go to azertag.az/en and click on Official News and
      move to the 2nd page. So, as a former analyst, what do you think the chances are
      that Iran would send a new Ambassador, and the President of Iran would travel
      to a country that only days earlier had allowed its territory to be used by Israel
      to launch deadly surprise attacks on Tehran. Less than zero? FYI relations between
      the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran are cordial, business relations are developing,
      and the north south rail corridor project between Russia and Iran through Azerbaijan
      is proceeding apace. With this in mind, where is this easily debunk-able narrative
      about the Republic of Azerbaijan allowing Israel to use its territory for sneak
      attacks on Iran coming from?  To explain I need to take you on a short history
      lesson. In 2020 I was present in Azerbaijan during the war between Armenia and
      Azerbaijan. The hysterical narratives coming out of Armenia at that time would
      have made Bagdad Bob blush. When Armenia disastrously lost this war, and the Armenian
      President Pashinian acknowledged in writing that he recognized the Nagorno Karabakh
      territories as Azeri, Western pundits siding with Armenia had a lot of egg on
      their faces. Since the Iraq war in 2003, the ethnic Kurds have carved out a semi-autonomous
      state in the north of Iraq and parts of north east Syria. These Kurdish enclaves
      directly border the West and East Azerbaijan Provinces of Iran, (located in north
      west Iran, just south of the Republic of Azerbaijan – check a provincial map of
      Iran for details). The Israelis have established deep ties in these Kurdish enclaves,
      and it is entirely conceivable that their sneak attacks on northern Iran were
      launched from precisely these Kurdish held enclaves THROUGH the territories of
      West and East Azerbaijan provinces, further through Ardabil province to the Caspian
      Sea, over the Caspian Sea for a 100 kilometers or so, and directly south onto
      Tehran and other nearby targets. This is why some disposable extra fuel tanks
      for drones were discovered off the northern coast of Iran. Armenian narrators,
      ever looking for a chance to increase tension between Iran and the Republic of
      Azerbaijan, have apparently launched a carefully crafted deception, confusing
      the two Azerbaijan provinces of Iran with the actual Republic of Azerbaijan. Unfortunately,
      many otherwise reliable bloggers have jumped on the band wagon without doing their
      due diligence. I would recommend to you that you never take any possible anti-Azeri
      narrative at face value without double checking. As concerns Russian – Azeri tensions,
      here we have to go back to the Second World War. After the war, large regions
      of today’s Ukraine were essentially depopulated. Thousands of ethnic Azeris, who
      had fought the Wehrmacht in Ukraine and in Berlin, married ethnic Ukrainian ladies
      and settled in the country. During my 25 years in and around the Republic of Azerbaijan,
      I was almost astonished at how many familial ties there actually were between
      ethic Ukrainians and Azeris. Azeris are also excellent business people and established
      solid investments in the oil and gas industries in Ukraine, the oil refinery in
      Kremenchug that Russia destroyed recently was owned by Azeri interests linked
      to President Aliyev. Apparently there had been some sort of “understanding” that
      Russia would not seriously disable this refinery during the special military operation.
      In exchange, the Russians may have negotiated the right to use existing Soviet
      era pipelines to pipe their oil and gas south to the Republic of Azerbaijan, re-flag
      it as Azeri, and then pump it through the newly constructed BTC and other existing
      pipelines from Azerbaijan to Turkey, and onward to western markets. No need for
      “ghost oil tankers” on the high seas, which may simply be a diversion. It looks
      as though the Spider’s Web operation tarnished these “understandings”. Ukrainian
      intelligence may have engaged certain ethnic Azeri criminal networks operating
      in Russia to assist with this operation. This operation, however, was not officially
      approved in any manner by the actual government of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
      The Russian response was not long in waiting and, as usual, heavy-handed, as it
      probably should be. This Russian response and subsequent clamp down on ethnic
      Azeri “businessmen” has opened old wounds between the Russian government and ethnic
      Azeris living in Russia and Azerbaijan, with predictable results. However, don’t
      expect any major fireworks, or attacks on Azeri oilfields, although our friends
      in MI6 may stage a false flag or two to heat matters up. We should never forget
      the prominent position that BP Azerbaijan holds within the Republic of Azerbaijan
      – although it operates VERY carefully. Finally, the Zangezur corridor in southern
      Armenia located between the two Azeri territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan
      proper and Nakhichevan. At the end of the 2020 war between Azerbaijan and Armenia,
      there were discussions about opening this corridor, and this initiative has continued
      to this day. Now it looks as if the US State Department has proposed leasing this
      Armenian territory to a US entity for 100 years to supervise the orderly transit
      of goods and services between Turkey – through Nakhichevan – to the Republic of
      Azerbaijan. A modern road, railroad, oil and gas pipelines and a fiber optic magistral
      are proposed. The Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan have just recently met
      in the UAE and may have come to an understanding on this matter, (again, go to
      azertag.az/en for confirmation and photos). Iran and Russia may not actually halt
      this initiative if they are guaranteed open access to this corridor and it may
      serve their economic interests as well. It looks as if the US State Department
      has finally come up with a good idea that may come to fruition, although the actual
      operator of the Zangezur corridor may not eventually be a direct US interest.
      The recent visit of the current President of Syria to the Republic of Azerbaijan
      may be directly connected to the Zangezur corridor developments. The President
      of Turkmenistan has also just recently visited the Republic of Azerbaijan, possibly
      discussing a trans-Caspian gas pipeline to hookup to the planned pipeline links
      to Turkey that are to be built in the Zangezur corridor. In short, there is a
      LOT of activity behind the scenes. I had the pleasure of chatting with Garland
      Nixon and Rasheed Muhammad about current events, especially Trump’s self-inflicted
      Epstein Infrerno : I thank you for your invaluable support by taking time to read

      of Israel's nuclear capabilities and accountability for its actions. The figure
      emphasized that without these conditions, negotiations would likely lead to war
      rather than peace. While Iran is open to dialogue, it requires evidence of genuine
      U.S. intentions for peace, complicating the prospect of future negotiations, especially
      given the influence of Trump’s Chief of Staff, who has ties to Israeli politics.

      are proposed. The Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan have just recently met
      in the UAE and may have come to an understanding on this matter, (again, go to
      azertag.az/en for confirmation and photos). Iran and Russia may not actually halt
      this initiative if they are guaranteed open access to this corridor and it may
      serve their economic interests as well. It looks as if the US State Department
      has finally come up with a good idea that may come to fruition, although the actual
      operator of the Zangezur corridor may not eventually be a direct US interest.
      The recent visit of the current President of Syria to the Republic of Azerbaijan
      may be directly connected to the Zangezur corridor developments. The President
      of Turkmenistan has also just recently visited the Republic of Azerbaijan, possibly
      discussing a trans-Caspian gas pipeline to hookup to the planned pipeline links
      to Turkey that are to be built in the Zangezur corridor. In short, there is a
      LOT of activity behind the scenes. I had the pleasure of chatting with Garland
      Nixon and Rasheed Muhammad about current events, especially Trump’s self-inflicted

    paragraph_summary: A senior Iranian political figure has stated that Iran is reevaluating
      its approach to nuclear negotiations and will not engage in talks under the previous
      framework, particularly in response to U.S. requests for resumption. The official
      expressed skepticism about U.S. intentions, suggesting that Washington's goal
      is to disarm Iran to bolster Israel's position in potential conflicts. For Iran
      to consider new negotiations, it demands serious guarantees, including scrutiny
      of Israel's nuclear capabilities and accountability for its actions. The figure
      emphasized that without these conditions, negotiations would likely lead to war
      rather than peace. While Iran is open to dialogue, it requires evidence of genuine
      U.S. intentions for peace, complicating the prospect of future negotiations, especially
      given the influence of Trump’s Chief of Staff, who has ties to Israeli politics.

  - title: Genocide as “self-defense” – Western media as accomplices to the genocide
      in Gaza – We stand up!
    url: https://sonar21.com/genocide-as-self-defense-western-media-as-accomplices-to-the-genocide-in-gaza-we-stand-up/
    text: 'The current genocide is the culmination of a spiral of violence that has
      been going on since 1948 and has been covered up by the powerful in the West for
      generations. The media portray the genocide as self-defense – but they are nothing
      less than partners in crime. Introduction This article deals with a more than
      unsavory topic: a genocide that is committed in the open and not only promoted
      by most Western media, but justified in such a way that opponents of this genocide
      – be they Jews or non-Jews – are attacked, vilified and threatened in the most
      disgraceful manner. It is not only difficult, but downright dangerous to stand
      up to such a superior force. Nevertheless, we have decided to stand up. Imagine
      how you would like to answer the question of your grandchild sitting on your lap
      in 20 years’ time and asking, “Grandpa, what did you think about the time when
      babies were slaughtered in plain sight? – Why did everyone keep quiet? – Did you
      keep quiet too?” It all began with a mendacious fairy tale I was born in Zurich
      in 1964 and since my earliest childhood the following axiom has applied: “The
      Israelis are the good guys and the Palestinians are terrorists” . This was instilled
      in us by our parents and teachers and we saw ourselves happily confirmed when
      we were allowed on television to watch our Israeli heroes defeating the evil Arabs
      in all the wars. Good prevailed, we were on the right side of history and sang
      Hebrew songs in religious education lessons at a Protestant grammar school. “The
      Israelis are the good guys and the Palestinians are terrorists” I was completely
      unaware that this view of things had nothing to do with reality. My friends and
      acquaintances felt the same way – for decades. Skepticism – the stuff realities
      are made of When I traveled to Moscow for the first time in 1997, I was confronted
      with a character trait of Russians that is completely foreign to Westerners: skepticism.
      Russians have the characteristic – or rather: the ability – to take note of everything
      they are given in terms of information – be it by the media or the government
      – and instead of believing everything, they question everything. The discovery
      of skepticism shaped me and had a lasting impact on my thinking. Admittedly, questioning
      is much more strenuous than believing and since most people believe almost everything
      they are told by parents, teachers, pastors, politicians and the media, skeptics
      in the West find themselves in an almost fatal minority. What’s more, politicians
      and the media add a “democratic touch” to the discussion. They insinuate that
      the majority view is the right one. This is complete and utter nonsense, but many
      even believe in this fairy tale. In the last 30 years or so, I have had a lot
      of catching up to do. The internet helped me to do this, as it opens up sources
      that take control of the narrative away from those in power, although you have
      to be careful, as the internet is also full of lies. However, if you apply skepticism,
      the Internet opens up a universe where you can gather the facts. October 7, 2023
      – The Trigger for the “Final Solution” The Bloodbaths Series When Hamas attacked
      on October 7, 2023, and within hours there were reports of babies being beheaded
      and mass rapes committed by these monsters, we decided to wait: We are not a news
      outlet. We took this event as an opportunity to write a series about bloodbaths.
      “The powerful of this world are capable of using any means to achieve their goals
      – any!” Our aim was to show that bloodbaths – often caused by the “victims” themselves
      – are regularly used to justify further, even bloodier massacres in the form of
      wars. In passing, we realized that the US narrative on 9/11 could not possibly
      be true. The findings of this series can be summarized in one sentence: “The powerful
      of this world are capable of using any means to achieve their goals – any!” .
      This series is therefore a perfectly suitable introduction to an article about
      a genocide carried out in public, supported or even considered necessary by almost
      all Western mass media. Bloodbaths change the world – Part 1 Bloodbaths change

      2023 Israel – from victim to perpetrator to victim – a back and forth for 80 years
      (Series) Only in November did we take on Israel and publish a five-part series
      on the Israel complex between November 5, 2023 and December 29, 2023 as follows:
      In Part 1 (1914-1948) of our series on the history of Israel, we shed light on
      the period leading up to the founding of the state. A phase of illegal and legal
      land seizure, as a result of which the State of Israel was proclaimed unilaterally,
      in contradiction to UN Resolution 181 and against the will of the Arab states.
      The result was war from day one. Part 2 (1948-1956) ended with the Suez Crisis.
      As a result of this second war, Great Britain lost its dominant position in the
      Middle East. Since then, Israel has aligned itself with the US on all issues.
      Another result was the stationing of UN troops on the border between Israel and
      Egypt. In addition to the 6-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, Part 3 (1956-1973)
      dealt with a topic that receives little geopolitical attention when it comes to
      Israel – Israel’s water strategy. This is surprising, to say the least, as Israel
      is also extremely consistent in its approach to this issue, regardless of the
      interests of its neighboring states. Part 4 shed light on the 1982 Lebanon War,
      a war that Israel waged outside its territory with the aim of destroying the Palestinian
      PLO. A Palestinian liberation organization whose armed arm had been expelled from
      the West Bank to Jordan by Israel in the preceding Yom Kippur War and then to
      Lebanon by the Jordanian state after the attempted violent enforcement of political
      demands in Jordan. Part 5 covers the period from 1993 to the present. We looked
      at the Oslo Accords of that year, as a result of which the PLO disappeared into
      insignificance and Hamas became increasingly important for the Palestinians. Cover
      picture of our series “Israel – from victim to perpetrator to victim – a back
      and forth for 80 years” – November 5 to December 29, 2023 Dealing with the history
      of Israel and the massacres was an eye-opening experience not only for our readers,
      but also for myself. Nevertheless, it was clear to me that it would not be easy
      to change the way the average person sees the world, which I had also been fed
      for decades by various agitators and in a wide variety of ways, because most people
      are not skeptics and simply cannot muster the 200 hours or so it takes to expose
      the fairy tale as a nightmare; why should they, when the fairy tale feels so much
      more comfortable and does not rob you of your sleep. Facts and Terminology A genocide
      is Being Purchased We are touching a hot iron here and even the disclosure of
      the facts means nothing less than a frontal attack against a group that is so
      rich and powerful that they can (co-) determine presidential elections (Miriam
      Adelson) and manage not only to commit genocide against women and children in
      public, but also to present themselves as the victims and get the media to report
      positively on this monstrous behavior. This is the first time in human history
      that a genocide has been called a war. In this extensive article, we only formulate
      our opinions after we have laid a foundation of facts that cannot be undermined
      even with all the money in the world. Miriam Adelson poured 100 million US dollars
      into Donald Trump’s coffers. The price: standing in front of three flags – two
      Israeli and one American – an indication of whose interests American policy is
      aligned with? Source: The Times of Israel Zionism is not a religion, but a movement
      that resorts to criminal means Zionism and Judaism must be differentiated. Zionism
      is a movement , not a religion. Its goal is, in a first step, the establishment,
      justification and preservation of a Jewish nation state in Palestine and, in a
      second step, the establishment of Greater Israel. Zionism therefore pursues political
      and not religious goals. This differentiation is essential and is deliberately
      concealed by Zionists, Western politicians and the media. The Zionists deliberately
      mix up the terms “Zionism” and “Judaism” and use Judaism as a shield for their
      political intentions, which they realize by criminal means. As soon as criticism
      of the criminal actions of the Zionists arises, their critics are labeled as anti-Semites,
      not only by the Zionists, but by practically all Western politicians and media.
      As a footnote: Semites are not only the Jews, but a whole group of peoples, including
      the Arabs, the Ethiopians, the Eritreans, the Maltese, the Assyrians and many
      more. So an anti-Semite hates not only the Jews, but all these peoples. Another
      indication of how carelessly language and the meaning of terms are handled. Non-Jewish
      Zionists Control American Politics There are many Zionists who are not Jewish.
      There are no figures, but estimates are passed around that say that 50% of all
      Zionists are not Jewish. The Zionists will of course dismiss this as a conspiracy
      theory. So let’s take a look at where money and power meet in the United States,
      in the current US government. In addition to the well-known large donation from
      Adelson to Trump, entire hordes of American politicians are bought in bulk , thus
      speaking and voting in the interests of Israel. In the current 119th US Congress
      (532 members), only 32 Jews are represented (6%), yet the American Congress, which
      consists of 87% Christians, has been voting staunchly Zionist since 1948 (figures:
      Pew Research ). To achieve a majority in Congress requires 50% plus 1 vote (266+1);
      thus at least 235 non-Jews together with 32 Jews determine the Zionist policy
      of the United States, which brings the non-Jewish share of Zionists in the US
      Congress to a whopping 88%. Zionism: Profitable for American Zionist Politicians
      These members can be described as Christian Zionists, e.g. Lindsey Graham, Ted
      Cruz, Marco Rubio, Mike Johnson, Mike Huckabee and many more. The American Israel
      Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) plays an important role in promoting bipartisan
      support. AIPAC is the only foreign-controlled lobbying organization in the US
      that does not have to comply with the foreign agent act . Politicians such as
      Graham, Rubio and Johnson have received sizable campaign contributions from pro-Israel
      donors (AIPAC), averaging $125,000 for pro-Israel lawmakers compared to $18,000
      for those more supportive of Palestine. The Gaza genocide is thus very profitable
      for their political supporters in the US. On the numbers: The Guardian . Goal
      of the Zionists: Greater Israel From Conspiracy Theory to Fact The goal of the
      Zionists is much grander than the present Israel. The goal is the creation of
      Greater Israel. Until recently, anyone who spoke of this project was dismissed
      as a conspiracy theorist. Today, however, the Zionists speak openly about their
      plans. For example, Bezalel Smotrich , the Israeli finance minister in October
      2024: Bezalel Smotrich – Source: Times of Israel “I want a Jewish state that includes
      Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.” Bezalel Smotrich Now at
      least the cat is out of the bag. There are countless different maps, which show
      different variants, but basically the map shows the following picture: The following
      countries should therefore dress warmly: Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria
      and Lebanon. The Israeli slogan “ From the River to the Sea ” is a deliberate
      concealment of the actual goal: for years it was insinuated that the Israelis’
      territorial claims would extend from the Jordan (‘river’) to the Mediterranean
      (“sea”): However, they extend from the Nile to the Euphrates. Cyprus in danger?
      There are other maps circulating on the internet that depict the Greater Israel
      to be established on an even larger scale, such as a map published by the Turkish
      news agency on October 10, 2024. Quelle: Sigmalive.com On this map, Greater Israel
      also includes parts of Turkey and Cyprus. I am publishing this map for one reason:
      for some time now, large areas of Cyprus have been bought by Israelis – they want
      a new, second Israel. The same thing happened in Palestine before the state of
      Israel was founded. Cypriot citizens and politicians are therefore not worried
      for no reason. As early as the late 19th century, Cyprus was suggested as a possible
      temporary solution for the settlement of Jewish refugees – as a stepping stone
      to Israel. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Iran war, thousands of Israelis have
      flocked to Cyprus despite the travel ban. On X you can find countless warnings
      from Palestinians to the Cypriot population, such as this one: new promised land
      unlocked Poor Cyprus pic.twitter.com/uNVI7jljhH — Abier (@abierkhatib) June 21,
      2025 Criticism of the colonization of Cyprus is naturally dismissed by the Israelis
      as anti-Semitism. As a Cypriot, I would be worried. The Genocide in Words and
      Images For many people, the crimes are not even visually present. What you can’t
      see doesn’t exist. However, the evidence is easy to find, especially on X, but
      not in the traditional media. I spent two days looking at atrocities in the course
      of my research. The price was more than a week of sleepless nights. It is not
      my aim to give our readers sleepless nights, but to give them the energy and the
      arguments to stand up. That is why we are showing footage here, which should be
      evidence enough to prove the genocide without causing insomnia. It is very well
      possible that some of the material presented here will not longer be available
      at the time of your reading since it does not show a world, which governments
      want you to see. In such a case, the links will not work anymore. Complete Destruction

      — JonnyUtd (@Fx1Jonny) June 29, 2025 Many Jews Oppose Zionism and Israel Media
      Accuse Every Critic of Genocide of Anti-Semitism Hand in hand with the justification
      of the genocide committed in public, the Western media are fighting tooth and
      nail to prevent their mendacious conflation of Zionism and Judaism from being
      exposed. This is the case when Jews themselves point out these lies – and this
      is exactly what is happening now. If you search for “Rabbis against Genocide ”
      or “Rabbis against Zionism” on X,you will find what you are looking for. The big
      media are losing control of their mendacious narrative. It should come as no surprise
      that the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) – one of the most influential promoters of
      genocide in the German-speaking world – accuses Grok , the AI tool of Elon Musk’s
      X, of anti-Semitism: “ Elon Musk’s chatbot makes anti-Semitic remarks ”. The media’s
      fear of losing their “anti-Semitism narrative” is understandable, because if this
      narrative falls, they will see the world for what they are: Genocidal psychopaths.
      Representative of the countless sources on the internet, we present two statements,
      one from an orthodox rabbi and one from a famous Israeli journalist. Rabbi Goldberg,
      Short and to the Point Rabbi Goldberger: “Israel does not represent the Jewish
      people. Judaism is a faith, not a flag, not a government, not a nation state.

      make Israel the country of all Jews of all nationalities. Combining Judaism and
      Zionism is the key in creating more antisemitism.” Rabbi Goldberger – 8 July 2025

      June 20, 2025 Thousands of Jews, whether orthodox or not, are resisting Israel’s
      policies and making clear statements against Zionism. They are hardly heard –
      except on X – and I don’t even want to imagine the danger these courageous people
      put themselves in – they have my greatest admiration. I have no idea how many
      Jews disagree with Israel’s disgusting policies and are condemned to silence because
      of the prevalent social structure. Why were the Nazi Butchers Hated – Because
      they were Christians? It is a fact that the Nazis and their helpers slaughtered
      six million Jews and over 15 million Soviet civilians. Is it legitimate to hate
      these psychopaths? – I believe so. “The biggest lie of this genocide: that opponents
      of the genocide are anti-Semites.” Do you hate these criminals because they were
      genocidal Nazis or for their religion? One can assume that practically 100% of
      the perpetrators were Christians. I have never heard of Christians being hated
      as a result of the Holocaust. So why should we hate the Jews when Zionist Israelis
      slaughter Palestinians just because many of the perpetrators are Jews? Once you
      realize this logic, you remove the narrative from the psychopaths – perpetrators
      and defenders of these crimes – that critics of genocide are anti-Semites. An
      Oppressive State – led by Psychopaths – Supported by its own People Israel was
      proclaimed unilaterally in violation of the famous UN Resolution 181 , which called
      for a two-state solution. The State of Israel is therefore an entity without a
      legal basis and thus has no “ legal basis for existence” but merely a “right to
      exist”, which was brought about by the majority of UN members under considerable
      pressure from the US and Great Britain. One would therefore think that a state
      that stands on such shaky legal foundations would make all the more effort to
      respect the rights of its inhabitants and neighbors. However, the realities prove
      the opposite. Since 1948, the state of Israel has increasingly behaved like Nazi
      Germany. It has been systematically decimating and eliminating the Arab population
      for almost 80 years, leading an apartheid regime and seems to have taken October
      7, 2023 as an opportunity to initiate the “final solution” to the Palestinian
      problem. Never before in the history of mankind has a people behaved so appallingly
      in public and at the same time had the chutzpah to portray itself as a victim
      and present its genocidal behavior as a “right to self-defense”. For the exact
      factual basis of the statements made here, I refer you to our Israel series .
      Golda Meir – Israeli Prime Minister 1969-1974 – looked more grandmotherly than
      she was. “We will never forgive the Arabs for forcing us to kill their children.”
      Golda Meir The Western Media as Complicit in Genocide Accomplices are punished
      like the main offenders It is obvious that practically all commercially run media
      in the West twist concepts in the worst possible way, rape history and, as paid
      henchmen, not only promote genocide, but contribute to the genocide, which they
      make accomplices. Criminal law distinguishes between aiding and abetting and co-perpetration,
      whereby the contribution to the offence is subordinate in the case of aiding and
      abetting, but must be causal to the realization of the offence in the case of
      co-perpetration. This contribution does not require equivalence, but relevance
      in the commission of the offense. If the media reported objectively and factually
      correctly, this reporting would make the genocide impossible, as the populations
      of the world would force their governments to break off all contact with Israel
      and thus Israel would be unable to commit these crimes due to a lack of weapons
      and money. The Western media are therefore guilty of complicity. Accomplices are
      punished in the same way as the main perpetrators. There is no mitigation of punishment
      due to this form of participation, as genocide can only be carried out with the
      participation of the media. Nuremberg precedent: Julius Streicher This view is
      by no means far-fetched. The editor-in-chief of the National Socialist diatribe
      “Der Stürmer”, Julius Streicher, was hanged with other major war criminals in
      Nuremberg in 1946. The ladies and gentlemen of the media concerned should do some
      soul-searching. Writing can be dangerous – Julius Streicher at the end of his
      career – October 16, 1946 – Source: Getty Images In the following, we analyze
      the practices and statements of two media companies from German-speaking countries,
      representative of almost all media companies in the West, although, in contrast
      to Europe, critical voices are becoming louder in the US. ARD, the first German
      state television channel, should actually know better after the German crimes
      a few decades ago, but today it stands out for its downright diabolical behavior.
      We also mention the Swiss weekly Weltwoche, as it likes to present itself as a
      Robin Hood-like savior of the truth and completely fails in the biggest crime
      of the still young 21st century, betraying not only the victims of the genocide
      but also its readership. German State Television on the Trail of Dr. Goebbels

      This document was intended for internal use and found its way into the public
      domain, probably through an employee who was disgusted by this Goebbelsian approach.
      This document gives the reader an insight into the perfidy with which the management
      of the first German television station filled its own employees with pseudo-scientific
      half-truths and made them justify a genocide. We reported on this in “ ARD glossary

      The Swiss weekly magazine Weltwoche, whose publisher and editor-in-chief likes
      to present himself as a critical intellectual and Robin Hood of truth who questions
      everything, does not question anything when it comes to genocide, but reliably
      promotes the Zionist line. In his daily show “Weltwoche Daily”, Roger Köppel said
      the following on December 6, 2024 (shortened quote – full-length video): “Amnesty
      International accuses Israel of genocide. For once, stop calling everything genocide.
      […] I know of one genocide or attempted genocide. That is the genocide of the
      Jews. […] Now I say something about the situation in Gaza. That is not genocide.
      If the Israelis want to commit genocide, they could have it easier. Then they
      would simply have to lay carpets of bombs over the Gaza Strip. […] The word “genocide”
      has become the weapon of these woke moralists, these crusaders, these woken –
      even right-wingers – who juggle it around and thus invalidate the meaning of the
      word. There are a lot of Palestinians in Jordan – they are not being murdered.”
      Roger Köppel – Publisher and Editor-in-Chief Weltwoche – Weltwoche Daily – December
      6, 2024 These statements do not meet minimum journalistic, human or intellectual
      requirements: Genocide is a crime and a glance at the UN website or the ICC’s
      deliberations would have been enough to subsume Israel’s actions under the criminal
      offense of genocide, even as a legal layman. You don’t have to be an intellectual
      to do this, you just need common sense and 10 minutes of your time. He also denies
      facts: He claims, for example, that Israel could “commit genocide” by laying carpets
      of bombs over Gaza. But that is exactly what Israel is doing . Why Köppel even
      bothers to deny the genocide he promotes is strange: In contrast to him, the Israelis
      do not deny the genocide at all, but believe they have a right to do so and naturally
      feel victimized by this “work” – see quote from Golda Meir. When he claims that
      there was only one genocide – the one committed by the Germans against the Jews
      – he is not only speaking like a typical Israeli, “we are the victims, the only
      victims!” (see Gideon Levy above), but he also snubs the people who had to endure
      the greatest genocide: in his Zionist fervor, the self-declared Russia expert
      has probably missed the fact that the Nazis slaughtered between 15.9 and 17.4
      million civilians in the Soviet Union. Köppel does not even mention the largest
      genocide in human history in terms of numbers. When Köppel states that there are
      a lot of Palestinians in Jordan, that are not being murdered, I do not know what
      to read into this statement: That the Palestinians should move out of their homeland,
      if they want to survive? Köppel goes on to justify the genocide by linking President
      Putin’s actions in Ukraine with those of Netanyahu in Gaza. He fails to mention
      that President Putin was not wanted by the ICC for genocide, but – together with
      Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights – for the alleged
      deportation of children to Russia. An accusation that has long since proven to
      be untenable and is no longer even claimed by the Ukrainians. He makes this cynical
      conflation against his better judgment, as Köppel conducted an interview with
      Ms. Lvova-Belova on precisely this topic in Moscow in May 2023. Weltwoche completely
      lost its moral compass a few days ago when it published the article “ The greatest
      enemies of the Jews are – Jews ” on July 4, 2025, in which it attacks those Jews
      who oppose the genocide. The author – one David Klein – calls Jews who oppose
      the genocide in Israel «Duldungsjude» (en. “ Jews of Toleration ”). The editors
      of Weltwoche were demonstrably aware that this article was of the worst possible
      nature, as the comment function was switched off for the first time on “Weltwoche
      Online”. This article was a service to the Zionists and not a contribution on
      which they wanted to hear the opinion of paying readers. As Weltwoche readers
      were unable to submit comments to Weltwoche, some readers sent comments to us
      and informed us that inquiries to the editors as to why the comment function had
      been switched off remained unanswered. Some readers compared the article to the
      “Stürmer”: “Duldungsjude”? – Inexcusable! How can a Family Man Justify Genocide
      of Children? As a father, I cannot comprehend condoning such an act under any
      circumstances. Obviously, people who endorse – or even carry out – genocide can
      activate a mechanism in their conscience that is able to distinguish between their
      own children and the children of “sub-humans”. There are certainly historical
      examples. Rudolf Höss shows himself in his villa in Auschwitz as a loving father
      of five children (1943) – Source: Geo-Wissen Why the Media Do This – Money Rules
      the World In the case of bought politicians in the US, the role of money is evident
      and provable with hard facts, see above. The “services” of politicians are bought
      in plain sight. The media in the West regularly talk about being independent.
      For me, the perverse reporting on the genocide is proof to the contrary: Most
      of the media are controlled by their advertisers and unknown backers. I cannot
      give you any information about the nature of this influence, because Forum Geopolitica
      does not accept advertising money . Otherwise we would not be able to do our work.
      However, true independence comes at a price. If you have to maintain villas and
      vacation homes, accumulate gigantic travel expenses, because luxury is the order
      of the day, as a publisher you should have private funds at your disposal that
      make such a lifestyle sustainable regardless of advertising income, otherwise
      you will degenerate into what you don’t want to degenerate into: a store-bought
      accomplice. Conclusion What conclusions should one come to after seeing so much
      evil, deceitfulness and bought people? – It would be dishonest and naive to choose
      words of reconciliation and hope that the guilty will change, because they will
      not. If one were to apply the standards of the statute of the Nuremberg Tribunal
      and its judgment of 1946, then the following institutions and their leading personnel
      would have to reckon with the maximum penalty. The main perpetrators are the Israeli
      government, the secret services and the military, those directly involved in the
      genocide. In addition to the politicians throughout the West, who made this bloodbath
      politically, economically and militarily feasible in the first place, the media
      should be emphasized as accomplices. Without their deliberately false, manipulating
      reporting, the populations of the West would never have been prepared to tolerate
      these crimes and thus support them. In contrast to the Holocaust, this genocide
      is being committed in public and supported and promoted by Western politicians
      and media. Western society is thus so degenerate that it will probably not be
      able to muster the energy for a cleansing process such as a tribunal. I simply
      deny states without any understanding of history, as well as the organizations
      and companies concerned, the moral right to exist. If humanity is unable to put
      a stop to such monstrous creatures and organizations, the question arises as to
      the viability of what we call civilization: Without a minimum level of humanity
      and justice, a social system cannot and should not survive. Civilization also
      means that those directly affected by genocide have the right to use any means
      to defend themselves against the perpetrators. It means no less that the media
      and their exponents who support genocide in whatever form should be banned through
      social ostracism. They should die alone, without ever being heard again, in the
      dungeon of loneliness. Peter Hanseler is a geopolitical analyst who reports from

    text: 'The current genocide is the culmination of a spiral of violence that has
      been going on since 1948 and has been covered up by the powerful in the West for
      generations. The media portray the genocide as self-defense – but they are nothing
      less than partners in crime. Introduction This article deals with a more than
      unsavory topic: a genocide that is committed in the open and not only promoted
      by most Western media, but justified in such a way that opponents of this genocide
      – be they Jews or non-Jews – are attacked, vilified and threatened in the most
      disgraceful manner. It is not only difficult, but downright dangerous to stand
      up to such a superior force. Nevertheless, we have decided to stand up. Imagine
      how you would like to answer the question of your grandchild sitting on your lap
      in 20 years’ time and asking, “Grandpa, what did you think about the time when
      babies were slaughtered in plain sight? – Why did everyone keep quiet? – Did you
      keep quiet too?” It all began with a mendacious fairy tale I was born in Zurich
      in 1964 and since my earliest childhood the following axiom has applied: “The
      Israelis are the good guys and the Palestinians are terrorists” . This was instilled
      in us by our parents and teachers and we saw ourselves happily confirmed when
      we were allowed on television to watch our Israeli heroes defeating the evil Arabs
      in all the wars. Good prevailed, we were on the right side of history and sang
      Hebrew songs in religious education lessons at a Protestant grammar school. “The
      Israelis are the good guys and the Palestinians are terrorists” I was completely
      unaware that this view of things had nothing to do with reality. My friends and
      acquaintances felt the same way – for decades. Skepticism – the stuff realities
      are made of When I traveled to Moscow for the first time in 1997, I was confronted
      with a character trait of Russians that is completely foreign to Westerners: skepticism.
      Russians have the characteristic – or rather: the ability – to take note of everything
      they are given in terms of information – be it by the media or the government
      – and instead of believing everything, they question everything. The discovery
      of skepticism shaped me and had a lasting impact on my thinking. Admittedly, questioning
      is much more strenuous than believing and since most people believe almost everything
      they are told by parents, teachers, pastors, politicians and the media, skeptics
      in the West find themselves in an almost fatal minority. What’s more, politicians
      and the media add a “democratic touch” to the discussion. They insinuate that
      the majority view is the right one. This is complete and utter nonsense, but many
      even believe in this fairy tale. In the last 30 years or so, I have had a lot
      of catching up to do. The internet helped me to do this, as it opens up sources
      that take control of the narrative away from those in power, although you have
      to be careful, as the internet is also full of lies. However, if you apply skepticism,
      the Internet opens up a universe where you can gather the facts. October 7, 2023
      – The Trigger for the “Final Solution” The Bloodbaths Series When Hamas attacked
      on October 7, 2023, and within hours there were reports of babies being beheaded
      and mass rapes committed by these monsters, we decided to wait: We are not a news
      outlet. We took this event as an opportunity to write a series about bloodbaths.
      “The powerful of this world are capable of using any means to achieve their goals
      – any!” Our aim was to show that bloodbaths – often caused by the “victims” themselves
      – are regularly used to justify further, even bloodier massacres in the form of
      wars. In passing, we realized that the US narrative on 9/11 could not possibly
      be true. The findings of this series can be summarized in one sentence: “The powerful
      of this world are capable of using any means to achieve their goals – any!” .
      This series is therefore a perfectly suitable introduction to an article about
      a genocide carried out in public, supported or even considered necessary by almost
      all Western mass media. Bloodbaths change the world – Part 1 Bloodbaths change

      2023 Israel – from victim to perpetrator to victim – a back and forth for 80 years
      (Series) Only in November did we take on Israel and publish a five-part series
      on the Israel complex between November 5, 2023 and December 29, 2023 as follows:
      In Part 1 (1914-1948) of our series on the history of Israel, we shed light on
      the period leading up to the founding of the state. A phase of illegal and legal
      land seizure, as a result of which the State of Israel was proclaimed unilaterally,
      in contradiction to UN Resolution 181 and against the will of the Arab states.
      The result was war from day one. Part 2 (1948-1956) ended with the Suez Crisis.
      As a result of this second war, Great Britain lost its dominant position in the
      Middle East. Since then, Israel has aligned itself with the US on all issues.
      Another result was the stationing of UN troops on the border between Israel and
      Egypt. In addition to the 6-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, Part 3 (1956-1973)
      dealt with a topic that receives little geopolitical attention when it comes to
      Israel – Israel’s water strategy. This is surprising, to say the least, as Israel
      is also extremely consistent in its approach to this issue, regardless of the
      interests of its neighboring states. Part 4 shed light on the 1982 Lebanon War,
      a war that Israel waged outside its territory with the aim of destroying the Palestinian
      PLO. A Palestinian liberation organization whose armed arm had been expelled from
      the West Bank to Jordan by Israel in the preceding Yom Kippur War and then to
      Lebanon by the Jordanian state after the attempted violent enforcement of political
      demands in Jordan. Part 5 covers the period from 1993 to the present. We looked
      at the Oslo Accords of that year, as a result of which the PLO disappeared into
      insignificance and Hamas became increasingly important for the Palestinians. Cover
      picture of our series “Israel – from victim to perpetrator to victim – a back
      and forth for 80 years” – November 5 to December 29, 2023 Dealing with the history
      of Israel and the massacres was an eye-opening experience not only for our readers,
      but also for myself. Nevertheless, it was clear to me that it would not be easy
      to change the way the average person sees the world, which I had also been fed
      for decades by various agitators and in a wide variety of ways, because most people
      are not skeptics and simply cannot muster the 200 hours or so it takes to expose
      the fairy tale as a nightmare; why should they, when the fairy tale feels so much
      more comfortable and does not rob you of your sleep. Facts and Terminology A genocide
      is Being Purchased We are touching a hot iron here and even the disclosure of
      the facts means nothing less than a frontal attack against a group that is so
      rich and powerful that they can (co-) determine presidential elections (Miriam
      Adelson) and manage not only to commit genocide against women and children in
      public, but also to present themselves as the victims and get the media to report
      positively on this monstrous behavior. This is the first time in human history
      that a genocide has been called a war. In this extensive article, we only formulate
      our opinions after we have laid a foundation of facts that cannot be undermined
      even with all the money in the world. Miriam Adelson poured 100 million US dollars
      into Donald Trump’s coffers. The price: standing in front of three flags – two
      Israeli and one American – an indication of whose interests American policy is
      aligned with? Source: The Times of Israel Zionism is not a religion, but a movement
      that resorts to criminal means Zionism and Judaism must be differentiated. Zionism
      is a movement , not a religion. Its goal is, in a first step, the establishment,
      justification and preservation of a Jewish nation state in Palestine and, in a
      second step, the establishment of Greater Israel. Zionism therefore pursues political
      and not religious goals. This differentiation is essential and is deliberately
      concealed by Zionists, Western politicians and the media. The Zionists deliberately
      mix up the terms “Zionism” and “Judaism” and use Judaism as a shield for their
      political intentions, which they realize by criminal means. As soon as criticism
      of the criminal actions of the Zionists arises, their critics are labeled as anti-Semites,
      not only by the Zionists, but by practically all Western politicians and media.
      As a footnote: Semites are not only the Jews, but a whole group of peoples, including
      the Arabs, the Ethiopians, the Eritreans, the Maltese, the Assyrians and many
      more. So an anti-Semite hates not only the Jews, but all these peoples. Another
      indication of how carelessly language and the meaning of terms are handled. Non-Jewish
      Zionists Control American Politics There are many Zionists who are not Jewish.
      There are no figures, but estimates are passed around that say that 50% of all
      Zionists are not Jewish. The Zionists will of course dismiss this as a conspiracy
      theory. So let’s take a look at where money and power meet in the United States,
      in the current US government. In addition to the well-known large donation from
      Adelson to Trump, entire hordes of American politicians are bought in bulk , thus
      speaking and voting in the interests of Israel. In the current 119th US Congress
      (532 members), only 32 Jews are represented (6%), yet the American Congress, which
      consists of 87% Christians, has been voting staunchly Zionist since 1948 (figures:
      Pew Research ). To achieve a majority in Congress requires 50% plus 1 vote (266+1);
      thus at least 235 non-Jews together with 32 Jews determine the Zionist policy
      of the United States, which brings the non-Jewish share of Zionists in the US
      Congress to a whopping 88%. Zionism: Profitable for American Zionist Politicians
      These members can be described as Christian Zionists, e.g. Lindsey Graham, Ted
      Cruz, Marco Rubio, Mike Johnson, Mike Huckabee and many more. The American Israel
      Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) plays an important role in promoting bipartisan
      support. AIPAC is the only foreign-controlled lobbying organization in the US
      that does not have to comply with the foreign agent act . Politicians such as
      Graham, Rubio and Johnson have received sizable campaign contributions from pro-Israel
      donors (AIPAC), averaging $125,000 for pro-Israel lawmakers compared to $18,000
      for those more supportive of Palestine. The Gaza genocide is thus very profitable
      for their political supporters in the US. On the numbers: The Guardian . Goal
      of the Zionists: Greater Israel From Conspiracy Theory to Fact The goal of the
      Zionists is much grander than the present Israel. The goal is the creation of
      Greater Israel. Until recently, anyone who spoke of this project was dismissed
      as a conspiracy theorist. Today, however, the Zionists speak openly about their
      plans. For example, Bezalel Smotrich , the Israeli finance minister in October
      2024: Bezalel Smotrich – Source: Times of Israel “I want a Jewish state that includes
      Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.” Bezalel Smotrich Now at
      least the cat is out of the bag. There are countless different maps, which show
      different variants, but basically the map shows the following picture: The following
      countries should therefore dress warmly: Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria
      and Lebanon. The Israeli slogan “ From the River to the Sea ” is a deliberate
      concealment of the actual goal: for years it was insinuated that the Israelis’
      territorial claims would extend from the Jordan (‘river’) to the Mediterranean
      (“sea”): However, they extend from the Nile to the Euphrates. Cyprus in danger?
      There are other maps circulating on the internet that depict the Greater Israel
      to be established on an even larger scale, such as a map published by the Turkish
      news agency on October 10, 2024. Quelle: Sigmalive.com On this map, Greater Israel
      also includes parts of Turkey and Cyprus. I am publishing this map for one reason:
      for some time now, large areas of Cyprus have been bought by Israelis – they want
      a new, second Israel. The same thing happened in Palestine before the state of
      Israel was founded. Cypriot citizens and politicians are therefore not worried
      for no reason. As early as the late 19th century, Cyprus was suggested as a possible
      temporary solution for the settlement of Jewish refugees – as a stepping stone
      to Israel. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Iran war, thousands of Israelis have
      flocked to Cyprus despite the travel ban. On X you can find countless warnings
      from Palestinians to the Cypriot population, such as this one: new promised land
      unlocked Poor Cyprus pic.twitter.com/uNVI7jljhH — Abier (@abierkhatib) June 21,
      2025 Criticism of the colonization of Cyprus is naturally dismissed by the Israelis
      as anti-Semitism. As a Cypriot, I would be worried. The Genocide in Words and
      Images For many people, the crimes are not even visually present. What you can’t
      see doesn’t exist. However, the evidence is easy to find, especially on X, but
      not in the traditional media. I spent two days looking at atrocities in the course
      of my research. The price was more than a week of sleepless nights. It is not
      my aim to give our readers sleepless nights, but to give them the energy and the
      arguments to stand up. That is why we are showing footage here, which should be
      evidence enough to prove the genocide without causing insomnia. It is very well
      possible that some of the material presented here will not longer be available
      at the time of your reading since it does not show a world, which governments
      want you to see. In such a case, the links will not work anymore. Complete Destruction

      is exactly what is happening now. If you search for “Rabbis against Genocide ”
      or “Rabbis against Zionism” on X,you will find what you are looking for. The big
      media are losing control of their mendacious narrative. It should come as no surprise
      that the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) – one of the most influential promoters of
      genocide in the German-speaking world – accuses Grok , the AI tool of Elon Musk’s
      X, of anti-Semitism: “ Elon Musk’s chatbot makes anti-Semitic remarks ”. The media’s
      fear of losing their “anti-Semitism narrative” is understandable, because if this
      narrative falls, they will see the world for what they are: Genocidal psychopaths.
      Representative of the countless sources on the internet, we present two statements,
      one from an orthodox rabbi and one from a famous Israeli journalist. Rabbi Goldberg,
      Short and to the Point Rabbi Goldberger: “Israel does not represent the Jewish
      people. Judaism is a faith, not a flag, not a government, not a nation state.

      July 8, 2025 “Israel is not a Jewish state. You can’t just take an ancient religious,
      collective, and transform it into a nationality because it convenient for the
      Zionists. Yes, Jews live in Israel, and we pray for their safety, but that doesn’t
      make Israel the country of all Jews of all nationalities. Combining Judaism and
      Zionism is the key in creating more antisemitism.” Rabbi Goldberger – 8 July 2025

      June 20, 2025 Thousands of Jews, whether orthodox or not, are resisting Israel’s
      policies and making clear statements against Zionism. They are hardly heard –
      except on X – and I don’t even want to imagine the danger these courageous people
      put themselves in – they have my greatest admiration. I have no idea how many
      Jews disagree with Israel’s disgusting policies and are condemned to silence because
      of the prevalent social structure. Why were the Nazi Butchers Hated – Because
      they were Christians? It is a fact that the Nazis and their helpers slaughtered
      six million Jews and over 15 million Soviet civilians. Is it legitimate to hate
      these psychopaths? – I believe so. “The biggest lie of this genocide: that opponents
      of the genocide are anti-Semites.” Do you hate these criminals because they were
      genocidal Nazis or for their religion? One can assume that practically 100% of
      the perpetrators were Christians. I have never heard of Christians being hated
      as a result of the Holocaust. So why should we hate the Jews when Zionist Israelis
      slaughter Palestinians just because many of the perpetrators are Jews? Once you
      realize this logic, you remove the narrative from the psychopaths – perpetrators
      and defenders of these crimes – that critics of genocide are anti-Semites. An
      Oppressive State – led by Psychopaths – Supported by its own People Israel was
      proclaimed unilaterally in violation of the famous UN Resolution 181 , which called
      for a two-state solution. The State of Israel is therefore an entity without a
      legal basis and thus has no “ legal basis for existence” but merely a “right to
      exist”, which was brought about by the majority of UN members under considerable
      pressure from the US and Great Britain. One would therefore think that a state
      that stands on such shaky legal foundations would make all the more effort to
      respect the rights of its inhabitants and neighbors. However, the realities prove
      the opposite. Since 1948, the state of Israel has increasingly behaved like Nazi
      Germany. It has been systematically decimating and eliminating the Arab population
      for almost 80 years, leading an apartheid regime and seems to have taken October
      7, 2023 as an opportunity to initiate the “final solution” to the Palestinian
      problem. Never before in the history of mankind has a people behaved so appallingly
      in public and at the same time had the chutzpah to portray itself as a victim
      and present its genocidal behavior as a “right to self-defense”. For the exact
      factual basis of the statements made here, I refer you to our Israel series .
      Golda Meir – Israeli Prime Minister 1969-1974 – looked more grandmotherly than
      she was. “We will never forgive the Arabs for forcing us to kill their children.”
      Golda Meir The Western Media as Complicit in Genocide Accomplices are punished
      like the main offenders It is obvious that practically all commercially run media
      in the West twist concepts in the worst possible way, rape history and, as paid
      henchmen, not only promote genocide, but contribute to the genocide, which they
      make accomplices. Criminal law distinguishes between aiding and abetting and co-perpetration,
      whereby the contribution to the offence is subordinate in the case of aiding and
      abetting, but must be causal to the realization of the offence in the case of
      co-perpetration. This contribution does not require equivalence, but relevance
      in the commission of the offense. If the media reported objectively and factually
      correctly, this reporting would make the genocide impossible, as the populations
      of the world would force their governments to break off all contact with Israel
      and thus Israel would be unable to commit these crimes due to a lack of weapons
      and money. The Western media are therefore guilty of complicity. Accomplices are
      punished in the same way as the main perpetrators. There is no mitigation of punishment
      due to this form of participation, as genocide can only be carried out with the
      participation of the media. Nuremberg precedent: Julius Streicher This view is
      by no means far-fetched. The editor-in-chief of the National Socialist diatribe
      “Der Stürmer”, Julius Streicher, was hanged with other major war criminals in
      Nuremberg in 1946. The ladies and gentlemen of the media concerned should do some
      soul-searching. Writing can be dangerous – Julius Streicher at the end of his
      career – October 16, 1946 – Source: Getty Images In the following, we analyze
      the practices and statements of two media companies from German-speaking countries,
      representative of almost all media companies in the West, although, in contrast
      to Europe, critical voices are becoming louder in the US. ARD, the first German
      state television channel, should actually know better after the German crimes
      a few decades ago, but today it stands out for its downright diabolical behavior.
      We also mention the Swiss weekly Weltwoche, as it likes to present itself as a
      Robin Hood-like savior of the truth and completely fails in the biggest crime
      of the still young 21st century, betraying not only the victims of the genocide
      but also its readership. German State Television on the Trail of Dr. Goebbels
      of All People 10 days after the start of the final solution to the Palestinian
      problem, the editor-in-chief of the First German Television (ARD), Oliver Köhr,
      distributed a glossary on reporting on the Middle East conflict among his staff.
      This document was intended for internal use and found its way into the public
      domain, probably through an employee who was disgusted by this Goebbelsian approach.
      This document gives the reader an insight into the perfidy with which the management
      of the first German television station filled its own employees with pseudo-scientific
      half-truths and made them justify a genocide. We reported on this in “ ARD glossary
      justifies genocide – Dr. Goebbels would be proud ”. Left: Family man Oliver Köhr
      – ARD editor-in-chief with a teddy bear look – Right: Slaughtered Palestinian
      Babies – Source: ForumGeopolitica.com Schweizerische Weltwoche is also a Collaborator
      The Swiss weekly magazine Weltwoche, whose publisher and editor-in-chief likes
      to present himself as a critical intellectual and Robin Hood of truth who questions
      everything, does not question anything when it comes to genocide, but reliably
      promotes the Zionist line. In his daily show “Weltwoche Daily”, Roger Köppel said
      the following on December 6, 2024 (shortened quote – full-length video): “Amnesty
      International accuses Israel of genocide. For once, stop calling everything genocide.
      […] I know of one genocide or attempted genocide. That is the genocide of the
      Jews. […] Now I say something about the situation in Gaza. That is not genocide.
      If the Israelis want to commit genocide, they could have it easier. Then they
      would simply have to lay carpets of bombs over the Gaza Strip. […] The word “genocide”
      has become the weapon of these woke moralists, these crusaders, these woken –
      even right-wingers – who juggle it around and thus invalidate the meaning of the
      word. There are a lot of Palestinians in Jordan – they are not being murdered.”
      Roger Köppel – Publisher and Editor-in-Chief Weltwoche – Weltwoche Daily – December
      6, 2024 These statements do not meet minimum journalistic, human or intellectual
      requirements: Genocide is a crime and a glance at the UN website or the ICC’s
      deliberations would have been enough to subsume Israel’s actions under the criminal
      offense of genocide, even as a legal layman. You don’t have to be an intellectual
      to do this, you just need common sense and 10 minutes of your time. He also denies
      facts: He claims, for example, that Israel could “commit genocide” by laying carpets
      of bombs over Gaza. But that is exactly what Israel is doing . Why Köppel even
      bothers to deny the genocide he promotes is strange: In contrast to him, the Israelis
      do not deny the genocide at all, but believe they have a right to do so and naturally
      feel victimized by this “work” – see quote from Golda Meir. When he claims that
      there was only one genocide – the one committed by the Germans against the Jews
      – he is not only speaking like a typical Israeli, “we are the victims, the only
      victims!” (see Gideon Levy above), but he also snubs the people who had to endure
      the greatest genocide: in his Zionist fervor, the self-declared Russia expert
      has probably missed the fact that the Nazis slaughtered between 15.9 and 17.4
      million civilians in the Soviet Union. Köppel does not even mention the largest
      genocide in human history in terms of numbers. When Köppel states that there are
      a lot of Palestinians in Jordan, that are not being murdered, I do not know what
      to read into this statement: That the Palestinians should move out of their homeland,
      if they want to survive? Köppel goes on to justify the genocide by linking President
      Putin’s actions in Ukraine with those of Netanyahu in Gaza. He fails to mention
      that President Putin was not wanted by the ICC for genocide, but – together with
      Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights – for the alleged
      deportation of children to Russia. An accusation that has long since proven to
      be untenable and is no longer even claimed by the Ukrainians. He makes this cynical
      conflation against his better judgment, as Köppel conducted an interview with
      Ms. Lvova-Belova on precisely this topic in Moscow in May 2023. Weltwoche completely
      lost its moral compass a few days ago when it published the article “ The greatest
      enemies of the Jews are – Jews ” on July 4, 2025, in which it attacks those Jews
      who oppose the genocide. The author – one David Klein – calls Jews who oppose
      the genocide in Israel «Duldungsjude» (en. “ Jews of Toleration ”). The editors
      of Weltwoche were demonstrably aware that this article was of the worst possible
      nature, as the comment function was switched off for the first time on “Weltwoche
      Online”. This article was a service to the Zionists and not a contribution on
      which they wanted to hear the opinion of paying readers. As Weltwoche readers
      were unable to submit comments to Weltwoche, some readers sent comments to us
      and informed us that inquiries to the editors as to why the comment function had
      been switched off remained unanswered. Some readers compared the article to the
      “Stürmer”: “Duldungsjude”? – Inexcusable! How can a Family Man Justify Genocide
      of Children? As a father, I cannot comprehend condoning such an act under any
      circumstances. Obviously, people who endorse – or even carry out – genocide can
      activate a mechanism in their conscience that is able to distinguish between their
      own children and the children of “sub-humans”. There are certainly historical
      examples. Rudolf Höss shows himself in his villa in Auschwitz as a loving father
      of five children (1943) – Source: Geo-Wissen Why the Media Do This – Money Rules
      the World In the case of bought politicians in the US, the role of money is evident
      and provable with hard facts, see above. The “services” of politicians are bought
      in plain sight. The media in the West regularly talk about being independent.
      For me, the perverse reporting on the genocide is proof to the contrary: Most
      of the media are controlled by their advertisers and unknown backers. I cannot
      give you any information about the nature of this influence, because Forum Geopolitica
      does not accept advertising money . Otherwise we would not be able to do our work.
      However, true independence comes at a price. If you have to maintain villas and
      vacation homes, accumulate gigantic travel expenses, because luxury is the order
      of the day, as a publisher you should have private funds at your disposal that
      make such a lifestyle sustainable regardless of advertising income, otherwise
      you will degenerate into what you don’t want to degenerate into: a store-bought
      accomplice. Conclusion What conclusions should one come to after seeing so much
      evil, deceitfulness and bought people? – It would be dishonest and naive to choose
      words of reconciliation and hope that the guilty will change, because they will
      not. If one were to apply the standards of the statute of the Nuremberg Tribunal
      and its judgment of 1946, then the following institutions and their leading personnel
      would have to reckon with the maximum penalty. The main perpetrators are the Israeli
      government, the secret services and the military, those directly involved in the
      genocide. In addition to the politicians throughout the West, who made this bloodbath
      politically, economically and militarily feasible in the first place, the media
      should be emphasized as accomplices. Without their deliberately false, manipulating
      reporting, the populations of the West would never have been prepared to tolerate
      these crimes and thus support them. In contrast to the Holocaust, this genocide
      is being committed in public and supported and promoted by Western politicians
      and media. Western society is thus so degenerate that it will probably not be
      able to muster the energy for a cleansing process such as a tribunal. I simply
      deny states without any understanding of history, as well as the organizations
      and companies concerned, the moral right to exist. If humanity is unable to put
      a stop to such monstrous creatures and organizations, the question arises as to
      the viability of what we call civilization: Without a minimum level of humanity
      and justice, a social system cannot and should not survive. Civilization also
      means that those directly affected by genocide have the right to use any means
      to defend themselves against the perpetrators. It means no less that the media
      and their exponents who support genocide in whatever form should be banned through
      social ostracism. They should die alone, without ever being heard again, in the
      dungeon of loneliness. Peter Hanseler is a geopolitical analyst who reports from
      Moscow. Peter was born in Zurich, Switzerland. He holds a J.D. (lic. iur.) and
      Ph.D. (Dr. iur.) from Zurich University Law School and Master in International

    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the ongoing genocide, rooted in a
      long history of violence since 1948, is being obscured and justified by Western
      media, which portrays it as self-defense while vilifying those who oppose it.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the ongoing genocide that has been occurring
      since 1948, which it claims has been obscured by Western powers and media, framing
      the violence as self-defense while vilifying those who oppose it. The author reflects
      on their upbringing, which instilled a narrative of Israelis as heroes and Palestinians
      as terrorists, highlighting a long-standing bias that distorts reality. The piece
      emphasizes the moral imperative to confront this injustice, questioning the complicity
      of those who remain silent in the face of atrocities and urging a reevaluation
      of the dominant narratives surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

      telling people, “ Nothing to see here, move along .” A large segment of Trump’s
      base ain’t moving… they are digging in and demanding answers. I want to clarify
      an important point about my recent article on this topic — The Epstein Client
      List — Why is Trump Breaking His Promise to Publish? Pam Bondi is technically
      correct, i.e., the US Government (USG) does not have a list of Jeffrey Epstein’s
      clients. What the USG has in its possession is a mountain of evidence, including
      eyewitness testimony from underage girls and members of Epstein’s staff, that
      should have been subjected to a criminal investigation. What does that mean? It
      means creating a list of the prominent men and women named by those witnesses
      and then collecting evidence such as travel logs, phone records, emails, social
      media posts, and bank transactions. The claims by the victims are allegations
      that must be proven with corroborating data. But we already have plenty of legally
      validated evidence that Epstein was engaged in a human trafficking scheme that
      involved powerful, wealthy, politically connected men. Ever heard of JPMorgan
      Chase bank? JPMorgan Chase served as Jeffrey Epstein’s primary bank for 15 years,
      from 1998 to 2013, during which period it processed financial transactions Epstein
      and his associates used to facilitate and conceal his sex trafficking enterprise.
      Lawsuits and government investigations found that the bank failed to act on multiple
      red flags and continued to provide Epstein financial services even after serious
      allegations against him became public. Key findings and outcomes include: • Facilitation
      and Red Flags: The US Virgin Islands and Epstein’s victims alleged JPMorgan Chase
      enabled Epstein’s trafficking by allowing routine large cash withdrawals and failing
      to flag him as a high-risk client, even while internal concerns were raised. According
      to court documents and internal emails, JPMorgan’s internal monitors filed multiple
      suspicious activity reports related to Epstein as early as 2002, indicating awareness
      or suspicion of criminal activity before public allegations surfaced. • Delayed
      Reporting: Despite monitoring suspicious transactions over many years, JPMorgan
      Chase only reported more than $1 billion in “suspicious” transactions connected
      to Epstein to the U.S. Treasury Department after his arrest and death in 2019.
      Settlements: • In June 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to Epstein’s
      victims in a class-action lawsuit that alleged JPMorgan “knowingly benefited from
      participating in a sex-trafficking venture” and obstructed enforcement of anti-trafficking
      laws. • In September 2023, the bank settled for $75 million with the US Virgin
      Islands to resolve claims it enabled Epstein’s sex crimes, with the majority of
      funds designated for local charities and victim support. • JPMorgan also reached
      a confidential legal settlement with Jes Staley, its former executive alleged
      to have been complicit in maintaining Epstein as a client. And Trump thinks this

      outrage among his supporters, particularly the under-30 demographic, by making
      controversial comparisons between the Jeffrey Epstein case and Hunter Biden's
      laptop, which he falsely labeled a hoax. The article criticizes Trump's crisis
      management approach, suggesting he is exacerbating his political troubles rather
      than addressing them. It emphasizes that while the U.S. government may not have
      a formal list of Epstein's clients, there is substantial evidence, including eyewitness
      testimony, that warrants a thorough investigation into the allegations against
      Epstein and his associates. The author argues that Trump's dismissive attitude
      is alienating a significant portion of his base, who are now demanding accountability
      and answers.

    one_sentence_summary: Trump's recent post on Truth Social has sparked outrage among
      his former supporters, particularly the younger demographic, as he continues to
      mishandle a crisis and make misleading comparisons, ultimately deepening his political
      troubles.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent post on Truth Social, former President Trump sparked
      outrage among his supporters, particularly the under-30 demographic, by making
      controversial comparisons between the Jeffrey Epstein case and Hunter Biden's
      laptop, which he falsely labeled a hoax. The article criticizes Trump's crisis
      management approach, suggesting he is exacerbating his political troubles rather
      than addressing them. It emphasizes that while the U.S. government may not have
      a formal list of Epstein's clients, there is substantial evidence, including eyewitness
      testimony, that warrants a thorough investigation into the allegations against
      Epstein and his associates. The author argues that Trump's dismissive attitude
      is alienating a significant portion of his base, who are now demanding accountability
      and answers.

      by Ukrainian authorities in May 2025 on suspicion of fraud and forgery linked

      for these loans. Prosecutors allege that GNT, under Naumenko’s leadership, misrepresented
      grain stocks and participated in a scheme that involved simulating the destruction
      of non-existent or unavailable collateral, especially during the chaos following
      the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I guess he forgot to grease Zelensky’s

      were sentenced to 21 months in prison by an English High Court judge for violating
      a Worldwide Freezing Order meant to protect the creditors’ interests. Subsequent

    url: https://sonar21.com/the-ambition-that-kills-a-call-for-ethical-leadership/
    text: '“They burn in fire to attain, To build empires based on pain, On ashes climb
      to reach for skies, While blinded by the gleam of lies. With hands of iron, hearts
      of stone, They climb their thrones, yet stand alone, Corrupting worlds with restless
      might, To lose the day, and fear the night.” “Awaken” – The Frontier Man The Moral
      Crisis of Leadership Throughout history, the health of democracies has hinged
      not merely on their laws or institutions, but on the moral character of the leaders
      entrusted with power. The rise and fall of governments, the flourishing or decay
      of civilizations, and the liberty or subjugation of citizens often trace back
      to the moral character of those at the helm. In our present age—fraught with crises
      of trust, integrity, and democratic erosion—it is imperative for us to reconsider
      not only whom we elect, but the character and motivations behind their pursuit
      of power. This essay argues that we must reject and vote out politicians driven
      by career ambition, lust for wealth, and/or hunger for power. Instead, we must
      elect leaders who are honest, intelligent, ethical, have track records of outstanding
      public service, and pursue public office not as a ladder to personal gain, but
      as a platform to serve their fellow citizens. History offers us powerful testimony:
      societies thrive under servant-leaders, and crumble under self-serving, corrupt
      elites. Personal ambition at any cost not only kills democracy but also often
      literally kills people who are sent to die in endless, unnecessary wars of aggression
      driven by the egos of corrupt leaders. When Ambition Kills: Lessons from History
      Ambition, in isolation, is not inherently evil. It has spurred explorers across
      oceans, scientists toward discoveries, and artists to greatness. But when personal
      ambition, untethered from virtue, ethics, and duty, dominates the souls of leaders,
      nations stand at great risk. Among history’s most vivid examples of ambition’s
      perils stands Napoleon Bonaparte . Hailed at first as a defender of liberty, he
      soon crowned himself Emperor of the French, betraying the very ideals that elevated
      him. His wars—spanning from Italy to Russia—left millions dead, cities in ruins,
      and a continent reeling. Napoleon’s fall at Waterloo was not just military defeat;
      it was the collapse of a regime built on ego, not ethics. His story is a cautionary
      tale: how a republic, birthed in revolution, can be crushed by the ambitions of
      a single man. Adolf Hitler best represents ambition without any moral anchor.
      Rising amid Germany’s despair, he promised revival but delivered tyranny, death,
      and destruction. Cloaking power in populism, he dismantled the Weimar Republic
      with chilling efficiency—via law, propaganda, and fear. His wars of conquest and
      genocide were obsessions fueled by racial hatred and imperial delusions. By the
      time he fell, tens of millions were dead, and the world had seen the abyss. These
      examples echo a timeless truth: ambition without virtue does not elevate—it annihilates
      . The Power of the Servant-Leader In contrast to the ambitious politician stands
      the servant-leader —those who enter politics not to be someone , but to do something
      . These are individuals for whom public service is not a means to personal gain,
      but a moral obligation rooted in humility, service, and justice. American history
      has some outstanding examples of such principled public servants. Abraham Lincoln
      A self-educated lawyer from humble beginnings, Lincoln did not seek power for
      its own sake, but was summoned by the moment to preserve a fractured union and
      confront the moral crisis of slavery. His decisions were not dictated by party
      pressures or personal popularity, but by an unwavering sense of justice and an
      evolving commitment to human dignity. Though ridiculed by elites and assailed
      from all sides, Lincoln held fast to a vision of a “more perfect Union,” where
      liberty would not be the province of some, but the birthright of all. He issued
      the Emancipation Proclamation not as a tactical maneuver, but as a moral imperative—knowing
      it might cost him reelection, or even his life. In Lincoln, we find not the ambition
      of a conqueror, but the moral character of a public servant and custodian—one
      who bore the weight of a nation’s soul with courage, compassion, and purpose.
      John F. Kennedy John F. Kennedy exemplified a form of principled leadership grounded
      in restraint, intellect, and moral duty. At the height of the Cold War, when pressure
      to demonstrate military dominance was immense, Kennedy chose diplomacy over destruction
      during the Cuban Missile Crisis—resisting the chorus for war and averting global
      nuclear catastrophe through calm resolve and ethical judgment. Kennedy governed
      not by fear or flattery but by a quiet sense of duty to peace, justice, and the
      common good. In him, we see a leader who understood that true strength lies not
      in military conquest and subjugation of others, but in peace and cooperation—and
      that ethical leadership is defined as much by what one refuses to do as by what
      one dares to accomplish. Ron Paul, Thomas Massie, and Dennis Kucinich are among
      the best contemporary examples of principled public service: Ron Paul A former
      Air Force flight surgeon, physician, and Congressman from Texas, Ron Paul carved
      a distinctive path in American politics and gained respect across ideological
      lines for his outstanding intellectual consistency and moral character—particularly
      in foreign policy. He consistently opposed foreign wars, denouncing the use of
      false intelligence to start them. Paul also consistently opposed censorship and
      systematic dismantling of the Constitution and domestic civil liberties. Thomas
      Massie A principled conservative from Kentucky, Congressman Thomas Massie stands
      out as a rare example of ethical consistency in modern American politics. Massie
      has built an outstanding reputation for strong moral character, independence,
      and constitutional fidelity. He has routinely cast lone votes when conscience
      compels him—opposing mass surveillance, resisting unnecessary military interventions,
      and rejecting bloated spending bills. Massie’s positions are not always popular,
      but they are grounded in a belief that public office is a trust to be discharged
      with integrity—not a celebrity brand to be cultivated. His steadfastness, especially
      on matters of war, civil liberties, and fiscal responsibility, exemplifies how
      ethical leadership often means swimming against the current of partisan convenience
      and ambition. Dennis Kucinich A former mayor of Cleveland and Congressman from
      Ohio, Dennis Kucinich exemplifies politics grounded in conscience and courage.
      From his working-class roots, he entered public service with a commitment to justice,
      peace, and the common good—consistently challenging both corporate power and militarism.
      Kucinich was one of the most vocal opponents of the Iraq War and other wars. He
      also resisted the post-9/11 surveillance state, defending civil liberties and
      opposing the militarization of domestic life. Refusing corporate PAC money and
      standing alone on many key votes, Kucinich’s career is marked by moral clarity.
      The Philosophy of Ethical Leadership Before we can demand ethical leadership,
      we must first define it—not merely by example, but by principle. What does it
      mean to lead ethically? What moral compass guides a leader worthy of public trust?
      At its core, ethical leadership is the convergence of moral philosophy and civic
      responsibility . It is not simply about making “good” decisions or avoiding scandal.
      It is about grounding power in conscience, anchoring ambition in humanity and
      humility, and shaping policy with an unwavering commitment to justice, truth,
      and the dignity of others. Virtue Ethics From Aristotle to Confucius, virtue ethics
      teaches us that the moral quality of a leader is not defined by results alone,
      but by the inner character that guides their choices. Ethical leaders cultivate
      virtues such as prudence , honesty, temperance , courage , justice , and humility
      . These are not ornamental qualities—they are the very soul of leadership. Such
      a leader does not merely do what is legal or expedient. They ask: ” Is this right?”,
      Not “ Will this win votes? ” ” Does this serve the common good?”, Not “ Can I
      get away with it? ” In ethical leadership, conscience precedes calculation , and
      virtue transcends vanity. Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that ethics is not
      a matter of consequences or popularity but of adherence to moral duty. Ethical
      leaders understand their role as a sacred trust. They take oaths not as ceremonial
      rituals but as binding moral commitments. To them, the Constitution is not a tool
      but a sacred covenant . An ethical leader does not violate others’ civil liberties
      for political gain. They do not sacrifice principles for polls. They ask not what
      is easy or advantageous, but what is required of them by law, by justice, and
      by the responsibilities of office. Their motto is not “win at all costs,” but
      “do what is right, come what may.” Ethical leadership cannot ignore outcomes—it
      must care for the consequences of policy. But the utilitarian impulse to maximize
      collective good must always be tempered by the inviolable rights of individuals
      . An ethical leader may seek to reduce suffering or promote prosperity, but never
      by violating human dignity or sacrificing the vulnerable. True ethical leadership
      weighs costs and benefits without cynicism, and rejects the false logic of “collateral
      damage” as a moral shield . No ambition, however grand, can justify injustice
      against the powerless. The Ethic of Stewardship In the republican tradition—from
      Cicero to Jefferson to Hannah Arendt—ethical leadership is about stewardship of
      the res publica (literally, ‘the public thing’), or the commonwealth —that is,
      the shared public realm, the institutions, values, and affairs that belong to
      and serve the whole political community. Leaders are not owners of the state—they
      are caretakers. Their charge is not to command but to preserve liberty, justice,
      and democratic life for future generations. This tradition emphasizes public accountability,
      transparency, civic courage , and a deep reverence for the Constitution, institutions,
      laws, and the dignity of citizenship . Ethical leadership in this view is not
      heroic domination—it is quiet guardianship. It is not a stage for ego but a field
      of duty. Ethical leadership, then, is not accidental. It is not charisma, nor
      cleverness, nor simply the absence of scandal. It is a discipline of character,
      a fidelity to truth, and a refusal to wield power as a weapon of self-interest
      . Such leadership is difficult, often thankless, and rarely rewarded in the short
      term. But it is the only kind of leadership that sustains true freedom, prosperity,
      restores trust, and dignifies the Republic. As citizens, our responsibility is
      to recognize and demand this kind of leadership —not by the glare of fame, but
      by the light of conscience. And as a society, our survival depends on demanding
      nothing less. Ambition and the Endless Wars Nowhere is ambition untethered from
      virtue more lethal than in the affairs of war and peace. When the quest for personal
      power eclipses moral restraint, nations are drawn into bloody, unnecessary, and
      otherwise avoidable conflicts. War becomes not a last resort, but a permanent
      theater for ego—a distraction from domestic failures and a tool for empire-building.
      The Iraq War stands as one of the most egregious examples. Launched on false pretenses
      about “weapons of mass destruction”, the war cloaked darker motives: regional
      dominance, oil access, and political legacy. It destabilized the Middle East,
      cost hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions, and drained trillions
      from the public treasury. Many wars of aggression in the Middle East and elsewhere
      followed. Beyond the terrible devastation abroad, these wars led to de facto dismantling
      of the United States Constitution and our civil liberties and fueled the expansion
      of the surveillance state . Their architects have faced little accountability,
      and its contractors grew rich—proving that in an unprincipled system, war profits
      the few while burdening the many. President Eisenhower warned us of the “military-industrial
      complex,” a network that profits from perpetual war and incentivizes aggression
      over diplomacy . Today, war-making is a bipartisan ritual, politically safer than
      peace. Drone strikes, surveillance powers, and endless defense budgets face little
      scrutiny—while veterans return home scarred, and the vulnerable pay with their
      lives. Ethical leadership must reject war and embrace peace as a moral imperative.
      We must elect leaders who see diplomacy as strength, who tell the truth about
      our wars, and who refuse to sacrifice lives for their ambition. Only when we elevate
      such leaders can we break the cycle of war violence—and reclaim our Republic from
      the grip of endless foreign wars. We must insist on ethical leadership—not just
      to preserve our values, but to preserve our lives and the lives of our loved ones.
      We Must End the Cult of Political Celebrity In an age of algorithmic seduction
      and nonstop media saturation, politics has been hijacked by spectacle. The politician
      has been remade—not as a public servant, but as a brand, a cult figure, a celebrity
      . This is not a harmless cultural shift. It is a profound perversion of democracy
      and a central driver of narcissism, corruption, and authoritarian drift. When
      governance becomes entertainment, truth becomes optional , and performance becomes
      everything . The metrics that once defined responsible leadership—integrity, wisdom,
      courage—are replaced by likes, shares, poll numbers, and viral soundbites. The
      goal is not sound governance, but building personal brands and power of celebrity
      leaders . To win the camera, not the argument. Style trumps substance. Decisions
      are driven less by conscience than by public relations calculus. In this perverted
      public landscape, we mistake popularity for virtue, and charisma for competence
      and moral character . In this theater of the absurd, government becomes a stage,
      and the Republic turns into a mindless reality show based on lies. This culture
      encourages vanity and attracts narcissists and psychopaths . As the politicians’
      celebrity swells, so does their insulation from criticism. Like rock stars or
      royalty, they become cocooned in bubbles of loyalists, flattered by sycophants
      and shielded from accountability. Truth becomes elastic. Scandals are reframed
      as spectacles. Ethical lapses are recast as mere plot twists. The consequences
      are as dangerous as they are predictable: a loss of truth, humility, accountability,
      and moral restraint . The loudest voices dominate; the wisest are ignored. The
      humble are dismissed as “boring.” The reflective are derided as weak. Demagogues
      thrive in this terrain, while principled leaders struggle to break through the
      noise. This celebrity-politics complex also rewires the public. Citizens become
      fans , and fans are not rational citizens. They do not demand accountability—they
      demand victory and affirmation. They will excuse abuse, rationalize lies, and
      defend injustice so long as their chosen idol remains untarnished. Opponents are
      demonized for trivia; allies are excused for crimes. The media become an amplifier
      of emotion, not a steward of facts and truth. News segments are not designed to
      inform, but to provoke emotion —fear, anger, indignation. Journalism becomes a
      mix of propaganda and entertainment. Deliberation gives way to tribalism. To restore
      democratic integrity and common sense, we must reverse this cultural drift. Politicians
      must be brought down from the pedestal and returned to their true role of public
      servants. Public office is not a birthright, not a platform for money or fame—it
      is an obligation of duty and an opportunity to serve. We must resist the temptation
      to idolize those who govern us. They are not kings, not influencers, not saviors.
      They are public servants. And our job is not to cheer them from the sidelines
      as fans—but to exercise responsible citizenship by electing the most ethical leaders,
      and then questioning, challenging, and holding them to account. How To Identify
      Ethical Leaders Ethical leaders rarely announce themselves with fanfare. They
      are not always the most charismatic, nor the most media-savvy. But they leave
      clues—ethical fingerprints—that conscientious voters can discern. Here are some
      concrete ways to identify them: Track Record Over Rhetoric Look beyond what a
      candidate says and examine what they’ve done . Have they taken unpopular but principled
      stances in the true public interest? Have they kept their word, even at political
      cost? Have they delivered for their voters in their previous public service jobs?
      Ethics is revealed in actions, not press releases. What is their voting record?
      Voting in favor of a genocide or any war of aggression should be disqualifying.
      If they sent someone else’s children to die for their ambition, they will not
      hesitate to send yours. Have they voted for any unconstitutional bills such as
      authorizing surveillance without a warrant or restricting freedom of speech? If
      they were willing to betray their sacred oath to protect and defend the Constitution,
      they cannot be trusted and are not eligible for public service. Follow the Money
      Examine where their campaign funding comes from. Do they rely on grassroots donations,
      or on PACs, defense contractors, and lobbyists of foreign countries? Money is
      a moral trail; follow it. Do not support any candidates who are funded by corporate
      interests, military industrial complex, and/or foreign lobbies – they will not
      be representing you, they will be serving their donors. How They Treat the Powerless
      Pay attention to how a candidate treats those without influence—whistleblowers,
      immigrants, prisoners, the poor. Ethical leaders fight for those who cannot repay
      them. Humility in Leadership Avoid those who speak only in absolutes, or elevate
      themselves as saviors. Ethical leaders acknowledge their limits, welcome dissent,
      and share credit. Hubris is the mask of ambition; humility is the mark of service.
      Transparency Do they explain their decisions clearly, or hide behind spin? Are
      they willing to be held accountable, or do they deflect and blame? Transparency
      is the companion of integrity. Build a Culture and Institutions of Ethical Leadership
      Identifying ethical leaders is only half the battle. We must also build a culture
      and institutions that promote them, protect them, and value their service. Reform
      the Incentives Electoral reforms including primaries reform, ranked-choice voting,
      anti-gerrymandering measures, and reform of campaign financing, can disincentivize
      performative politics, encourage truthful and thoughtful competition of ideas,
      and highlight the most competent and ethical candidates. Break the cycle of careerism
      by instituting term limits, banning lobbying jobs for former legislators, and
      minimizing the influence of big money in politics. Institute a full ban on the
      insider trading by political leaders and appointed officials. Ethical leaders
      are more likely to emerge in a system that does not reward corruption. Civic Education
      Teach the next generation that leadership is not about fame, power, or wealth.
      Highlight moral exemplars in classrooms, not just military generals or billionaires.
      Show that quiet courage and servant-leadership are worthy of admiration. Read
      and Support Independent Media Ethical leaders are often ignored or marginalized
      by mainstream legacy media. Read, share, and support independent journalism that
      exposes corruption and uplifts principled voices . Shine light where spin dominates.
      Create Political Spaces for Discussion Encourage local forums, debates, town halls,
      podcasts, and online discussions where citizens can engage with candidates directly,
      outside the noise of partisan media. Ethical leaders thrive in spaces where ideas
      matter more than soundbites. Hold Power to Account Even ethical leaders need scrutiny.
      The path to tyranny is paved with blind loyalty. A healthy republic supports virtue,
      but demands transparency and oversight from all. The Responsibility of Citizens
      If we are to have ethical leaders, we must be ethical citizens . Democracies usually
      get the leaders they deserve. If we reward spectacle over substance, promises
      over principles, we enable the rise of careerists and charlatans. If we are cynical,
      apathetic, or distracted, we surrender the Republic to those who hunger for power.
      But if we demand character, accountability, and humility, we can restore politics
      to its noblest function: the stewardship of the common good . Yet this restoration
      cannot rely on individual discernment alone. It requires the active organization
      of citizens and reform of the structures that elevate public servants. Citizen
      watchdog groups, independent ethics commissions, and local political clubs can
      pressure institutions to remain transparent and accountable. Civic technology—such
      as open-data platforms and Artificial Intelligence tools —can empower citizens
      and journalists to publish the truth, voice their views, expose corruption, monitor
      leaders, and influence decision-making directly. Ethical leadership also thrives
      when the system doesn’t penalize moral courage. That means building political
      cultures and institutional frameworks that reward truth-telling, protect whistleblowers,
      and guard against retaliation. We must make it safer to dissent with integrity
      than to conform with cowardice. Most of all, we must live the civic virtue we
      seek . Courage is not the exclusive domain of those in high office. It belongs
      also to voters who speak unpopular truths at school board meetings, to activists
      who challenge unjust laws, and to communities who refuse to look away. Ethics
      in leadership begins with ethics in citizenship. The Courage to Lead Ethically
      Ethical leadership is not merely about character; it is about courage. The courage
      to say no when the crowd shouts yes. The courage to sacrifice political gain for
      moral principle. The courage to lead not by fear or flattery, but by truth. History
      honors not the cautious consensus-seekers, but those who risked reputation and
      career for justice. Whether standing alone on a congressional floor, vetoing a
      war budget, or calling out abuses within their own party, ethical leaders often
      act in defiance of the powerful. Their integrity does not exempt them from hardship—it
      demands it. That is why courage must be cultivated—not only in our leaders, but
      in ourselves. In a society that prizes convenience and rewards compliance, ethical
      leadership is a difficult path. But it is the only path that leads to peace, justice,
      and democratic renewal and therefore the only path worth pursuing. Every generation
      faces the question: what kind of people shall we entrust with power? If we choose
      those who serve ambition, the state will serve them in turn. But if we elevate
      those who truly serve the people, the nation can thrive . Ethical, pro-peace leadership
      is not a fantasy—it is the only viable path forward to a peaceful, thriving, and
      just society. “For peace is not in gold or gain, Nor in the spoils of others’
      pain; It’s found turning from the lie, Refusing worlds where good must die, To
      stand where truth and kindness grow, And dream a life beyond this woe.” “Awaken”

    paragraph_summary: The article emphasizes the critical importance of moral character
      in leadership for the health of democracies, arguing that the rise and fall of
      governments often stem from the integrity of those in power. It calls for a reevaluation
      of the qualities we seek in elected officials, advocating for the rejection of
      self-serving politicians motivated by ambition, wealth, or power, and the selection
      of leaders who are honest, ethical, and dedicated to public service. The piece
      highlights that while ambition can drive positive achievements, unchecked ambition
      devoid of virtue can lead to disastrous consequences, as exemplified by historical
      figures like Napoleon Bonaparte. Ultimately, the essay warns that personal ambition
      can undermine democracy and lead to unnecessary conflicts, urging voters to prioritize
      character and service over personal gain in their leaders.

    text: '“They burn in fire to attain, To build empires based on pain, On ashes climb
      to reach for skies, While blinded by the gleam of lies. With hands of iron, hearts

      might, To lose the day, and fear the night.” “Awaken” – The Frontier Man The Moral
      Crisis of Leadership Throughout history, the health of democracies has hinged
      not merely on their laws or institutions, but on the moral character of the leaders
      entrusted with power. The rise and fall of governments, the flourishing or decay
      of civilizations, and the liberty or subjugation of citizens often trace back
      to the moral character of those at the helm. In our present age—fraught with crises
      of trust, integrity, and democratic erosion—it is imperative for us to reconsider
      not only whom we elect, but the character and motivations behind their pursuit
      of power. This essay argues that we must reject and vote out politicians driven
      by career ambition, lust for wealth, and/or hunger for power. Instead, we must
      elect leaders who are honest, intelligent, ethical, have track records of outstanding
      public service, and pursue public office not as a ladder to personal gain, but
      as a platform to serve their fellow citizens. History offers us powerful testimony:
      societies thrive under servant-leaders, and crumble under self-serving, corrupt
      elites. Personal ambition at any cost not only kills democracy but also often
      literally kills people who are sent to die in endless, unnecessary wars of aggression
      driven by the egos of corrupt leaders. When Ambition Kills: Lessons from History
      Ambition, in isolation, is not inherently evil. It has spurred explorers across
      oceans, scientists toward discoveries, and artists to greatness. But when personal
      ambition, untethered from virtue, ethics, and duty, dominates the souls of leaders,
      nations stand at great risk. Among history’s most vivid examples of ambition’s
      perils stands Napoleon Bonaparte . Hailed at first as a defender of liberty, he
      soon crowned himself Emperor of the French, betraying the very ideals that elevated
      him. His wars—spanning from Italy to Russia—left millions dead, cities in ruins,
      and a continent reeling. Napoleon’s fall at Waterloo was not just military defeat;
      it was the collapse of a regime built on ego, not ethics. His story is a cautionary
      tale: how a republic, birthed in revolution, can be crushed by the ambitions of
      a single man. Adolf Hitler best represents ambition without any moral anchor.
      Rising amid Germany’s despair, he promised revival but delivered tyranny, death,
      and destruction. Cloaking power in populism, he dismantled the Weimar Republic
      with chilling efficiency—via law, propaganda, and fear. His wars of conquest and
      genocide were obsessions fueled by racial hatred and imperial delusions. By the
      time he fell, tens of millions were dead, and the world had seen the abyss. These
      examples echo a timeless truth: ambition without virtue does not elevate—it annihilates
      . The Power of the Servant-Leader In contrast to the ambitious politician stands
      the servant-leader —those who enter politics not to be someone , but to do something
      . These are individuals for whom public service is not a means to personal gain,
      but a moral obligation rooted in humility, service, and justice. American history
      has some outstanding examples of such principled public servants. Abraham Lincoln
      A self-educated lawyer from humble beginnings, Lincoln did not seek power for
      its own sake, but was summoned by the moment to preserve a fractured union and
      confront the moral crisis of slavery. His decisions were not dictated by party
      pressures or personal popularity, but by an unwavering sense of justice and an
      evolving commitment to human dignity. Though ridiculed by elites and assailed
      from all sides, Lincoln held fast to a vision of a “more perfect Union,” where
      liberty would not be the province of some, but the birthright of all. He issued
      the Emancipation Proclamation not as a tactical maneuver, but as a moral imperative—knowing
      it might cost him reelection, or even his life. In Lincoln, we find not the ambition
      of a conqueror, but the moral character of a public servant and custodian—one
      who bore the weight of a nation’s soul with courage, compassion, and purpose.
      John F. Kennedy John F. Kennedy exemplified a form of principled leadership grounded
      in restraint, intellect, and moral duty. At the height of the Cold War, when pressure
      to demonstrate military dominance was immense, Kennedy chose diplomacy over destruction
      during the Cuban Missile Crisis—resisting the chorus for war and averting global
      nuclear catastrophe through calm resolve and ethical judgment. Kennedy governed
      not by fear or flattery but by a quiet sense of duty to peace, justice, and the
      common good. In him, we see a leader who understood that true strength lies not
      in military conquest and subjugation of others, but in peace and cooperation—and
      that ethical leadership is defined as much by what one refuses to do as by what
      one dares to accomplish. Ron Paul, Thomas Massie, and Dennis Kucinich are among
      the best contemporary examples of principled public service: Ron Paul A former
      Air Force flight surgeon, physician, and Congressman from Texas, Ron Paul carved
      a distinctive path in American politics and gained respect across ideological
      lines for his outstanding intellectual consistency and moral character—particularly
      in foreign policy. He consistently opposed foreign wars, denouncing the use of
      false intelligence to start them. Paul also consistently opposed censorship and
      systematic dismantling of the Constitution and domestic civil liberties. Thomas
      Massie A principled conservative from Kentucky, Congressman Thomas Massie stands
      out as a rare example of ethical consistency in modern American politics. Massie
      has built an outstanding reputation for strong moral character, independence,
      and constitutional fidelity. He has routinely cast lone votes when conscience
      compels him—opposing mass surveillance, resisting unnecessary military interventions,
      and rejecting bloated spending bills. Massie’s positions are not always popular,
      but they are grounded in a belief that public office is a trust to be discharged
      with integrity—not a celebrity brand to be cultivated. His steadfastness, especially
      on matters of war, civil liberties, and fiscal responsibility, exemplifies how
      ethical leadership often means swimming against the current of partisan convenience
      and ambition. Dennis Kucinich A former mayor of Cleveland and Congressman from
      Ohio, Dennis Kucinich exemplifies politics grounded in conscience and courage.
      From his working-class roots, he entered public service with a commitment to justice,
      peace, and the common good—consistently challenging both corporate power and militarism.
      Kucinich was one of the most vocal opponents of the Iraq War and other wars. He
      also resisted the post-9/11 surveillance state, defending civil liberties and
      opposing the militarization of domestic life. Refusing corporate PAC money and
      standing alone on many key votes, Kucinich’s career is marked by moral clarity.
      The Philosophy of Ethical Leadership Before we can demand ethical leadership,
      we must first define it—not merely by example, but by principle. What does it
      mean to lead ethically? What moral compass guides a leader worthy of public trust?
      At its core, ethical leadership is the convergence of moral philosophy and civic
      responsibility . It is not simply about making “good” decisions or avoiding scandal.
      It is about grounding power in conscience, anchoring ambition in humanity and
      humility, and shaping policy with an unwavering commitment to justice, truth,
      and the dignity of others. Virtue Ethics From Aristotle to Confucius, virtue ethics
      teaches us that the moral quality of a leader is not defined by results alone,
      but by the inner character that guides their choices. Ethical leaders cultivate
      virtues such as prudence , honesty, temperance , courage , justice , and humility
      . These are not ornamental qualities—they are the very soul of leadership. Such
      a leader does not merely do what is legal or expedient. They ask: ” Is this right?”,
      Not “ Will this win votes? ” ” Does this serve the common good?”, Not “ Can I
      get away with it? ” In ethical leadership, conscience precedes calculation , and
      virtue transcends vanity. Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that ethics is not
      a matter of consequences or popularity but of adherence to moral duty. Ethical
      leaders understand their role as a sacred trust. They take oaths not as ceremonial
      rituals but as binding moral commitments. To them, the Constitution is not a tool
      but a sacred covenant . An ethical leader does not violate others’ civil liberties
      for political gain. They do not sacrifice principles for polls. They ask not what
      is easy or advantageous, but what is required of them by law, by justice, and
      by the responsibilities of office. Their motto is not “win at all costs,” but
      “do what is right, come what may.” Ethical leadership cannot ignore outcomes—it
      must care for the consequences of policy. But the utilitarian impulse to maximize
      collective good must always be tempered by the inviolable rights of individuals
      . An ethical leader may seek to reduce suffering or promote prosperity, but never
      by violating human dignity or sacrificing the vulnerable. True ethical leadership
      weighs costs and benefits without cynicism, and rejects the false logic of “collateral
      damage” as a moral shield . No ambition, however grand, can justify injustice
      against the powerless. The Ethic of Stewardship In the republican tradition—from
      Cicero to Jefferson to Hannah Arendt—ethical leadership is about stewardship of
      the res publica (literally, ‘the public thing’), or the commonwealth —that is,
      the shared public realm, the institutions, values, and affairs that belong to
      and serve the whole political community. Leaders are not owners of the state—they
      are caretakers. Their charge is not to command but to preserve liberty, justice,
      and democratic life for future generations. This tradition emphasizes public accountability,
      transparency, civic courage , and a deep reverence for the Constitution, institutions,
      laws, and the dignity of citizenship . Ethical leadership in this view is not
      heroic domination—it is quiet guardianship. It is not a stage for ego but a field
      of duty. Ethical leadership, then, is not accidental. It is not charisma, nor
      cleverness, nor simply the absence of scandal. It is a discipline of character,
      a fidelity to truth, and a refusal to wield power as a weapon of self-interest
      . Such leadership is difficult, often thankless, and rarely rewarded in the short
      term. But it is the only kind of leadership that sustains true freedom, prosperity,
      restores trust, and dignifies the Republic. As citizens, our responsibility is
      to recognize and demand this kind of leadership —not by the glare of fame, but
      by the light of conscience. And as a society, our survival depends on demanding
      nothing less. Ambition and the Endless Wars Nowhere is ambition untethered from
      virtue more lethal than in the affairs of war and peace. When the quest for personal
      power eclipses moral restraint, nations are drawn into bloody, unnecessary, and
      otherwise avoidable conflicts. War becomes not a last resort, but a permanent
      theater for ego—a distraction from domestic failures and a tool for empire-building.
      The Iraq War stands as one of the most egregious examples. Launched on false pretenses
      about “weapons of mass destruction”, the war cloaked darker motives: regional
      dominance, oil access, and political legacy. It destabilized the Middle East,
      cost hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions, and drained trillions
      from the public treasury. Many wars of aggression in the Middle East and elsewhere
      followed. Beyond the terrible devastation abroad, these wars led to de facto dismantling
      of the United States Constitution and our civil liberties and fueled the expansion
      of the surveillance state . Their architects have faced little accountability,
      and its contractors grew rich—proving that in an unprincipled system, war profits
      the few while burdening the many. President Eisenhower warned us of the “military-industrial
      complex,” a network that profits from perpetual war and incentivizes aggression
      over diplomacy . Today, war-making is a bipartisan ritual, politically safer than
      peace. Drone strikes, surveillance powers, and endless defense budgets face little
      scrutiny—while veterans return home scarred, and the vulnerable pay with their
      lives. Ethical leadership must reject war and embrace peace as a moral imperative.
      We must elect leaders who see diplomacy as strength, who tell the truth about
      our wars, and who refuse to sacrifice lives for their ambition. Only when we elevate
      such leaders can we break the cycle of war violence—and reclaim our Republic from
      the grip of endless foreign wars. We must insist on ethical leadership—not just
      to preserve our values, but to preserve our lives and the lives of our loved ones.
      We Must End the Cult of Political Celebrity In an age of algorithmic seduction
      and nonstop media saturation, politics has been hijacked by spectacle. The politician
      has been remade—not as a public servant, but as a brand, a cult figure, a celebrity
      . This is not a harmless cultural shift. It is a profound perversion of democracy
      and a central driver of narcissism, corruption, and authoritarian drift. When
      governance becomes entertainment, truth becomes optional , and performance becomes
      everything . The metrics that once defined responsible leadership—integrity, wisdom,
      courage—are replaced by likes, shares, poll numbers, and viral soundbites. The
      goal is not sound governance, but building personal brands and power of celebrity
      leaders . To win the camera, not the argument. Style trumps substance. Decisions
      are driven less by conscience than by public relations calculus. In this perverted
      public landscape, we mistake popularity for virtue, and charisma for competence
      and moral character . In this theater of the absurd, government becomes a stage,
      and the Republic turns into a mindless reality show based on lies. This culture
      encourages vanity and attracts narcissists and psychopaths . As the politicians’
      celebrity swells, so does their insulation from criticism. Like rock stars or
      royalty, they become cocooned in bubbles of loyalists, flattered by sycophants
      and shielded from accountability. Truth becomes elastic. Scandals are reframed
      as spectacles. Ethical lapses are recast as mere plot twists. The consequences
      are as dangerous as they are predictable: a loss of truth, humility, accountability,
      and moral restraint . The loudest voices dominate; the wisest are ignored. The
      humble are dismissed as “boring.” The reflective are derided as weak. Demagogues
      thrive in this terrain, while principled leaders struggle to break through the
      noise. This celebrity-politics complex also rewires the public. Citizens become
      fans , and fans are not rational citizens. They do not demand accountability—they
      demand victory and affirmation. They will excuse abuse, rationalize lies, and
      defend injustice so long as their chosen idol remains untarnished. Opponents are
      demonized for trivia; allies are excused for crimes. The media become an amplifier
      of emotion, not a steward of facts and truth. News segments are not designed to
      inform, but to provoke emotion —fear, anger, indignation. Journalism becomes a
      mix of propaganda and entertainment. Deliberation gives way to tribalism. To restore
      democratic integrity and common sense, we must reverse this cultural drift. Politicians
      must be brought down from the pedestal and returned to their true role of public
      servants. Public office is not a birthright, not a platform for money or fame—it
      is an obligation of duty and an opportunity to serve. We must resist the temptation
      to idolize those who govern us. They are not kings, not influencers, not saviors.
      They are public servants. And our job is not to cheer them from the sidelines
      as fans—but to exercise responsible citizenship by electing the most ethical leaders,
      and then questioning, challenging, and holding them to account. How To Identify
      Ethical Leaders Ethical leaders rarely announce themselves with fanfare. They
      are not always the most charismatic, nor the most media-savvy. But they leave
      clues—ethical fingerprints—that conscientious voters can discern. Here are some
      concrete ways to identify them: Track Record Over Rhetoric Look beyond what a
      candidate says and examine what they’ve done . Have they taken unpopular but principled
      stances in the true public interest? Have they kept their word, even at political
      cost? Have they delivered for their voters in their previous public service jobs?
      Ethics is revealed in actions, not press releases. What is their voting record?
      Voting in favor of a genocide or any war of aggression should be disqualifying.
      If they sent someone else’s children to die for their ambition, they will not
      hesitate to send yours. Have they voted for any unconstitutional bills such as
      authorizing surveillance without a warrant or restricting freedom of speech? If
      they were willing to betray their sacred oath to protect and defend the Constitution,
      they cannot be trusted and are not eligible for public service. Follow the Money
      Examine where their campaign funding comes from. Do they rely on grassroots donations,
      or on PACs, defense contractors, and lobbyists of foreign countries? Money is
      a moral trail; follow it. Do not support any candidates who are funded by corporate
      interests, military industrial complex, and/or foreign lobbies – they will not
      be representing you, they will be serving their donors. How They Treat the Powerless
      Pay attention to how a candidate treats those without influence—whistleblowers,
      immigrants, prisoners, the poor. Ethical leaders fight for those who cannot repay
      them. Humility in Leadership Avoid those who speak only in absolutes, or elevate
      themselves as saviors. Ethical leaders acknowledge their limits, welcome dissent,
      and share credit. Hubris is the mask of ambition; humility is the mark of service.
      Transparency Do they explain their decisions clearly, or hide behind spin? Are
      they willing to be held accountable, or do they deflect and blame? Transparency
      is the companion of integrity. Build a Culture and Institutions of Ethical Leadership
      Identifying ethical leaders is only half the battle. We must also build a culture
      and institutions that promote them, protect them, and value their service. Reform
      the Incentives Electoral reforms including primaries reform, ranked-choice voting,
      anti-gerrymandering measures, and reform of campaign financing, can disincentivize
      performative politics, encourage truthful and thoughtful competition of ideas,
      and highlight the most competent and ethical candidates. Break the cycle of careerism
      by instituting term limits, banning lobbying jobs for former legislators, and
      minimizing the influence of big money in politics. Institute a full ban on the
      insider trading by political leaders and appointed officials. Ethical leaders
      are more likely to emerge in a system that does not reward corruption. Civic Education
      Teach the next generation that leadership is not about fame, power, or wealth.
      Highlight moral exemplars in classrooms, not just military generals or billionaires.
      Show that quiet courage and servant-leadership are worthy of admiration. Read
      and Support Independent Media Ethical leaders are often ignored or marginalized
      by mainstream legacy media. Read, share, and support independent journalism that
      exposes corruption and uplifts principled voices . Shine light where spin dominates.
      Create Political Spaces for Discussion Encourage local forums, debates, town halls,
      podcasts, and online discussions where citizens can engage with candidates directly,
      outside the noise of partisan media. Ethical leaders thrive in spaces where ideas
      matter more than soundbites. Hold Power to Account Even ethical leaders need scrutiny.
      The path to tyranny is paved with blind loyalty. A healthy republic supports virtue,
      but demands transparency and oversight from all. The Responsibility of Citizens
      If we are to have ethical leaders, we must be ethical citizens . Democracies usually
      get the leaders they deserve. If we reward spectacle over substance, promises
      over principles, we enable the rise of careerists and charlatans. If we are cynical,
      apathetic, or distracted, we surrender the Republic to those who hunger for power.
      But if we demand character, accountability, and humility, we can restore politics
      to its noblest function: the stewardship of the common good . Yet this restoration
      cannot rely on individual discernment alone. It requires the active organization
      of citizens and reform of the structures that elevate public servants. Citizen
      watchdog groups, independent ethics commissions, and local political clubs can
      pressure institutions to remain transparent and accountable. Civic technology—such
      as open-data platforms and Artificial Intelligence tools —can empower citizens
      and journalists to publish the truth, voice their views, expose corruption, monitor
      leaders, and influence decision-making directly. Ethical leadership also thrives
      when the system doesn’t penalize moral courage. That means building political
      cultures and institutional frameworks that reward truth-telling, protect whistleblowers,
      and guard against retaliation. We must make it safer to dissent with integrity
      than to conform with cowardice. Most of all, we must live the civic virtue we
      seek . Courage is not the exclusive domain of those in high office. It belongs
      also to voters who speak unpopular truths at school board meetings, to activists
      who challenge unjust laws, and to communities who refuse to look away. Ethics
      in leadership begins with ethics in citizenship. The Courage to Lead Ethically
      Ethical leadership is not merely about character; it is about courage. The courage
      to say no when the crowd shouts yes. The courage to sacrifice political gain for
      moral principle. The courage to lead not by fear or flattery, but by truth. History
      honors not the cautious consensus-seekers, but those who risked reputation and
      career for justice. Whether standing alone on a congressional floor, vetoing a
      war budget, or calling out abuses within their own party, ethical leaders often
      act in defiance of the powerful. Their integrity does not exempt them from hardship—it
      demands it. That is why courage must be cultivated—not only in our leaders, but
      in ourselves. In a society that prizes convenience and rewards compliance, ethical
      leadership is a difficult path. But it is the only path that leads to peace, justice,
      and democratic renewal and therefore the only path worth pursuing. Every generation
      faces the question: what kind of people shall we entrust with power? If we choose
      those who serve ambition, the state will serve them in turn. But if we elevate
      those who truly serve the people, the nation can thrive . Ethical, pro-peace leadership
      is not a fantasy—it is the only viable path forward to a peaceful, thriving, and
      just society. “For peace is not in gold or gain, Nor in the spoils of others’
      pain; It’s found turning from the lie, Refusing worlds where good must die, To
      stand where truth and kindness grow, And dream a life beyond this woe.” “Awaken”

    paragraph_summary: The article emphasizes the critical importance of moral character
      in leadership for the health of democracies, arguing that the rise and fall of
      governments often stem from the integrity of those in power. It calls for a reevaluation
      of the qualities we seek in elected officials, advocating for the rejection of
      self-serving politicians motivated by ambition, wealth, or power, and the selection
      of leaders who are honest, ethical, and dedicated to public service. The piece
      highlights that while ambition can drive positive achievements, unchecked ambition
      devoid of virtue can lead to disastrous consequences, as exemplified by historical
      figures like Napoleon Bonaparte. Ultimately, the essay warns that personal ambition
      can undermine democracy and lead to unnecessary conflicts, urging voters to prioritize
      character and service over personal gain in their leaders.

      is self-reflective and not afraid to admit his errors. The import of Putin’s words
      is that he articulately explains two fundamental reasons for the tension between
      Russia and the West: repeated lies by Western leaders and repeated rejections
      of Russian overtures to cooperate on matters of mutual national security. It is
      a short, but profound interview: Which brings me to Trump’s YUGE Announcement

      Trump’s ceasefire in place , Trump will impose 100% tariffs on countries supporting
      Russia, i.e., China and India. Why 50 days? Did Putin tell Trump during their

    text: 'Cartoon by NEMO The world waits and wonders what Donald Trump will say on
      Monday evening about Russia. Given his narcissism and his belief that he is invincible
      — as illustrated in NEMO’s cartoon at the top of this article — I think that Trump
      is poised to reverse himself on his promise to bring a quick end to the war in
      Ukraine, and he will announce a series of steps that he foolishly believes will
      put pressure on Russia and its allies. He continues to ignore the West’s responsibility
      for provoking this conflict and he does not assign any blame to Ukraine. Instead,

      image: The folks at DD Geopolitics provided a nice summary of Senator Lindsey
      Graham’s remarks to CBS on Sunday: Senator Lindsey Graham told CBS News what to
      expect from Trump’s upcoming statement on Russia. First, he pointed to possible
      moves regarding Russia’s frozen assets. “Watch for news about the seized assets.
      I don’t want to speak ahead of the President, but the Europeans want to cap the
      interest that goes to Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Bessent wants to go further,”
      Graham said. He also spoke of a plan where the US will start selling large volumes
      of weapons to European allies — supposedly to help Ukraine. “I expect a record
      flow of weapons in the coming days to help Ukraine defend itself,” he said. Graham
      also confirmed that Congress is close to passing a sanctions package targeting
      countries that buy Russian oil and goods. The tariffs may not be fixed at 500%
      as earlier proposed — Trump will have authority to set them between 0% and 500%.
      “He’ll have maximum flexibility,” Graham stated. “Congress is about to pass the
      most significant sanctions package in US history. It will give President Trump
      tools he doesn’t have now — a real sledgehammer. The main violators are China,
      India, and Brazil. India buys cheap Russian oil and resells it. It’s disgusting.
      I spoke with Trump, and last week he said it’s time to act,” Graham added. He
      said Trump wants to force those supporting Putin to choose between the U.S. economy
      and backing Russia. “China, India, Brazil — you’ll suffer if you keep helping
      Putin,” Graham said. If Trump pursues the course of action outlined by the Little
      Old Lady from South Carolina (aka, Lindsey Graham), the President will further
      strengthen Russia’s resolve to end the affair militarily; he will reinforce the
      conviction of the BRICS nations that they must pursue an economic and financial
      policy that frees them of US coercion; and he may unleash unanticipated economic
      blowback on the US and World economy that could ignite a financial crisis. For
      example, as of 10 pm Eastern time, gold futures are trending up. I suppose there
      is always a chance that Trump will surprise and adopt a conciliatory policy proposal,
      but given his comments about “Putin’s bullshit,” I don’t think that is likely.
      I will be happy to be proved wrong. Trump may announce he is sending more Patriot
      missile batteries and missiles to Ukraine… Good luck with that. US supplies are
      depleted, as I and many others have pointed out over the last two weeks, and Russia
      has proven to be quite adept at blowing them up. Also, the Patriot is totally
      ineffective against Russia’s hypersonic missiles, which Moscow is regularly launching.
      Monday’s speech may be the moment when Trump takes full ownership of the war in
      Ukraine. Instead of garnering a Nobel Peace Prize , Trump will be setting himself
      up for winning a resurrected Public Eye Award — i.e., Public Eye Awards were annual
      “shame-on-you” prizes given from 2005 to 2015 to corporations with the worst records

    url: https://sonar21.com/by-the-numbers-western-propaganda-on-russian-losses/
    text: 'Over the past week, the Western media has frantically pushed the narrative
      that Russia is suffering massive losses. Marco Rubio’s remarks in Kuala Lumpur
      a couple of days ago is a typical example: One hundred thousand since January?
      But it is not just Rubio… The Economist provides a more modest estimate, but the
      key word is estimate : As of July 9th our tracker suggests there have been between
      900,000 and 1.3m Russian casualties since the war began, including some 190,000–350,000
      deaths. That updates assessments from other sources, which put total casualties
      above 1m at the end of June. Our numbers suggest roughly 31,000 Russians may have
      been killed in the summer offensive so far, which began in earnest on May 1st.
      There is too little data to generate a comparable live estimate for Ukraine. However,
      a catalogue of the known dead and missing from UAL osses, a website, implies that
      between 73,000 and 140,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died since the invasion began.
      Talk about lazy reporters. There is plenty of data out there if you simply do
      basic analysis. For example, start with social media. In the age of ubiquitous
      smart-phones and social media platforms, it is impossible to hide death notices
      — aka obituaries — and pictures of funerals and graveyards. There are hundred
      of images of Ukrainian funerals and of graveyards with a literal sea of Ukrainian
      flags fluttering over a vast expanse of freshly dug graves. Not so in Russia.
      There are a few, but nothing to match the quantity displayed on Ukrainian channels.
      Here is one example from the cemetery in Khmelnitsky: Again, there are a few videos
      of some cemeteries in Russia, but nothing to match the scale of what we can see
      in Ukraine. Western intelligence analysts have access to satellite imagery and
      the capability to look at cemeteries in both Russia and Ukraine and compare where
      the most new graves are being dug. I swear I wrote an article on this with those
      images, but I can’t find it. But I did make an interesting discovery while searching
      for it… Western satellites and media companies are doing nothing to make that
      comparison. The following graph helps explain why. [Note: This bears an erroneous
      title.] This graph shows the number of Russian bodies exchanges for Ukrainian
      bodies since the start of the Special Military Operation. In my previous article,
      I discussed the reason for the disparity in combat deaths… It is the fact that
      Russia enjoys an overwhelming advantage in firepower. Let’s look at just two weapon
      systems: Artillery shells : Russia enjoys a lopsided advantage thanks to ramped-up
      domestic production (3-4.5 million shells annually) and massive imports (e.g.,
      9+ million from North Korea since 2023), while Ukraine is dependent entirely on
      Western aid (1.3-2 million annually). NATO’s Secretary General has conceded in
      public that Russia produces more artillery shells in three months than the US
      and the rest of NATO can produce in a year. Production numbers are relevant because
      Russia’s firing rate (10,000-15,000 shells/day) outpaces Ukraine’s (2,000-7,000/day),
      leading to a 5-10:1 disparity in some sectors in 2024. In 2025, that disparity
      has grown to a 23:1 disadvantage for Ukraine. In other words, Ukrainians hit by
      artillery shells are will have more casualties than Russians simply because the
      Russians are firing more shells. Drones : Russia holds several key advantages
      in the use of drones for combat in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine, primarily
      stemming from its larger industrial base, foreign partnerships (e.g., with Iran
      for Shahed -type drones and China for components), and focus on mass production
      and deployment. Superior Production Volume and Stockpiles: Russia aims to produce
      2-4 million drones in 2025 (including 2 million FPV models and 30,000 long-range/decoy
      types), outpacing Ukraine’s targets in certain categories despite Ukraine’s overall
      goal of 4.5 million. This includes ramping up to 300-500 long-range drones per
      day, bolstered by Chinese components, giving Russia a 3:1 edge in daily output
      for some types. Ukraine produced 2.2 million in 2024 (a 900% surge), but Russia’s
      cumulative stockpiles (estimated 1.5-2.5 million active) enable sustained operations.
      Massive Barrage Capabilities: Russia routinely launches large-scale drone assaults
      (e.g., record 728 drones in one night in July 2025, up from 2,264 in H1 2024 to
      22,495 in H1 2025), overwhelming Ukrainian air defenses and destroying key facilities.
      Technological Adaptations for Resilience: Russia has gained an edge with fiber-optic
      cable-guided drones (e.g., Lancet variants), which are resistant to electronic
      jamming—a key Ukrainian countermeasure. These “low-tech” innovations have been
      called game-changers, allowing Russia to bypass EW systems where Ukraine previously
      dominated. Additionally, Russia’s integration of AI and machine vision in drones
      enhances targeting, though Ukraine leads in autonomous swarms. Foreign Supply
      Chains and Sustainability: Partnerships with Iran (thousands of Shahed imports
      annually) and China (components for 70% of drones) provide Russia with a reliable
      influx, evading sanctions and sustaining high usage rates. This contrasts with
      Ukraine’s reliance on Western aid and domestic firms (200+ companies), which face
      funding volatility despite a 22-fold increase in long-range drone output from
      2023 to 2024. Battlefield Integration and Attrition Edge: Russia uses its drone
      superiority to support infantry advances, forcing Ukraine into defensive adaptations
      like motorcycle evasions. Russia’s drones enable a 10:1 attack ratio in some sectors,
      compounding its manpower advantage, and increasing the number of Ukrainian casualties.
      There is not a single weapon system where Ukraine can claim to have the advantage.
      While Russia is employing two additional weapons systems that Ukraine does not
      have… hypersonic missiles and combat aircraft. Before you holler, “Wait a minute…
      Ukraine has combat aircraft,” Russia enjoys air supremacy, while Ukrainian aircraft
      are shot down with regularity. Oh yeah, almost forgot… Russia’s fleet of bombers
      and submarines regularly launch missiles that Ukraine is incapable of destroying.
      Whatever casualties Ukraine is inflicting on Russian forces, it pales in comparison
      to what Ukraine is losing because of the overwhelming advantage in fires that
      Russia has. I guess Marco Rubio did not get that briefing. I thank you for your

      and Ukrainian losses while suggesting that the reporting lacks rigor and accuracy.
    paragraph_summary: In recent days, Western media has amplified claims of significant
      Russian military losses in the ongoing conflict, with figures ranging from 100,000
      to over a million casualties since the war began, including substantial death
      tolls. While estimates vary, a report suggests that Russian casualties may be
      between 900,000 and 1.3 million, with 190,000 to 350,000 deaths. In contrast,
      Ukrainian losses are estimated to be between 73,000 and 140,000 soldiers. The
      article criticizes the media for relying on these estimates without thorough analysis,
      pointing out that social media and satellite imagery provide ample evidence of
      the scale of casualties, particularly in Ukraine, where numerous funeral images
      and grave sites are documented, unlike in Russia. The author emphasizes the need
      for more rigorous data analysis to accurately assess the situation on both sides.

      900,000 and 1.3m Russian casualties since the war began, including some 190,000–350,000

      condemning blatant Ukrainian attacks on Russian civilians. Here is what he said
      during the impromptu presser at the start of the Thursday cabinet meeting. I’m
      NOT happy with Putin. He’s killing a lot of people… his soldiers and their soldiers.
      Trump got it only half-right… Putin is not killing a lot of his soldiers . Russian
      tactics, notwithstanding Western propaganda, eschew mass assaults and employ small
      unit tactics that minimize Russian casualties. Then there is the gross disparity
      in firepower in favor of Russia.  Russia is hitting Ukrainian forces with artillery,
      aerial bombs, multiple rocket launcher systems (MRLS), mortars, drones and missiles.
      It is a simple math problem… Russia is hitting the Ukrainian troops with 30 to
      40 times the rate of fire compared to what Ukraine can employ. Moreover, Ukraine
      has limited options — i.e., they are short of artillery shells and replacement
      barrels; they cannot match Russia’s ability to produce and deploy drones; they
      have limited supplies of MRLS; and they have no effective combat air or missiles.
      This explains why Ukraine is suffering devastating losses in manpower. When you
      consider the amount of firepower that Russia has unloaded on Ukraine over the
      last 41 months, it is clear that Russia has taken great pains to avoid civilian
      casualties. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
      (OHCHR) has systematically reported on civilian casualties in Ukraine, attributing
      the overwhelming majority of deaths and injuries to Russian military actions since
      the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. As of May 31, 2025, the OHCHR
      recorded at least 13,341 civilians killed and 32,744 injured, noting the actual
      numbers are likely higher. If you can do simple division, you will know that works
      out to an average of 325 deaths per month. Compare that to the havoc that Israel
      has inflicted on the Palestinians in Gaza: The Gaza Health Ministry reported 57,762
      Palestinians killed as of July 10, 2025. This includes civilians and militants,
      with breakdowns often estimating ~70% women and children (though exact proportions
      are disputed). An additional ~14,000 are missing and presumed dead under rubble,
      potentially pushing the figure above 71,000. I personally believe the number is
      much higher, but for the sake of citing a specific source, let’s use 71,000… After
      21 months of attacks, an average of 3,381 Palestinians civilians are being killed
      each month. If you go with the Gaza Health Ministry number of 57,762, it is still
      a horrific 2,750. Let me put that number in perspective… During the Vietnam war,
      US military personnel experienced an average of 494 combat deaths per month. I
      started thinking about this after watching the video yesterday of Russia’s four
      Iskander missiles hitting Kiev. Those were precision shots and apparently did

  - title: Trump’s Schizophrenia Cannot Hide the US Lack of Strategic Depth
    url: https://sonar21.com/trumps-schizophrenia-cannot-hide-the-us-lack-of-strategic-depth/
    text: 'Patriot Missile Launcher Sometime in the next decade, I think the publishers
      of Roget’s Thesaurus will include, “Trump” as a new synonym for erratic . Trump
      executed another of his signature volte face during a meeting with his cabinet.
      According to The Economist : A MERICA ALARMED Ukraine, and European allies, when
      it abruptly halted weapons shipments to Ukraine earlier this month (July 3rd).
      Just as suddenly, President Donald Trump countermanded the order on July 7th.
      “We are going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend
      themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now.” Within hours, the Pentagon confirmed
      it would send “additional defensive weapons”. Former Russian President Medvedev,
      wasted no time skewering Trump with this post: Looks like the Russians are not
      impressed with Trump’s fickle behavior and will continue to pulverize the Ukrainians.
      Although Trump’s decision to send Ukraine some more weapons for defense was interpreted
      as something that will happen quickly, Sean Parnell, the spokesman for DOD Secretary
      Hegseth : insists that the process to “evaluate military shipments across the
      globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defence priorities”.
      This implies that some weapons could still be held back from Ukraine. What Trump
      does not understand is that the ability of the US to supply a variety of weapon
      systems — both offensive and defensive — is constrained by a lack of supplies
      and a weak industrial capability to ramp up production. Let’s take a look at some
      of the systems: PATRIOT MISSILES : Start with the understanding that at least
      two Patriot missiles are fired at an inbound missile. During the last three days,
      Russia has launched more than 1300 missiles and drones at Ukraine. The annual
      US production of Patriot missiles—specifically the PAC-3 MSE variant—is currently
      about 500 missiles per year . Production is contractually obligated to increase
      to 550 per year by mid-2025 and is expected to reach 650 per year by mid-2027.
      When including both PAC-2 and PAC-3 variants (produced by Lockheed Martin and
      Raytheon), the total US production is projected at around 740 Patriot missiles
      per year in 2025, with plans to ramp up to approximately 1,100 per year by 2027.
      In other words, if Ukraine tried to shoot down each of the 1300 missiles and drones
      launched this week by Russia, that volley would have consumed more than three
      years of current Patriot production. At what cost? The cost of a Patriot missile
      depends on the variant: • PAC-2 GEM-T missile: Approximately $4 million per missile.
      • PAC-3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement) missile: Approximately $7 million per
      missile. M1 ABRAMS TANK : In 2024, the United States produced approximately 30
      M1 Abrams tanks. This figure reflects a reduction from previous years and aligns
      with the US Army’s FY2024 budget plans, which projected the production of 30 tanks
      for that year. Most of these are not brand-new builds from scratch but rather
      upgraded or rebuilt tanks—primarily conversions of older M1 variants to the latest
      configurations (such as the M1A2 SEPv3). The production is handled by General
      Dynamics Land Systems at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio.
      Russia, by contrast, is producing 10 times the number. In 2024, Russia produced
      an estimated 280 to 300 T-90M tanks. This figure is supported by multiple defense
      analysis sources, including the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), Army Recognition,
      and Military Watch Magazine, all of which report a significant surge in production
      compared to prewar levels. The increase is attributed to expanded operations at
      the Uralvagonzavod plant, which shifted to a 24-hour, three-shift schedule to
      meet wartime demand. TERMINAL HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE MISSILES (THAAD) : Industry
      analysis and government reporting suggest the U.S. produces approximately 60–80
      THAAD interceptors per year. This estimate is based on historical production rates
      and recent increases in demand due to deployments in the Middle East and new orders
      from allies. Israel reportedly launched over 90 THAADs against Iranian ballistic
      missiles during the 12 day war. Each missile costs $13 million, which means $1.2
      billion worth of THAADs were expended in a fruitless effort to thwart the Iranian
      attacks. HIMARS MISSILES : In 2024, the United States produced approximately 14,000
      HIMARS missiles—specifically, Guided Multiple- Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets,
      which are the primary munitions used by the M142 HIMARS launcher. • Monthly production:
      As of September 2024, the U.S. was producing about 1,167 GMLRS rockets per month,
      a 40% increase from 2022 levels. • Annual production: At this rate, annual output
      is approximately 14,000 GMLRS rockets (1,167 × 12). The cost of an exported HIMARS
      missile is approximately $220,000. BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLES : In 2024, the United
      States contracted BAE Systems to produce more than 200 new modernized Bradley
      Fighting Vehicles, specifically the A4 variants (M2A4 and M7A4). This production
      surge is in response to the need to replenish vehicles sent to Ukraine and to
      modernize the Army’s fleet. These vehicles are primarily modernized/upgraded from
      older variants rather than entirely new-builds, reflecting current US Army procurement
      and modernization strategies. The modernized M2A4 Bradley currently costs about
      $4.35 million per vehicle as of recent US Army procurement in the mid-2020s. As
      of early July 2025, Russia has destroyed, damaged, abandoned, or captured at least
      140 Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFVs) supplied to Ukraine since February 2022,
      according to the open-source intelligence group Oryx and multiple defense analysis
      reports. This figure includes vehicles that are visually confirmed as destroyed,
      damaged, abandoned, or captured in combat. That is $609 million dollars lost in
      Ukraine. STINGER MISSILES : The United States currently produces about 40 Stinger
      missiles per month, with plans to increase production to 60 per month by 2025—a
      50% increase from the current rate. This means the annual production rate in 2024
      is approximately 480 Stinger missiles, with a target of 720 missiles per year
      once the ramp-up is complete. 155 MM ARTILLERY SHELLS : In 2024, the United States
      produced approximately 400,000 to 480,000 155 mm artillery shells. The cost of
      a 155 mm artillery shell depends on the type: • Standard (unguided) 155 mm shell:
      • Current market price is approximately €3,300–€4,000 per shell (about $3,600–$4,400
      USD as of 2024). • US Army procurement data for the XM1113 round lists a unit
      cost of about $13,656 per shell, and the XM1113 Extended Range round at $14,484.
      These figures may include additional costs related to U.S. military procurement.
      • Precision-guided 155 mm shell (e.g., M982 Excalibur): • Costs over $110,000
      per shell. 155 MM HOWITZERS : In 2024, the United States produced approximately
      200–250 new 155 mm howitzers. The US Army’s primary 155 mm howitzers are the M777
      (towed) and the M109A7 Paladin (self-propelled). Russian drone manufacturer ZALA
      claims that nearly 200 American-made M777 howitzers supplied to Ukraine have been
      destroyed by Russian Lancet drones since February 2022. In 2024, the United States
      produced fewer than 30 replacement barrels per month for the M777 howitzer, totaling
      fewer than 360 barrels for the year. The sole US production facility, Watervliet
      Arsenal, was unable to meet the “unprecedented demand” created by Ukraine’s high
      rate of artillery fire, which led to rapid barrel wear and an urgent need for
      replacements. The cost of a replacement barrel (M776 cannon tube) for the M777
      howitzer is approximately $690,000 USD. This figure is based on Canada’s June
      2022 contract to provide 10 replacement barrels to Ukraine for a total of $6.9
      million. As you can see, the US production of these weapons systems is anemic
      and expensive. Moreover, the demand for these systems is not confined to Ukraine…
      Israel, Taiwan and other US allies also need these weapons, as well as the US
      providing supplies for its own forces. Uncle Sam has become Old Mother Hubbard
      … The cupboard is bare. Danny Davis and I had an interesting chat today about

      regarding military support for Ukraine, highlighting a recent instance where he
      abruptly halted and then reversed a decision to stop weapons shipments to the
      country. Following his reversal, the Pentagon confirmed the dispatch of additional
      defensive weapons, although concerns were raised about the U.S.'s ability to supply
      these due to limited production capabilities. The article emphasizes the challenges
      faced in ramping up the production of critical systems like Patriot missiles,
      which are essential for Ukraine's defense against Russian attacks, particularly
      given the high volume of missiles and drones launched by Russia. Overall, the

    text: 'Patriot Missile Launcher Sometime in the next decade, I think the publishers
      of Roget’s Thesaurus will include, “Trump” as a new synonym for erratic . Trump
      executed another of his signature volte face during a meeting with his cabinet.
      According to The Economist : A MERICA ALARMED Ukraine, and European allies, when
      it abruptly halted weapons shipments to Ukraine earlier this month (July 3rd).
      Just as suddenly, President Donald Trump countermanded the order on July 7th.
      “We are going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend
      themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now.” Within hours, the Pentagon confirmed
      it would send “additional defensive weapons”. Former Russian President Medvedev,
      wasted no time skewering Trump with this post: Looks like the Russians are not
      impressed with Trump’s fickle behavior and will continue to pulverize the Ukrainians.
      Although Trump’s decision to send Ukraine some more weapons for defense was interpreted
      as something that will happen quickly, Sean Parnell, the spokesman for DOD Secretary
      Hegseth : insists that the process to “evaluate military shipments across the
      globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defence priorities”.
      This implies that some weapons could still be held back from Ukraine. What Trump
      does not understand is that the ability of the US to supply a variety of weapon
      systems — both offensive and defensive — is constrained by a lack of supplies
      and a weak industrial capability to ramp up production. Let’s take a look at some
      of the systems: PATRIOT MISSILES : Start with the understanding that at least
      two Patriot missiles are fired at an inbound missile. During the last three days,
      Russia has launched more than 1300 missiles and drones at Ukraine. The annual
      US production of Patriot missiles—specifically the PAC-3 MSE variant—is currently
      about 500 missiles per year . Production is contractually obligated to increase
      to 550 per year by mid-2025 and is expected to reach 650 per year by mid-2027.
      When including both PAC-2 and PAC-3 variants (produced by Lockheed Martin and
      Raytheon), the total US production is projected at around 740 Patriot missiles
      per year in 2025, with plans to ramp up to approximately 1,100 per year by 2027.
      In other words, if Ukraine tried to shoot down each of the 1300 missiles and drones
      launched this week by Russia, that volley would have consumed more than three
      years of current Patriot production. At what cost? The cost of a Patriot missile
      depends on the variant: • PAC-2 GEM-T missile: Approximately $4 million per missile.
      • PAC-3 MSE (Missile Segment Enhancement) missile: Approximately $7 million per
      missile. M1 ABRAMS TANK : In 2024, the United States produced approximately 30
      M1 Abrams tanks. This figure reflects a reduction from previous years and aligns
      with the US Army’s FY2024 budget plans, which projected the production of 30 tanks
      for that year. Most of these are not brand-new builds from scratch but rather
      upgraded or rebuilt tanks—primarily conversions of older M1 variants to the latest
      configurations (such as the M1A2 SEPv3). The production is handled by General
      Dynamics Land Systems at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio.
      Russia, by contrast, is producing 10 times the number. In 2024, Russia produced
      an estimated 280 to 300 T-90M tanks. This figure is supported by multiple defense
      analysis sources, including the Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), Army Recognition,
      and Military Watch Magazine, all of which report a significant surge in production
      compared to prewar levels. The increase is attributed to expanded operations at
      the Uralvagonzavod plant, which shifted to a 24-hour, three-shift schedule to
      meet wartime demand. TERMINAL HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE MISSILES (THAAD) : Industry
      analysis and government reporting suggest the U.S. produces approximately 60–80
      THAAD interceptors per year. This estimate is based on historical production rates
      and recent increases in demand due to deployments in the Middle East and new orders
      from allies. Israel reportedly launched over 90 THAADs against Iranian ballistic
      missiles during the 12 day war. Each missile costs $13 million, which means $1.2
      billion worth of THAADs were expended in a fruitless effort to thwart the Iranian
      attacks. HIMARS MISSILES : In 2024, the United States produced approximately 14,000
      HIMARS missiles—specifically, Guided Multiple- Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) rockets,
      which are the primary munitions used by the M142 HIMARS launcher. • Monthly production:
      As of September 2024, the U.S. was producing about 1,167 GMLRS rockets per month,
      a 40% increase from 2022 levels. • Annual production: At this rate, annual output
      is approximately 14,000 GMLRS rockets (1,167 × 12). The cost of an exported HIMARS
      missile is approximately $220,000. BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLES : In 2024, the United
      States contracted BAE Systems to produce more than 200 new modernized Bradley
      Fighting Vehicles, specifically the A4 variants (M2A4 and M7A4). This production
      surge is in response to the need to replenish vehicles sent to Ukraine and to
      modernize the Army’s fleet. These vehicles are primarily modernized/upgraded from
      older variants rather than entirely new-builds, reflecting current US Army procurement
      and modernization strategies. The modernized M2A4 Bradley currently costs about
      $4.35 million per vehicle as of recent US Army procurement in the mid-2020s. As
      of early July 2025, Russia has destroyed, damaged, abandoned, or captured at least
      140 Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFVs) supplied to Ukraine since February 2022,
      according to the open-source intelligence group Oryx and multiple defense analysis
      reports. This figure includes vehicles that are visually confirmed as destroyed,
      damaged, abandoned, or captured in combat. That is $609 million dollars lost in
      Ukraine. STINGER MISSILES : The United States currently produces about 40 Stinger
      missiles per month, with plans to increase production to 60 per month by 2025—a
      50% increase from the current rate. This means the annual production rate in 2024
      is approximately 480 Stinger missiles, with a target of 720 missiles per year
      once the ramp-up is complete. 155 MM ARTILLERY SHELLS : In 2024, the United States
      produced approximately 400,000 to 480,000 155 mm artillery shells. The cost of
      a 155 mm artillery shell depends on the type: • Standard (unguided) 155 mm shell:
      • Current market price is approximately €3,300–€4,000 per shell (about $3,600–$4,400
      USD as of 2024). • US Army procurement data for the XM1113 round lists a unit
      cost of about $13,656 per shell, and the XM1113 Extended Range round at $14,484.
      These figures may include additional costs related to U.S. military procurement.
      • Precision-guided 155 mm shell (e.g., M982 Excalibur): • Costs over $110,000
      per shell. 155 MM HOWITZERS : In 2024, the United States produced approximately
      200–250 new 155 mm howitzers. The US Army’s primary 155 mm howitzers are the M777
      (towed) and the M109A7 Paladin (self-propelled). Russian drone manufacturer ZALA
      claims that nearly 200 American-made M777 howitzers supplied to Ukraine have been
      destroyed by Russian Lancet drones since February 2022. In 2024, the United States
      produced fewer than 30 replacement barrels per month for the M777 howitzer, totaling
      fewer than 360 barrels for the year. The sole US production facility, Watervliet
      Arsenal, was unable to meet the “unprecedented demand” created by Ukraine’s high
      rate of artillery fire, which led to rapid barrel wear and an urgent need for
      replacements. The cost of a replacement barrel (M776 cannon tube) for the M777
      howitzer is approximately $690,000 USD. This figure is based on Canada’s June
      2022 contract to provide 10 replacement barrels to Ukraine for a total of $6.9
      million. As you can see, the US production of these weapons systems is anemic
      and expensive. Moreover, the demand for these systems is not confined to Ukraine…
      Israel, Taiwan and other US allies also need these weapons, as well as the US
      providing supplies for its own forces. Uncle Sam has become Old Mother Hubbard
      … The cupboard is bare. Danny Davis and I had an interesting chat today about

    one_sentence_summary: President Trump exhibited erratic decision-making by abruptly
      halting and then reversing a ban on weapons shipments to Ukraine, prompting criticism
      from former Russian President Medvedev and raising concerns about the implications
      for Ukraine's defense.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses President Donald Trump's erratic decision-making
      regarding military support for Ukraine, highlighting a recent instance where he
      abruptly halted and then reversed a decision to stop weapons shipments to the
      country. Following his reversal, the Pentagon confirmed the dispatch of additional
      defensive weapons, although concerns were raised about the U.S.'s ability to supply
      these due to limited production capabilities. The article emphasizes the challenges
      faced in ramping up the production of critical systems like Patriot missiles,
      which are essential for Ukraine's defense against Russian attacks, particularly
      given the high volume of missiles and drones launched by Russia. Overall, the
      piece critiques Trump's inconsistent approach and the implications for U.S. military
      support amidst ongoing conflict.

    url: https://sonar21.com/the-war-on-truth-how-our-leaders-lie-while-pretending-not-to/
    text: '“Upon their strings, the papers dance, Ink-stained puppets, in dark romance,
      With sharpened quills, they pen their lies, To fan the flames, and stoke the cries.
      For war and ruin, they conspire, To set the world’s stage afire, With whispered
      words and twisted truth, They prey on minds, both old and youth.” “Freedom” —
      The Frontier Man When Language Becomes a Weapon On February 5, 2003, U.S. Secretary
      of State Colin Powell stood before the United Nations Security Council, holding
      up a small vial of white powder. “Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax,” he warned,
      “shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.” Then, looking around
      the chamber with solemn authority, he declared: “There can be no doubt that Saddam
      Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many
      more.” The room was silent. Powell was composed, deliberate, and gravely persuasive.
      He spoke of intercepted communications, decontamination trucks, and “mobile biological
      weapons factories.” At one point, he looked directly into the cameras and said:
      “Every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are
      not assertions. What we’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid
      intelligence.” The speech was a masterclass in performed sincerity: measured tone,
      scientific language, visual aids, and emotional appeals to fear and responsibility.
      And yet, the weapons were never found. The intelligence was deeply flawed. Years
      later, Powell called the speech a “painful” and “permanent blot” on his record.
      But by then, the damage was done. Believing his words, the United States hurtled
      toward an 8-year war that would cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions
      of dollars, destabilize an entire region, and erode trust in Western institutions
      for a generation. This moment was not just a policy failure—it was a linguistic
      deception event. It revealed how language, delivered with sincerity and confidence,
      can be used not just to mislead, but to fabricate consent for war. Powell did
      not scream. He did not lie in the crude, cartoonish fashion of a propagandist.
      He lied in the way that matters most today: with calm authority, persuasive language,
      and all the trappings of truth. Language is not just how we speak—it’s how we
      make sense of the world. We use words to describe reality, to build trust, to
      create laws, and to express values. But words can also be used to manipulate,
      to hide the truth, and to control how people think and feel. Today, many leaders
      lie—often not by making obvious false statements, but by bending language in subtle,
      clever ways. They say things that sound honest while hiding dishonesty beneath
      the surface. This essay explores how this form of deception works, why it’s so
      dangerous, and how we can learn to recognize it. As George Orwell wrote in his
      seminal 1946 essay Politics and the English Language , political language “is
      designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance
      of solidity to pure wind.” The philosopher Hannah Arendt warned that the destruction
      of truth is central to authoritarian rule. In her 1971 essay “Lying in Politics,”
      she argued that when facts become unstable, people become more susceptible to
      propaganda and demagogues. This essay follows their insights by examining how
      modern leaders cloak deception in respectable forms—and how language itself can
      become corrupted in the process. Here are some examples of how language is used
      to deceive: Empty Assurance: Saying Something Without Meaning Anything Sometimes
      leaders say things that seem reassuring, but don’t actually commit to any action.
      For example: “We take these concerns very seriously.” This sounds like a promise
      to act, but it’s often just a polite way to avoid doing anything concrete. It’s
      a way of pretending to care without taking responsibility. Passive Voice: Hiding
      Who’s Responsible In grammar, the passive voice is when something is done, but
      the person doing it isn’t named. Compare: Active voice : “We made mistakes.” Passive
      voice : “Mistakes were made.” Politicians and officials often use passive voice
      to avoid taking blame. If no one is named, no one can be held accountable. An
      example from real life: During the U.S. military prison scandal in Abu Ghraib
      (2004), officials used phrases like “abuses occurred” instead of “we committed
      abuses” —shifting attention away from the perpetrators. Euphemisms: Soft Words
      for Harsh Realities A euphemism is a mild or vague word used to replace one that
      might be upsetting or offensive. Leaders use euphemisms to make unpleasant truths
      sound acceptable. Examples: “Collateral damage” instead of killing civilians during
      a military strike. “Enhanced interrogation” instead of torture . “Restructuring”
      or “rightsizing” instead of laying people off . Euphemisms are used not just to
      protect feelings, but to control how people interpret events. They hide the emotional
      or moral weight of what’s really happening. Framing: Shaping How We See the World
      Framing means choosing words or phrases that guide people toward a specific interpretation,
      even if the facts don’t change. It’s like putting a photo in a red frame versus
      a black one—the image stays the same, but the mood changes. Examples: A protest
      can be framed as a “riot” (dangerous and chaotic) or a “movement for justice”
      (noble and necessary). A tax cut might be called “relief” (implying suffering)
      or “a handout to the rich” (implying unfairness). Framing is powerful because
      it affects how we emotionally and morally respond to events. Leaders and media
      often use framing to sway public opinion without changing the actual facts. Vagueness:
      Speaking Without Saying Anything Vague language allows leaders to appear like
      they are taking action or making promises, while avoiding specifics that could
      hold them accountable. For example: “We will explore all options.” This statement
      sounds responsible, but it doesn’t mean anything concrete. It creates the illusion
      of leadership without committing to a path. Similarly, companies say things like:
      “We are committed to sustainability.” What does “committed” mean here? Are there
      goals? Deadlines? Actions? Often, no. It’s a public relations move that sounds
      good but says little. Performed Sincerity: Acting Honest Without Being Honest
      Sometimes, deception doesn’t happen in the words themselves, but in how those
      words are delivered. Politicians often use body language, tone of voice, or emotional
      stories to appear sincere. Examples of performed sincerity : Speaking in a casual
      or emotional tone: “Look, folks… I understand.” Sharing personal stories: “As
      a mother/father, I know how hard this is.” Making eye contact, lowering the voice,
      or even crying. These cues signal honesty—but they can be faked. A speaker can
      appear heartfelt while saying something misleading or false. This is a kind of
      performance , and it’s powerful because humans are wired to trust people who seem
      sincere, even when we should be skeptical. Understanding Why Deceptive Language
      Works To resist manipulative language, we must also understand why it so often
      succeeds. Human cognition is not wired for constant vigilance. Psychologists have
      shown that we rely on mental shortcuts— heuristics —to process complex information
      quickly. When a speaker appears calm, authoritative, or emotionally in tune with
      our values, our brains often substitute these cues for critical scrutiny. This
      is known as the affect heuristic : we tend to judge statements as true if they
      are spoken with alleged authority, make us feel good, or align with our group
      identity. Moreover, confirmation bias leads people to accept claims that reinforce
      what they already believe, while discounting facts that challenge their worldview.
      Motivated reasoning —our tendency to reason toward a desired conclusion rather
      than truth—further compounds the problem. In this environment, performed sincerity
      becomes a powerful weapon. It doesn’t just bypass reason—it co-opts it. When paired
      with emotionally charged framing or repetition, such language can implant durable
      falsehoods in the public mind, even after the original claims are debunked. This
      is why political deception isn’t merely a moral failure—it is a psychological
      deception strategy. And countering it requires not just moral will, but also cognitive
      awareness. Why This Matters: The Collapse of Shared Truth When leaders constantly
      manipulate language, people stop trusting not just politicians—but words themselves.
      Eventually, facts become meaningless. People stop asking “Is this true?” and start
      asking “Is this what my side believes?” Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, in his essay
      On Bullshit , draws a crucial distinction: a liar knows the truth and hides it;
      a bullshitter is indifferent to whether what he says is true or false. Today’s
      crisis is not just the result of lies—it is a culture of indifference to truth
      itself. In such a world, language becomes noise, facts become partisan tokens,
      and public debate descends into meaningless spectacle. If words no longer connect
      us to reality, then democratic deliberation becomes impossible. This creates division,
      confusion, and cynicism. If everyone is lying, who can you believe? When words
      no longer describe reality, we can no longer solve real problems together. Society
      breaks down. What We Can Do: Becoming Language-Aware Citizens To fight back, we
      don’t need more shouting—we need better listening and sharper thinking. Everyone
      should learn how to spot dishonest language. Here’s how: Question euphemisms :
      What’s the real thing being described? Ask who’s responsible : Is the speaker
      avoiding blame? Look for specifics : Are they telling you what they’ll actually
      do? Watch for performance : Do they sound honest—or are they being honest? Compare
      frames : Are you being nudged toward one moral viewpoint without being shown the
      full picture? Being alert to these tricks doesn’t make us cynical—it makes us
      better citizens. We can demand clarity. We can call out manipulation. We can protect
      the connection between words and truth. A Way Forward: Concrete Steps for Rebuilding
      a Truthful Society Recognizing the problem is the first step. Acting on it is
      the next. Rebuilding a culture that values truth in public language requires specific,
      systemic interventions. These steps—especially in education, media, governance,
      and technology—can begin to reverse the damage caused by manipulative speech.
      Language and Media Literacy Education in Schools We must teach students not only
      what to think but how to think critically about language. Curriculum on rhetoric
      and propaganda should begin by middle school. Students should learn to identify
      propaganda, euphemisms, spin, framing, passive constructions, and emotional manipulation
      in advertising, political speech, and media. Classroom news analysis can train
      students to compare headlines and coverage across ideological outlets, helping
      them spot biases and distortion. Practical exercises should include rewriting
      euphemistic or vague statements in plain, honest language and exploring how wording
      changes perception. By making this a core part of education, we will empower future
      generations to resist manipulation and demand integrity from their leaders. Adult
      Education and Public Campaigns Not everyone went to school in the age of digital
      misinformation. We need public-facing efforts to raise linguistic awareness among
      adults: Community workshops in libraries, unions, and civic centers can offer
      training on spotting deceptive language in news and politics. Public service announcements
      and social media campaigns can highlight common tricks of misleading language
      (e.g., “What does ‘mistakes were made’ really mean?”). Nonprofit alliances can
      produce open-source toolkits for media consumers and educators to analyze public
      speech. This is civic hygiene: just as we teach people to recognize fraud in finance,
      we should teach them to recognize fraud in language. Transparency Standards for
      Political Communication Laws cannot—and should not—ban free speech. Censorship
      is not the answer—we must cherish and enforce the precious First Amendment. As
      history tells us, any attempt to ban “wrong” speech results in necessarily appointing
      an “arbiter of truth” who becomes a totalitarian censor. The answer to deceptive
      or misleading speech is not censorship but more truthful speech and more transparency.
      But we can push for transparency in how public messaging is produced and labeled:
      Plain language laws can require that laws, regulations, government forms, and
      official statements be written in clear, accessible, jargon-free language. Full
      disclosure of conflicts of interest : Just as we require financial disclosures
      in advertising, all public officials and public campaigns should disclose who
      funds them. Independent fact-checking bodies , protected from political control,
      should have a visible role in live broadcasts, debates, and digital content—flagging
      vague or misleading claims in real time. Linguistic Integrity in Journalism and
      Media Media organizations must take responsibility for the language they amplify.
      Editorial guidelines for clarity and accountability must be introduced which should
      discourage the use of untruthful and misleading language. Headlines and soundbites
      should be held to high standards of factual accuracy and linguistic honesty. Media
      watchdogs must be strengthened and made more visible to the public. We need to
      praise not just good reporting—but good language use in reporting. Precision must
      be seen as a journalistic virtue. Tech Solutions with Human Oversight Social media
      platforms shape much of our public discourse. Their algorithms reward emotional,
      simplistic, or manipulative language. Algorithmic transparency laws should require
      platforms to reveal how engagement is promoted and whether misleading content
      is being amplified. Linguistic flagging tools : AI-based browser extensions and
      apps can highlight vague, passive, or euphemistic language in real time—offering
      users plain-language summaries or counterpoints. Tech should help us think more
      clearly, not manipulate us more efficiently. Living in Truth: A Cultural Shift
      Toward Courageous Speech Václav Havel, the dissident playwright who became president
      of a free Czechoslovakia, believed that “even a single act of truth can shatter
      the lie.” In The Power of the Powerless , he described “living in truth” not as
      heroism, but as the quiet refusal to speak what one does not believe. In an age
      of linguistic distortion, this refusal becomes a revolutionary act. We need to
      demand a new cultural norm—one that prizes clarity over spin, truth over polish,
      and moral courage over rhetorical manipulation. Beyond policy and education, this
      crisis is ultimately moral. We must reward those who speak clearly and truthfully—even
      when their message is uncomfortable. Celebrate plainspoken truth-tellers in journalism,
      media, literature, and public service. Ensure strong whistleblower protections
      for those who take risks to tell the truth to the public. Create cultural norms
      where untruthful, misleading, and manipulative speech is seen as cowardly, unacceptable,
      and disqualifying from public service, not clever. Call out deceptive speech not
      just as partisan error, but as a civic betrayal. Truth must become our core value
      again—not through nostalgia, but through example, courage, and clarity. Reclaiming
      the Moral Power of Language In our time, speaking clearly and truthfully—refusing
      euphemisms, spin, and pretense—is an act of civic duty. Language must again become
      a vessel for truth and conscience. Words are not decorations. They are tools of
      meaning, tools of truth—or tools of deception. When leaders lie while pretending
      not to, they unravel the thread of truth that ties language to reality. That thread
      of truth must be rebuilt—not just by linguists or educators, but by all of us.
      To restore truth in society, we must start with language. That means valuing honesty
      over smooth talk, substance over style, and integrity over performance. It means
      reclaiming our right to words that mean what they say. Because when we lose that,
      we don’t just lose trust—we lose our grip on reality. We can no longer understand
      what is happening and have a truthful debate about our most important issues.
      And without that debate, democracy cannot stand. Education is our foundation.
      Vigilance is our duty. Clarity is our weapon. To speak truthfully is to act morally.
      To teach truthfulness is to defend democracy. And to demand truth from power is
      not just our right—it is our responsibility. “Reclaim the right to think and live,
      by values that we choose, And to ourselves our essence give, no longer to abuse.
      A revolution of the mind, rebellion of the soul. In every heart, a spark we’ll
      find, to make the broken whole. A sovereign people, wild and free, we rise to
      break the chain. And in our freedom, we shall see, our true selves once again.”

    text: '“Upon their strings, the papers dance, Ink-stained puppets, in dark romance,
      With sharpened quills, they pen their lies, To fan the flames, and stoke the cries.
      For war and ruin, they conspire, To set the world’s stage afire, With whispered
      words and twisted truth, They prey on minds, both old and youth.” “Freedom” —
      The Frontier Man When Language Becomes a Weapon On February 5, 2003, U.S. Secretary
      of State Colin Powell stood before the United Nations Security Council, holding
      up a small vial of white powder. “Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax,” he warned,
      “shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.” Then, looking around
      the chamber with solemn authority, he declared: “There can be no doubt that Saddam
      Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many
      more.” The room was silent. Powell was composed, deliberate, and gravely persuasive.
      He spoke of intercepted communications, decontamination trucks, and “mobile biological
      weapons factories.” At one point, he looked directly into the cameras and said:
      “Every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are
      not assertions. What we’re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid
      intelligence.” The speech was a masterclass in performed sincerity: measured tone,
      scientific language, visual aids, and emotional appeals to fear and responsibility.
      And yet, the weapons were never found. The intelligence was deeply flawed. Years
      later, Powell called the speech a “painful” and “permanent blot” on his record.
      But by then, the damage was done. Believing his words, the United States hurtled
      toward an 8-year war that would cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions
      of dollars, destabilize an entire region, and erode trust in Western institutions
      for a generation. This moment was not just a policy failure—it was a linguistic
      deception event. It revealed how language, delivered with sincerity and confidence,
      can be used not just to mislead, but to fabricate consent for war. Powell did
      not scream. He did not lie in the crude, cartoonish fashion of a propagandist.
      He lied in the way that matters most today: with calm authority, persuasive language,
      and all the trappings of truth. Language is not just how we speak—it’s how we
      make sense of the world. We use words to describe reality, to build trust, to
      create laws, and to express values. But words can also be used to manipulate,
      to hide the truth, and to control how people think and feel. Today, many leaders
      lie—often not by making obvious false statements, but by bending language in subtle,
      clever ways. They say things that sound honest while hiding dishonesty beneath
      the surface. This essay explores how this form of deception works, why it’s so
      dangerous, and how we can learn to recognize it. As George Orwell wrote in his
      seminal 1946 essay Politics and the English Language , political language “is
      designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance
      of solidity to pure wind.” The philosopher Hannah Arendt warned that the destruction
      of truth is central to authoritarian rule. In her 1971 essay “Lying in Politics,”
      she argued that when facts become unstable, people become more susceptible to
      propaganda and demagogues. This essay follows their insights by examining how
      modern leaders cloak deception in respectable forms—and how language itself can
      become corrupted in the process. Here are some examples of how language is used
      to deceive: Empty Assurance: Saying Something Without Meaning Anything Sometimes
      leaders say things that seem reassuring, but don’t actually commit to any action.
      For example: “We take these concerns very seriously.” This sounds like a promise
      to act, but it’s often just a polite way to avoid doing anything concrete. It’s
      a way of pretending to care without taking responsibility. Passive Voice: Hiding
      Who’s Responsible In grammar, the passive voice is when something is done, but
      the person doing it isn’t named. Compare: Active voice : “We made mistakes.” Passive
      voice : “Mistakes were made.” Politicians and officials often use passive voice
      to avoid taking blame. If no one is named, no one can be held accountable. An
      example from real life: During the U.S. military prison scandal in Abu Ghraib
      (2004), officials used phrases like “abuses occurred” instead of “we committed
      abuses” —shifting attention away from the perpetrators. Euphemisms: Soft Words
      for Harsh Realities A euphemism is a mild or vague word used to replace one that
      might be upsetting or offensive. Leaders use euphemisms to make unpleasant truths
      sound acceptable. Examples: “Collateral damage” instead of killing civilians during
      a military strike. “Enhanced interrogation” instead of torture . “Restructuring”
      or “rightsizing” instead of laying people off . Euphemisms are used not just to
      protect feelings, but to control how people interpret events. They hide the emotional
      or moral weight of what’s really happening. Framing: Shaping How We See the World
      Framing means choosing words or phrases that guide people toward a specific interpretation,
      even if the facts don’t change. It’s like putting a photo in a red frame versus
      a black one—the image stays the same, but the mood changes. Examples: A protest
      can be framed as a “riot” (dangerous and chaotic) or a “movement for justice”
      (noble and necessary). A tax cut might be called “relief” (implying suffering)
      or “a handout to the rich” (implying unfairness). Framing is powerful because
      it affects how we emotionally and morally respond to events. Leaders and media
      often use framing to sway public opinion without changing the actual facts. Vagueness:
      Speaking Without Saying Anything Vague language allows leaders to appear like
      they are taking action or making promises, while avoiding specifics that could
      hold them accountable. For example: “We will explore all options.” This statement
      sounds responsible, but it doesn’t mean anything concrete. It creates the illusion
      of leadership without committing to a path. Similarly, companies say things like:
      “We are committed to sustainability.” What does “committed” mean here? Are there
      goals? Deadlines? Actions? Often, no. It’s a public relations move that sounds
      good but says little. Performed Sincerity: Acting Honest Without Being Honest
      Sometimes, deception doesn’t happen in the words themselves, but in how those
      words are delivered. Politicians often use body language, tone of voice, or emotional
      stories to appear sincere. Examples of performed sincerity : Speaking in a casual
      or emotional tone: “Look, folks… I understand.” Sharing personal stories: “As
      a mother/father, I know how hard this is.” Making eye contact, lowering the voice,
      or even crying. These cues signal honesty—but they can be faked. A speaker can
      appear heartfelt while saying something misleading or false. This is a kind of
      performance , and it’s powerful because humans are wired to trust people who seem
      sincere, even when we should be skeptical. Understanding Why Deceptive Language
      Works To resist manipulative language, we must also understand why it so often
      succeeds. Human cognition is not wired for constant vigilance. Psychologists have
      shown that we rely on mental shortcuts— heuristics —to process complex information
      quickly. When a speaker appears calm, authoritative, or emotionally in tune with
      our values, our brains often substitute these cues for critical scrutiny. This
      is known as the affect heuristic : we tend to judge statements as true if they
      are spoken with alleged authority, make us feel good, or align with our group
      identity. Moreover, confirmation bias leads people to accept claims that reinforce
      what they already believe, while discounting facts that challenge their worldview.
      Motivated reasoning —our tendency to reason toward a desired conclusion rather
      than truth—further compounds the problem. In this environment, performed sincerity
      becomes a powerful weapon. It doesn’t just bypass reason—it co-opts it. When paired
      with emotionally charged framing or repetition, such language can implant durable
      falsehoods in the public mind, even after the original claims are debunked. This
      is why political deception isn’t merely a moral failure—it is a psychological
      deception strategy. And countering it requires not just moral will, but also cognitive
      awareness. Why This Matters: The Collapse of Shared Truth When leaders constantly
      manipulate language, people stop trusting not just politicians—but words themselves.
      Eventually, facts become meaningless. People stop asking “Is this true?” and start
      asking “Is this what my side believes?” Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, in his essay
      On Bullshit , draws a crucial distinction: a liar knows the truth and hides it;
      a bullshitter is indifferent to whether what he says is true or false. Today’s
      crisis is not just the result of lies—it is a culture of indifference to truth
      itself. In such a world, language becomes noise, facts become partisan tokens,
      and public debate descends into meaningless spectacle. If words no longer connect
      us to reality, then democratic deliberation becomes impossible. This creates division,
      confusion, and cynicism. If everyone is lying, who can you believe? When words
      no longer describe reality, we can no longer solve real problems together. Society
      breaks down. What We Can Do: Becoming Language-Aware Citizens To fight back, we
      don’t need more shouting—we need better listening and sharper thinking. Everyone
      should learn how to spot dishonest language. Here’s how: Question euphemisms :
      What’s the real thing being described? Ask who’s responsible : Is the speaker
      avoiding blame? Look for specifics : Are they telling you what they’ll actually
      do? Watch for performance : Do they sound honest—or are they being honest? Compare
      frames : Are you being nudged toward one moral viewpoint without being shown the
      full picture? Being alert to these tricks doesn’t make us cynical—it makes us
      better citizens. We can demand clarity. We can call out manipulation. We can protect
      the connection between words and truth. A Way Forward: Concrete Steps for Rebuilding
      a Truthful Society Recognizing the problem is the first step. Acting on it is
      the next. Rebuilding a culture that values truth in public language requires specific,
      systemic interventions. These steps—especially in education, media, governance,
      and technology—can begin to reverse the damage caused by manipulative speech.
      Language and Media Literacy Education in Schools We must teach students not only
      what to think but how to think critically about language. Curriculum on rhetoric
      and propaganda should begin by middle school. Students should learn to identify
      propaganda, euphemisms, spin, framing, passive constructions, and emotional manipulation
      in advertising, political speech, and media. Classroom news analysis can train
      students to compare headlines and coverage across ideological outlets, helping
      them spot biases and distortion. Practical exercises should include rewriting
      euphemistic or vague statements in plain, honest language and exploring how wording
      changes perception. By making this a core part of education, we will empower future
      generations to resist manipulation and demand integrity from their leaders. Adult
      Education and Public Campaigns Not everyone went to school in the age of digital
      misinformation. We need public-facing efforts to raise linguistic awareness among
      adults: Community workshops in libraries, unions, and civic centers can offer
      training on spotting deceptive language in news and politics. Public service announcements
      and social media campaigns can highlight common tricks of misleading language
      (e.g., “What does ‘mistakes were made’ really mean?”). Nonprofit alliances can
      produce open-source toolkits for media consumers and educators to analyze public
      speech. This is civic hygiene: just as we teach people to recognize fraud in finance,
      we should teach them to recognize fraud in language. Transparency Standards for
      Political Communication Laws cannot—and should not—ban free speech. Censorship
      is not the answer—we must cherish and enforce the precious First Amendment. As
      history tells us, any attempt to ban “wrong” speech results in necessarily appointing
      an “arbiter of truth” who becomes a totalitarian censor. The answer to deceptive
      or misleading speech is not censorship but more truthful speech and more transparency.
      But we can push for transparency in how public messaging is produced and labeled:
      Plain language laws can require that laws, regulations, government forms, and
      official statements be written in clear, accessible, jargon-free language. Full
      disclosure of conflicts of interest : Just as we require financial disclosures
      in advertising, all public officials and public campaigns should disclose who
      funds them. Independent fact-checking bodies , protected from political control,
      should have a visible role in live broadcasts, debates, and digital content—flagging
      vague or misleading claims in real time. Linguistic Integrity in Journalism and
      Media Media organizations must take responsibility for the language they amplify.
      Editorial guidelines for clarity and accountability must be introduced which should
      discourage the use of untruthful and misleading language. Headlines and soundbites
      should be held to high standards of factual accuracy and linguistic honesty. Media
      watchdogs must be strengthened and made more visible to the public. We need to
      praise not just good reporting—but good language use in reporting. Precision must
      be seen as a journalistic virtue. Tech Solutions with Human Oversight Social media
      platforms shape much of our public discourse. Their algorithms reward emotional,
      simplistic, or manipulative language. Algorithmic transparency laws should require
      platforms to reveal how engagement is promoted and whether misleading content
      is being amplified. Linguistic flagging tools : AI-based browser extensions and
      apps can highlight vague, passive, or euphemistic language in real time—offering
      users plain-language summaries or counterpoints. Tech should help us think more
      clearly, not manipulate us more efficiently. Living in Truth: A Cultural Shift
      Toward Courageous Speech Václav Havel, the dissident playwright who became president
      of a free Czechoslovakia, believed that “even a single act of truth can shatter
      the lie.” In The Power of the Powerless , he described “living in truth” not as
      heroism, but as the quiet refusal to speak what one does not believe. In an age
      of linguistic distortion, this refusal becomes a revolutionary act. We need to
      demand a new cultural norm—one that prizes clarity over spin, truth over polish,
      and moral courage over rhetorical manipulation. Beyond policy and education, this
      crisis is ultimately moral. We must reward those who speak clearly and truthfully—even
      when their message is uncomfortable. Celebrate plainspoken truth-tellers in journalism,
      media, literature, and public service. Ensure strong whistleblower protections
      for those who take risks to tell the truth to the public. Create cultural norms
      where untruthful, misleading, and manipulative speech is seen as cowardly, unacceptable,
      and disqualifying from public service, not clever. Call out deceptive speech not
      just as partisan error, but as a civic betrayal. Truth must become our core value
      again—not through nostalgia, but through example, courage, and clarity. Reclaiming
      the Moral Power of Language In our time, speaking clearly and truthfully—refusing
      euphemisms, spin, and pretense—is an act of civic duty. Language must again become
      a vessel for truth and conscience. Words are not decorations. They are tools of
      meaning, tools of truth—or tools of deception. When leaders lie while pretending
      not to, they unravel the thread of truth that ties language to reality. That thread
      of truth must be rebuilt—not just by linguists or educators, but by all of us.
      To restore truth in society, we must start with language. That means valuing honesty
      over smooth talk, substance over style, and integrity over performance. It means
      reclaiming our right to words that mean what they say. Because when we lose that,
      we don’t just lose trust—we lose our grip on reality. We can no longer understand
      what is happening and have a truthful debate about our most important issues.
      And without that debate, democracy cannot stand. Education is our foundation.
      Vigilance is our duty. Clarity is our weapon. To speak truthfully is to act morally.
      To teach truthfulness is to defend democracy. And to demand truth from power is
      not just our right—it is our responsibility. “Reclaim the right to think and live,
      by values that we choose, And to ourselves our essence give, no longer to abuse.
      A revolution of the mind, rebellion of the soul. In every heart, a spark we’ll
      find, to make the broken whole. A sovereign people, wild and free, we rise to
      break the chain. And in our freedom, we shall see, our true selves once again.”

    url: https://sonar21.com/russias-demands-for-ending-the-war-in-ukraine/
    text: 'Screen grab of BORZZIKMAN’s Latest Video Donald Trump still has not learned
      a thing from his conversations with Vladimir Putin. Instead of ending all US military
      and intelligence assistance given to Ukraine, Trump is now doing a Joe Biden impersonation
      by announcing that he is going to send more weapons to Ukraine. During a public
      portion of his meeting with Israel’s Bibi Netanyahu on July 7, Trump said the
      following about Ukraine: We’re going to send some more weapons. We have to. They
      have to be able to defend themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now.” This
      announcement came just days after his administration had paused certain weapons
      shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns about US military stockpiles. This is crazy.
      The problem with shortages of US stockpiles has not gone away. Trump has a habit
      of saying things for public consumption, but then never following through. Remember
      when he threatened to hit BRICS countries with 100% tariffs? If the photo at the
      top of this piece is accurate, then Ukraine’s demise could come more quickly than
      many in the West anticipate. If you are still struggling to understand what Russia’s
      position is with respect to ending the war, please read the following remarks
      of  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, made during an interview with the
      Hungarian media outlet, Magyar Nemzet . Lavrov said: A sustainable settlement
      is impossible without addressing the root causes of the conflict. Above all, the
      security threats posed by NATO expansion and Ukraine’s potential accession to
      the Alliance must be eliminated, as they directly affect Russia. It is equally
      important to ensure respect for human rights in territories still under the control
      of the Kiev regime, where everything linked to Russia, Russians, and Russian-speaking
      people has been systematically destroyed since 2014 — the Russian language, culture,
      traditions, canonical Orthodoxy, and Russian-language media. There must be international
      legal recognition of the new territorial realities formed following the accession
      of Crimea, Sevastopol, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as

    text: 'Screen grab of BORZZIKMAN’s Latest Video Donald Trump still has not learned
      a thing from his conversations with Vladimir Putin. Instead of ending all US military
      and intelligence assistance given to Ukraine, Trump is now doing a Joe Biden impersonation
      by announcing that he is going to send more weapons to Ukraine. During a public
      portion of his meeting with Israel’s Bibi Netanyahu on July 7, Trump said the
      following about Ukraine: We’re going to send some more weapons. We have to. They
      have to be able to defend themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now.” This
      announcement came just days after his administration had paused certain weapons
      shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns about US military stockpiles. This is crazy.
      The problem with shortages of US stockpiles has not gone away. Trump has a habit
      of saying things for public consumption, but then never following through. Remember
      when he threatened to hit BRICS countries with 100% tariffs? If the photo at the
      top of this piece is accurate, then Ukraine’s demise could come more quickly than
      many in the West anticipate. If you are still struggling to understand what Russia’s
      position is with respect to ending the war, please read the following remarks
      of  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, made during an interview with the
      Hungarian media outlet, Magyar Nemzet . Lavrov said: A sustainable settlement
      is impossible without addressing the root causes of the conflict. Above all, the
      security threats posed by NATO expansion and Ukraine’s potential accession to
      the Alliance must be eliminated, as they directly affect Russia. It is equally
      important to ensure respect for human rights in territories still under the control
      of the Kiev regime, where everything linked to Russia, Russians, and Russian-speaking
      people has been systematically destroyed since 2014 — the Russian language, culture,
      traditions, canonical Orthodoxy, and Russian-language media. There must be international
      legal recognition of the new territorial realities formed following the accession
      of Crimea, Sevastopol, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, as well as
      the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions into the Russian Federation. On the agenda
      are the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, lifting of anti-Russian
      sanctions, withdrawal of lawsuits against Russia, and return of illegally frozen

    text: 'At the end of this essay, I have posted my latest interview with Alex Krainer,
      where we discuss the West’s current offensive to derail BRICS . While the Western
      media, especially the establishment media in the United States, continue to ignore
      BRICS and pretend that nothing important is happening, I believe that the financial
      leaders privately recognize that BRICS presents a potentially formidable threat
      to a Western-dominated financial system. Furthermore, I believe that the Western
      intelligence agencies are working feverishly to sow unrest in Armenia, Azerbaijan,
      Georgia, Iran, India and Pakistan in order to throw a monkey wrench into BRICS
      , as it works to develop an alternative to being held hostage to the US dollar.
      I have some surprising statistics for you, but you’ll have to read further to
      find out. Let’s start with a summary of the key results from the 2025 BRICS conference
      in Rio de Janeiro: Expansion and Membership • The BRICS group reaffirmed its commitment
      to expansion, welcoming new members and discussing further enlargement. • There
      was consensus on deepening cooperation with recently admitted countries and evaluating
      applications from additional interested nations. Economic Cooperation • BRICS
      leaders agreed to strengthen trade and investment ties among member states, with
      a focus on reducing reliance on the US dollar in cross-border transactions. •
      The summit advanced discussions on creating a common payment system and expanding
      the use of local currencies for trade within the bloc. Development Initiatives
      • The New Development Bank (NDB) announced new funding for infrastructure and
      green-energy projects across member countries. • Special emphasis was placed on
      supporting sustainable development and climate resilience in the Global South.
      Geopolitical Stance • The BRICS nations issued a joint statement calling for a
      multipolar world order, emphasizing respect for international law and the sovereignty
      of nations. • The group expressed concern over ongoing global conflicts and called
      for peaceful resolutions through dialogue. Technology and Innovation • The summit
      launched new initiatives for cooperation in digital infrastructure, artificial
      intelligence, and cybersecurity. • Plans were made to establish a BRICS technology
      forum to share expertise and foster innovation. Global Governance Reform • BRICS
      leaders reiterated calls for reform of major international institutions, including
      the United Nations Security Council and the International Monetary Fund, to better
      reflect the interests of emerging economies. As a reminder, the BRICS group includes
      the following member countries at the start of the conference: 1. Brazil 2. Russia
      3. India 4. China 5. South Africa 6. Egypt 7. Ethiopia 8. Iran 9. Saudi Arabia
      10. United Arab Emirates (UAE) As of Sunday, the BRICS Rio de Janeiro Declaration

      BRICS as official partner countries . They are: Belarus The Plurinational State
      of Bolivia Kazakhstan Cuba Indonesia Nigeria Malaysia Thailand Vietnam Uganda
      Uzbekistan All of these countries combined represent 55% of the world’s population.
      Although these 21 countries account for only 30% of the world’s nominal GDP, they
      represent approximately 45% of the world’s GDP, as measured by purchasing power
      parity (PPP) as of 2025. Why is PPP important? PPP GDP is a crucial measure for
      comparing the real economic health, living standards, and domestic market size
      of countries, because it adjusts for differences in local prices and cost of living.
      It also provides a more accurate picture of how much people can actually buy with
      their income in their own country. By way of comparison, the G7 countries represent
      approximately 31% of the world’s PPP GDP as of 2025. BRICS is not done growing.
      Other countries, such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and. Bahrain have expressed interest
      in joining. Donald Trump’s use of tariffs, as well as the threat of international
      sanctions, may very well inspire other countries to join BRICS as a reaction to
      US financial bullying. Maybe it is true… Size does matter. Here is my conversation

  - title: Armenia’s Prime Minister is Trapped
    url: https://sonar21.com/armenias-prime-minister-is-trapped/
    text: 'On June 4, 2025, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated , in response
      to a wide-ranging student question during a talk given at Yerevan State University,
      “We have lost part of our homeland, but we have gained a state.” We must assume
      that before having “lost part of our homeland,” Armenia wasn’t a state. Armenia
      was more of a sovereign entity before Pashinyan was ushered into power in 2018,
      and today, Armenia is caught in a diplomatic trap. Why is this? Critical analysts
      generate hypotheses in pursuing explanations for political events based on unbiased
      evaluation of available evidence. Looking back at events that may not initially
      appear significant sometimes creates the basis for hypotheses when viewed across
      a longer timeline. Hypotheses are required because most observers and analysts
      cannot access privileged information. A contemporary example of this might be
      whether US President Trump is kept in the dark about clandestine events he should
      know about or does not care about significant events. Few know the real explanation;
      the rest suggest hypotheses. The leading hypothesis to be examined here is: Pashinyan’s
      ascent to power was a light-color revolution encouraged by the West to reduce
      Russia’s footprint in the Southern Caucasus. The suggested quid pro quo was the
      West would support a Pashinyan ascendancy to power, replacing pro-Russia incumbents,
      but the piper must be paid. Once Russian influence was reduced, any promises or
      assurances given Armenia never materialized, leaving diplomatically-challenged
      Armenia to fend for itself. Armenians were told by Western states and their own
      ‘analysts’ that Armenia would have to make concessions on Nagorno-Karabakh to
      achieve peace with its neighbors. No Armenian government could unilaterally concede
      Nagorno-Karabakh and survive. However, with targeted framing that persists to
      this day, Armenians fought, were defeated, and emerged in a significantly weakened
      and demoralized state, with more than four thousand young soldiers dead. Armenia
      participated in an engineered defeat of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, followed by
      the 2023 Azerbaijani ethnic cleansing of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, negating
      the mandate of a Russian peace-keeping contingent in the region. Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh
      ceased to exist as an entity. While peace remains elusive, the Armenian regime
      is doing its best not to appear patriotic, attacking national symbols, including
      the Armenian church, and kowtowing to the dictates of Baku in their never-ending
      cascade of concessions, all intended to reduce Armenian sovereignty. Direct proof
      doesn’t exist to prove or contradict this hypothesis. However, the US Deep State
      is demonstrably in pursuit of the dismemberment of Russia via proxies. Pashinyan
      was convicted of political libel in 1999. He was fined and given a one-year suspended
      sentence. In 2008, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the
      2008 post-election violence. He was released in May 2011 as part of a general
      amnesty. Both of these events took place under the leadership of pro-Russian governments.
      Pashinyan was a classic candidate for fulfilling a Western anti-Russian agenda
      in Armenia. The West’s Deep State Ukrainian proxy war against Russia has not resulted
      in a Russian disintegration but rather quite the opposite. Subsequently, Armenia
      painted itself into a corner; it neither has peace nor is the absence of war the
      equivalent of peace. Turkey and Azerbaijan, especially the latter, after the successful
      conquest of Nagorno-Karabakh, are attempting to reduce Armenian sovereignty incrementally.
      Currently, the Azerbaijani military units occupy about two hundred fifteen sq
      km of Armenia’s internationally recognized territory, and over thirty Armenian
      villages are now abandoned. Rather than for Armenia to plan for the worst, it
      hoped for the best, and hope doesn’t spring eternal in geopolitics. The West using
      Minsk I and II agreements to further arm Ukraine as a proxy fighting Russia should
      have been a hint. However, for this and other events to be recognized for what
      they represent, such as Georgia’s Saakashvili hoping for NATO intervention in
      the 2008 Georgian-Russian war, these lessons should have encouraged Armenia to
      develop strategic goals rather than being reduced to transactional processes that
      serve the interests of others while keeping the Pashinyan regime in power. Much
      of the US Deep State’s activities serve the disintegration of Russia. Thus, anything
      that supports that policy would be under active consideration. This includes opening
      more than just a Ukrainian front against Russian interests. One need only read
      the Rand Corporation’s recommendations in Extending Russia and note on page 117
      how “the United States could try to induce Armenia to break with Russia” and on
      118, “While the principal aim of these policies would be to extend Russia, closer
      relationships with Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Armenia might yield important secondary
      benefits for the United States.” The following is a sampling of the evidence that
      supports the stated hypothesis. As seen on Wikileaks, US diplomatic cables suggest
      a consistent, strategic push from Washington for Armenia to prepare public opinion
      to accept compromises on Nagorno-Karabakh, including territorial concessions,
      to reach peace. There is a recurring, subtly but firmly framed message that peace
      cannot come without concessions on Nagorno-Karabakh’s status. The number of current
      Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) registered in Armenia remains elusive. While
      Armenia’s official count as of 2019 stood at 4,222 NGOs and 1,120 foundations,
      a claim made by Russian sources in the fall of 2023 estimated the number of NGOs
      in Armenia to be around 9,000. This number of NGOs is considered excessive in
      a country of about three million people. The role of Western-sponsored NGOs in
      color revolutions is widely recognized. Nikol Pashinyan stated that his ascendancy
      was on the backs of NGOs, a classic method used in all Western-inspired color
      revolutions. In 2017, Nikol Pashinyan’s party proposed Armenia’s exit from the
      Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) to the Armenian Parliament, signaling a shift away
      from closer integration with Russia. Since assuming power in 2018, Pashinyan has
      had five Directors of the National Security Service, and six state officials have
      died under circumstances deemed suspicious. Additionally, four different Ministers
      of Defense have served under Pashinyan since 2018. Such frequent changes in key
      ministries hinder coherent policy implementation. In July 2018, shortly after
      his election, Pashinyan charged Yuri Khachaturov, who served as the head of the
      Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), with “subverting public
      order” in 2008. In the months leading up to the 2020 war, Pashinyan appointed
      individuals known for their loyalty to his administration to key positions within
      the Armenian Constitutional Court. These appointments were seen as a move to consolidate
      power and influence within the judiciary, particularly given Pashinyan’s assumption
      of extraordinary powers during and immediately after the 2020 Karabakh War. Approximately
      10,000 diasporan Armenians volunteered as soldiers in the 2020 Karabakh War, despite
      many being informed that their assistance on the battlefield was not required.
      Following a series of phone conversations between Pashinyan and Russian President
      Putin and between Azerbaijani President Aliyev and Putin in mid-October 2020 ,
      a proposal was made to end the fighting. The proposal involved Armenians maintaining
      control over much of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region from the Soviet era,
      along with bordering regions. It included the deployment of Russian peacekeepers
      to Nagorno-Karabakh. However, Pashinyan refused the proposal, arguing it would
      amount to surrender. An engineered defeat of this 2020 war was the goal; such
      a rejection would be necessary. On February 25, 2021, Armenia’s general staff
      demanded Pashinyan’s resignation, citing indecisiveness during and after the 2020
      Karabakh War. In retaliation, Pashinyan dismissed the Chief of the General Staff
      and his first deputy. He also dismissed or arrested several combat generals from
      Armenia and Karabakh. Aired on December 19, 2023, on Armenian TV 1 , Pashinyan
      claimed that the resources meant to strengthen Armenia were always diverted to
      support the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. He also stated that he was elected prime
      minister of Armenia, not Nagorno-Karabakh. The interview implied that the burden
      of Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh was lifted, bringing economic benefits to Armenia.
      A quick review can be read here . On February 1, 2024, Armenia’s ratification
      of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court came into effect. This
      ratification means that Armenia has agreed to abide by the jurisdiction of the
      International Criminal Court, potentially allowing for the prosecution of individuals
      accused of committing international crimes, including heads of state. Under the
      Rome Statute, the ICC claims jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity,
      war crimes, and the crime of aggression. As a result, there is the possibility
      that Russian President Putin could face arrest if he enters Armenia and is accused
      of committing such crimes. By the end of February 2024, Armenia had frozen its
      membership in the CSTO, signaling a significant shift in its foreign policy or
      security strategy. This decision raised questions about Armenia’s relationship
      with other CSTO member states and its broader geopolitical stance. In a March
      8, 2024 interview , Armenian Foreign Minister Mirzoyan stated that Armenia is
      actively discussing the possibility of joining the EU. On March 18, 2024, “NATO
      Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reportedly praised on Monday Azerbaijan’s close
      military ties with NATO member Turkey, which helped it to win the 2020 war in
      Nagorno-Karabakh.” Pashinyan explicitly stated , on September 18, 2024, that (1)
      others wrote Armenian history, and (2) Patriotism is destructive and does not
      envision a ‘real’ homeland. On June 18, 2025, Russian-Armenian businessman and
      philanthropist Samvel Karapetyan was charged with making public calls to seize
      state power . The legal action against Karapetyan only began after he publicly
      denounced the government, accusing Pashinyan of orchestrating a targeted campaign
      against the Armenian Church. Just hours after Karapetyan’s remarks, Pashinyan
      publicly floated the confiscation of the Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA), the
      country’s main power distribution company, owned by Karapetyan’s Tashir Group.
      The Public Services Regulatory Commission has fined Electric Networks of Armenia
      $25,000 for documented technical and commercial violations. The government is
      conducting inspections at thirty public dining establishments owned by Pizza Tashir.
      Armen Abazyan, the director of Armenia’s National Security Service, was dismissed
      the day after his officers failed to arrest Samvel Karapetyan swiftly. The 1648
      Westphalian definition of a state is rooted in the principle of sovereignty, where
      each state has exclusive control over its territory and domestic affairs without
      external interference. The following elements define a sovereign state under international
      law and were outlined in frameworks such as the 1933 Montevideo Convention on
      the Rights and Duties of States. First, a sovereign state must possess a clearly
      defined territory. This includes a specific geographical area with recognized
      borders over which the state exercises exclusive control, including land, airspace,
      and natural resources. Second, a permanent population is necessary. This refers
      to a group of people who reside within the state’s territory, regardless of whether
      they are citizens or non-citizens, as long as the population is stable and identifiable.
      Third, the presence of an organized government is essential. The government is
      the central authority that creates and enforces laws, maintains order, manages
      public affairs, and represents the state internally and externally. Fourth, the
      state must have independence or autonomy. This means it can make its laws, policies,
      and decisions without interference from external powers, affirming its self-governing
      status. Fifth, recognition by other states and international organizations. Recognition
      can be formal or practical, allowing the state to participate in the global community
      as a legitimate and equal actor. Lastly, a sovereign state must have the capacity
      to enter into relations with other states. This involves engaging in diplomacy,
      signing treaties, forming alliances, and participating in global institutions
      and negotiations. Together, these elements form the foundation of what constitutes
      a sovereign state under international law. Not only has Pashinyan succumbed to
      the suggested quid pro quo on Nagorno-Karabakh, but since Azerbaijan’s conquest
      of Nagorno-Karabakh, Pashinyan has engaged in reducing Armenia’s sovereignty even
      further by insulting the Armenian Church and its leadership , amending Armenia’s
      constitution, challenging Armenian symbols that contain Mt Ararat , etc., items
      demanded by Baku and a lesser extent Turkey as preconditions for a treaty with
      Armenia. There is no indication that Baku will not demand more concessions from
      Armenia if all the current demands are met. Not only has the Pashinyan regime
      served the anti-Russia interests of the collective West, it has been forced to
      serve the interests of both Turkey and Azerbaijan in reducing Armenia’s identity
      and sovereignty. There are no genuine friends in international relations, only
      shifting alliances based on mutual interests. The regional players include Russia,
      Iran, and the Azerbaijan-Turkey “one nation, two states.” Blaming Russia for the
      loss of Nagorno-Karabakh and subsequently cooling relations is a diplomatic loss
      for Armenia. Iran should be a natural ally of Armenia, especially technologically
      and militarily. Of all three regional powers, only Iran has demanded that Armenian
      sovereignty not be interfered with . Surely, this policy is in their interest,
      as is Armenia’s. The collective West (the US and the EU) is a player, but at a
      distance, as is China, yet the latter has a place. These regional and global powers
      have parochial interests, which Armenia should understand and deal with. Armenia
      must establish strategic goals and methods to achieve them. What will Armenia
      do with no hard allies if the current Israeli-Iranian war spills over into Armenia?
      Would the US or EU send troops into Armenia? No. Armenian officials’ eyes are
      dazzled when invited to EU events. Yet neither the EU nor the US will come to
      Armenia’s defense, nor will Armenia ever enter the EU, considering after almost
      two decades, Georgia, to the north of Armenia, gave up its ascension activities.
      As a result of the 2018 light color regime change, Armenia has trapped itself
      in a conundrum of its creation. It has strained relations with Russia and stagnated
      closer ties with Iran, as closer relations would horrify the West. It is being
      cornered by never-ending demands by Azerbaijan and, to a lesser extent, Turkey.
      Jumping on the illusionary Western bandwagon is not a strategic goal; its operational
      definition is the Pashinyan trap. Like a small kid in a schoolyard not wanting
      to cross a bully, Pashinyan’s government is engaging in national self-deprecation.
      This sorry state of affairs began in May of 2018 as Pashinyan came to power in
      a light-colored revolution only to see its sovereignty degenerate to a point where
      Pashinyan and supporters equate losing 11,500 sq km of “Armenian homeland” with
      gaining a state. Yerevan, Armenia David Davidian is a Lecturer at the American

    paragraph_summary: On June 4, 2025, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan acknowledged
      the loss of part of Armenia's homeland while asserting the country's statehood
      during a talk at Yerevan State University, indicating a shift in Armenia's status
      since his rise to power in 2018. Analysts suggest that Pashinyan's ascent was
      part of a Western-backed "light-color revolution" aimed at diminishing Russian
      influence in the Southern Caucasus, with the expectation of Western support for
      Armenia. However, this support failed to materialize, leaving Armenia diplomatically
      isolated and pressured to make concessions regarding Nagorno-Karabakh, a sensitive
      issue that no Armenian government could afford to concede without risking its
      survival. The result has been a weakened and demoralized Armenia, facing significant
      challenges in the aftermath of conflict and territorial loss.

    url: https://sonar21.com/why-most-of-the-worlds-population-dont-have-a-clue-about-zionism/
    text: 'Sometimes we are captive to our own cultural prejudices and assume the rest
      of the world understands or perceives an issue in the same way that we do. I started
      thinking about this after my conversation on Friday with Jyotishman … I realized
      that I had assumed that most people are familiar with the eschatological beliefs
      of Jews, and Christians, which is the foundation of Zionism. The truth of the
      matter is otherwise… The majority of the world’s population doesn’t have a clue
      about how the current support for Israel in the United States rests on a foundation
      of religious beliefs about the end of the world and the return of the Messiah.
      Let’s start with some facts (courtesy of Perplexity AI ): About 59% of the world’s
      population lives in Asia, including India. As of 2025, approximately 35.4% of
      the world’s population lives in China and India combined. Specifically, about
      17.5% live in China and 17.9% live in India. About 2.3% of India’s population
      is Christian, while the Jewish population is extremely small—less than 0.01%.
      Christians make up about 2–5% of China’s population, while Jews represent less
      than 0.01%. While I am sure that university educated people in Asia have some
      superficial familiarity with Jewish/Christian eschatology, most are not steeped
      in the details and do not understand how emotionally charged the issue is if someone,
      me in this case, dares to challenge the narrative that the Jews are God’s chosen
      people and have a divine right to inhabit the portion of the Levant known as Israel,
      Gaza and the West Bank. Here are just two examples of comments made in response
      to my chat with Jyotishman: While the CREATOR did Choose for HIMSELF a Covenant
      People, HE also embraces all People who take hold of HIS Covenant (Isaiah 56:6-8).
      Moreover, it is impossible for these Ashkenazi Europeans to be of the seed of
      Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. GOD called Abraham from out of “Ur of the CHALDEES”
      a place where once Black People lived. Therefore, these so-called White Jews are
      IMPOSTORS! Do the research! Johnson, just like “Zionist Christians,” are [sic]
      not interested in the truth: “IF ONLY YOU FULLY OBEY THE LORD YOUR GOD and are
      careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today. For the Lord your
      God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will
      borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.”
      Deuteronomy 15:5 No Matter, Larry Johnson, as well as Satanic Zionist Jews, will
      continue to lie about the Word of God, because it suits them to do so……the time
      is short. Most Christians and religious Jews accept the Old Testament/Torah as
      the divine word of God, even though it was written by Jewish scholars in the 6th
      Century BCE. I don’t. Turning to Perplexity AI again, I asked: When was the Torah
      written: The Torah —the foundational text of Judaism, comprising the first five
      books of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy)—was
      written over a long period, and its exact date of composition is a subject of
      both religious tradition and scholarly debate. Traditional Jewish View • Traditional
      belief: The Torah was written by Moses around the 13th century BCE (approximately
      1200–1300 BCE), during the Israelites’ journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.
      Scholarly (Academic) View • Modern scholarship: Most historians and biblical scholars
      believe the Torah was composed and compiled over several centuries. • Estimated
      timeline: • Earliest sources: Some material may date back to the 10th–9th centuries
      BCE. • Main composition and compilation: Most scholars suggest the Torah reached
      its near-final form between the 7th and 5th centuries BCE (c. 700–400 BCE), during
      and after the Babylonian Exile. • Final editing: The text was likely finalized
      in the 5th century BCE. This was a book compiled by Jewish scholars primarily
      during their captivity in Babylon, under the rule of King Nebuchadnezzar II. It
      is a story told initially, drawing on oral traditions, by Jewish scholars who
      assembled a narrative that put Judaism at the center of their religious world.
      While Jewish longing for a return to Zion (Jerusalem and the Land of Israel) has
      existed for centuries, modern Zionism arose in Europe in response to rising antisemitism
      and nationalist movements. The movement was most notably organized by Theodor
      Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian journalist and political activist. Here’s the irony…
      Theodor Herzl was not a religious Jew in the traditional sense. He was born into
      a secular, assimilated Jewish family in Budapest and later lived in Vienna. Herzl’s
      upbringing and personal beliefs were shaped by the secular, intellectual culture
      of 19th-century Central Europe. So here is a guy who does not believe that the
      promises contained in the Torah were written by Moses as dictated to him by a
      divine being. I have deliberately declined to discuss the Islamic eschatology,
      because that opens a whole new can of worms . I will simply note that religious
      Muslims deeply revere Jerusalem and the Holy Land for their association with the
      Prophet Muhammad’s Night Journey, their mention as a blessed land in the Qur’an,
      and their connection to many prophets. The Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem is the
      third holiest site in Islam, and the city holds great spiritual, historical, and
      religious significance for Muslims worldwide. I am not suggesting that other factors,
      such as the control of oil resources in the region and historical grievances,
      play no role in the genocidal war being waged against the Palestinian people.
      However, the religious foundations of this struggle should not be ignored. Here’s
      another twist. Tel Aviv University linguist, Paul Wexler, has written two books
      that offer an alternative narrative: i.e., The Non-Jewish Origins of the Sephardic
      Jews and The Ashkenazic Jews: A Slavo-Turkic People in Search of a Jewish Identity
      . Using linguistic analysis, Wexler concludes that neither of the main branches
      of modern Judaism can claim they are the descendants from the Jewish tribes of
      biblical times. Rather, they descend from disparate populations that converted
      during a vigorous proselytizing campaign traditional Judaism undertook around
      the Mediterranean to counter the rise of Christianity. That sort of worked for
      a while until Islam swamped them both across MENA and, finally, even Spain. Of
      the Ashkenazim, who make up the vast bulk of today’s Jewry and led the Jewish
      takeover of Palestine, he writes: “… contemporary Judaism is best defined not
      as the continuation of the Judaism which served as an antecedent of Christianity
      and Islam, but as a newly Judaized variant of European (mainly Slavic) paganism
      and Christianity…most of the features of Old Palestinian Judaism and Semitic Hebrew
      to be found in Ashkenazic ‘Judaism’ and Medieval Ashkenazic/Modern Israeli ‘Hebrew’
      were latter borrowings rather than original inheritance.” Martin Cohen (Jewish
      Institute of Religion, NYC) wrote in the American Historical Review (Feb. 1999):
      “Wexler’s insights…may possibly startle some readers but in my opinion, they are
      soundly and irrefutably presented”. The upshot of Wexler’s and others’ work, including
      reams of genetic studies, is that there was no Diaspora . The Jews of Palestine,
      for the most part, stayed where they were, mixing with others as empires rose
      and fell and eventually converted to Islam. Today’s Palestinians may be the best
      candidate population of any size to claim an ethnic heritage from the biblical
      Israelites. Don’t get mad at me for suggesting that the narrative spun among the
      Christian West about the righteousness of the Zionist cause may be a fraud. Just

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the author's realization of the cultural
      biases that shape perceptions of global issues, particularly regarding the eschatological
      beliefs of Jews and Christians that underpin Zionism and the U.S. support for
      Israel. The author notes that a significant portion of the world's population,
      especially in Asia, lacks a deep understanding of these religious narratives,
      which can lead to misunderstandings about the emotional weight of discussions
      surrounding Israel's legitimacy. Highlighting demographic facts, the author emphasizes
      that the majority of people in countries like India and China are not familiar
      with the intricacies of Jewish and Christian eschatology, which complicates dialogues
      about Israel's divine right to the land. The article concludes with examples of
      comments reflecting a lack of awareness about these beliefs and the complexities
      of identity related to the Jewish population.

      deliberately misrepresented. A failed attack on Iran, a response from Tehran that
      almost broke Israel’s neck. The painful birth pangs of new political realities
      – the war of two worlds. Introduction US President Trump does what he wants, his
      opinion changes hourly and his actions break both American and international law.
      We already reported on the American attack on Iran in “ Trump has decided and
      is attacking Iran – this will have consequences – for the whole world? ” on June
      22. Now we have some new insights. In this article, we look at the complete military
      and strategic failure of Israel’s and the US’s attacks on Iran, the response of
      the attacked country that brought Israel to the brink of destruction, the “ceasefire”,
      the reasons why Iran spared Israel from possible total destruction. Twelve days
      that had it all. Israel and the US have failed Regime change failed – Iranian
      people united The war against Iran, jointly planned and instigated by the US and
      Israel, was lost by both. Even non-political contemporaries are increasingly amazed
      at the simple-mindedness with which the West, which once dominated the world,
      maneuvers entire regions into a new catastrophe time and time again, lacks any
      humanity in the pursuit of its goals and tramples on the rules it has set itself.
      No matter from which perspective you look at this adventure, it had no chance
      of success. Reza Pahlevi as the new Shah – a spoiled brat seeks money The eldest
      son of the last Shah left Iran with his father’s family at the beginning of 1979.
      The billions stolen enabled the multiple university dropout to lead a more than
      comfortable life. This money seems to have been running out for years. This is
      shown by lawsuits in the US in which he fought with employees and managers over
      money. He is therefore broke and looking for a new livelihood. Pahlevi has spent
      his whole life in the US, has never cared about the welfare of his country and
      is now being used as a puppet by the US, the British and Israel – with the prospect
      of a lot of money. His father had already come to power as an illegal puppet.
      The Iranian people democratically elected the liberal Professor Mohammad Mossadegh.
      After he curtailed the power of the British and American oil giants in order to
      transfer the gigantic oil wealth to his people, the British and Americans reacted
      promptly. With the secret service operation Ajax , MI-6 and the CIA staged a coup
      against Mossadegh and installed the Shah as a puppet. He reversed the democratic
      achievements and returned the wealth to the US and Great Britain. The Americans,
      for their part, forced the British out of business. Business is business. The
      Shah was paid handsomely for this whoring service. Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh
      – Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Another unsavory step: in order to keep the Shah
      in power, the Mossad was hired to set up the notorious SAVAK secret police for
      the new masters. In doing so, it used the support of Gestapo and SS specialists
      who had been disempowered in Germany in 1945. Against the background of this history,
      the West seeks to install this unsavory puppet in Iran, in the unrealistic belief
      that it can repeat the Ajax campaign. So Pahlevi was allowed to appeal to his
      people in Paris – nota bene in English. A speech to the British parliament is
      also planned. These dirty tricks are used to get the Western populations used
      to the desired ruler. The Iranian people have nothing to say about this – or so
      the Western powers think. The following picture shows the young Shah during a
      visit to Israel on April 17, 2023 with Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Intelligence
      Minister Gila Gamliel. From left to right: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
      Reza Pahlavi, Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel The perverse strategy of the
      West in one picture: After the last democratic president was ousted with the father
      of the would-be Shah, the cloned son embarks on a similar adventure, nota bene
      in minne with Netanyahu, who wanted to bomb the way to regime change in Tehran
      a few days ago, killing scientists and military personnel as well as many civilians
      in Iran. My sources in Iran just shake their heads: no one in Iran, young or old,
      even those who liked the old Shah, would want this little boy. Relatively little
      damage in Iran, but many deaths Iran is geographically almost as large as Western
      Europe, 75 times larger than Israel and has a population ten times that of Israel.
      It is therefore logical that the damage in Iran in the military exchange of blows
      with Israel was relatively minor compared to the Jewish state, which is very small
      in terms of area. The nuclear program was literally and figuratively only touched
      on the surface, entrances to underground objects and bunkers were destroyed; symbolic
      damage. Trump’s reports of victory are so inaccurate that even the American secret
      services did not remain loyal to their supreme leader in their announcements and
      were more inclined towards the Iranian view of things. It is difficult to assess
      the extent to which the decapitation strikes against scientists and military leaders
      have weakened Iran’s scientific and military capabilities. In any case, these
      attacks have had exactly the opposite effect on the Iranian people to that intended
      by the West: The Iranian people are united now behind their leadership, including
      the group of young people who want to see the society modernized domestically.
      The attack has therefore not only failed militarily, but also in terms of society.
      Israel on the brink of disaster Huge damage – photos and reports prohibited Overview
      Our colleague and friend Larry Johnson of Sonar21 – a former CIA analyst – compiled
      the following overview of the damage inflicted on Israel. Overview of Iranian
      military strikes against Israel Tel Aviv If you searched for images of destruction
      on X a few days ago, you would find what you were looking for. The following image
      of the complete destruction of Tel Aviv (left) comes from a video that we wanted
      to use for this article. We are not surprised that the video has been removed
      – what remains is a screenshot. The photo on the left shows Tel Aviv and the one
      on the right shows Berlin in 1945. Apart from the fact that the picture of Tel
      Aviv is in color and the one of Berlin is in black and white, there is no difference
      in the extent of the destruction. We are not surprised that the Israeli authorities
      have banned the taking or distribution of photos of the destruction under threat
      of several years’ imprisonment – albeit with modest success. Needless to say,
      such photos cannot be found in the Western media. left: Tel Aviv – June 2025;
      right: Berlin – 1945 Israeli defense companies The Iranians have also successfully
      attacked Israeli arms companies. The state-owned arms company “Rafael”, which
      was attacked, is the crown jewel of the Israeli arms industry. Its production
      program ranges from anti-tank weapons to cruise missiles, marine drones and key
      elements of the “Iron Dome” and “David’s Sling”, Israeli strategic missile defence
      systems. Source: Sonar21.com Rafael operates internationally and also has a subsidiary
      in Germany, Dynamit Nobel Defence . Infrastructure The country has three important
      ports: Haifa, Eilat and Ashdod. The Yemeni Houthis “shut down” Eilat months ago
      by blocking the Bab-al-Mandab Strait, the entrance from the Gulf of Aden into
      the Red Sea for ships bound for or coming from Israel. The port has been dead
      ever since. Since June 13, 2025, the port facilities of Haifa have been so badly
      destroyed by Iran in response to the Israeli attacks on Iran that this largest
      port in Israel will probably only be of very limited use for a long time. This
      also applies to the oil refinery located in the port area. Both infrastructure
      objects are core elements of the Israeli economy. Over 30 percent of Israel’s
      foreign trade is handled via Haifa. The refinery’s share of the Israeli market
      is probably even higher. This is the famous port of Haifa. When Iranians claimed
      they’ve completely destroyed it, I was one of those who silently said, “come on!”

      aircraft would almost certainly have been destroyed as well as the military airfields.
      Iran speaks of major personnel losses on the Israeli side The West diligently
      propagates how many Iranian scientists and officers were eliminated. The Israelis
      remain silent about their own losses. Iranian sources report the following: An
      Israeli security website had been hacked. Information about Israel’s losses was
      provided there as follows: 6 high-ranking generals; 32 Mossad agents; 78 Shin
      Bet (domestic intelligence) personnel; 27 naval officers; 198 air force officers;
      462 soldiers. We have not been able to verify this information, but it does not
      seem implausible. 40% of Tel Aviv is destroyed – Israel is out of munitions American
      analysts such as Douglas Macgregor assume that 40% of Tel Aviv has been destroyed.
      Destroyed, not damaged. The pictures above show the difference between “damaged”
      and “destroyed”. The Israelis’ much-vaunted “Iron Dome” has failed. Given the
      extent of the damage, the attribute “pathetic” to describe this miracle shield
      (Iron Dome) is not far-fetched. What’s more, Israel has been shot out: credible
      sources told us that the Israelis have practically run out of ammunition. In those
      12 days of war, Israel used up as many defensive missiles as the US can produce
      in two years. So not only does the system not work as advertised, but its production
      capacity means that it cannot be used sustainably. Financially unsustainable system
      If you look at the weapons used in this system, it becomes clear that the Iron
      Dome cannot be operated in a financially sustainable manner in an actual attack.
      The Iron Dome consists of various components; we illustrate some examples. Patriot
      – American According to Reuters, the Patriot system costs 400 million dollars
      without missiles. The unit price of a missile ranges from 3.4 to 8 million dollars,
      depending on the version. Patriot System – Quelle: New York Times Thaad – American
      The cost of a single complete Thaad system (Thaad stands for “Terminal High Altitude
      Area Defense”) is estimated at around three billion dollars for one system. A
      system comprises six launchers, a combat kit of 48 missiles, a radar system and
      a command vehicle. Thaad – Quelle: Wikipedia The costs for the heart of the system
      , the interceptor missiles, are not publicly communicated. In Russian sources,
      we found almost fabulous figures: One missile can cost between 45 and 500 million
      dollars, depending on the design in the export version (e.g. for Saudi Arabia
      or South Korea). One missile. Arrow – Israeli In addition to the aforementioned
      “Thaad” and ‘Patriot’ systems, Israel developed its own missile, the “ Arrow”
      , due to the inadequate performance of the Patriot system. The costs for this
      system amounted to approx. 1.5 billion US dollars, one missile costs approx. 2
      million US dollars . Arrow – Quelle: Wikipedia It is not known how many rockets
      of all systems were fired during these 12 days, but it is likely to have been
      thousands. A prolonged conflict – apart from the fact that the necessary quantities
      of rockets are not available and have very limited functionality – will result
      in Israel’s bankruptcy. “Ceasefire” No agreement The announcement of the end of
      hostilities between Israel and Iran came as a surprise to many. But a detailed
      look at the 12 days of the war sheds light on the alleged darkness. The longer
      the mutual bombardment lasted, the more visibly and tangibly Israel ran out of
      strength, which is not surprising given the geographical and demographic circumstances.
      Iran is 75 times larger and damage is therefore spread over a much larger area;
      the population factor of 10 also comes into play. In contrast, Iran had reorganized
      its command structures after the decapitation strikes of the first few days, which
      was just as visible and, above all, painfully tangible for Israel. The ceasefire
      announced by US President Trump on the night of June 25 is not an official agreement.
      The current state of calm is therefore not a ceasefire, but at best a temporary
      silencing of the guns. Who initiated the ceasefire – and why? According to Larry
      Johnson, the request to cease hostilities came from Netanyahu. The reasons are
      simple and convincing: Israel could not take any longer. The destruction of even
      the most sensitive objects is unprecedented in Israeli history. Will the “ceasefire”
      hold? This question is relatively easy to answer based on the behavior of Israel
      and the US so far. If Israel and the US come to the conclusion that they can achieve
      their goals with a further strike, they will strike. What Mr. Netanyahu and Mr.
      Trump will say before such an attack is completely irrelevant. We have already
      explained why Donald Trump’s word is worthless in our article “ Diplomacy on his
      deathbed – from peace president to warmonger ”. The fact that Israel and the US
      made a complete miscalculation before the first strike will also be irrelevant
      in the decision-making process. Netanyahu must continue to attack, otherwise he
      will end up in prison and Trump will probably believe that he must always win,
      as his character does not allow him to admit mistakes. These imponderables combined
      with Western hubris will probably result in the war continuing and the “ceasefire”
      merely being interpreted as a breather for the Israelis. I very much hope that
      I am wrong. Israel possibly at the end of the line Israeli refugees and internally
      displaced persons According to the Times of Israel, around half a million Israelis
      left the country after October 7, 2023. The newspaper refers to official figures
      from the Israeli Settlement and Immigration Administration. American sources even
      speak of up to 1.5 million, although it is not known whether these people only
      left the country temporarily or permanently. To these figures must be added the
      Israeli internally displaced persons as a result of the fighting with Hamas and
      Hezbollah, whose number amounted to around 100,000 in July 2024 according to the
      “Jüdische Allgemeine Zeitung” . In view of the Iranian response to the Israeli-American
      attack on June 13, 2025, another large number of refugees were added. After the
      Israeli authorities banned Israeli citizens from leaving the country, many simply
      chartered boats to leave the country by sea. We found no official figures, but
      there are unofficial reports of up to another 200,000-250,000 Israelis who are
      said to have left their country. Refugee flows are on the one hand a reaction
      to current events. However, they also reflect political and social problems and
      cause considerable economic and demographic problems. Israel is not exempt from
      this. There is currently not much sign of the much-vaunted patriotism. Those who
      trust their leadership never leave their homeland. Direct and indirect consequences
      The infrastructure and economy have been permanently damaged. It is impossible
      to predict how much time the country will need to rebuild if the ceasefire holds.
      Israel’s economy has not only been suffering since this conflict, but was already
      not in the best of shape in October 2023. In the last two years – i.e. up to June
      13, 2025 – up to 1.5 million Israelis have already left the country – a catastrophe
      for a population of just 9 million. If you also take into account the fact that
      it is mainly those people who can afford to leave a country due to the financial
      circumstances, this figure is even more alarming, as well-educated, wealthy Israelis
      who would be essential for reconstruction are now missing. A further indication
      of how disastrous the situation is is the travel ban imposed by Israeli Transport
      Minister Miri Regev – a comparison with Ukraine comes to mind. The information
      is vague, but the exit ban is in force, even if no details can be found on the
      website of the Israeli embassy in Berlin. The demographic consequences of this
      exodus could be fatal for Israel. Official Israel is always keen to portray the
      country as a land of Jews, in which the majority of residents are Jews. However,
      millions of Arabs also live in the country. Their birth rate is significantly
      higher than that of Jewish Israelis. The waves of refugees following the war and
      the demographic development will sooner or later result in more non-Jews (Muslims,
      Christians) living in the country than Jews, which will foreseeably render the
      Zionist strategy absurd. In addition, there is probably no passport in the world
      at the moment that is less attractive. The losers will be those who only have
      an Israeli passport. It is also difficult to imagine that anyone will move to
      this promised land. Who wants to live in a country where over 50% of the population
      is in favor of genocide? A passport that nobody wants to hold in their hands –
      Source: Süddeutsche Zeitung We will comment on the genocidal character of the
      majority of the Israeli population in a follow-up article. Why did the Iranians
      stop the attacks? Given the circumstances, this is a compelling question. In order
      to gain some clarity, it is necessary to look beyond the region. Military mistake?
      Our sources assume that a continuation of the Iranian barrage would have resulted
      in the collapse or even the downfall of Israel within days or weeks. Thus, from
      a purely military point of view, an opportunity to neutralize Israel in the long
      term was missed. All those directly and indirectly involved and affected were
      certainly aware of such a scenario. There must therefore have been serious and
      very compelling reasons why this historic opportunity was not seized or postponed.Geopolitische
      Considerations by China and Russia Iran has probably suspended hostilities under
      the influence of Russia and China. When weighing up all interests, the disadvantages
      for Russia, China and ultimately Iran appear to have outweighed the foreseeable
      advantages, at least for the time being. The following thoughts should be evaluated
      as such, as we have not been able to gain insight into the Russian and Chinese
      decision-making process. As a matter of principle, Russia and China do not let
      us look at their cards: Firstly, Russia – always de-escalating – must take into
      account the interests of Israelis of Russian descent. At around 2 million, their
      number is considerable. Secondly, a continuation of hostilities would very probably
      have forced Russia to become more involved due to the existing treaty of principle
      on strategic cooperation, even if there is no mention of obligatory military support
      in the event of war in the treaty. There was therefore a risk of becoming a de
      facto participant in the war against a country whose population has extensive
      connections to Russia and a large proportion of whom speak Russian. In addition,
      Russia is making great military progress in Ukraine and does not want to disperse
      its forces. Thirdly, remember the patience that Russia exercised towards Israel
      during the Syrian war, despite the loss of material and, above all, human lives.
      For example, Israeli warplanes deliberately used a Russian unarmed aircrafts as
      cover against Syrian air defenses. Fourthly, a further indication of Russia’s
      reticence towards Israel is the fact that the involvement of the Mossad in the
      Ukrainian drone attack against military airfields in Russia is still not officially
      mentioned in Russia, although many Russian blogs report on it and the facts leave
      little room for interpretation in view of comparable attacks by the Israelis in
      Iran. Fifthly, a full-scale war in Iran would also come at an inopportune time
      for Russia in economic terms. The north-south transport corridor from St. Petersburg
      via the Caucasus and Iran to India is nearing completion and is of considerable
      importance to both countries. China’s interest is more obvious. It is primarily
      concerned with economic reasons. A war in Iran would have severely disrupted the
      Chinese in the realization of their Belt and Road project, in which Iran plays
      a major role and represents an important link in its further expansion to Africa
      and Europe. The Chinese also purchase a great deal of natural gas and oil from
      Iran. An escalation would have severely damaged China’s economic interests. For
      example, immediately after the ceasefire began, the US contractually allowed China
      to purchase oil and gas from Iran without sanctions. This provides Iran with income
      and China with planning security, if one can speak of reliability and security
      in agreements with the Trump administration. The current resurgence of social
      media reports from the White House about 500% secondary sanctions against Russia’s
      trading partners sends its regards. Part of the gas and oil that China receives
      will be used by Iran – another agreement that was reached very quickly after June
      25, 2025 – as payment for modern Chinese fighter jets. Previously, China insisted
      on cash payment, which delayed the realization of the project for a long time.
      Interest of the US We assume that Iran, Russia and China have been given something
      by the US in return for arms silence: Firstly, the US is allowing China to officially
      purchase gas and oil from Iran, as already described. In return, the US now appears
      to have regained access to rare earths from China. This is of paramount interest
      to the US, especially for the defense industry. Rare earths are not rare and the
      US also has significant deposits. However, the US does not have the complete production
      cycle from mining to refining, while China does. Russia has probably obtained
      American concessions with regard to Ukraine – the details are not known, but the
      news on Ukraine certainly suggests this. Trump has already admitted that Iran
      has hit Israel hard and those responsible in the White House and the Pentagon
      are well aware that a continuation of the Iranian attacks would have completely
      destroyed Israel. As a result, the US would have lost even more face than it already
      has. From its imperial perspective, it would have been forced to launch further
      military strikes against Iran, for which the US is neither economically nor militarily
      (lack of ammunition) prepared. A few B2 bombers would not have been enough, because
      Iran cannot be dealt with militarily with bombs and missiles alone. Any further
      attack by the US on Iran would in turn have forced Iran to attack the US bases
      in the Persian Gulf. And then what? It seems that not only Israel has been shot
      out, but that the Americans simply do not have enough ammunition either. Three
      reasons for this: firstly, for three years the US has been emptying its stockpiles
      for Ukraine, despite the lack of successes. It is therefore not surprising that
      the US announced yesterday that it would not be supplying any more weapons to
      Ukraine. Second, since October 7, 2023, the US has been supplying vast quantities
      of ammunition for the genocide in Gaza. Thirdly, the US’s production capacities
      are anything but sufficient to meet demand. As mentioned above, Israel used as
      many air defense missiles in the 12 days of the war with Iran as the US is able
      to produce in two years. The need is now so great that the production of Patriot
      missiles, for example, is also taking place in other countries. Germany, for example,
      will produce 1000 of these missiles . However, there is no mention of how long
      this will take. In a report dated 20 July 2024 , the Russian newspaper Kommersant
      , referring to the US Department of Defense, writes about the increase in annual
      production of missiles for the Patriot missile defence system from 500 to 750
      units. To put the figures mentioned here into context: To defend against an Iranian
      missile, the Israeli air defense system fired up to 25 of these missiles at the
      target. This figure is extreme and certainly due to specific circumstances. But
      as a rule of thumb: for every missile that attacks – and Iran has thousands of
      them – there are at least two interceptor missiles. Conclusion The destruction
      of Israel is in full swing. The reconstruction of partially destroyed Israel (Tel
      Aviv, ports, airports and arms factories) will take years, but requires that the
      ceasefire holds, which is completely uncertain as the protagonists are behaving
      so unreliably. This will result in the owners concerned not putting up any money
      in the current situation. Would you rebuild an office building if there was a
      50% chance that it would be destroyed again tomorrow? It is highly questionable
      whether the Israelis who have fled will return in the foreseeable future. Since
      October 2023, Israel has probably lost almost a third of its population, namely
      the part that is well educated, wealthy and therefore essential for reconstruction.
      It is also possible that many of those who have left the country are not part
      of the genocidal majority of the population – another reason not to return. There
      are no indications that would allow us to predict the future of this conflict.
      It is possible that the war will break out again tomorrow – or not. What we expect
      with certainty, however, is that the War of Two Worlds, which we have already
      described in a series of articles , will continue – possibly in a new location,
      but it will remain bloody. The only assessment we can make with certainty is that
      neither the US nor Israel can be trusted. In terms of reliability and respect
      for international law, these two countries are on a par with Nazi Germany. Peter
      Hanseler is a geopolitical analyst who reports from Moscow. Peter was born in
      Zurich, Switzerland. He holds a J.D. (lic. iur.) and Ph.D. (Dr. iur.) from Zurich

    url: https://sonar21.com/donald-trump-continues-to-send-mixed-messages-on-iran-and-russia/
    text: 'Since it is the Fourth of July, I suppose the most apt metaphor to describe
      Donald Trump’s foreign policy is a fireworks display. For those of you who live
      overseas, it is tradition in America to detonate fireworks to commemorate the
      signing of the Declaration of Independence. Trump’s fireworks display is not like
      those professional spectacles you see when New Year’s Eve is celebrated — i.e.,
      highly scripted, well-organized and impressive. Nope. Trump is like that guy in
      your neighborhood who is convinced he invented firecrackers and spurting flaming
      fountains, and he is going to show the neighbors how it’s done. The problem is
      that he almost sets himself ablaze; he fires some errant bottle rockets into the
      neighbor’s home and starts a real fire; some of the Roman candles don’t ignite;
      but he manages to salvage a blazing finale because he accidentally detonates the
      propane-gas tank that heats his hot tub. He then turns to his neighbors and proclaims,
      “That was the biggest, most magnificent display in history.” And he truly believes
      it. So let’s start with potential, promising developments with respect to Gaza.
      Netanyahu’s popularity reportedly has soared in Israel and his Likud party now
      believes they can win a snap election and will no longer have to cater to the
      Zionist crazies, like Ben Gvir and Smotrich. Trump’s intervention with the Israeli
      court seems to have removed, at least temporarily, the legal sword of Damocles
      hanging over Bibi’s noggin. How is this good news for the Palestinians? Because
      Bibi reportedly is now willing to entertain a ceasefire, accompanied by a release
      of hostages on both sides, and Hamas reportedly is favorably considering the deal.
      However, the deal ain’t done and there are still points of disagreement between
      Hamas and Israel. Specifically: – The withdrawal of the Israeli army from key
      positions in the Gaza Strip. – Changing the mechanism for humanitarian aid. –
      Guarantees for the continuation of negotiations. And there are other disturbing
      signs that Israel is just trying to buy time. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
      reportedly has asked his war cabinet to prepare an “evacuation plan” of the Palestinian
      population from the north of the Gaza Strip to Rafah, the very south of the strip.
      Likud Ministers also are urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to annex the West Bank
      as the time is just “ripe” following Israel’s victories abroad, according to Israeli
      Channel 12’s Amit Segal. I think these are two issues that Netanyahu will discuss
      with Donald Trump on Monday, during his trip to Washington. Trump being Trump,
      I expect Bibi will persuade him that this is the best policy to pursue. So, hopes
      of even a temporary ceasefire and the establishment of a reliable, safe flow of
      humanitarian aid to the residents of Gaza are dim at best. Turning to Trump’s
      relations with Putin, Trump continues to insist that the war in Ukraine ain’t
      his fault — it is Joe Biden’s — and that he is disappointed that Vladimir Putin
      won’t kiss his ass like the NATO Secretary General did a week ago. Trump reportedly
      spent almost two hours on the phone with Ukraine’s Zelensky today, and both sides
      seem pleased with the call. Trump even said he would see what he could do to get
      Ukraine some more air defense. Zelensky offered a more upbeat assessment : We
      discussed air defense capabilities and agreed that we will work to increase air
      defense. We agreed on a corresponding meeting of our teams. Instead of confronting
      Zelensky with the hard truth that the US cupboards are bare and that Russia is
      beating the tar out of Ukraine, Trump opted for the coward’s way out and played
      along with Zelensky’s delusions. Trump may think he is very clever with these
      tactics, but he is just perpetuating the war… one he could end in short order
      if he eliminated all support to Ukraine. I started by Friday morning chatting
      with Jyotishman, who is currently in Beijing. We had a fascinating chat about
      the eschatological nonsense that governs US policy in West Asia: And then there
      is Nima. We are at war … he’s showing up with better shirts than me. Actually,
      our chuckles about wardrobe are a nice diversion from the grim news we covered
      with respect to the Palestinians, Iran and the war in Ukraine: I thank you for

      Minister Netanyahu's popularity has surged, potentially allowing him to pursue
      a ceasefire with Hamas, which is also considering a deal. However, the article
      emphasizes that significant disagreements remain between the two sides regarding
      military withdrawal, humanitarian aid mechanisms, and negotiation guarantees,
      indicating that while there are promising signs, the situation is still precarious
      and unresolved.

  - title: The Importance of Today’s Chat Between Putin and Trump
    url: https://sonar21.com/the-importance-of-todays-chat-between-putin-and-trump/
    text: 'My, my, what a difference 10 days makes. Remember what Donald Trump said
      on June 24 about Putin’s offer to help with Iran? Donald Trump publicly rejected
      President Vladimir Putin’s offer to help with the Iran conflict, specifically
      the escalating situation between Israel and Iran. Trump told reporters that when
      Putin called and asked, “Can I help you with Iran?” Trump replied, “No, I don’t
      need help with Iran. I need help with you.” He redirected the conversation to
      focus on the ongoing war in Ukraine, emphasizing that resolving the Russia-Ukraine
      conflict was his priority rather than accepting Russian mediation in the Middle
      East. Trump further clarified his stance by telling Putin, “Do me a favor, mediate
      your own. Let’s mediate Russia first. You can worry about this later.” He expressed
      that the United States was more interested in working with Russia to settle the
      Ukraine conflict, citing the high number of casualties and the continued fighting
      as unacceptable. Now we learn that Trump apparently has had a change of heart
      regarding Russia’s ability to help with Iran. Today, Putin and Trump had a conversation
      — Yuri Ushakov, the special representative of the Russian president, explained
      the main points of their dialogue : — Trump raised the issue of an early end to
      military action in Ukraine in his conversation with Putin; — Putin and Trump did
      not discuss a possible personal meeting; — Trump informed Putin about the successful
      passage of the bill on tax and immigration reform in the Senate; — Putin congratulated
      Trump on the upcoming US Independence Day; — Putin noted in his conversation with
      Trump that Russia played an important role in the development of American statehood;
      — Putin and Trump discussed in detail the situation around Iran and the Middle
      East in general; — Putin and Trump touched on the developments in Syria during
      their conversation; Moscow and Washington will continue their dialogue on this
      topic; — Putin and Trump discussed a number of promising joint economic projects
      in energy and space exploration; — Putin and Trump will continue to communicate
      with each other. The presidents can pick up the phone at any time during the day
      if they need to talk to each other; — Putin told Trump that Russia continues to
      seek a negotiated solution to the Ukrainian conflict; — Putin told Trump that
      Russia will not back down from its goals to eliminate the causes of the conflict
      in Ukraine. This was a friendly, but frank conversation. Putin took the high road
      by acknowledging America’s Fourth of July celebration and reminding President
      Trump of Russia’s friendship with the newly formed United States. Actually, I
      don’t think Trump knows that history, but Putin was sending a clear message that
      Russia’s intent is to be a friend, not an enemy of Russia. What caught my eye
      was that Trump discussed the situation in Iran with Putin… a volte face from his
      remarks on June 24. Trump insisted in remarks to the press that, “President Putin
      offered to help mediate the tensions with Iran, but I told him my priority is
      ending the war in Ukraine. I said, ‘Let’s focus on peace in Europe first.’” I
      think Russia’s account of what was said is more accurate–i.e., “… they discussed
      in detail the situation around Iran.” What details? For example, I think Trump
      realizes that he has zero chance of persuading Iran to allow IAEA inspections
      without Russia’s help. Iran does not trust the US, but it will listen to Putin
      and Lavrov, who are encouraging Iran not to abandon the Non-Proliferation Treaty
      (NPT). I think that Trump’s narcissism prevents him from admitting he asked Russia
      for help. Putin, for his part, has a very precise goal — prevent a further exchange
      of bombs and missiles between Iran and Israel. Also worth noting that Syria was
      discussed. I am pretty sure that Putin expressed concern about the current actions
      of the US-backed Syrian government, which is killing Christians and Alawites.
      Putin’s position on Ukraine, and ending the war, remains firm. It is not just
      about defeating Ukraine on the battlefield; it is ultimately about getting NATO
      to reverse its aggressive policy towards Russia and accepting that Russia has
      legitimate security concerns that must be addressed. The good news is that Putin
      and Trump agreed to continue talking to each other. I think Trump’s decision,
      which was announced yesterday, to halt sending weapons to Ukraine was intended
      as an olive branch to Putin. Here is a better translation of what Putin said to
      Trump: Our president also said that Russia will achieve its goals, that is, the
      elimination of all the root causes that led to the current state of affairs, to
      the current confrontation. And Russia will not back down from these goals. Quite
      clear. Trump had to be in a very good mood given his success in getting Congress
      to pass the Big, Beautiful Bill and, uncharacteristically, shied away from posting
      any outlandish or disparaging comments on TruthSocial about his conversation with
      Putin. Now, to the videos. Scott Ritter filled in for Ray McGovern today on The
      Roundtable with Judge Napolitano. Ray is attending a conference in Germany… my

      Putin's offer to mediate the Iran conflict, prioritizing the resolution of the
      Russia-Ukraine war instead, but recent developments suggest a change in his stance.
    paragraph_summary: In a notable shift from his previous stance, Donald Trump recently
      engaged in a conversation with Vladimir Putin where they discussed the situation
      in Iran and the Middle East, a topic Trump had previously dismissed in favor of
      focusing on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Just ten days earlier, Trump had rejected
      Putin's offer to assist with Iran, stating that he needed help with Ukraine instead.
      However, during their latest dialogue, they explored various issues including
      the potential for an early end to military actions in Ukraine, developments in
      Syria, and the importance of continued communication between Moscow and Washington.
      This change in Trump's approach suggests a growing openness to Russian involvement
      in Middle Eastern affairs, contrasting sharply with his earlier priorities.

      Community Assessment on Russian Election Interference (ICA) , reminds me of Claude
      Rains, who played the police captain in Casablanca … He was shocked to discover
      gambling in the casino. A bombshell new CIA review of the Obama administration’s
      spy agencies’ assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election
      to help Donald Trump was deliberately corrupted by then-CIA Director John Brennan,
      FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper,
      who were “excessively involved” in its drafting, and rushed its completion in
      a “chaotic,” “atypical” and “markedly unconventional” process that raised questions
      of a “potential political motive.” Further, Brennan’s decision to include the
      discredited Steele dossier, over the objections of the CIA’s most senior Russia
      experts, “undermined the credibility” of the assessment. The “Tradecraft Review
      of the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment [ICA] on Russian Election Interference”
      was conducted by career professionals at the CIA’s Directorate of Analysis and
      was commissioned by CIA Director John Ratcliffe in May. Here is the link to the
      CIA report on Russiagate . So, I am taking this opportunity for a victory lap.
      I wrote an article debunking the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian
      Election Interference (ICA), in January 2017 on Pat Lang’s blog, but it is now
      inactive and I can’t find the link. However, thanks to Perplexity AI , here’s
      an accurate summary of what I wrote eight years ago: Larry Johnson is a former
      CIA analyst and commentator who has written critically about the U.S. intelligence
      community’s assessment of Russian activities and intentions in recent U.S. elections,
      particularly regarding the 2016 presidential election. In his writings, Johnson
      has challenged the conclusions of the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment
      (ICA) titled “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections.”
      He argues that the report is politically motivated, lacks solid evidence, and
      is based on subjective judgments rather than hard intelligence. Key points from
      Larry Johnson’s perspective include: • Skepticism of the ICA’s Conclusions: Johnson
      asserts that the ICA, which assessed with “high confidence” that Russia sought
      to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process and favored Donald Trump,
      is not supported by concrete evidence. He contends that the report relies heavily
      on assumptions and analytic judgments rather than verifiable intelligence. • Critique
      of Methodology: Johnson has argued that the ICA was not a consensus product of
      all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, as sometimes claimed, but rather the work of
      a handpicked group of analysts from three agencies (CIA, FBI, NSA) under the direction
      of then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. • Political Influence
      Alleged: He suggests that the assessment was shaped by political bias within the
      intelligence leadership during the Obama administration, and that dissenting views
      were excluded from the final report. • Lack of Technical Evidence: Johnson points
      out that the ICA did not present technical forensic evidence to substantiate claims
      of Russian hacking or direct coordination with the Trump campaign. I nailed the
      fact that the ICA was, “ the work of a handpicked group of analysts from three
      agencies (CIA, FBI, NSA) under the direction of then-Director of National Intelligence
      James Clapper ,” eight years ago. Glad the media finally caught up. I was interviewed
      on Tuesday by Glenn Diesen about the Iran/Israel war. During the interview, I
      made a mistake on the timeline regarding when the battleship New Jersey launched
      shells into the Bekaa Valley and the bombing of the Marines in October 1983. What
      I should have said, to be more precise, was that the US Marines were supporting
      the Lebanese factions that were killing Shia. My basic point still holds–we provoked
      that. Anyway, enjoy the chat: I thank you for your invaluable support by taking

  - title: Looks Like Trump is Walking Away from the Ukrainian Military Casino
    url: https://sonar21.com/looks-like-trump-is-walking-away-from-the-ukrainian-military-casino/
    text: 'THAAD Launcher Today, the Pentagon announced that the Ukrainian party is
      over : The U.S. is halting some shipments of weapons to Ukraine amid concerns
      that its own stockpiles have declined too much, officials said Tuesday, a setback
      for the country as it tries to fend off escalating attacks from Russia . Certain
      munitions were previously promised to Ukraine under the Biden administration to
      aid its defenses during the more than three-year-old war . The pause reflects
      a new set of priorities under President Donald Trump and came after Defense Department
      officials scrutinized current U.S. stockpiles and raised concerns. This means
      that Ukraine WON’T be getting any more: PAC3 Patriot missiles 155mm artillery
      shells GMLRS rockets Stinger, AIM-7, and Hellfire missiles While the White House
      insisted that it is just “putting American interests first,” the move reveals
      that the US has a serious problem in manufacturing certain weapon systems and
      that supplies are at or near critical levels. Consider that has happened with
      the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, aka THAAD , which was deployed
      to Israel. The United States currently produces about 50–60 THAAD missiles (interceptors)
      per year at a price of $13 million per missile. The production number reflects
      recent production rates as of 2025, which have increased to meet both domestic
      and international demand. Lockheed Martin, the primary manufacturer, previously
      reported manufacturing as many as eight missiles per month, which would equate
      to a maximum of 96 per year, but more recent and widely cited estimates place
      the annual output closer to 50–60 interceptors. Let me repeat that… 50–60 a year.
      This production rate is significant given the high cost and limited global stockpile
      of THAAD missiles. During a the 12-day war with Iran, the US expended 15–20% of
      its global THAAD arsenal supporting Israel, highlighting both the high operational
      demand and the relatively slow pace at which these interceptors can be replenished.
      Had the war continued another two weeks, it is likely that the US would have exhausted
      its supply of THAADs . We have witnessed a similar shortage with the GBU-57 Massive
      Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bombs, which were dropped on Iranian nuclear sites on
      June 22. Although the precise number in the US inventory is not publicly disclosed,
      experts believe that the current US stockpile is likely fewer than 50 units. However,
      Boeing, in partnership with the McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma, currently
      is building between 72 and 96 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) per year.
      This is based on a recent production expansion completed in mid-2024, which increased
      output from two bombs per month (24 per year) to at least six, and potentially
      up to eight, bombs per month. Therefore, the new annual production rate is estimated
      at 72 to 96 units. And then there are the Patriot missiles. Lockheed Martin has
      that contract as well and reportedly produces 550 missiles per year. A Patriot
      missile launcher can carry a different number of missiles depending on the missile
      type: • PAC-2 missiles: Up to 4 missiles per launcher. • PAC-3 CRI missiles: Up
      to 16 missiles per launcher. • PAC-3 MSE missiles: Up to 12 missiles per launcher.
      Usually, there are at least two Patriot missiles fired for every approaching threat,
      such as a missile or drone. Two days ago, Russia fired over 500 missiles and drones
      into Ukraine. If Ukraine still had functioning Patriot missile launchers and a
      supply of missiles, that Russian attack would have depleted both the US and Ukraine’s
      supply of missiles. Has anyone in Washington learned a damn thing from the war
      in Ukraine? Do they now understand that the US is incapable of matching the Russians
      or the Chinese in the production of weapons expended on the battlefield? I don’t
      think so. Trump keeps pounding his chest, while insisting America has the greatest
      military in the world. Here is a newsflash, Don: No, you don’t. Meanwhile in Moscow,
      there is a glimmer of hope that not all European leaders are insane. Putin and
      Macron chatted by phone on July 1 and it seemed to go well. Here is the Kremlin
      readout: The two leaders held a detailed discussion on the situation in the Middle
      East in the context of the Iran-Israel confrontation and the recent U.S. strikes
      on Iranian nuclear facilities. Putin and Macron emphasized the special responsibility
      of Russia and France as permanent members of the UN Security Council in maintaining
      global peace and security, particularly in the Middle East, as well as in upholding
      the nuclear non-proliferation regime. They underscored the importance of respecting
      Iran’s legitimate right to develop a peaceful nuclear program and to continue
      fulfilling its obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, including cooperation
      with the IAEA. Both leaders advocated resolving the Iranian nuclear crisis — as
      well as other regional conflicts — exclusively through political and diplomatic
      means. They agreed to stay in contact to possibly coordinate positions. Discussing
      the situation in Ukraine, Putin reiterated that the conflict is a direct result
      of Western policies, which for years ignored Russia’s security interests, fostered
      an anti-Russian foothold in Ukraine, and encouraged violations of the rights of
      Russian-speaking populations. He noted that the West continues to prolong hostilities
      by supplying modern weapons to Kiev. Regarding prospects for peace, the Russian
      president reaffirmed Russia’s fundamental stance: any potential agreements must
      be comprehensive, long-term, and address the root causes of the conflict while
      reflecting the new territorial realities. The conversation between Putin and Macron
      was substantive. Putin did not budge an inch as far as Russia’s terms for a negotiated
      end to the war. This marked the first polite conversation between the two since
      September 2022. Putin and Macron discussed their respective roles on the UN Security
      Council. Based on my brief experience there in April 2024, I can state without
      reservation that the French representative is a total prick. So the fact that
      Putin and Macron are talking about how the UNSC can play a more constructive role
      could indicate that the French ambassador is going to be instructed to start acting
      and speaking like a diplomat. What do you think Trump’s reaction will be when
      he finds out that Putin and Macron are chatting? My guess is that he will be upset
      that he is no longer the only world leader in Putin’s life. However, did you catch
      what Putin said about Western responsibility? He noted that the West continues
      to prolong hostilities by supplying modern weapons to Kiev. Could it be that the
      Pentagon’s announcement that it is no longer supplying “modern weapons” to Ukraine
      was a signal to Putin that the US is ending its role in Ukraine? Very interesting.

      THAAD missile defense system, which produces only 50-60 interceptors annually
      at a high cost. The limited production capacity and high operational demand were

      War'

    text: 'THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN BY A READER OF SONAR21 WHO WISHES TO REMAIN
      ANONYMOUS “And everybody praised the Duke Who this great fight did win.” “But
      what good came of it at last?” Quoth little Peterkin. “Why that I cannot tell,”
      said he, “But ’twas a famous victory.” After Blemheim Robert Southey 1796 On June
      22, 2025, the United States launched Operation Midnight Hammer, an “obliterating”
      attack on Iran’s nuclear program that has so far been peaceful. This happened
      despite the fact that the IAEA had not produced any concrete evidence that any
      enriched uranium had been diverted to weaponization. Iran’s possible responses
      to such an unjustifiable attack had been gamed out. Possibilities included a devastating
      missile salvo on US bases in the Persian Gulf, further attacks on Israeli infrastructure,
      closure of the Strait of Hormuz, mobilization of Hezbollah in Lebanon, drones
      from Ansar Allah from Yemen, and further resistance from Hamas in Gaza. Such events
      could have collapsed the world economy. But apart from a few token missiles launched
      by Iran at the Al Udeid base southwest of Doha, Qatar that killed no one, the
      war seems to be on hold. There is a pause in hostilities without an actual ceasefire.
      What is going on here? Several different viewpoints have emerged. Scott Ritter
      seems to think that the Israeli attacks on Iran widely shown in the Western media
      must have been quite painful for Iran. After all, for a country under so many
      sanctions, it is not easy to rebuild after destruction. The death of 935 people
      in Iran puts pressure on the Islamic Republic. It suggests that the government
      cannot defend its own people and undermines its credibility. This could lead to
      the decapitation and collapse scenario that had been dream of the Neocons prior
      to the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. After all, if Iran had been in a dominant
      position, it would not have agreed to stop. A Native American Muslim has written
      on Sonar21 that the reason for pause in hostilities can be found in the Quran
      that the Iranians adhere to strictly. If the enemy stops its attack, the Muslims
      must also do the same, even if they hold a winning hand. Laith Marouf thinks that
      the reason Iran stopped their attack was because Iran had brought Israel to the
      brink of collapse. Benjamin Netanyahu was begging the US to help against the Persian
      onslaught by joining the conflict. If the conflict had continued, Israel would
      have no other option other than the Samson Option, i.e., use of nuclear weapons
      against Iran, and possibly other states in the region. I personally think that
      Laith Marouf is the closest to the calculations in the minds of the IRGC. The
      Samson Option is the ultimate nightmare scenario for West Asia. The preferred
      option for the Persians is the so-called Samsonite Option. In other words, the
      settlers pack their Samsonites and head back to Brooklyn. Such a scenario can
      only be achieved in stages. The Israeli economy has to be slowly strangled using
      war and other coercive measures. The settlers have no real connection to the land
      they occupy. At least a million out of the 7 million settlers hold dual citizenship
      and would have no problem immigrating. Many others can find work visas in other
      countries or claim refugee status. The number of people who have left Israel after
      October 7, 2023 is thought to be at least in the hundreds of thousands. It is
      not unusual to find estimates exceeding 1 million on the internet, but reliability
      of such estimates is questionable. It is therefore very likely that the Samsonite
      scenario is already at least partially in operation. So, what should Israel be
      doing at this time? They could change course and accept a two-state solution.
      But that would mean telling the half a million settlers in the West Bank to move
      into Israel proper. These settlers are armed with automatic weapons given to them
      by the Israeli state. If they are uprooted, the civil strife in Israel is likely
      to include a lot of spilt blood. Whether Israel can survive that remains questionable.
      The entire strategy of Israel has been to make a two-state solution impossible.
      Here they have succeeded. Israel could also begin negotiations with Hezbollah
      or Hamas to find a modus vivendi. In war, that would seem impossible. Without
      war, Netanyahu cannot survive and would go to jail. Without war, Al-Aqsa cannot
      be destroyed and the Third Temple cannot be built. The hard-liners in Israel would
      never accept that, and they remain in power. Just as September 11, 2001 launched
      a series of responses from the US that have ultimately weakened its global position,
      October 7, 2023 has launched a series of responses from Israel that have limited
      its geostrategic options. So, what should Iran be doing at this time? It has been
      argued that they have been deceived into negotiating with the West and delayed
      signing the mutual defense treaty with Russia. It has been argued that the Western-aligned
      liberals who support Javad Zarif and Masoud Pezeshkian will do anything to gain
      approval of the Europeans, including not aligning with Russia. Although this point
      of view may be partially correct, it ignores a fundamental fact of Israel. At
      least 1 million Jews in Israel are of Russian origin, most holding dual Russian
      citizenship. When Russia annexed Crimea, Vladimir Putin stated on March 18, 2024:
      “If we are talking about the protection of our citizens, the protection of Russian-speaking
      people, the protection of Russian compatriots, Russia will always do this, and
      we will do it by all available means, including military force.” The entire war
      in Ukraine is based upon this principle that Russia would defend Russian-speaking
      people of the Donbass if they were attacked by the Ukrainian government. So why
      would Russian not defend the Russian citizens in Israel if they were attacked
      by Iran? What was the exact wording of the proposed agreement that Russia gave
      to Iran to sign? Surprisingly, the Russian Jews living in Israel have little affinity
      for Russia itself. Despite the fact that Germany perpetrated the Holocaust and
      Russia saved the Jews by defeating Germany, Jews have much warmer feeling for
      Germany than Russia. This is said to be because Germany has accepted its responsibility
      for the Holocaust, but Russia has never accepted its responsibility for its historic
      antisemitism under Stalin. Such is the ill-will against Russia that many of the
      Jewish Neocons have targeted Russia for destruction in their works for various
      think tanks. The current war in Ukraine has been supported by Mossad with collaboration
      in intelligence and drones. Therefore, Israel can even be considered a hostile
      nation by Russia. So, both Russia and Iran have to tread carefully. Iran cannot
      sign a mutual defense treaty with Russian that would hamstring its ability to
      wage war with Israel if the hostilities commence again. Russia must stay true
      to its commitment to protect Russian-speaking people even if they are hostile
      to it. Iran must very carefully navigate between the Samson Option and the Samsonite
      Option. Russia must not appear to take sides against Israel openly. There are
      two kinds of information that will become publicly available in the next few weeks
      and months that would be of great interest to me. The first would be battle damage
      assessment from Israel and Iran that would tell us how close to the Samson Option
      Israel was, and how much pressure the Islamic Republic was feeling being unable
      to protect its citizens. The second would be what level of military cooperation
      Iran and Russia agree to, and whether it includes any protections for Russian
      Jews. And the war continues, each side looking for that “famous victory” with
      our future children destined to find things under the rubble that are “large,
      smooth, and round.” I thank you for your invaluable support by taking time to

      unmask Empire’s spin, And build a world worth living in.” “The Empire” – The Frontier
      Man The Lie Always Comes First Before the bombs fall, before the sanctions choke,
      before the drone strike turns a wedding into a crater—there is a story. The story
      that says: We are the good guys. This is the first crime of the Empire: the lie
      that cloaks its violence in virtue. Not just the violence itself—but the ease
      with which it is made invisible, the speed with which it is turned into entertainment.
      The American Empire is not merely a machine of war. It is a factory of myths.
      Myths so seductive, so immersive, that they turn complicity with murder into identity.
      This is not just domination—it is sorcery. A kind of psychic conquest that replaces
      reality with ritual, conscience with costume. An empire whose power does not rest
      only on military supremacy, but on narrative supremacy: the ability to make injustice
      feel like order, exploitation feel like generosity, and war feel like safety.
      It is not just that this Empire kills. It teaches its people to cheer for the
      killing. To wave flags while children in Gaza suffocate under rubble. To post
      patriotic memes while Yemeni families bury their dead in desperate silence. To
      recite slogans about liberty while applauding the starvation of whole nations
      through economic warfare. This is not simply propaganda—it is the construction
      of a moral architecture in which an atrocity becomes acceptable, and then—inevitably—unnoticeable.
      This Empire does not only commit atrocities; it manufactures accomplices. Through
      screens that romanticize war. Through slogans that bury genocide in euphemisms.
      Through silence that drowns any cry from the oppressed. The Empire has perfected
      a kind of violence that needs no chains—only belief. The most effective Empire
      is not the one that enslaves bodies, but the one that colonizes minds. American
      imperialism has done something few empires in history have managed: it has taught
      people to identify with their own propaganda. Its greatest triumph is psychological.
      It convinces its citizens to not only tolerate violence, but to demand it. To
      not only ignore suffering, but to justify it. To not only believe lies—but to
      depend on them. This conditioning begins in childhood—through textbooks, national
      holidays, and tales of “exceptionalism.” The Myth of Exceptionalism and the Logic
      of Violence “Exceptionalism” is the sacred myth at the heart of the Empire—the
      belief that one nation, one people, one way of life is inherently superior to
      all others. It is a story told not as aspiration, but as destiny. This belief
      is not benign; it is the ideological engine that justifies domination and subjugation.
      For if a people are exceptional, then what they do is not subject to the same
      moral standards as others. Their wars are not wars of aggression, but of liberation.
      Their wealth is not exploitation, but reward. Their control is not tyranny, but
      stewardship. But the logic of exceptionalism always leads to murder. It creates
      a moral hierarchy in which the lives of others—those who do not belong to the
      “exceptional” group—are worth less, or nothing at all. The Other becomes expendable.
      Bombed villages become “collateral damage.” Sanction-starved children become “strategic
      costs.” Every crime becomes an act of righteousness when committed by the “exceptional.”
      This myth disables empathy. It transforms suffering into statistics and tragedy
      into tactics. When people are taught that their nation is uniquely virtuous, they
      are less likely to question its actions, less willing to listen to those it harms,
      and more inclined to see its violence as necessary or even noble. Exceptionalism
      breeds a spiritual blindness—a belief that the world must conform to one vision,
      and that those who resist must be corrected, punished, or erased. In this way,
      the myth of moral superiority becomes the psychological groundwork for war. It
      does not just make killing permissible—it makes it justified and invisible. And
      worst of all, it makes killing feel like virtue. It is reinforced by a compliant
      mainstream media machine that floods the public with stories of heroism, never
      horror. The American public is not evil. But it has been heavily propagandized
      and trained to comply—trained to feel pride instead of guilt, superiority instead
      of humility, and fear instead of love and compassion. Empires thrive on fear—the
      fear of scarcity, of irrelevance, of the Other. In this way, Empire sustains itself
      not by the iron fist, but through the velvet glove of myths. Myths strong enough
      to maintain a system of global cruelty without ever having to name it or to understand
      it. The Seduction of Comfort There is a reason why the American Empire is more
      dangerous than the dictatorships it condemns: because it does not need to suppress
      dissent by force. It has learned how to make people believe their silence is noble,
      their apathy is wisdom, and their complicity is patriotism. It teaches obedience
      through comfort. It rewards loyalty with ease. And in doing so, it turns citizens
      into caretakers of Empire—even as it destroys everything that once made their
      lives worth living: their love, empathy, curiosity, and connection to humanity.
      The Empire’s brilliance lies in making people think they are free, even while
      they remain shackled to a worldview that demands the constant death of others
      to sustain itself. But no lie lasts forever. The stories that justified centuries
      of war and plunder are beginning to crack. The myth of moral supremacy no longer
      holds in a world where mobile phone cameras are everywhere, and the dead can speak
      through a phone screen. The truth, long buried beneath Hollywood scripts and sanitized
      history, is resurfacing. And when it does, it doesn’t just threaten the Empire’s
      dominance—it reveals its corrupt and inhumane soul. Because when people awaken
      from indoctrination, what dies first is the illusion of virtue. And that fall—that
      loss of imagined righteousness—shakes harder than any economic collapse or military
      defeat ever could. A New Revolution of Consciousness But what rises from those
      ruins? What comes after the Empire of Lies has fallen—not just as a system, but
      as a story? What lies ahead is not merely political upheaval but an existential
      reckoning with the crimes of the Empire and with the culture that enabled them.
      The danger was never just in drones or dollars, but in the deep psychic investment
      in a narrative of false benevolence. When that story breaks, so too does the veil
      that shielded the Empire from accountability. The fall of such an Empire will
      not be a spectacle of fire—it will be a collapse of certainty. A rupture in the
      myths that have animated a nation. It will be an awakening, painful and profound,
      in which the true cost of false beliefs is finally revealed. And in that awakening,
      the world may discover not just justice, but clarity. But what follows clarity?
      What replaces a culture built on fear, conquest, and obedience? The answer must
      be nothing less than a reimagining of the human project—a new revolution of consciousness.
      A society built not on conquest and dominance, but on love, compassion, and dignity.
      Not on fear of the Other, but reverence for our shared humanity. A society that
      recognizes that strength lies not in death and destruction, but in understanding
      and peaceful cooperation. That true freedom is not the license to dominate, but
      the capacity to live and love without needing to. That radical, unselfish love
      is not sentimental weakness, but the most resilient force we’ve ever known. A
      humane society does not turn away from suffering because it is inconvenient or
      distant. It listens. It mourns what must be mourned, and protects what must be
      protected—not because it is profitable, but because it is just. It sees the beautiful
      child behind every death statistic, the family behind every bombing, the human
      soul behind every border. Such a society would view each person not as a citizen
      of Empire, but as a member of a global human family. It would understand that
      strength is in restraint, and power is in healing, not in harm. It would tell
      the truth about history, so that it may finally stop repeating itself. This society
      would not mistake war for justice, or conquest for civilization. It would not
      starve the children of one nation to comfort the adults of another. It would not
      weaponize language and call it diplomacy. It would know that to build peace, we
      must dismantle the walls within ourselves. It is a world where cooperation displaces
      coercion, where compassion exceeds conquest, where education enlightens and liberates
      rather than indoctrinates. A world that teaches history truthfully, that fosters
      critical thought, that upholds humanity above ideology. Such a world is not a
      fantasy or utopia—it is the only way out of the moral abyss we find ourselves
      in. For us to survive and thrive on this planet demands empathy, cooperation,
      and a commitment to human dignity. It requires a society that teaches its children
      to question rather than obey, to listen rather than dominate, to care for others
      not because it is rewarded, but because it is the right thing to do. The Fall
      of The Empire of Lies is the New Dawn of Humanity When the Empire of Lies falls—and
      it will—it will not be the end of America, or any people. It will be the end of
      a lie that cloaked its violence in virtue. That fall will shake the world. But
      it will also clear the ground for something honest and beautiful to grow. For
      the first time in centuries, humanity may have the chance to build not on the
      ruins of delusion, but on the solid foundation of truth. And if we choose love
      over fear, understanding over ignorance, compassion over compliance, and peace
      and cooperation over conquest—then something truly astonishing becomes possible:
      Not just the end of the Empire of Lies, but the new Dawn of Humanity. The Frontier

    paragraph_summary: The article calls for a revolutionary shift in consciousness
      to challenge the pervasive narratives of the American Empire, which cloaks its
      violent actions in a facade of virtue and morality. It argues that the Empire's
      power lies not only in military might but in its ability to shape public perception,
      turning complicity in violence into a source of identity. By creating myths that
      normalize atrocities and desensitize the populace, the Empire fosters a culture
      where injustice is perceived as order and war as safety. The piece emphasizes
      the need to unmask these narratives and build a more just world, urging individuals
      to recognize and reject the moral architecture that makes such violence acceptable
      and invisible.

    url: https://sonar21.com/video-monday-talking-israel-iran-and-ukraine/
    text: Mind you, I am not complaining… I had a busy day flapping my gums. The primary
      focus remains on the aftermath of the Iran / Israel war. But there is action on
      a new front — Azerbaijan — that I believe represents another Western-supported
      effort to create trouble for Russia by exploiting ethnic tensions between Russia
      and the Azeris. On Monday, Azerbaijan detained Russian journalists and raided
      the offices of Russia’s state-funded news outlet Sputnik in Baku. The immediate
      trigger was the deaths of two ethnic Azerbaijanis during a Russian police operation
      in Yekaterinburg last week against an organized crime group in the Russian city
      of Yekaterinburg, composed of Russian nationals of Azerbaijani origin. Azerbaijani
      authorities denounced the “brutal killings” and accused Russian law enforcement
      of acting with ethnic bias. Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that
      Sputnik had continued operating in the country through “unauthorized funding”
      even after its accreditation was revoked in February 2025. During the raid, police
      detained several individuals, including Sputnik’s local editor-in-chief and director,
      and Azerbaijani media reported that some of those detained were suspected of being
      connected to Russian intelligence. The Azerbaijani government also canceled Russian
      cultural events and withdrew from scheduled bilateral meetings with Russia in
      protest of the treatment of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Russia. Russia, in response,
      summoned Azerbaijan’s ambassador and condemned the detentions as “unfriendly actions”
      and “illegal detention of Russian journalists.” But there may be more to this
      story — Azerbaijan is used by both the Mossad and the CIA for clandestine operations
      against Iran. Israel used Azerbaijan air space to launch missiles and drones into
      Iran during the latest conflict. So, is this flare-up between Russia and Azerbaijan
      just about the Yekaterinburg incident, or is Azerbaijan now making a turn to the
      West in order to put pressure on Russia? I think it is the latter. I don’t believe
      in coincidence. Keep your eye on Azerbaijan. Monday morning started with my regularly
      scheduled chats with Nima and with Judge Napolitano. As soon as I signed off with
      the Judge, I jumped on Deep Dive with Danny Davis , who just returned from a week
      vacation in Europe. The final video posted below comes courtesy of Randy Credico…

  - title: Are the US and Europe Working Frantically to Derail BRICS?
    url: https://sonar21.com/are-the-us-and-europe-working-frantically-to-derail-brics/
    text: 'I managed to snag my globe-trot ter friend, Pepe Escobar, for a video chat
      on Friday. Pepe had just returned to Paris from the St. Petersburg International
      Economic Forum (SPIEF). SPIEF is an amazing experience. I was fortunate to attend
      last year. It is an annual event, held in June during the White Nights of St.
      Petersburg. Representatives from more than 130 countries attended. As a result
      of Russia’s Special Military Operation (SMO) and the ensuing flood of Western
      economic sanctions, Russia and China have accelerated their economic cooperation
      and integration. Although India, Brazil and South Africa were founding members
      of BRICS, Russia and China remain the major players in driving efforts to create
      an alternative to the US-led financial system. Countries like Indonesia, Malaysia
      and Vietnam are expected to play a more critical role as BRICS expands in the
      Global South. Iran is a full member of BRICS, and I believe that is one of the
      underlying reasons for the US-supported attack on Iran on June 13. Iran’s enrichment
      of uranium is just a sideshow. The real objective is to remove the existing government
      and replace it with one committed to upholding the primacy of the US dollar, especially
      in oil transactions. One development to keep your eye on is the Cross-Border Interbank
      Payment System ( CIPS ). CIPS is a payment infrastructure launched by the People’s
      Bank of China in 2015 to facilitate and streamline cross-border transactions denominated
      in Chinese yuan ( RMB ). Unlike SWIFT , which primarily acts as a messaging network,
      CIPS provides both clearing and settlement services, making RMB transactions faster,
      more cost-effective, and more secure. CIPS operates as a wholesale payment system,
      enabling direct onshore settlement of international RMB payments within China’s
      domestic financial system. Financial institutions can join CIPS as either direct
      or indirect participants: Direct participants are typically large banks that hold
      accounts directly with the PBOC and can settle payments for themselves and others,
      while indirect participants access CIPS services through a corresponding direct
      participant. As of early 2025, CIPS had 170 direct participants and nearly 1,500
      indirect participants, connecting banks in over 119 countries and regions. The
      system plays a key role in internationalizing the RMB , supporting cross-border
      trade and investment, and reducing reliance on the US dollar. It also supports
      China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the development of Shanghai as an international
      financial center. CIPS processes millions of transactions annually, with trillions
      of yuan settled through its network. Key Improvements of CIPS : Direct Clearing
      and Settlement : • CIPS processes and settles RMB transactions onshore in real
      time or near real time, reducing reliance on intermediary banks and eliminating
      delays associated with correspondent banking models. • SWIFT does not provide
      settlement services; it only transmits payment messages, which then require additional
      clearing and settlement steps through other systems. Speed and Efficiency : •
      CIPS achieves average settlement times of around 300 milliseconds for direct participants,
      making transactions much faster than traditional SWIFT-based RMB transfers. •
      SWIFT -based transactions can take up to 48 hours when routed through offshore
      RMB clearing hubs. Cost Reduction : • CIPS transaction fees average 0.01%—a fraction
      of SWIFT’s costs—making RMB trade settlements significantly cheaper, especially
      for Belt and Road Initiative countries. • CIPS reduces the need for multiple correspondent
      banks and associated foreign exchange costs. Operational Features : • CIPS operates
      24/7, supporting global business needs, and is integrated with advanced features
      like Delivery Versus Payment ( DVP ) for securities and Payment Versus Payment
      ( PVP ) for forex. • CIPS also offers ISO 20022 messaging and is piloting integration
      with the digital yuan (e-CNY), enabling faster and more secure cross-border transfers.
      • Promotion of RMB Internationalization: • By making cross-border RMB payments
      more efficient and accessible, CIPS supports the broader international use of
      the Chinese yuan, reducing reliance on the US dollar. I am not suggesting that
      SWIFT is going to disappear anytime soon, but it is an archaic technology. The
      events of the last three years have persuaded both Russia and China that they
      can no longer risk being held hostage to a US-controlled financial system. I think
      CIPS will play a growing role in weaning nations of the Global South from being
      controlled by the US dollar. As with all wars, it is largely about money and who
      controls it. Pepe provides an excellent summary of SPIEF and the current status
      of BRICS : I thank you for your invaluable support by taking time to read or comment.

    one_sentence_summary: Pepe Escobar discussed the St. Petersburg International Economic
      Forum, highlighting the strengthened economic cooperation between Russia and China
      amid Western sanctions, and the expanding influence of BRICS countries in creating
      an alternative to the US-led financial system.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent video chat, Pepe Escobar shared insights from the
      St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), an annual event that attracts
      representatives from over 130 countries. He noted that due to Russia's Special
      Military Operation and subsequent Western sanctions, economic cooperation between
      Russia and China has intensified, positioning them as key players in the BRICS
      coalition, which also includes India, Brazil, and South Africa. The expansion
      of BRICS is expected to involve countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam,
      while Iran's membership is seen as a factor in the US's recent military actions
      against it, aimed at maintaining the dominance of the US dollar in oil transactions.
      Escobar highlighted the significance of China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment
      System (CIPS), which enhances the efficiency and security of transactions in Chinese
      yuan, contrasting with the traditional SWIFT system by offering both clearing
      and settlement services, thereby facilitating international payments within China's
      financial framework.

  - title: How Islam is Governing Iran’s Response to Israel and the United States
    url: https://sonar21.com/how-islam-is-governing-irans-response-to-israel-and-the-united-states/
    text: 'I have received a couple of very insightful messages from two readers — one
      is a convert to Islam and the other is a scholar, currently living in Asia. Both
      wrote to challenge my view that Iran rejected a mutual defense pact with Russia
      because moderates in Iran still hoped to curry favor with the US. After reading
      their thoughtful, detailed explanations, I think they present a perspective worth
      considering. Since the establishment of Iran’s Islamic Republic in 1979, Iran
      has not invaded another country. However, Iran was invaded by Iraq with the full
      encouragement and support of the United States. What most Americans do not know
      is that Israel was helping Iran fight Iraq. Israel began supplying weapons to
      Iran in early 1980, shortly after the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War. The first
      documented sale was of tires for the F-4 Phantom fighter jet, which occurred after
      Iran, unable to secure military equipment from the United States, reached out
      to Israel through back channels. Substantial and large-scale arms sales began
      in 1981, including the transfer of significant military equipment such as antitank
      guns, artillery shells, spare parts for tanks and aircraft, and TOW missiles as
      part of what was known as Operation Seashell . These sales continued throughout
      the early 1980s, with Israel becoming a major supplier of arms to Iran during
      the conflict. That came to an inglorious end with the Iran – Contra debacle. Iran
      suffered significantly as a result of the US-backed Iran-Iraq war. Most credible
      academic and historical sources estimate that between 500,000 and 750,000 Iranians
      died, but official Iranian figures are considerably lower, generally in the range
      of 155,000 to 183,000 for direct military deaths, with some studies counting up
      to 183,000–184,000 documented fatalities. And Americans wonder why Iranians would
      chant, Death to America . So, let me present the enlightening essay by my new
      friend — he is a native American who converted to Islam. I have not asked his
      permission to publish this, which is why I am not naming him. However, what he
      wrote is very compelling and I want to share it with you. BEGIN ESSAY FROM A NATIVE
      AMERICAN CONVERT TO ISLAM: Iran’s military response to Israel was governed by
      the following theological constraints: 1) the Iranian Military was NOT allowed
      Islamically to do preemptive strikes, 2)  they were NOT allowed Islamically to
      continue fighting whenever the enemy wishes to stop fighting, and 3) they are
      ONLY allowed to fight defense battles… wars of aggression are Islamically forbidden.
      I will also add that 4) harming innocent men, women, and children, during times
      of war is FORBIDDEN and caution must be strictly adhered to!  Although, I mentioned
      these truths, I was negligent in presenting the corresponding evidences to my
      statements, and God-willing this brief email will rectify that. Now then, I would
      like to begin this email by mentioning a verse from the Holy Qur’an in which it
      says: “Verily those who believe, and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabians,
      whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and is a doer of good, then for them
      their reward is with their Lord, and no fear shall be upon them, nor shall they
      grieve.” [Qur’an 2:62] The reason I quoted this verse is because it refutes the
      false notion, put forth by Benjamin Netanyahu, and others, that Iranians, and/or
      any other Muslims, for that matter, are antisemites. This is obviously an absurd
      notion. The issue between Iran and Israel has little to do with Islam versus Judaism,
      but more to do with oppression, and opposing it. It is mentioned in the Holy Bible:
      “Learn to do good: seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless,
      plead the widow’s cause.” [Isaiah 1:17] And Jesus (peace be upon him) said: “…He
      has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight of the
      blind, to set liberty those who are oppressed.” [Luke 4:18] Based upon what I
      just quoted above, in addition to common sense, it is incumbent upon not only
      the Muslims, but also the Christians, to oppose oppression, no matter who the
      oppressor is, and to help the oppressed, no matter who the oppressed are. Furthermore,
      I don’t think I need to emphasize the fact that, the Iranian and Yemeni “Shi’ites”
      are the only Muslim nations helping their “Sunni” brothers and sisters, i.e. the
      Palestinians. The question could be asked: Where are the other “Sunni” Nations?
      Also, the above verse of the Holy Qur’an exemplifies the “real” view that Islam
      has on other divine religions. I don’t think I need to explain the verse, nor
      is there any issues with its context, its very clear how Islam views Christianity
      and Judaism, and it is NOT with hostility. In any case, before I continue, God-willing,
      I would like to quickly mention that I am NOT Iranian…I am American…in fact, I
      am Native American. My maternal grandfather was full blooded Cherokee, and my
      maternal grandmother was a Cherokee /Caucasian mix, from the North Carolina/Tennessee
      area. On my paternal side, my grandparents were African American with a heavy
      dose of Cherokee as well from the Alabama Area. Although my mother was born in
      North Carolina, I was born and raised in Upstate New York, in a suburban town
      called Spring Valley, in Rockland County, about 25 minutes outside of New York
      City. With that being said, due to my facial features, and my name change in 2005,
      not to mention the fact that I am easily identifiable as Muslim due my wardrobe
      choices, many consider me a foreigner. I embraced Islam in 1999 and was initially
      a part of the radical Salafi Sect of Islam, until I converted to Shia Islam in
      2005. As of yet, I have not had the privilege, or honor, to study abroad in Qum,
      Iran, or Najaf, Iraq, but by the grace of God, I spent time in a seminary here
      in the states, and I was also honored with being personally tutored by several
      renown mid level scholars, some of which were, and still are, teachers in Qum,
      and Najaf. First, I would like to expound a bit on the concept of Wilayatul-Faqih,
      and the role of the Supreme Leader. No matter what the “educated dummies” may
      say, the role of Ayatollah Khamenei is simple…his job is to ensure that whatever
      the government of Iran does, whether domestic, or foreign…in peace time, or war…does
      not contradict, or undermine, in any way shape or form, the Islamic morals and
      codes of ethics. This is why the Iranian military has been considered weak, and
      this why certain bills, etc. take so long to pass, because they have to abide
      by the Islamic code of ethics. Obviously, a large majority of Iranians are not
      very religious, to say the least, and would prefer a more western standard. In
      simple terms, the Iranian Army has to “play fair”, whereas its opponents are known
      for cheating! Everything that the Iranians do, or don’t do, has a definite precedent
      in Islamic history, unbeknownst to the western world. I mentioned to you, that
      the Iranians are not allowed to continue fighting when their opponents have stopped,
      even if they are on the verge of victory. It is written in the Holy Qur’an: “Fight
      in the way of Allah those who fight you, but do not exceed the limits; Surely
      Allah does not like those who exceed the limits” [Qur’an 2:190] This verse also
      makes it clear that retaliations must be proportional, and blowing up a city block
      in order to kill one person is most certainly unacceptable and forbidden! Not
      to mention, it implicitly condemns preemptive strikes. And there is a clear and
      simple precedent for this. A person cannot be punished for something he/she hasn’t
      done yet! “Fight them until there is no more oppression…but if they cease, then
      let there be no hostilities except on the oppressors.” [Qur’an 2:193] This particular
      verse makes it clear that, when the enemy stops fighting, you must also stop fighting.
      Furthermore, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S) explicitly commanded his followers
      to NEVER harm innocent men, women, and children, during warfare. This is why the
      Iranian military is diligent in their trying to limit casualties, focusing on
      military, and infrastructure targets. The Iranians, although hated by the west,
      are displaying honor on the battle field. The saying that, “all is fair in love
      and war”, is an incorrect statement with the Iranians (Muslims). There are rules
      of engagement, not just militarily, but also ethically and morally. The Holy Prophet
      Muhammad (S) said: “The strong man isn’t the one who could conquer the people,
      the strong man is he who can conquer himself!” Mr. Johnson, this is the month
      of Muharram, which is a very important month in Islamic History for Shi’ite Muslims,
      and to make a  long story short, prophet Muhammad’s grandson, Imam Husayn (A)
      was denied water for three days in the blazing desert! A Muslim could NEVER deny
      anyone water, or stop their water flow, no matter if they are staunch enemies…this
      would be horrendous. The reason that I am telling you this, is because this is
      a reality that is hidden from mainstream media… they are viewing honorable traits
      as weakness, and higher morals and ethics as stupidity. A country being considered
      “weak” because it is trying to balance modern warfare with a higher level of morals
      and ethics. A country being considered an enemy because it opposes oppression.
      And although I keep referring to the Iranians, these are” Islamic” Morals and
      ethics that ALL Muslims should be upholding. Furthermore, even when It comes to
      Russia, China, and their relationship with Iran, there is also precedent in the
      Islamic morals and ethics. It has been said by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (S):
      “Your friends are three (3), and your enemies are three (3): Your friend is your
      friend, your friend’s friend is your friend, and your enemy’s enemy is your friend.
      Likewise, your enemy is your enemy, your enemy’s friend is your enemy, and your
      friend’s enemy is your enemy.” It is very advantageous for you, for me, and for
      everyone, that you add to your arsenal of information, a bit more understanding
      of the Islamic thought process, especially here in America where Islamophobia
      is increasing rapidly, and running rampant. On another note, Bibi Netanyahu once
      mentioned that he would like to follow the “Libyan Model” when dealing with Iran.
      Perhaps, you are familiar with him saying this. I would like to ask you this:
      Is it safe to say, or am I completely delusional, that the quote unquote “model”
      that the Israelis have adopted in the systematic oppression of the Palestinians
      is based upon the “Native American Model” that was used to deal with my ancestors,
      i.e. the Native Americans? From my perspective the operations are identical! The
      Israelis received a modest parcel of land in Palestine, and ultimately took over
      the entire state and relocated the Palestinians to a small enclosed area, i.e.
      Gaza. Similarly, the colonials acquired a modest parcel of land from the Native
      Americans, and ultimately took over the entire state, and relocated the Indians
      to a small enclosed area, i.e. Reservations. Whereas the Palestinians were oppressed
      and fought back, and continue this fight today, the Indians were made complacent
      through alcohol and gambling. If what I mention is actually true, and their is
      definite connection, then it would be more understandable as to why many Americans
      turn a blind eye to the plight of the Palestinians…because if they condemn it,
      then they will have to condemn what they did to the Native Americans here. In
      any case, I hope that at least one thing that I mentioned gave you a personal
      better understanding of the Iranian (Islamic) thought process, which will resonate
      with your audience. Some of what I have mentioned has been noticed, but not explained
      as I have explained it, and some of what I have mentioned will become clear later
      on. As far as the Iranian people are concerned, they are generally very patriotic,
      but the people that have the taste for Islam, and the Islamic Republic in general,
      is slowly dissipating, I am ashamed to say. I hope that, when you put all of the
      espionage aside, all of the military aspects aside, all of the nuclear issues
      aside, all of the realigning of alliances aside, that you can see a nation that
      wasn’t bent on world domination…a nation that wasn’t trying to control the precious
      materials of other countries, and rape, pillage, and plunder them…just a nation,
      maybe the last nation, that simply believed in something and tried diligently
      to keep it alive…i.e. being conscious of God. Just for the record, all of the
      terrorists groups were/are “Sunni”, and many were supported, and trained by the
      United States. Hizbullah, Hamas, and Ansarullah, were only trying to defend the
      Palestinians. Imagine an old lady getting mugged, and when a stranger comes to
      her rescue he is considered the “bad guy” and called a terrorist! what a world
      we live in! Thank you again Mr. Johnson for allowing me this honor. May God continue
      to enlighten you and continue to use you as a vessel to enlighten others! I appreciate
      all that you do…take care. I thank you for your invaluable support by taking time

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses insights from two readers challenging
      the author's view on Iran's rejection of a defense pact with Russia, highlighting
      Iran's historical context of not invading other countries since 1979 and its unexpected
      military support from Israel during the Iran-Iraq War.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses insights from two readers—a convert to
      Islam and a scholar living in Asia—who challenge the author's view that Iran rejected
      a mutual defense pact with Russia due to hopes of improving relations with the
      US. They argue that since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Iran
      has not invaded another country, while it was itself invaded by Iraq with US support.
      The article highlights that Israel, contrary to common perceptions, aided Iran
      during the Iran-Iraq War by supplying weapons after the US cut off military support.
      This assistance, which included significant arms sales, continued until the Iran-Contra
      affair. The author notes the heavy toll of the war on Iran, with estimates of
      Iranian casualties ranging from 500,000 to 750,000, which helps explain the animosity
      some Iranians feel towards the US. The piece concludes by introducing an enlightening
      essay from the convert, emphasizing the complexity of Iran's historical context.
