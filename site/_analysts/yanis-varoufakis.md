summary: |
  The past 24 hours have seen intensifying scrutiny of the intersection between economic interests, international law, and Western policy, with new developments centering on the fallout from Francesca Albanese’s UN report on Palestine and the ongoing debate over the role of financial power in global crises.
  
  The most immediate development is the open letter published by a group of leading economists—including **Yanis Varoufakis** and **Thomas Piketty**—defending UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese. This comes as the US government, under pressure from former President Trump and pro-Israel lobbies, calls for Albanese’s removal following her report on the “Economics of Genocide” in the occupied Palestinian territories. The letter, as summarized by **Varoufakis**, asserts that “corporate involvement has perpetuated violence and dispossession of Indigenous peoples,” and that Albanese’s analysis is “vital for understanding the political economy of Israel’s apartheid system.” The signatories urge the UN to resist efforts to suppress this discourse, highlighting the broader trend of economic interests shaping conflict and policy in the region.
  
  Meanwhile, reflections on the 10th anniversary of Greece’s 2015 referendum underscore the enduring impact of financial power on democratic processes. **Varoufakis** draws a parallel between the Greek “NO” vote against austerity and the ongoing struggles against economic injustice, noting that “the working class and marginalized citizens were unfairly made to bear the costs of the crisis.” The sense of betrayal following the referendum’s outcome is presented as emblematic of a wider pattern in which popular mandates are overridden by entrenched financial interests.
  
  Looking ahead, these developments reinforce a pattern of Western institutions prioritizing economic and strategic interests over democratic or humanitarian concerns. There is a high chance that the UN will face continued pressure to moderate or suppress critical voices like Albanese’s, but, as the letter’s signatories argue, the growing alignment of independent scholars and activists may help sustain international attention on the economic dimensions of conflict. I guarantee that the struggle between financial power and democratic accountability will remain a defining feature of global politics in the coming months, with Europe and the US likely to continue privileging stability and alliance politics over substantive reform or justice.

      Nidhi Srinivas co-sign the open letter below supporting Francesca Albanese amid
      US calls to remove her as the UN special rapporteur on Palestine History teaches
      us that economic interests have been key drivers and enablers of colonial enterprises
      and often of the genocides they perpetrated. The corporate sector has been intrinsic
      to colonialism since its inception, with corporations historically contributing
      to the violence against, the exploitation, and ultimately the dispossession, of
      Indigenous people and lands, a mode of domination known as racial colonial capitalism.
      Israel’s colonisation of the occupied Palestinian territories is no exception.
      The recent report by Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation
      of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, constitutes
      a major contribution to understanding the political economy of Israel’s Apartheid
      state, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians and, now, their genocide. As such,
      we believe, it must be studied and debated widely and freely. In view of the virulently
      hostile and indeed intimidating letter from the US government to the UN Secretary
      General demanding the dismissal of Ms Albanese and the quashing of her excellent
      report, we felt the need to express our strong support for Ms Albanese and to
      encourage the UN to dismiss the shrill demands of the US and Israeli governments.
      Following a well-trodden path of genocide denial and of bullying anyone who challenges
      the right of the colonial power to dispossess Indigenous peoples, the US and Israeli
      governments, with most European governments too timid to take a stance, demand
      that the international community turn a blind eye to the ongoing genocide and,
      in particular, to the key role that multinational and national corporations are
      playing in maintaining the Apartheid regime and enabling the subsequent genocide.
      As economists we feel the duty to highlight three key findings that Ms Albanese’s
      report unveils with clarity and precision. First, occupation and genocide are
      highly lucrative for conglomerates. These include not only the usual arms and
      ‘defence’ big businesses (e.g., Lockheed-Martin, the primary maker of the F35s,
      ELBIT, Israel’s own arms manufacturer, and Palantir, the software company whose
      algorithms have most likely been crucial in the selection of ‘targets’ across
      Gaza) but also household brand names (e.g., Caterpillar, BNP Paribas, Barclays,
      Allianz, Chevron, BP, Petrobas, A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S). As Israel’s defence budget
      doubled, with the active support of the US government, it crowded in large ‘investments’
      into Israel’s killing machine across this international network of complicit conglomerates
      in which thousands of Israeli companies are intertwined with US, European, Korean
      and even a Brazilian mega-corporation. This explains why Israeli equities rose
      by 161% at a time of falling demand, production and consumer confidence. The second
      finding in Ms Albanese’s report that deserves extensive study is that the Palestinian
      territories Israel occupies have functioned as Big Tech’s ideal laboratory and
      testing ground – a function that the transition from occupation to genocide has
      only heightened. No country, for instance, has given as much access to a population’s
      biometric data as Israel has given to IBM. Since 7th October 2023, Microsoft,
      Amazon, Alphabet and Palantir have been expanding their cloud capital services
      at a breathtaking pace. Face recognition software, target selection algorithms
      and automated execution systems are being tested in real time, at will, and with
      fewer ethical constraints than in the case of experiments on laboratory rats.
      Big Tech could not be happier! The third key finding is that top US and European
      universities are financially dependent on remaining wedded to Israel’s Apartheid
      and permanent occupation/conflict political economy. Many top US and EU institutions
      will face serious financial difficulties if they were to stop backing Israel’s
      genocide. Ms Albanese’s report must be commended for drawing this sordid dependency
      of stellar Western universities and research institutions (including the Technical
      University of Munich, MIT Labs, the University of Edinburgh among others). The
      peoples of Europe and America have a right to know that some of their most cherished
      academic institutions are financially reliant on helping Israel reproduce its
      political economy of occupation and genocide. In a few years, almost everyone
      will claim they opposed this genocide. But it is now that people of good conscience
      need to take a stand. As economists we stand, today, with Francesca Albanese,
      the UN Special Rapporteur under attack by the US and Israeli governments because
      her recent report throws indescribably important light on the political economy
      of Israel’s occupation and genocide. For the article in Zeteo, click the photo

  - title: Ten years after the majestic, globally significant, yet betrayed NO Referendum
      of the Greek people – a personal message
    url: https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2025/07/05/ten-years-after-the-majestic-globally-significant-yet-betrayed-no-referendum-of-the-greek-people-a-personal-message/
    text: 'Hello, I am Yanis Varoufakis with a message from me and DiEM25, today, the
      5th of July 2025, exactly 10 years after the Greek people voted overwhelmingly
      in a referendum to say a big, beautiful NO. A NO to the Big Business and Big Finance
      who, through their centre right and centre left political representatives, were
      demanding of the Greek people that they shoulder the costs of the banking crisis
      which Big Business and Big Finance had caused, with the result that hundreds of
      millions of people in Europe and America were crushed under mountain ranges of
      banking losses which governments then turned into public debt, before shifting
      it to the shoulders of the weakest of citizens through universal austerity – the
      working classes, the poor, the elderly, the young, the women, people who lacked
      the power to defend themselves from the powerful plucking the very  moneytree
      whose existence they denied. Churchill once said of the battle of El Alamein that,
      before it, the Allies had never won but that, after it, they never lost again.
      I could say something similar about that splendid and, at once, tragic day, of
      the Greek NO Referendum ten years ago today – the day when 62% of Greek voters
      ignored the financial terrorism of the European Central Bank (which had shut down
      the Greek banks to blackmail voters to accept the terms of surrender they were
      dictating to the Greek people). That same day when my former comrade, the PM I
      was serving as finance minister on behalf of the Greeks who were resisting, trashed
      their verdict and defected to the Big Finance and the Big Business in the name
      of the left. Before that day, before the magnificent NO Referendum outcome of
      5th July 2015, and during the months and years leading to it, we could not imagine
      losing in the long run our fights against the Big Finance and the Big Business
      that blew up our social economies in 2008. But after it, since the PM I was serving
      under overturned our people and betrayed their referendum verdict, we cannot imagine
      winning ever again, at least not in our lifetimes, against the Big Finance and
      the Big Business whom the betrayal of the NO Referendum helped recover. It was
      THAT significant a day. It was THAT significant a defection. Now, I know it is
      not the done thing to sully the spirit of one’s fellow travellers, one’s comrades,
      to say things like that – to surrender in public to the admission not only of
      the size of our defeat but also of the possibility that we may not win again for
      the foreseeable future. Alas, now is the time for honesty – for without honesty
      amongst rebels no rebellion worth its salt can be staged. Indulge me friends,
      fellow travellers, comrades. My point is not to bring you down. My point is to
      acknowledge where we are not just in Greece, in Germany, in Britain, in Europe
      but globally. To take stock properly of our situation globally not to mourn nor
      for some perverted sense of inverted glory, certainly not for gain, but for the
      simple, stubborn hope of rising again. Somewhere to the North of where I am talking
      you from, the killing fields of Ukraine are devouring lives with a ruthless, mechanical
      precision. Where is the Peace Movement to stop this? Nowhere really. Instead Europe
      is sinking fast into Military Keynesianism, with large majorities in our parliaments
      voting for unspeakable amounts of new debt to go to weapons of mass destruction
      we neither need nor can afford – and certainly weapons that people with the slightest
      of sense left in their hearts and minds should not want. Meanwhile, needless to
      say, from my southeast, from the scorched land of Palestine, the acrid stench
      of genocide drifts on the wind. Yes, we have staged magnificent marches on our
      streets. Yes, our people have marched to Gaza, other comrades risked life and
      limb to sail to that coastal war crime scene. Yes we have made it possible to
      speak of the genocide without being treated as buffoons. Yes, we have shifted
      public opinion. But, nothing is changing on the ground where Palestinian life
      is eradicated at a steady, at an unbearable rate, or in the corridors of power.
      Where are the sanctions on Israel? Where is the UN Peacekeeping force that should
      have been parachuted in to stop the genocide in its tracks? Nowhere. The only
      people that are hounded are people like the UN’s Special Rapporteur, my friend
      Francesca Albanese, for daring to report on the political economy of genocide.
      Why has Brazil, Spain or Ireland, countries whose governments have been supportive
      of the Palestinians not joined the Hague Group that our Progressive International
      has brought together to isolate Israel? What are they waiting for? Friends, fellow-travellers,
      comrades, at the risk of saddening, maybe even angering you, I shall say it again:
      Since that NO referendum was overturned ten years ago, today, by the left’s own
      leadership, we are losing at every front. Who is winning? Not the liberal authoritarian
      establishment – Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, Friedrich Merz. No the pro-genocide
      radical centre they sensationally unpopular. Even if they are clinging onto power
      for the time being, they are thoroughly discredited, despised even. No, the winners
      nest elsewhere in even uglier echelons of the political spectrum. Have you not
      smelled its smell? Can’t you smell the fascism in the air? Can’t you feel its
      sour, metallic taste clinging to the back of your throat? What happened to our
      great hopes? Remember Woman-Life-Freedom? The whispered three-word promise Kurdish
      heroines carried like a fragile beacon in their hands, a promise that until recently
      seemed to shimmer just within reach? Well, take a look at the triumphant Donald
      Trump on the one hand – yes, he is winning on every front – and the pathetic Kamala
      Harris, or the even more pathetic Hillary Clinton, on the other. Between them,
      willingly in Trump’s case, they created the manosphere’s unyielding juggernaut,
      which trampled upon Woman-Life-Freedom, as if these precious little words, had
      never been spoken at all. Authoritarianism, that most insidious of plagues, has
      crept into every sinew of life. Along with the smell of pollution in the air,
      microplastics in our oceans, the insidious power of cloud capital hardwired into
      our brains, delivering our minds to the whims of our new techlords – this New
      Global Ecocidal Hyper-Exploitative Ruling Class is entrenching itself as the new
      order, its cold grip tightening with each passing day. I don’t know about you
      but, speaking personally, on this, the 10th anniversary of our Great Victory which
      was turned overnight into the Great Betrayal, it is ever so easy to surrender
      to the feeling, the sensation, that my political struggles, fuelled by a fierce
      and unyielding hope, are taking me from one defeat to the next, making me feel
      like a character in some twisted simulation, doomed to repeat the same futile
      actions over and over. BUT, I shall not surrender. And nor will you! Acknowledging
      our defeats, the overwhelming strength of the monsters in power, and the magnitude
      of the task, needs to be done so that we ground our disobedience, our activism,
      our sacred campaigns for Humanity and for Nature, on solid ground. So that we
      learn from the past, from what happened to the brave Greek people 10 years ago
      to this day, focussing with laser sharp precision not only on the economics and
      the politics of what needs to be done but, much more so, on the greatest solvent,
      the ugliest enemy, of solidarity: The tendency of our own side, our own comrades,
      to be lured by power into defecting to the other side – to the oligarchs who are
      ever so eager to co-opt us, to co-opt our leading figures especially.So, on behalf
      of DiEM25, today, the 5th of July 2025, exactly 10 years after the Greek people’s
      majestic, betrayed, but inspiringly courageous NO – that ethereal revolutionary
      little word – a word redolent of the only Freedom that matters, the freedom to
      turn down exploitative, extractive deals. On this day, I bid you farewell. Battle
      well, and let us all, grounded on facts, work joyously to devise acts that make
      the fascists, the radical centre, the genocide practitioners and the purveyors
      of all types of exploitation lose their sleep at night so that the many can dream
      again. The post Ten years after the majestic, globally significant, yet betrayed

      the Greek referendum on July 5, 2015, reflects on the overwhelming "NO" vote by
      the Greek people against the austerity measures imposed by Big Business and Big
      Finance in the wake of the banking crisis. He emphasizes that this referendum
      was a pivotal moment in resisting the financial pressures that had burdened the
      working class and marginalized citizens, who were unfairly made to bear the costs
      of the crisis. Varoufakis recalls how, despite the clear mandate from the voters,
      the then-Prime Minister betrayed their decision by capitulating to financial interests,
      leading to a sense of defeat in the ongoing struggle against economic injustices.
      He draws a parallel to historical battles, suggesting that the referendum was
      a significant stand against financial oppression, even as the subsequent political
      actions undermined its potential impact.

      financial meltdown – UNHERD, 19 JUNE 2025'

    text: 'Francisco Goya’s etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters was an artist’s
      stern warning of the hideous forces unleashed in the mind when reason lowers its
      guard. Today, stablecoins are the gruesome forces being released into the global
      economy as President Trump’s crypto dreams, unchecked by reason, morphed into
      the GENIUS Act. Stablecoins are the bastard child of parents seemingly at permanent
      odds with each other: The libertarian spirit of the crypto community and statist
      dollar-worshipping. Built on the blockchain technology that was meant to tear
      asunder the oppressive powers of the financial oligarchy (Wall Street and the
      Fed), stablecoins are nevertheless fastened to that same oligarchy’s greatest
      totem: the US dollar. The result is a purportedly apolitical money promising to
      be joined at the hip with the most politically dominant form of money. What’s
      a stablecoin? The idea was produce a cryptocurrency devoid of Bitcoin’s hideous
      volatility while preserving the freedom to transact anonymously and globally –
      unseen by any government, in a currency beyond the manipulative reach of corrupt
      politicians, nosy bureaucrats, greedy bankers, the IRS, the CIA etc. Technically,
      stablecoins comprise a distributed ledger containing information on every transaction
      (the blockchain) plus a mechanism which holds the exchange rate of each token
      transacted constant at $1. To render this 1:1 exchange rate credible, issuers
      of stablecoins like Tether and Circle promise that, for every token they sell,
      they shall keep in reserve the equivalent of an actual $1. Typically, issuers
      use the dollars they receive when they sell their tokens to buy US Treasury bills
      of the same dollar face value. As Treasuries pay interest, unlike cash or stablecoins
      that do not, issuers profit handsomely. Setting aside their utility for mafia
      types, who naturally crave any payment means (including $100 and €500 bills) that
      can lubricate their trade, stablecoins have been a godsent for people in countries,
      especially in Africa, with fragile monetary systems, hyperinflation, debilitating
      capital controls etc. Besides providing the unbanked ready access to a proxy for
      the American dollar, stablecoins offer a means of wiring money abroad that is
      faster, cheaper, immune to US sanctions and more reliable compared to rickety
      inter-bank messaging systems (e.g., SWIFT). In short, while stablecoins were ignored
      by government, they did considerable good and could not do much harm. However,
      now that the Trump administration is weaponising stablecoins for its own purposes,
      their potential for serious damage has risen exponentially. The combination of
      two executive orders President Trump issued (one on 23 rd January and another
      on 6 th March 2025 ) and the GENIUS Act that the Senate has just approved is turning
      stablecoins into a massive timebomb deep in the foundations of the global economy.
      How widespread are stablecoins and why are they taking off under Trump? Today,
      the dollar value of circulating stablecoins is around $250bn. For that sum to
      be backed with sufficient reserves, it is estimated that, only during 2024, their
      issuers purchased $40bn of US Treasury bills, making them larger than any foreign
      buyer of Treasuries during 2024. In the same year, Tether alone reported annual
      pre-tax profits of $13bn — not bad for an offshore company employing around a
      hundred people! As for the number of wallets containing stablecoins, last May
      it jumped, on a year-to year monthly basis, from 27mn to 46mn while transactions
      in stablecoins climbed 84 per cent, from to $752bn to $409bn. Already, stablecoins
      account for around 80% of all crypto transactions. Such growth could not but encourage
      the very financial establishment that crypto was originally meant to disrupt to
      jump aboard. Behemoths like Visa and Stripe are on the bandwagon, with Big Tech
      in the process of joining too, seeking revenge for the manner in which Wall Street
      elbowed it out of payment systems – recall the infanticide of Mark Zuckerberg’s
      Libra. Even Uber, eager to keep more of the cloud rents currently seeping from
      its ride-hailing platform to the financiers, is developing a fully-owned cross-border
      stablecoin. Well before the Trump administration had stepped into the fray to
      boost them with the GENIUS Act, Standard Chartered was estimating that stablecoins
      in circulation would increase eight-fold, topping $2tn by 2028. The question then
      is why are Donald Trump, JD Vance and their MAGA brethren hellbent to boost stablecoins
      further? Besides the obvious self-enrichment motive , the more interesting explanation
      is that stablecoins fit in nicely with the Trump administration’s goal of shrinking
      global trade imbalances in a manner consistent with their strategy for ‘Making
      America Great Again’. Nothing motivates these people more than the idea that what
      is good for their bank account is good for America. Team Trump has made no qualms
      that it aims to devalue the dollar , with a view to shrink America’s trade deficit,
      yet preserve its dominance by using the threat of tariffs to force allies to dump
      dollars but refrain from buying rival fiat currencies. Stablecoins are assigned
      a key role in this plan. Suppose, for instance, Japan were to be bullied into
      using a considerable portion of its $1.2 trillion holdings to buy dollar-denominated
      stablecoins. Trump’s twin aims would be served: First, the dollar’s aggregate
      supply would rise, devaluing the dollar. Secondly, the stablecoin issuers would
      use the dollars it receives to buy Treasury bills, thus reducing the US government’s
      borrowing costs and, in the process, bolster dollar supremacy. In the words of
      JD Vance, a greater stablecoin uptake will be “a force multiplier of our economic
      might.” The five supersized systemic risks posed by stablecoins Moral Hazard :
      Stablecoin issuers stand to profit from issuing more tokens than the dollars they
      collect or from purchasing relatively illiquid (but higher interest rate yielding)
      securities. In short, the danger of a stablecoin run (the equivalent of a bank
      run) is clear and present. When stablecoins were small fry (e.g., when in 2021
      New York regulators fined Tether $21mn for undisclosed irregularities regarding
      its reserves), the threat of dodgy reserves was too small to lose much sleep over.
      However, as stablecoins exceed the $2tn mark, the risks become systemic, perhaps
      greater than those posed by subprime mortgages in 2007. Migrating deposits : As
      dollars migrate from US domestic bank accounts to stablecoins, demand for Treasury
      bills rises and their yields fall. Banks must raise their interest rates to stem
      this outflow while Treasury must issue more Treasury bills to satiate the greater
      demand for them. A wedge suddenly appears between different types of interest
      rates: Bank and long-term Treasuries’ rates rise while short-term Treasury bill
      rates fall causing the so-called yield curve to become steeper – a sure sign of
      financial instability. The Doom Loop between Stablecoins and Banks : In 2023,
      Circle – the issuer of USDC, the second largest stablecoin – had entrusted $3.3bn
      of its reserves to the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). When the latter tanked, a run
      on USDC began severing its dollar peg. Had the Fed not stepped in to bailout SVB,
      Circle would be toast. That little incident now seems like a walk in the park
      given the US Treasury’s prediction that, in the new climate shaped by the Trump
      administration’s crypto peans, and the GENIUS Act, $6.6tn of US bank deposits
      are in the process of migrating into stablecoins. The Doom Loop between Stablecoins
      and Securities : Wall Street is keen to use blockchain-based technologies for
      speeding up, securing and reducing the cost of trading securities – to disrupt
      the traditional rickety system of trading securities in the same way that stablecoins
      are disrupting SWIFT. But, to shift the trading of shares, bonds, derivatives
      and assorted exotic financial contracts onto a blockchain, the contracts and the
      tokens used to buy or sell them must be inserted into the same blockchain – exactly
      as most trading in NFTs is done on the Ethereum platform using its own cryptocurrency.
      This means that an arms race is now on to determine which dollar-backed stablecoin
      dominates the securities’ trades. Once the answer is in, its usage is bound to
      go through the roof. But the moment the private company that issues this stablecoin
      gets into hot waters, the entire stock market along with the $29tn Treasuries
      market is in peril. Global fragility : What happens if a stablecoin issued outside
      the United States crashes? Non-US institutions, including European ones, lack
      access to Fed rescue mechanisms. Will the Trump administration offer them the
      Fed swap lines that kept European banks alive in 2008? It is doubtful. Thus, dollar-backed
      stablecoins issued in Europe, Asia, Africa or Latin America risk exporting financial
      fragility globally. Even the European Central Bank is panicking at the prospect
      of having to find dollars to bailout European holders of dollar-denominated stablecoins.
      In the meantime, developing countries face a trilemma: ban stablecoins (forfeiting
      its substantial benefits), create sovereign alternatives, or accepting deeper
      dollarisation. China, armed with its digital yuan, sensibly opted to ban stablecoins
      outright, shielding its financial system. Yet its $4.5 trillion in dollar reserves
      poses a dilemma—dumping them aids Trump’s dollar devaluation, while holding them
      risks exposure to US-driven volatility. The BRICS’ preparedness, nevertheless,
      contrasts with most economies, trapped between dollar dependence and destabilising
      crypto experiments. The spectacular inadequacy of the Genius Act The GENIUS Act,
      which last Tuesday was approved by the US Senate with a 68-30 majority, is hard
      to fault if the intention was to maximise the threat of a financial meltdown.
      Essentially, it weaponises stablecoins as a means of privatising money and effectively
      outsourcing dollar dominance to Trump-friendly techlords . Proving their endless
      inanity, lured by two promises, many Democrats supported this legislation. The
      first promise was that the Act will protect their chums in Wall Street with a
      preposterous ban on stablecoins that pay interest. The second promise was that
      the Act will regulate Trump’s new digital Wild West. How? Issuers of stablecoins
      worth less than $50bn are to be regulated by the… states, allowing for a thousand
      lesser stablecoins to bloom across America. As for the systemically significant
      ones, including issuers domiciled outside the United States (like El Salvador-based
      Tether), they will be required to submit to an ‘independent’ audit of the quality
      of their dollar reserve assets. Two are the ways in which the GENIUS Act paves
      the ground to a massive crash. One is the ill-defined regulation of their reserves,
      combined with the inexcusable neglect of the abovementioned doom loops that stablecoin
      growth is occasioning. But there is a much, much worse aspect of the Act: It emasculates
      the Federal Reserve. It does this in two distinct ways: First, by banning it from
      issuing its own stablecoin, a digital dollar by which to counter the up-and-running
      digital yuan of the People’s Bank of China. Secondly, by implicitly burdening
      the Fed, without giving it the necessary tools (e.g. the equivalent for stablecoins
      of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), with the enormous task of cleaning
      up the mess private stablecoin issuers are bound to create. Conclusion To err
      in the world of financial innovation is human. But to cock things up big time
      all you need is the US government to promote private stablecoins, to cloak them
      in the legitimacy that a little regulation-lite can provide, to ban the Fed from
      deploying the same technology, and to deprive it of the means to clean up the
      inevitable mess. So, yes, be afraid. Be very afraid. For the UNHERD site, where

    paragraph_summary: Francisco Goya’s etching, "The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters,"
      serves as a metaphor for the chaotic forces unleashed when rationality is abandoned,
      paralleling the rise of stablecoins in today's economy. These digital currencies,
      born from a clash between the libertarian ethos of the crypto community and the
      traditional reliance on the US dollar, aim to provide a stable, apolitical means
      of transaction while remaining tethered to the very financial system they sought
      to disrupt. Stablecoins, such as Tether and Circle, promise a 1:1 exchange rate
      with the dollar by maintaining reserves of actual currency or US Treasury bills,
      allowing issuers to profit from interest while offering a seemingly secure alternative
      to volatile cryptocurrencies. Despite their potential benefits for various users,
      including those seeking anonymity in transactions, stablecoins also raise concerns
      about their implications for financial stability and regulation in a world increasingly
      influenced by unchecked crypto ambitions.

    text: 'On Tuesday, June 10 2025, I addressed a meeting at the European Parliament,
      an event organised by The Left and M5S Europa, on the theme of “The Economic Conditions
      for Peace”, alongside Jeffrey Sachs and Giuseppe Conte . My talk can be watched
      and read here. [INTRODUCTION] A year ago, I would have started this speech with
      a lament about the hitherto unimaginable conversion of the European Union from
      a Peace to a War Project. Not so today. Over the past year, warmongering has seeped
      into the very fabric of the Union, it has trickled into every policy, it has soaked
      every one of the thinktanks that generate Europe’s dominant narratives and creeds.
      Today, therefore, it makes no sense to lament what is now a fact: The EU is now
      a fully-fledged War Project – a project that will either land us in permanent
      war, or it will bankrupt us further, or probably both! Europe’s military Keynesianism,
      I shall be arguing, is guaranteed to make Europe less safe, more unequal, weaker.
      Only two interesting questions remain: Why has Europe taken this road? And, now
      that Europe is on this war path, what is our duty to our people, to Europeans,
      to Peace? Let me begin at the very beginning. [THE EU WAS DESIGNED TO BE SUBSERVIENT
      TO THE UNITED STATES] At the risk of irking Europeanists who believe in their
      own creation myth, let me be clear: The European Union (from its beginnings as
      the European Communities of Coal & Steel) was an American Construction – a part
      of a US Global Plan that also comprised the Bretton Woods System, the Truman Doctrine
      and, of course, NATO. Yes, most Europeans hankered for no more war and no more
      totalitarianism. But the EU was designed in Washington DC. And it was designed
      specifically not as a competitive market but as a Big Business Cartel run by a
      democracy-free bureaucracy (also known as the European Commission) not coincidentally
      located a stone’s throw from NATO’s headquarters. From 1950 on, the EU was nurtured
      by and in tune with the interests of the United States – an inconvenient fact
      both for Europe’s self-important rulers and for Donald Trump. Looking back, a
      common thread runs through the entire history of the EU: its total economic dependence
      on the United States. Initially, the EU was deeply dependent on being part of
      the Dollar Zone. Then, from 1971 onwards, it was deeply dependent on the American
      trade deficit. So, one way or another, Europe’s deep dependence on the US was
      ingrained into its architecture. It will thus take much more than mere pronouncements
      – or a few hundred billion borrowed euros spent on weaponry – to shed Europe’s
      in-built dependence on the United States. The fact that the EU was, from the beginning,
      fashioned as a Big Business Cartel is the reason why the EU needed fixed exchange
      rates: Currency fluctuations destabilise any cartel, making it hard to maintain
      the necessary levels of collusion between its participating producers. From 1950
      to 1971, the US took care of this problem on Europe’s behalf. As long as it was
      running a trade deficit with the United States, Europe’s cartel was embedded in
      the dollar zone – its currencies tied to the dollar But, when around 1969 Europe
      (and Japan) started running a trade surplus with the United States, it was game
      over. On 15 th August 1971, the Donald Trump of that era, President Richard Nixon,
      jettisoned Europe from the dollar zone, his Treasury Secretary cynically telling
      the dumbfounded Europeans: “From today the dollar is our currency but it is your
      problem!” Two things happened next. First, to save their Big Business Cartel the
      Europeans scrambled to create their own fixed exchange rate regime. They tried
      everything: The Snake. The European Monetary System. The European Exchange Rate
      Mechanism. They all proved flimsy designs that speculators had no trouble crushing.
      So, in desperation, they created the most noxious currency the human spirit could
      fashion – the euro. The second development was that, as America expanded its budget
      and trade deficits, the Eurozone morphed into a German-led net exporting machine
      whose aggregate demand was subcontracted to the United States. In effect, America’s
      twin deficits operated like a huge vacuum cleaner that sucked into America Europe’s
      net exports as well as the European exporters’ profits which were thus invested
      in US Treasuries, US shares and US real estate. That’s how, once it was expelled
      from the dollar zone, Europe became addicted to the US deficits. That was what
      the Nixon Shock did: It converted Europe’s utter reliance on living within the
      dollar zone into an even greater dependence on the US deficits. [NEVER MISSING
      A CHANCE TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY] Here in Brussels they love the expression that
      Europe progresses from crisis to crisis. That’s another delusion. The crisis of
      2008 was our greatest opportunity to render the European Union viable, and to
      end its deep dependence on the United States. The French and German banks went
      bankrupt. The Eurozone’s impossible rules were in tatters. A domino effect, beginning
      with Greece, was bankrupting our governments. It was the perfect opportunity to
      transform the EU from a Big Business Cartel, inherently reliant on the US for
      its aggregate demand, into a functional, internally balanced federation. Instead,
      Europe’s radical centre (both the centre right and the centre left) decided that
      they would change everything so as to ensure that nothing changes. In this vein,
      they did their worst: Universal austerity for the many. And frantic money printing
      for the financiers and Big Business. What happens when you crush the incomes of
      the many and hand over trillions to the very few? Since the many are too poor
      to buy high value added goods, business stops investing in productive capital
      –– while the rich use the free cash to push through the roof house prices, share
      prices, Bitcoin prices, art, asset prices in general. The natural result is soul-crushing
      levels of inequality and deep popular discontent. The people got desperate. They
      even voted for radical progressives like me to enter the Eurogroup! Then, in horror,
      Brussels and Frankfurt overthrew us, or made Mr Tsipras overthrow his own government,
      using not the tanks, as they did in Greece in 1967, but the banks – not that much
      of a difference really! A coup d’ état is a coup d’ état. [TWO SYMBIOTIC AUTHORITARIANISMS]
      Guess what happened next: Just as in the mid-war period, xenophobic ultra-rightists
      rose up from the woodwork. They proved a godsent for the shockingly unpopular
      radical centre whose politicians could now say to voters: It is us or them! But
      it was equally a godsent for the ultra-right who needed the radical centre to
      impose the austerity policies which created the discontent which fuelled the anger
      that delivered the ultra-right votes. To put it differently, if Macron and Le
      Pen had any sense, they would each keep a framed picture of the other on their
      bedside tables, saying a little prayer in their hated opponent’s name every night
      before going to sleep. [SMOKE AND MIRRORS] Liberal Totalitarianism and Ultra-Right-Xenophobic
      Totalitarianism are accomplices, they feed off each other. Meanwhile, austerity
      for the many and money printing for the few depletes Europe’s productive foundations,
      its social fabric, its sense of purpose. That’s how the European Union lost any
      legitimacy it had in the eyes of the public. Sensing this, the Liberal Totalitarians
      in charge came up with one failed Grand Initiative after another. Who can forget
      the eminently forgettable Juncker investment plan, the Banking Union, the Green
      Deal, or the Draghi Report that has now joined them in History’s Dustbin? Impressive
      numbers were announced that, alas, dependably failed to materialise. It was inevitable.
      As long as our rulers said NO to the political union that could sustain a proper,
      macroeconomically significant, eurobond, the money to fund the necessary investment
      could never materialise. Even when they – finally – during the pandemic – did
      issue common debt, they ended up with common liabilities but no common purpose.
      Every Grand Initiative ever announced was a dance with failure,  smoke and mirrors
      by which they disguised Europe’s nakedness. The result? After fifteen years of
      ZERO NET PRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT, Germany is deindustrialising fast, and along with
      it Eastern and Central Europe, Austria, Northern Italy Political paralysis grows
      on the back of fiscal pressures Neofascism and xenophobia are rising up everywhere
      Europe’s dependence on the United States grows stronger at the time Donald Trump
      is cutting Europe loose The Rest of the World looks at Europe as a sad case of
      what could have been, an irritating irrelevance. In this sad context, our great
      and good leaders had another woeful idea for a Grand Initiative: Now that the
      Green Deal is dead-in-the-water and the Recovery Fund is spent, why not try Military
      Keynesianism? [THE FOLLY OF MILITARY KEYNESIANISM] Ladies and Gentlemen, Military
      Keynesianism works in the United States because America has the federal institutions,
      the monetary sovereignty, the fiscal power, the technostructure, and the common
      procurement process that are essential in implementing Military Keynesianism.
      Europe has none of that, nor does it have leaders interested in acquiring any
      of that. This is why Military Keynesianism cannot work in Europe. Thank goodness
      it can’t work, I say! For if it could work, Europe would have to emulate the United
      States in starting a war every year so that the stocks of ammunition, missiles
      et al could be depleted sufficiently to justify the new colossal orders necessary
      to maintain Military Keynesianism. Nevertheless, while Europe’s Military Keynesianism
      cannot and should not work, it serves a purpose – it is a kind of a solution for,
      say, Volkswagen: Now that Volkswagen can no longer sell its cars, it hands over
      whole production lines to Rheinmetall to produce Leopard tanks which von der Leyen
      makes Greece and Italy buy even though we neither want nor need them. Yes, Military
      Keynesianism will fail Europe badly, but not before it further bankrupts our states
      and throws more fuel onto the fire burning down lives and dreams in Ukraine’s
      killing fields. So, let me be frank: No really-existing enemy of Europe shakes
      in his boots watching a stagnating, heavily indebted Europe, invest billions in
      weaponry. Quite the opposite! Military Keynesianism will end up as Europe’s New
      Austerity for the many and a new money spinner for the few . It will make Europe
      weaker while prolonging the Ukraine War in a manner that is detrimental to the
      stated aim of supporting Ukraine. [EUROPE’S SURRENDER TO NATO, ITS ROLE IN UKRAINE]
      It is at this point that angry yelps will rise up from the press gallery. Can’t
      you hear them ask: ““Is Russia not ante portas ?” “Is Europe not in danger?” “Should
      Europe remain defenceless, especially now that Trump is abandoning Europe?” My
      answer is clear: Weakening ourselves economically through a Military Keynesianism
      that constitutes the New Austerity which will, with mathematical precision, diminish
      Europe further is no way to make Europe stronger! And lest we forget, Europe already
      has 1.5m men and women in uniform while, over the past decade, we spent €2.7 trillion
      on defence – a period during which our net productive investment was zero! Now,
      NATO demands that we spend three times as much – which is totally insane, given
      how wastefully that €2.7 trillion was spent. In this light, surrendering our foreign
      and defence policies to NATO, and sinking further in unsustainable debt just to
      satisfy President Trump’s demands for more military spending, is the surest way
      of making Europe more dependent, less secure, uglier and sadder. In this context,
      the powers-that-be here in Brussels are anxiously trying to keep their jobs and
      boost their budgets by spreading the lie that NATO had to expand in order to deter
      Russian aggression – when it is exactly the other way round: Like the Mafia, NATO
      expanded to create insecurity in order to sell us protection! Does this mean that
      Putin was right to invade the Ukraine? Of course not. What it means is that NATO
      and Putin are accomplices – that they needed one another in their joint bid for
      a confrontation that strengthened both – at Europe’s expense. It also means that
      anyone truly interested in Europe’s security and prosperity must dispel the lie
      that Russia is about to invade us – it can’t even if it wants to must work tirelessly
      to kill Europe’s Military Keynesianism, and must work toward a European Peace
      Process which uses Russia’s confiscated monies not as a piggybank for more useless
      Leopard tanks and Leonardo missiles but as a bargaining chip to end the Ukraine
      War in the context of a comprehensive EU-Russia Peace Treaty. As for the politicians
      in this town who will not rest until they see Russia on its knees, I have this
      to say to them: If you really wanted to weaken Russia, to bring Russia to its
      knees, you should have worked hard to admit Russia into the… Eurozone. In one
      fell swoop the euro would have wrecked Russia’s productive basis, it would have
      indebted its people and its state, it would have made its leaders rush to Brussels
      and to Frankfurt with begging bowl in hand! You think I am joking. But there is
      too much truth in this joke for comfort! To sum up my argument so far, Europe’s
      economic stagnation was the product of its total dependence on the American deficits.
      This dependence yielded Europe’s complicity with the decade-long American project
      of inciting a war in Ukraine. And now that the US is decoupling, our rulers –
      resembling decapitated chickens – are running around without their heads screwed
      on, struggling to find ways of continuing to impede Peace in Ukraine so as to
      use military funds to prop up Europe’s faltering Big Business Cartel. [WHAT’S
      BEHIND EUROPE’S ETHICAL DECAY: GAZA, TOTALITARIANISM] Ladies and Gentlemen, as
      we speak here today, Europe is falling headlong into another ethical void: complicity
      in the Palestinian genocide. It is not just the embarrassment, also known as Mrs
      Ursula von der Leyen, posing like a cheerleader of Israel’s genocidal army in
      front of its tanks hours before they stormed Gaza. No, the European Union is not
      merely complicit due to our subservience to the United States. No, the European
      Union is also enabling, it is in fact funding, the war criminals of its own accord.
      Directly. Cynically. With no compunction. BNP PARIBAS and ALLIANZ underwrite the
      issues of the Israeli government bonds that fund the Israeli meatgrinder in the
      Palestinian Occupied Territories MAERSK is the prime transporter of the military
      machine at work in Gaza Since 2007, the European Union has channelled €2 billion
      of research funding to Israeli entities producing the means by which Palestinians
      are ethnically cleansed, targeted, murdered and maimed. But there is something
      even scarier going on: Some of our top institutions depend financially on backing
      Israel’s genocide. If Europe were to do its duty and sanction Israel, the Technical
      University of Munich stands to lose €195.4 million from the EU’s HORIZON program
      which funds the University to carry out joint research with Israeli institutions.
      Ladies and Gentlemen, Europe carries an enormous guilt. The pogroms against the
      Jews started here, in Europe. Europeans carried out genocides across Africa, in
      the Americas, in Australia. By forming the EU as a Peace Project, we claimed a
      chance to make amends for Europe’s past genocides. However, our dependence on
      the US and our ruling class’s penchant to profit from imperialism have made this
      impossible – and so Europe’s hands are, again, covered in the blood of innocents,
      in Gaza, in Ukraine, in the Sudan, in Libya, in Yemen, in Syria. It has also brought
      totalitarianism back into our midst, here in Europe. When the German authorities
      banned me from entering Germany for the crime of co-organising with German Jews
      a conference on the theme of ‘A Just Peace in the Middle East’, they were making
      a point: To them, letting the rivers of Palestinian blood flow unimpeded represented
      their chance of washing off their hands the guilt over the Holocaust, over the
      other German genocide in Namibia, of Belgium’s crimes against humanity in the
      Congo… It is, therefore, a clear warning to us: Economic stagnation begets warmongering
      which begets a revived European white settler mentality. This Europe has fallen
      so far into a moral crevice that it cannot easily climb out of it. Europe’s Liberal
      Totalitarianism, which we in Greece experienced in all its horror ten years ago,
      is now everywhere – and it is throwing wide open the gates through which Xenophobic
      Ultra-Right Totalitarianism arrives to darken our doorstep. The time to rise up
      against both forms of totalitarianism is now. On behalf of the peoples of Europe.
      [WHAT MUST WE DO?] So, what must we do? Let us begin by grasping that: The economic
      condition for Peace is to de-couple Europe’s economy from America’s wars! But
      for that we must end, once and for all, Europe’s dependence on the United States.
      This entails ending Europe’s dependence on net exports to Which means rebalancing
      Europe’s internal economy through new productive green investments, an end to
      structural austerity an end to the madness of cartel-infested electricity ‘markets’
      a new monetary commons by which to end the bankers’ monopoly over payments and
      to institute a personal dividend for all a new EU-China deal that liberates us
      from America’s agenda of intensifying a pointless New Cold War at our expense.
      Only by transforming Europe’s political economy can we end the never-ending fragmentation
      which breeds war, totalitarianism and the embarrassment of being led by cheerleaders
      of genocide and permanent war with Russia, like Ursula von der Leyen and Kaja
      Kallas. How can we accomplish that? In two ways. First, we need a Credible Plan
      for a Europe worth fighting for. Second, we must organise a campaign of civil
      and governmental disobedience in our countries and, potentially, in the European
      Council until our Plan for Europe gets a chance. We, DiEM25, have worked for a
      decade on this Plan – our Green New Deal for Europe – and are happy to share it
      with you, so that you can refine, revise, adapt it. You, the 5S Movement and other
      parties eager to partake across Europe, have the organisation that we lack so
      that, together with our MERA25 transnational parties, we can together help organise
      the campaign of civil and governmental disobedience without which nothing will
      change, nothing will impede Europe’s, Italy’s, Greece’s, indeed Germany’s secular
      decline. [CONCLUSION] So, to conclude, seventy-five years of this European Union
      teach us that we face a stark choice. A choice between a Dependent-on-the-United
      States, Warmongering, Stagnating Europe. Or an Independent, Non-Aligned, Prosperous,
      Green Europe. A choice between a von der Leyen-type Commission that greenlights
      genocide, impedes Peace, illegally deletes her Pfizer chat history, lobbies for
      Lockheed Martin, and borrows money we can’t repay to buy weaponry we do not need
      – while condemning People and Planet to impecunity.  Or  European Institutions
      optimised against raw power and in favour of common prosperity. A choice between
      being at the beck and call of the boardrooms of Rheinmetall, Leonardo and Pfizer,
      blind to the tax havens where war profits and tax fraud hide, while our coastguards
      turn refugees into corpses. Or a Europe of rational, that is a radical, humanism.
      To even have this choice, our immediate task must be to end war, to end genocide
      and to terminate before it is too late the New Austerity going by the name of
      Military Keynesianism. The post The Economics of Europe’s Descent into Warmongering

      step into the fray and contribute to the world’s rebalancing: the European Union.
      The reason why the EU has ruled itself out needs to be traced in the original
      architecture of its common currency (the euro) and, later, with the EU’s steadfast
      refusal to utilise the tumultuous euro crisis as an opportunity properly to federalise
      fiscal and investment decision-making. As a result, the EU has now entered a long-term,
      secular economic stagnation as well as political fragmentation. We also know who
      is unwilling to help rebalance the world: the United States. While US Treasury
      Secretary Scott Bessent waxes lyrical about rebalancing trade and capital flows,
      the Trump administration he is labouring for is only interested in the contradictory
      aims of, on the one hand, undervaluing the dollar while, on the other, attracting
      even larger quantities of capital to the United States – a contradiction that
      can only be resolved through massive coercion that the US lacks both the power
      and the discipline to implement. Who is left? The answer is: China. As far back
      as in April 2009, at the G20 meeting in London whose purpose was to coordinate
      monetary policies globally in a bid to stem the North Atlantic financial collapse
      from getting worse and from spreading, the Chinese delegation welcomed the idea
      of revisiting the Bretton Woods conference of 1944 and reviving John Maynard Keynes’
      proposal (known as International Clearing Union, ICU). Alas, in exactly the same
      way that the United States had rejected Keynes’ proposal in 1944, the United States
      snubbed Beijing’s suggestion in 2009. The rest is the sad history of the past
      sixteen years: a world whose imbalances grew larger and are now spinning out of
      control. Given that the EU cannot and the US will not help reign in the crippling
      imbalances, what could China do? My answer is: Establish a New Bretton Woods without
      the US or the EU, beginning with the BRICS+ and then admitting other countries
      once the benefits for this new system become apparent. Lest I am misunderstood,
      my proposal here is not that China should become an alternative global hegemon
      by reviving the actual Bretton Woods system (as it functioned in the 1950s and
      1960s). No, my proposal is that China should build a truly multilateral system,
      in close collaboration with its BRICS+ partners – a New Bretton Woods mirroring
      Keynes’ 1944 proposal, the very proposal President Roosevelt’s team rejected in
      order to establish America’s hegemony. Before explaining how this New Bretton
      Woods might work, let me address some of the objections that will most likely
      be raised – especially in the West. Many will rgue that China cannot be the backbone
      of any international trading system because it imposes capital controls. Do they
      forget that Bretton Woods (both the actual system and Keynes’ ICU proposal) was
      founded – quite sensibly – on capital controls? Others will protest that to be
      at the heart of a large international trading and monetary system, a country must
      run a trade deficit, so that others can have a trade surplus with it. Do they
      forget that the original purpose of Bretton Woods was to maintain the US trade
      surpluses? Clearly, these objections reflect more the prejudices of the objectors
      than any serious economic analysis. Let me now turn to how this New Bretton Woods
      might work as a genuine multilateral system based on non-hegemony and mutual advantage.
      To counter the tendency of the market-driven trading system to generate increasing
      imbalances, Keynes had advocated the replacement of any system where “…the process
      of adjustment is compulsory for the debtor and voluntary for the creditor” [1]
      with one where the force of adjustment falls symmetrically upon debtors and creditors.
      Here is what such a system might look like. Participating countries keep their
      own currencies and central banks. All trade and capital flows between countries
      are denominated in a common digital accounting unit; let’s call it the kosmos
      . Every country’s central bank keeps a reserve account, in kosmos , with some
      common institution (e.g., the existing New Development Bank) that issues the kosmos
      on the basis of a transparent digital distributed ledger and an algorithm that
      adjusts the kosmos total supply in a pre-agreed manner in relation to the volume
      of world trade, allowing also for an automatic countercyclical component that
      boosts the global kosmos supply at times of a general slowdown. Foreign exchange
      markets would function as they do now and the exchange rate between the kosmos
      and various currencies would vary in the same way that the IMF’s Special Drawing
      Rights do viz. the dollar, the euro, the yen etc. The difference, of course, would
      be that, under the New Bretton Woods, all payments between participating countries
      pass through their central bank’s kosmos account. So far, nothing that has been
      proposed mitigates the underlying tendency to build up imbalances within the system
      (large trade deficits and surpluses). However, this new institutional setting
      allows for two key interventions that will not only limit imbalances but will
      also unlock massive potential for mutual development. I call these two interventions
      The Levy and The Charge. Here is what they are and how they work. The Levy : A
      trade imbalance levy to be charged annually to each central bank’s kosmos account
      in proportion to its current account deficit or surplus and paid into a Common
      Development Fund (CDF) held at the kosmos issuing multilateral institution The
      Charge : Private financial institutions to pay a ‘surge’ fee into the same common
      fund, the CDF, in proportion to any surge of capital flows out of a country, reminiscent
      of the congestion price-hike that companies like Uber charge their customers at
      times of peak traffic. The Levy’s rationale is to motivate governments of surplus
      countries to boost domestic spending and investment while systematically reducing
      the international spending power of deficit countries. Foreign exchange markets
      will factor this in, adjusting exchange rates faster in response to current account
      imbalances and cancelling out much of the capital flows which today support chronically
      unbalanced trade. As for the Charge, it will automatically penalise speculative
      herd-like capital inflows or outflows without, however, handing discretionary
      power to bureaucrats or the need for inflexible capital controls. Suddenly, through
      this New Bretton Woods’ common fund, the CDF, the participating countries will
      have acquired, without the need for any subscribed capital, an extra Global Sovereign
      Wealth Fund (in addition to the existing funds of the New Development Bank) that
      achieves two aims at once: it balances global trade and it generates new funding
      for the Just Green Transition at a planetary scale. **** Is this feasible? It
      sure is. China has the technology, in particular expertise in highly sophisticated
      digital payment systems. The rest of the world has the urgent need for a trading
      system that generates stability and mutual advantage, rather than imbalances and
      exploitation. We also have institutional experience with international clearing
      systems. [2] What the world lacks is the political process that can bring all
      these elements together. Would it not be a delicious irony if Donald Trump’s shock
      therapy, which he claims is all about rebalancing the world economy, helped motivate
      China to accept the challenge to do so by coordinating with countries around the
      world, not just the BRICS, to build the multilateral system that Keynes had envisaged
      in 1944 but which was rejected so that the United States could dominate the world
      for another eight decades? For the quancha.cn site where this article was originally

      global economy, highlighting the urgent need for rebalancing to address the imbalances
      affecting the developing world and the rise of fascism in Western economies, while
      the European Union remains unable to contribute effectively due to its structural
      limitations.
    paragraph_summary: The article argues that Donald Trump's actions have shattered
      the illusion that global business can proceed normally, highlighting the urgent
      need for rebalancing the global economy to avoid a crisis potentially worse than
      the 2008 financial meltdown. It critiques the European Union for its inability
      to contribute to this rebalancing due to structural flaws in its eurozone architecture
      and a failure to federalize fiscal decision-making, leading to economic stagnation
      and political fragmentation. The United States, under Trump's administration,
      is portrayed as unwilling to address these imbalances, with contradictory economic
      policies that lack the necessary coercive power. The article suggests that China
      may be the only major player left capable of influencing global economic rebalancing,
      referencing its openness to revisiting historical monetary agreements to stabilize
      the financial system.

    text: 'The IMF-World Bank Spring meetings are usually placid affairs that participating
      central bankers wish to forget soon after they are over. Not this Spring. This
      April the feeling several central bankers brought back home with them was not
      the usual relief but something far more visceral: dread, terror even. The reason?
      The spectre of the Genius Act—the U.S. stablecoin bill barrelling toward law in
      2025, hot on the heels of Donald Trump’s January 23 executive order heralding
      a strategic cryptocurrency reserve. Central bankers have hitherto seen cryptocurrencies
      as a nuisance whose upside is that, thankfully, they lack the capacity to cause
      serious raptures in the architecture of the monetary systems under their care.
      They no longer think now that President Trump’s team are counting on cryptocurrencies
      pegged to the dollar as part of their strategy to rejig the global monetary system.
      What unsettled central bankers this Spring wasn’t just the policy itself, but
      its implications: a deliberate, chaotic unravelling of the 20th century’s monetary
      order where central banks reigned as the sole architects of money. The Genius
      Act doesn’t just allow private stablecoins—it prohibits central bank digital currencies
      (CBDCs), anointing corporate-issued tokens as the new guardians of dollar hegemony.
      This isn’t innovation; it’s a hostile takeover of money itself. Lacking anything
      resembling serious regulation, stablecoins are neither stable nor merely an alternative
      dollar payment option. They are a Trojan horse for the full privatisation of money.
      The European Central Bank sees the danger. If securities migrate to blockchain,
      with bonds, stocks, and derivatives becoming tokenised, then settlement must follow.
      The ECB’s solution is a tokenised euro, ensuring public money remains the bedrock
      of finance. So far, the ECB had to face down resistance to this plan from the
      German and French banks who seek to maintain the status quo. Now, the ECB has
      another, a bigger headache: the spectacle of Washington racing in the opposite
      direction. By banning CBDCs and greenlighting stablecoins, Trump’s team do not
      just reject public digital money—they also outsource dollar supremacy to the darkest
      forces within Big Tech. The irony is grotesque. The same libertarians who rail
      against government are now begging the state to anoint their stablecoins as de
      facto official currency. Worse, they demand access to the Federal Reserve’s balance
      sheet—allowing private issuers to back their tokens with central bank reserves.
      Imagine a world where Tether, Circle, or Elon Musk’s X Coin enjoys the implicit
      backing of the US Treasury while operating outside banking regulations. This isn’t
      just regulatory arbitrage; it’s monetary feudalism. Lest we forget, there is a
      reason 19th century America was a monetary dystopia: thousands of wildcat banks
      issuing private notes, regular panics leaving the public, the working class in
      particular, holding worthless paper. Even J.P. Morgan was so appalled and threatened
      that he decided to strongarm the federal government and other bankers to establish
      the Federal Reserve as a public institution with a remit to stabilise money. Now,
      we’re hurtling backward. The Genius Act, whose final draft we have not seen yet,
      could unleash a digital wildcat era, where stablecoins—pegged to the dollar but
      controlled by private actors—flood the globe with digital pseudo dollars. Even
      if well-intentioned stablecoins, like Circle’s USDC or Tether’s USDT, are run
      by privateers who stand no chance of maintaining their tokens’ dollar peg once
      their volume escalates after they receive the official imprimatur of the federal
      authorities. In what must surely constitute the grossest example of truth reversal,
      President Trump’s executive order ill-defines stablecoins as instruments that
      will “promote and protect the sovereignty of the US dollar.” Loosely translated
      this calls upon shady privateers to flood the world with private dollar proxies,
      ensuring that even if nations ditch the greenback, they’ll still be trapped in
      its digital shadow. Europe is scrambling. The ECB, realising the existential threat,
      is fast-tracking a ‘wholesale CBDC’—a digital euro for institutional use that
      acts as a stopgap: a quick and dirty hybrid system syncing traditional payments
      with blockchain, buying time until true atomic settlement can be pushed past the
      vicious resistance of private bankers. But it may already be too late. While Europe
      dithers with committees, the US is acting. The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)
      regulation has already driven Tether out of Europe—not because MiCA is too strict,
      but because the European Union’s political leadership still does not grasp the
      stakes. If stablecoins become the default money of crypto markets, DeFi, and emerging
      economies, the ECB’s half-baked digital euro will arrive to a battlefield where
      the war is already lost. Meanwhile developing countries face a brutal choice.
      Already choking under the dollar’s dominance, they must now either ban stablecoins
      (thus forfeiting access to crypto capital flows) or create their own to compete
      with the dollar’s network effects. A third, unappetising alternative, is to surrender
      to a new – even more perilous – form of de facto dollarisation. The only central
      bank that has planned ahead of this tsunami is China’s, along with some of the
      rest of the BRICS. Having the luxury of its own, already functioning digital yuan,
      China’s central bank can afford to refuse lending legitimacy to stablecoins by
      regulating them, preferring to ban them altogether to be on the safe side. But
      this sensible defiance leaves one gigantic dilemma still unanswered: China’s accumulated
      savings of approximately $4.5 trillion held by public and private institutions.
      Should they dump them, thus giving a boost to the Trump team’s plan to devalue
      the dollar? Or hold them, thus remaining exposed to the turbulence that Trump’s
      team is so adept at stirring up? In the longer term, the real danger that looms
      is a bifurcation that fuels geo-monetary tensions, in addition to the existing
      geopolitical and geo-economic ones. Two parallel monetary systems seem to be heading
      for a clash: One made of public monies issued in China, India and, maybe, the
      Eurozone. And another comprising private money, increasingly dominated by dollar-pegged
      stablecoins colonising the dollar zone. Is it any wonder that, this Spring, dread
      was the order of the day as our central bankers boarded their planes to return
      from Washington? For the Project Syndicate site click here . The post Trump Wants

    one_sentence_summary: During the typically uneventful IMF-World Bank Spring meetings,
      central bankers expressed significant concern over the impending U.S. stablecoin
      bill, the Genius Act, and its potential to disrupt global monetary systems, particularly
      in light of a new cryptocurrency strategy announced by Donald Trump.
    paragraph_summary: The recent IMF-World Bank Spring meetings were marked by a sense
      of dread among central bankers, primarily due to the impending U.S. "Genius Act,"
      a stablecoin bill set to become law in 2025. This legislation, following a strategic
      cryptocurrency reserve initiative by Donald Trump, threatens to disrupt the established
      monetary order by allowing private stablecoins while prohibiting central bank
      digital currencies (CBDCs). Central bankers, who previously viewed cryptocurrencies
      as a minor nuisance, now perceive this move as a potential hostile takeover of
      the monetary system, undermining their authority and paving the way for the privatization
      of money. The European Central Bank (ECB) recognizes the risks involved, especially
      if securities transition to blockchain technology, prompting it to propose a tokenized
      euro to preserve the role of public money in finance. However, the ECB faces internal
      resistance from banks in Germany and France that prefer to maintain the current
      system, complicating its efforts to adapt to this new landscape.

    url: https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2025/06/05/exposing-keir-starmers-military-spending-scam-interview-with-declassified-uk/
    text: 'Just days into his premiership, Keir Starmer announced the commissioning
      of a “root and branch” Strategic Defence Review (SDR), writes Kate Hudson. Under
      the leadership of Lord Robertson, former defence secretary and NATO secretary
      general, the review panel claims to have broken with tradition, by including a
      much wider range of participants than usual – like former US presidential adviser
      Fiona Hill – and encouraging submissions from pretty much anybody. A better break
      with the past would have been a reassessment of whether the current policies are
      actually working, and whether the large amounts of cash involved could actually
      be better spent on something else. In recent days, Lord Robertson has said that
      the SDR will be “bolder and more radical” than previous versions, and will inspire
      our friends and intimidate our enemies. We await the review with bated breath.
      It’s generally been assumed that the SDR will be looking to justify “defence”
      spending increases, from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% from 2027 to the end
      of the current parliament. Controversially, the government has already announced
      that this increase will be funded by slashing international aid spending. The
      intention is then to increase spending to 3% in the next parliament, although
      it’s highly unlikely that the current prime minister will be making the decisions
      at that point. It’s hard to see, as plenty of military types have pointed out,
      that this level of increase will enable some massive root and branch transformation
      of our supposedly “hollowed-out” armed forces. But that isn’t really the point.
      Tired old policy The reality is that this Labour SDR is a continuation of the
      same tired old “nukes plus NATO” policy of the last 75 years. Yes, there are likely
      to be some new technological knobs on it, like the promised £1bn to develop technology
      to “speed up decisions on the battlefield”. There will also be a new Digital Targeting
      Web to “better connect soldiers on the ground with key information provided by
      satellites, aircraft and drones helping them target enemy threats faster”. What
      could possibly go wrong? But the real problem is that the government is starting
      in the wrong place: more military spending, more emphasis on militarisation within
      our society and “might makes right”, more resources to the “defence” industrial
      sector. And too many in the trade unions and on the left are buying into this
      – falling for the myth that spending on defence is jobs-rich and will boost the
      economy, and the old lie that if you want peace you should prepare for war. It’s
      beyond time to counter this disastrous narrative. With the NATO Secretary General
      calling for increases in military spending of more than 3.5% of GDP, European
      rearmament going into overdrive, and constant references to being war-ready, a
      new approach is crucial. We need to recognise that if we carry on in the same
      way, we will end up in a war that actually directly affects us, and that will
      likely end in nuclear weapons use. The post Exposing Keir Starmer’s military spending
      scam – interview with Declassified UK appeared first on Yanis Varoufakis .'
    one_sentence_summary: Keir Starmer's newly commissioned Strategic Defence Review,
      led by Lord Robertson, aims to be more inclusive and radical than past reviews,
      but critics argue it should also reassess the effectiveness of current defense
      policies and spending.
    paragraph_summary: Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Keir Starmer initiated
      a comprehensive Strategic Defence Review (SDR) led by Lord Robertson, aiming to
      include diverse perspectives and submissions from a broad audience, including
      notable figures like Fiona Hill. While the review is touted as a departure from
      tradition and is expected to advocate for increased defense spending—from 2.3%
      to 2.5% of GDP—funded by cuts to international aid, critics argue that it merely
      perpetuates outdated defense policies centered on nuclear capabilities and NATO
      alliances. Despite promises of a "bolder and more radical" approach, many military
      experts doubt that the proposed funding increases will significantly transform
      the UK's armed forces, suggesting that the SDR may ultimately reinforce existing
      strategies rather than innovate.

    text: 'Failure, corruption and warmongering: Ursula von der Leyen is awarded the
      International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen for her contribution to the EU – because
      in Europe utter failure is not only tolerated, but celebrated! It is one of life’s
      guilty pleasures when one’s cynical prejudices are confirmed. One such moment,
      when I allowed myself a long, hard laugh, came as the news arrived that Ursula
      von der Leyen had been awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen for
      “her services to the unity of the Member States, in the containment of the pandemic,
      for the unity of the Union’s determination to defend itself against Russia — and
      for the impetus towards the Green Deal.” It was now official: In Brussels, nothing
      succeeds like gross failure and, even worse, nothing is rewarded more generously
      than corruption. Let me begin with the above rationale for the Prize: Mrs von
      der Leyen’s “impetus towards the Green Deal”. Can they be serious? Future historians
      will zero in on the so-called Green Deal as an example of what is wrong with the
      European Union: smoke and mirrors masquerading as majestic policy initiatives.
      Indeed, when it was announced, and after studying it carefully, I rushed out an
      article in The Guardian to warn against the Green Deal on two grounds: first,
      the money it promised to invest in the green transition was simply not there and,
      secondly, the heralded deal was rather… brown – in that it aimed at greenwashing
      far more than at greening Europe. Four years later, the Green Deal was declared
      a gross failure and was unceremoniously ditched in favour of Ursula von der Leyen’s
      next white elephant: the folly of building up a European military-industrial complex
      under the codenames Re-Arm Europe or SAFE. Why is it folly to think that von der
      Leyen’s Commission will spearhead a European military-industrial complex? For
      three reasons, as I have explained elsewhere . First, as in the case of the Green
      Deal, the money is not there and the EU cannot credibly commit to finding it given
      its steadfast refusal to form a proper fiscal union. Secondly, even if money were
      not a problem, the EU lacks the federal institutions to construct a top-down,
      paneuropean military-industrial complex, instead of the existing patchwork of
      nation-state based companies that compete with one another with the backing of
      their national governments. Thirdly, even if neither money nor a federal-like
      set of institutions were a problem, Europe would not be able (I hope!) to emulate
      the United States’ capacity to wage one war after the other to ensure a constant
      demand for weapons and munitions. Two terms as President of the European Commission,
      two gross and rather costly failures. But these failures would not be enough to
      burnish Mrs von der Leyen’s credentials and seal her rise to the lofty heights
      that justified granting her the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen. No,
      for that splendid Prize to be awarded, she needed to add certified corruption
      to her gross failure. Thankfully, she did! Showing a remarkable determination
      to break the law both in her own country, Germany, and in the European Union,
      Mrs von der Leyen succeeded in being sanctioned in both jurisdictions for treating
      the public with contempt in pursuit of her own interests. As Germany’s defence
      minister, she desperately tried to conceal her involvement in shady defence contracts
      by sabotaging the Bundestag’s investigation in the matter through the “illegal
      and deliberate” deletion of her phone contents. As European Commission President,
      the EU top court found her culpable of repeating the unlawful practice of deleting
      her phone records of illicit personal exchanges with heads of global corporations
      – on this occasion with the CEO of Pfizer with whom she negotiated, on Europe’s
      behalf, lucrative COVID-19 vaccine deals. With these findings pointing to despicable
      behaviour under her belt, and her majestic policy failures (the Green Deal, Re-Arm
      and SAFE) on hand, Ursula von der Leyen was almost a shoo in for the International
      Charlemagne Prize of Aachen. Almost but not quite! To push through the finishing
      line she needed to add another credential to her curriculum vitae: she needed
      to become the cheerleader of Israel’s army. Thankfully for our European Commission
      President, the opportunity arose after Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October 2023.
      Immediately, Mrs von der Leyen sprang to action. Without any authority or authorisation
      – since neither foreign nor defence policy is in the purview of the Commission
      President – she landed in Tel Aviv, not as a campaigner for an immediate end to
      war crimes on all sides, nor as an ambassador of Peace & Reconciliation or as
      an advocate of International Law or as a believer in the simple idea that the
      Geneva convention is humanity’s last hope in the darkest of hours. No, she went
      there to pose in front of Israeli tanks poised to enter Gaza with the air of a
      proud cheerleader on Grand Final day. She went there as an enabler of the war
      crime of denying two million non-combatants water and food, as a cheerleader of
      an air force intentionally targeting people’s homes, as a facilitator of the war
      crime of transferring a million people to other parts of Gaza where they were
      also bombed. Thus, Mrs von der Leyen’s exhausting work was done, her triple whammy
      of failure-corruption-warmongering completed. She was now the prime candidate
      for the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen, which she received gladly.
      Without a hint of irony, I believe that it was well deserved and fully consistent
      with that particular prize’s background and history. After all, whether deservedly
      or undeservedly, the long dead European Emperor whose name the Prize carries has,
      for many years now, been appropriated by the inanest of Europe’s leaders in a
      frantic search for self-aggrandisement. To make the point, let me take you back
      to a dull autumnal afternoon when two suited men exuding authority entered Aachen’s
      Cathedral. The calendar read September 15 th 1978 and the two men were there to
      pay their respects to the remains of Charlemagne, the 9 th Century Frankish King
      who had briefly re-united the Roman Empire and whose spirit encapsulated, for
      traditionalist Central Europeans, Pan-Europa or Mittel-Europa – a borderless Christian
      European realm. Standing above the Christian warrior’s grave, and next to his
      ancient throne, the two pilgrims sought to quell their considerable trepidation
      caused by what they had just done: commit their two countries, France and Germany,
      to bundle their money together with an agreement, they had signed earlier that
      day to create the so-called European Monetary System (EMS) – the euro’s precursor.
      “Perhaps while we were discussing monetary affairs”, said one of the two to an
      Italian journalist, “the spirit of Charlemagne brooded over us.” His name? President
      Valéry Giscard d’ Estaing of France. The second pilgrim appealing to Charlemagne’s
      ghost for its approval of the monetary union with France was German Chancellor
      Helmut Schmidt. Setting aside the awful Euro-kitsch aesthetic of two leaders visiting
      the tomb of a Christian warrior king to steady their nerves over creating perhaps
      history’s most pathetic monetary union, it is heartening to realise that the EU
      has a long tradition of soap opera-like celebrations of failure. After all, the
      exchange rate mechanism that the two men established back then failed spectacularly
      but Europe still celebrates them to this day. As for the euro, which was born
      as a result of the calamity that was the EMS, it also proved a calamity for Europe
      and Europeans. And yet, in 2002, the committee awarding the International Charlemagne
      Prize of Aachen chose to award that year’s prize to… the euro! In this European
      Union, where nothing succeeds like failure, especially when laced with corruption
      and most recently warmongering, Mrs von der Leyen is the most deserved recipient
      of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen. For the DER FREITAG site, where
      the above was originally published in German, click here . The post In the EU

    one_sentence_summary: Ursula von der Leyen's receipt of the International Charlemagne
      Prize for her contributions to the EU is criticized as a celebration of failure
      and corruption, highlighting the disconnect between her perceived achievements
      and the realities of her leadership.
    paragraph_summary: Ursula von der Leyen has been awarded the International Charlemagne
      Prize of Aachen for her contributions to the European Union, particularly in managing
      the pandemic, responding to Russian aggression, and promoting the Green Deal.
      However, the article criticizes this recognition as emblematic of the EU's tendency
      to celebrate failure and corruption. It argues that the Green Deal, initially
      heralded as a significant initiative, has proven to be ineffective and more about
      greenwashing than genuine environmental progress. Furthermore, the article expresses
      skepticism about von der Leyen's push for a European military-industrial complex,
      citing a lack of funding and credibility, suggesting that her leadership has resulted
      in misguided policies rather than meaningful achievements.

    one_sentence_summary: In a critical episode of UNAPOLOGETIC, Yanis Varoufakis argues
      that the liberal establishment is largely responsible for the Palestinian genocide,
      highlighting the hypocrisy of Western moral superiority, the historical role of
      empire, and the current global crisis, while expressing hope in the Global South.
    paragraph_summary: In the latest episode of UNAPOLOGETIC, Yanis Varoufakis delivers
      a scathing critique of Western liberalism, attributing the ongoing genocide of
      Palestinians to the failures and hypocrisy of the liberal establishment. He discusses
      the illusion of Western moral superiority, the historical and contemporary impacts
      of empire, and how liberal complicity has contributed to the rise of fascism.
      Varoufakis connects these themes to broader issues such as the climate crisis,
      the collapse of capitalism post-2008, and the emergence of technofeudalism, while
      expressing his hope for change through the Global South. The episode covers a
      range of topics, including civil liberties in Europe, the dynamics between China
      and Russia, and the need for new forms of organization in the face of systemic

      prompting the Trump administration to seek a restructuring of the international

      It argues that Europe, while capable of pursuing a more advantageous direction,
      is hindered by inadequate political structures, a lack of collective action, and
      a failure to prioritize the interests of the majority of its citizens, ultimately
      positioning itself as a subordinate entity to the US. The discussion is framed
      within the context of a new economic world order and critiques Europe's current
