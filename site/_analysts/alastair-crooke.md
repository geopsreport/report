summary: |
  The aftermath of the U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran continues to reshape the geopolitical landscape, with the Trump administration facing mounting challenges to its foreign policy strategy. The most recent analysis by **Alastair Crooke** underscores how U.S. miscalculations have not only failed to weaken Iran but have, in fact, bolstered its regional standing and unified its domestic front. Crooke notes that “hubris-driven blunders” have transformed the complexion of the wider conflict, as Iran emerges more resilient and the U.S. struggles to maintain its traditional dominance.
  
  The Trump administration’s approach—marked by headline-grabbing military actions rather than sustainable strategic gains—has, according to Crooke, “strengthened the resistance among global powers” and exposed the limitations of American power projection. The Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, intended as a decisive blow, is now widely seen as a strategic failure that may provoke further escalation rather than resolve the underlying tensions.
  
  Meanwhile, the broader international response signals a shift toward multipolarity. Crooke highlights that the U.S. is increasingly isolated, with major powers such as Russia and China leveraging the situation to advance their own interests and challenge the post-WWII order. The erosion of dollar dominance and the rise of alternative financial systems, particularly in Asia, further complicate Washington’s position.
  
  Looking ahead, Crooke predicts with high confidence that the U.S. will face continued resistance to its policies in the Middle East and beyond. The likelihood of a negotiated settlement with Iran remains low, and the risk of further escalation is “most definitely” present. The trend toward a multipolar world order is accelerating, with the U.S. struggling to adapt to new realities and its adversaries capitalizing on American missteps.

      The big issue emerging from the U.S.’ 22 June strike on Iran – second only to
      ‘wither Iran?’ – is whether in Trump’s calculus he can ‘rhetorically impose’ the
      having “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme claim long enough to both restrain
      Israel from hitting Iran again, yet still allow Trump to pursue his show-stopper
      headline, ‘WE WON: I’m in charge now and everybody is going to do what I tell
      them’.


      These were the key conflicting issues that were to be hammered out with Netanyahu
      during his White House visit this week. Netanyahu’s interests essentially are
      for ‘more hot war’, and thus differ from the Trump ceasefire general stratagem.


      Implicit in his ‘In-Boom-Out & Ceasefire’ Iran approach is that Trump may imagine
      he has created the space to resume his primary objective – that of instituting
      a broader Israeli-centric order across the Middle East, devolving upon trade deals,
      economic ties, investment and connectivity, to create a business-led West Asia,
      centred on Tel Aviv (with Trump as its de facto ‘President’).


      And, via this ‘Business Super Highway’, to strike further beyond – with the Gulf
      States penetrating into BRICS’ south Asian heartland to disrupt BRICS connectivity
      and corridors.


      The sine qua non for any jumpstart to a putative ‘Abraham Accords 2.0 of course
      – as Trump clearly understands – is an end to the Gaza War; the withdrawal of
      Israeli forces from Gaza; and the Strip’s re-construction (none of which seems
      to be in realistic reach).


      What emerges rather, is that Trump continues to be seized by the delusional view
      that his Israeli-centred vision could all be accomplished merely by ending the
      genocide in Gaza, but with the world watching aghast as Israel continues on a
      hegemonic military rampage across the region.


      The most obvious flaw to the Trump premise is that a chastened Iran somehow has
      been achieved by Israeli and American strikes. It is the opposite. Iran has arisen
      more unified, resolute and defiant. Far from being relegated to watching passively
      from the sidelines, Iran now – in the wake of recent events – resumes its place
      as a leading regional power. One that is readying a possibly game-changing military
      riposte to any further strikes by either Israel or the U.S.


      What is ignored in all these western claims of Israeli success, is that Israel
      chose to bet all on a surprise ‘shock and awe’ strike. One that would overturn
      the Islamic Republic at a stroke. It didn’t work: the strategic objective failed,
      and it produced the opposite outcome. But the more fundamental point is that the
      techniques used by Israel – that required months, if not years of preparation
      – cannot just be repeated again now that their stratagems have been fully exposed.


      This White House misreading of the Iran reality signals that the Trump Team allowed
      themselves to be deceived by Israeli hubris in insisting that Iran was a house-of-cards,
      primed to collapse completely into paralysis upon the first taste of the Israeli
      sneak decapitation ‘muscle’ on 13 June.


      This was a fundamental error – in a pattern of similar errors: That China would
      capitulate to the threat of imposed tariffs; that Russia could be coerced into
      a ceasefire against its interests; and that Iran would be ready to sign an unconditional
      surrender document in the face of Trump’s threats post-22 June.


      What these U.S. blunders speak to – apart from a consistent divorce from geo-political
      realities – is western weakness masked behind hubris and bluster. The U.S. Establishment
      clings to its fading primacy; but in doing it so ineffectually, it has instead
      accelerated the formation of a potent geo-strategic alliance intent on defying
      the U.S.


      The consequence has been the wake up call to other States occasioned by the western
      slide towards stratagems of outright lies and deceit: The ‘Spider Web’ operation
      against the Russian strategic bomber fleet on the eve of the Istanbul talks and
      the U.S.-Israeli sneak attack on Iran two days before the expected next round
      of U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks, have increased the will-to-resist by China, Russian
      and Iran particularly, but more generally it is felt across the Global South.


      The entire complexion of this war to retain America’s dollar primacy has been
      irreversibly altered.


      All are ‘on guard’ as they see evidence that, with the expectation of NATO’s defeat
      in Ukraine, the West is ramping up the new Cold War on many fronts: in the Baltic
      Sea; the Caucasus; the Iran periphery (via cyber attack), and of course via escalated
      financial war across the board. Trump is again threatening to sanction Iran and
      any State purchasing its oil. On Monday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he
      would impose a new 10% tariff on “any country aligning themselves with the Anti-American
      policies of BRICS”.


      Naturally, States are preparing against this escalation. Tensions are rising everywhere.


      Azerbaijan (and even Armenia) are being weaponised against Russia and Iran by
      NATO powers and Turkey. Azerbaijan was used to facilitate Israeli drones launched
      into Iran, and its airspace was used too by Israeli aircraft to circle into the
      Caspian Sea in order for Israel to launch stand-off cruise missiles from Azeri
      airspace over the Caspian Sea at Tehran.


      Iraqi Kurdistan, Kazakhstan and the Baluchi borderlands have been used as platforms
      to infiltrate sabotage units into both Russia and Iran to pre-position missiles
      and drones and sabotage units for asymmetric warfare.


      On the other flank of this escalating war, Trump is racing to land a string of
      ‘trade’ agreements across the Pacific, including with Indonesia, Thailand and
      Cambodia. The aim being to build ‘a cage’ of special higher tariffs around China’s
      ability to use ‘trans-shipments’ – that is goods imported into other States from
      China, which are then re-exported to America.


      The U.S. set the precedent via Vietnam, with a 40% tariff on trans-shipments that
      is precisely double the 20% levy on Vietnamese-made goods.


      Except that Trump’s ‘shock and awe’ strategy of imposing tariffs to regain industrial
      activity and to keep the rest of the world subject to dollar hegemony is not working:
      First Trump was forced to announce a 90-day moratorium on Liberation Day Tariffs
      in the hope that 90 deals would be struck in the interim – yet only three ‘framework
      agreements’ were settled. So the Administration is now forced to extend the moratorium
      yet again (to 1 August). Bessent, U.S. Treasury Secretary, has said that many
      of the 90 states originally tariffed did not even try to contact the U.S. to work
      out a deal


      The ability to financially punish people for not doing what the U.S. says is drawing
      to a close. The alternative to the dollar network exists. And it is not a ‘new
      reserve currency’.


      The alternative is the solution envisaged by China: a fusion of Fintech retail
      payment platforms with banking and Central Banking digital frameworks, based on
      block-chain and other digital technologies. (The U.S. cannot replicate this approach
      – as Silicon Valley and Wall Street are at war with each other, and won’t co-operate).


      As Will Schryver noted wryly a couple of years ago —


      “The empire’s seemingly endless string of hubris-driven blunders has rapidly accelerated
      the formation of what is quite arguably the single most potent military / economic
      / geostrategic alliance seen in modern times: the tripartite axis of Russia, China,
      and Iran …


      “It has astoundingly managed to jump from the frying pan of a regional proxy war
      against Russia into the fire of a global conflict that all three of its steadily
      strengthening adversaries now view as existential”.


      “In my considered opinion, this is almost certainly the single most inexplicable
      and portentous series of geopolitical blunders in recorded history”.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the complexities of U.S. foreign policy
      under Trump regarding Iran, emphasizing the miscalculations and hubris that have
      led to a strengthened Iran and a growing resistance among global powers, while
      highlighting the challenges faced by the U.S. in maintaining its geopolitical
      dominance amidst escalating tensions and failed strategies.
    paragraph_summary: In Alastair Crooke's analysis, the aftermath of the U.S. strike
      on Iran raises critical questions about President Trump's strategy, particularly
      his aim to assert dominance over Iran while managing Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's
      desire for increased military action. Trump appears to believe he can claim victory
      over Iran's nuclear ambitions and simultaneously pursue a broader Israeli-centric
      order in the Middle East, despite the ongoing Gaza conflict and the failure of
      Israeli military strategies to weaken Iran. This miscalculation reflects a broader
      pattern of U.S. foreign policy errors, characterized by hubris and a disconnect
      from geopolitical realities, which has inadvertently strengthened alliances among
      Iran, Russia, and China. As tensions escalate globally, particularly with NATO's
      involvement in various regions, the U.S. faces challenges in maintaining its economic
      hegemony and is struggling to adapt to a shifting landscape where alternative
      financial systems are emerging, undermining its traditional power.

  - title: '‘The Land Of Performance’: Trump Wanted A Perfect War, A Headline Showstopper
      – OpEd'

      “Depending on who you ask, the U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities in Fordow,
      Natanz and Isfahan was either a smashing success that severely crippled Tehran’s
      nuclear programme, or a flashy show whose results were less than advertised …
      In the grand scheme of things, all of this is just drama”.


      The big issue – second only to ‘what next in Iran’ and how they might respond
      – says Michael Wolff (who has written four books on Trump), is “how the MAGA is
      going to respond”:


      “And I think he [Trump] is genuinely worried, [Wolff emphasises]. And I think
      he should be worried. There are two fundamental things to this coalition – Immigration
      and War. Everything else is fungible and can be compromised. It’s not sure those
      two elements can be compromised”.


      The signal from Hegseth (‘we are not at war with the Iranian people – just its
      nuclear programme’) clearly reflects a message being ‘walked back’ in the face
      of MAGA pushback: ‘Pay no attention. We’re not really doing war’ is what Hegseth
      was trying to say.


      So, what’s next? There are basically four things that can happen: First, the Iranians
      can say ‘okay, we surrender’, but that’s just not going to happen; the second
      option is protracted war between Iran and Israel with Israel continuing to be
      attacked in a way that it has never been attacked before. And thirdly there is
      attempted regime change – although this has never been successfully achieved by
      air assault alone. Historically, America’s regime changes have been accompanied
      by mass slaughter, years of instability, terrorism and chaos.


      Lastly, there are those who warn that nuclear Armageddon is on the table with
      the aim of destroying Iran. But that would be a case of self-harm, since it likely
      would be Trump’s Armageddon too – at the midterm elections.


      “Let me explain”, says Wolff;


      “I have been making lots of calls – so I think I have a sense of the arc that
      got Trump to where we are [with the strikes on Iran]. Calls are one of the main
      ways I track what he is thinking (I use the word ‘thinking’ loosely)”. “I talk
      to people whom Trump has been speaking with on the phone. I mean all of Trump’s
      internal thinking is external; and it’s done in a series of his constant calls.
      And it’s pretty easy to follow – because he says the same thing to everybody.
      So, it’s this constant round of repetition …”. “So, basically, when the Israelis
      attacked Iran, he got very excited about this – and his calls were all repetitions
      of one theme: Were they going to win? Is this a winner? Is this game-over? They
      [the Israelis] are so good! This really is a showstopper”. “So again, we’re in
      the land of performance. This is a stage and the day before we attacked Iran,
      his calls were constantly repeating: If we do this, it needs to be perfect. It
      needs to be a win. It has to look perfect. Nobody dies”.


      Trump keeps saying to interlocutors: “We go ‘in-boom-out’: Big Day. We want a
      big day. We want (wait for it, Wolff says) a perfect war”. And then, out of the
      blue, Trump announced a ceasefire, which Wolff suggests was ‘Trump concluding
      his perfect war’.


      And so, suddenly – with both Israel and Iran apparently co-operating with the
      staging of this ‘perfect war headline’ – “he gets annoyed that it doesn’t run
      perfectly”.


      Wolff continues:


      “Trump, by then, had already stepped into the role that ‘this was his war’. His
      perfect war. Television drama at the highest level: War to create a headline.
      And the headline is ‘WE WON’. I’m in charge now and everybody is going to do what
      I tell them. What we saw subsequently was his frustration at the spoiling of an
      outstanding headline: They’re not doing what he tells them”.


      What is the broader ramification to this mico-episode? Well, Wolff for one believes
      Trump is unlikely to get sucked into a long complex war. Why? “Because Trump simply
      does not have the attention span for it. This is it. He’s done: In-boom-out”.


      There is one fundamental point to be understood in Wolff’s analysis for its wider
      strategic import: Trump craves attention. He thinks in terms of generating headlines
      – each day, every day, but not necessarily the policies that flow from that headline.
      He seeks daily headline dominance, and for that he wants to define the headlines
      via a rhetorical posture – moulding ‘reality’ to give his own showstopping Trumpian
      ‘take’.


      Headlines then become, as it were, a sort of political dominance which can subsequently
      metamorphose into policy – or not.


      Nonetheless, it will not be quite as easy as Wolff suggests for Trump to simply
      ‘move the spotlight on’ from Iran – although Trump is a master at finding a new
      point of contention. For fundamentally, Trump has committed himself to the ancillary
      headline of ‘Iran will never have a bomb’. Note that he does not define that in
      policy terms, but gives himself wiggle-room for a possible later victory claim.


      Yet, there is another fundamental point here: The Israeli attack on Iran on 13
      June was supposed to collapse Iran like a house-of-cards. That is what Israel
      expected – and what Trump clearly expected too: “[Trump’s phone calls on the eve
      of the Israeli surprise attack] were all repetitions of one theme: Were they going
      to win? Is this a winner? Is this game-over? [The Israelis] are so good! This
      is really a show–stopper”. Trump foresaw the possible collapse of the Iranian
      State.


      Well … it wasn’t ‘game over’. Israelis may be hugging themselves in excitement
      at the Mossad pièce de théâtre on 13 June; at the ‘professionalism’ of Mossad-led
      decapitations; the assassinations of scientists, the cyber and the sabotage attacks.
      Mossad is acclaimed by many in Israel – yet all were tactical achievements.


      The s trategic objective – the ‘be all’ and ‘end all’ of it – was a bust: The
      ‘House-of-Cards’ did not implode. Rather, it powerfully rebounded. Instead of
      Iran being rendered weaker, the attack succeeded in firing-up Shia and Iranian
      national identities. It has ignited a largely dormant national fervour and passion.
      Iran will be the more resolute in the future.


      So, if the Israeli 13 June assault didn’t succeed, why would the plan go any better
      second time around and with Iran fully prepared? A long attritional war with Iran
      may be Netanyahu’s preference to fuel his own hoped-for ‘Great Victory’ headline.
      But Netanyahu cannot now pursue such delusions (neither can Israel survive an
      attritional war) – without substantive American help (which might not be forthcoming).


      Though Trump’s very evident queasiness (as painted by Wolff’s interlocutors) over
      whether the Israeli sneak attack would prove to be a quick win or not, is suggestive
      of Trump’s inner temper: “Is this a winner? Is this game-over? It needs to be
      a win: It has to look perfect: In-boom-out”.


      These repetitive enquiries to those around him spell more a lack of self-confidence,
      rather than suggest that he wants – or has the attention span – for a long-drawn
      out slug-match, bereft of a clear ‘game over’ moment.


      Too, he will be rightly fearful of the effect on his MAGA base of a long war,
      as well as on young Trump voters (who are already beginning to drift away from
      Trump – as focus group polls suggest). Trump’s majorities in both Houses are incredibly
      precarious. $300m could tip them either way.


      Recall too, the second fundamentally important point is that Israel was attacked
      in a way that it has never been attacked before. Israel still hides the extent
      of the damage inflicted by Iranian missiles; but even senior Israeli security
      watchers – as they digest the incrementally exposed extent of damage done to Israel
      – are drawing the bitter lesson that the Iranian ‘programme’ may not be able to
      be destroyed by military means. But only through a diplomatic agreement of some
      sort – if at all.


      Regime Change also has been revealed as a chimaera. Iran has never been as united
      and as steadfast as it is now. The threat to kill the Supreme Leader also completely
      backfired. Four Shia leading religious authorities (Marja’iyya), including the
      celebrated Grand Ayatollah Sistani in Iraq, have issued rulings that any attack
      on the Supreme Leader would trigger a jihad fatwa obligating all of the Ummah
      (community) to join with religious war on America and Israel.


      Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran reaching an agreed outcome seem far off.
      The IAEA has made itself a major part to the problem, rather than forming any
      part of a solution. Trump’s attention span on the Ukraine ‘ceasefire’ ploy seems
      to be ebbing – and this possibly might be the eventual outcome with Iran too.
      Long negotiations leading nowhere, as Iran quietly re-starts its enrichment programme.
      And presumably Israel launching further assaults on Iran, leading to Iran’s inevitable
      response – and escalation.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the mixed perceptions of the U.S. bombing
      of Iran's nuclear facilities, highlighting Trump's focus on generating headlines
      and quick victories rather than engaging in prolonged conflict, while emphasizing
      that the Israeli attack did not achieve its intended strategic objectives and
      may lead to further escalation rather than resolution.

      attack on Iran did not achieve its intended strategic objectives, instead unifying
      and energizing Iranian nationalism. The piece concludes that negotiations between

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      At one level, Iran plainly ‘won’. Trump had wanted to be regaled with a reality-TV
      style, splendid ‘Victory’. Sunday’s attack on the three nuclear sites indeed was
      loudly proclaimed by Trump and Hegseth as such – having ‘obliterated’ Iran’s nuclear
      enrichment programme, they claimed. ‘Destroyed it completely’, they insist.


      Only … it didn’t: The strike caused superficial surface damage, perhaps. And seemingly
      was co-ordinated in advance with Iran via intermediaries to be a ‘once and done’
      affair. This is a habitual Trump pattern (advance co-ordination). It was the mode
      in Syria, Yemen and even with Trump’s assassination of Qasem Soleimani – all intended
      to give Trump a quick media ‘victory’.


      The so-called ‘ceasefire’ that rapidly followed the U.S. strikes – albeit not
      without some hiccoughs – was a hastily assembled ‘cessation of hostilities’ (and
      no ceasefire – as no terms were agreed). It was a ‘stop-gap’. What this means
      is that the negotiating impasse between Iran and Witkoff remains unresolved.


      The Supreme Leader has forcefully laid down Iran’s position: ‘No surrender’; Enrichment
      proceeds; and the U.S. should quit the region and keep its nose out of Iranian
      affairs.


      So, on the positive side of cost-benefit analysis, Iran likely has enough centrifuges
      and 450 kg of highly enriched uranium – and nobody (except Iran) now knows where
      the stash is hidden. Iran will resume processing. A second plus for Iran is that
      the IAEA and its Director-General Grossi have been so egregiously subversive of
      Iranian sovereignty that the Agency most likely will be expelled from Iran. The
      Agency failed in its basic responsibility to safeguard sites at which enriched
      uranium was present.


      The U.S. and European intelligence services thus will lose their ‘eyes’ on the
      ground – as well as forego the IAEA’s Artificial Intelligence data collection
      (on which Israel’s identification of targets likely was heavily dependent).


      On the cost side, militarily, Iran of course suffered physical damage, but retains
      its missile potency. The U.S.-Israeli narrative of Iranian skies as ‘open wide’
      to Israeli aircraft is yet another deception contrived to support the ‘winning
      narrative’:


      As Simplicius notes: “There remains not a single shred of proof that Israeli (or
      American, for that matter) planes ever significantly overflew Iran at any time.
      Claims of ‘total air superiority’ have no grounds. [Footage] up until the final
      day shows Israel continued relying on their heavy UCAVs [large surveillance and
      strike drone aircraft] to strike Iranian ground targets”.


      Furthermore, drop tanks from Israeli planes were recorded washing up on Iran’s
      northernmost Caspian shores, suggesting rather, stand-off missile launches were
      being mounted by Israel’s Air Force from the north (i.e. from Azerbaijani airspace).


      Up a level in the cost-benefit analysis, one must move to the bigger picture:
      That the destruction of the nuclear programme was pretext, yet not the main objective.
      The Israelis themselves say that the decision to attack the Iranian State was
      taken last September/October (2024). Israel’s intricate, costly and sophisticated
      plan (de-capitation, targeted assassinations, cyber-attack and the infiltration
      of drone-equipped sabotage cells) that unfolded during the 13 June sneak attack
      was focussed on one immediate aim: the implosion of the Iranian state, paving
      the path to chaos and ‘regime change’.


      Did Trump believe in the Israeli delusion that Iran was on the brink of imminent
      collapse? Very likely, he did. Did he believe the Israeli story (reportedly concocted
      by the IAEA Mosaic programme) that Iran was speeding ‘towards a nuclear weapon’?
      It seems possible that Trump was suckered – or more likely, was willing prey –
      to the Israeli and U.S. Israeli-Firster narrative building.


      As the Ukraine issue has proved more intractable than Trump expected, the Israeli
      promise of an ‘Iran ready to implode, Syria-style’ – an ‘Epic’ transformation
      to a ‘New Middle East’ – must have been alluring enough for Trump to brusquely
      sweep aside Tulsi Gabbard’s assertion that Iran had no nuclear weapon.


      So, has the Iranian military response and the massive popular rallying to the
      flag been a ‘big win’ for Iran? Well, it is certainly a ‘win’ over the ‘brink
      of regime change’ pedlars; yet perhaps the ‘win’ needs refining? It is not a ‘forever
      win’. Iran cannot afford to let its guard down.


      ‘Iranian unconditional surrender’ is, of course, now off the cards. But the point
      here is that the Israel establishment, the pro-Israeli lobby in the U.S. (and
      possibly Trump too), will continue to believe that the only way to guarantee that
      Iran never moves toward threshold weapon status – is not through intrusive inspections
      and monitoring, but precisely via ‘regime change’ and the installation of a purely
      western puppet in Tehran.


      The ‘long war’ to subvert Iran, weaken Russia, BRICS and China is on hold. It
      is not over. Iran cannot afford to relax or to neglect its defences. What is at
      stake is the U.S. attempt to control the Middle East and its oil as a buttress
      to its dollar trading primacy.


      Professor Hudson notes that “Trump had expected that countries would respond to
      his tariff chaos by reaching an agreement not to trade with China – and indeed
      to accept trade and financial sanctions against China, Russia and Iran”. Clearly,
      both Russia and China understand the geo-financial stakes surrounding a ‘no surrender’
      Iran. And they understand too, how regime change would make Russia’s southern
      underbelly vulnerable; how it could collapse the BRICS trade corridors, and be
      used as a wedge separating Russia from China.


      Put plainly: the U.S. long war likely will be resumed in a new format. Iran notably
      has survived this acute phase of the confrontation. Israel and the U.S. bet all
      on an uprising of the Iranian people. It didn’t happen: Iranian society united
      in the face of aggression. And the mood is more robust; more resolute.


      However, Iran will ‘win’ all the more if the authorities seize on the euphoria
      of a united society to impart a new energy into the Iranian Revolution. The euphoria
      will not last forever – absent action. It is a paradoxical and unexpected opportunity
      offered to the Republic.


      Israel, by contrast, having launched its ‘psychic-shock war’ to overturn the Iranian
      State, has quickly found itself in a situation where its enemy did not surrender,
      but responded. Israel found itself the target of large-scale retaliatory strikes.
      The situation quickly became critical – both economically and in the depletion
      of air defences – as Netanyahu’s desperate appeals to the U.S. for rescue, duly
      attested.


      Moving to the wider geo-political cost-benefit level, Israel’s standing (at the
      regional level) of being unassailable when fused to American power, has taken
      a blow: ‘Think of it this way, in ten or twenty years, what will be remembered
      … [the de-capitation strike and the targeted killings of scientists] … or the
      fact that Israeli cities burned for the first time; that Israel failed to defang
      Iran’s nuclear program, and flopped with every other major objective it had, including
      regime change?’.


      “The fact is, Israel suffered an historic humiliation that has destroyed its mystique”.
      Gulf States will have some difficulty to digest the larger meaning to this symbolic
      occurrence.


      And though Trump’s electorate seemingly is satisfied that America participated
      in the war minimally – and apparently is happy to reside cocooned in a miasma
      of exaggerated self-congratulation – there is significant evidence that the MAGA
      faction of the Trump coalition, simultaneously is reaching the conclusion that
      the U.S. president is increasingly becoming part of the Deep State system that
      he so ardently criticised.


      There were two key issues in the last U.S. Presidential election: immigration
      and ‘no more forever wars’. Trump, today, despite highly confusing and contradictory
      massaging, is clear that a forever war is not off the table: “If Iran builds nuclear
      facilities again – then in that scenario – the U.S. will strike [again]”, Trump
      has warned.


      That – and the increasingly bizarre posts that Trump pens – seem to have had the
      effect of radicalising the Populist base against Trump on this issue.


      For the rest of the world, Trump’s recent postings are disturbing. Perhaps they
      work for some Americans, but not elsewhere. It means that Moscow, Beijing or Tehran
      find it harder to take such erratic messaging seriously. Equally troubling, however,
      is how divorced from geo-political reality, in a succession of cases, Team Trump
      has proved to be in their situation assessments. Amber lights are flashing in
      many capitals across the world.'

      a pattern of Trump seeking quick media victories rather than genuine military
      success. Iran's Supreme Leader has firmly rejected any notion of surrender, indicating
      that enrichment will continue and the U.S. should withdraw from the region. While
      the U.S. and Israel aimed for regime change in Iran, the anticipated uprising
      did not materialize, leading to a united Iranian front. This failure has damaged
      Israel's regional standing and raised questions about the efficacy of U.S. foreign
      policy under Trump, who continues to suggest future military action against Iran.
      The article highlights the complexities of the geopolitical landscape, suggesting
      that the long-standing U.S. efforts to control the Middle East and undermine Iran
      are far from over, and that Iran must remain vigilant in the face of ongoing threats.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      The IAEA Board’s ‘Non-Compliance’ Resolution on 12 June 2025 was the planned precursor
      for Israel’s ‘bolt from the blue’ strike on Iran the next day. Israelis say the
      plan to go to war with Iran was grounded in ‘the opportunity’ to strike, and not
      the intelligence that Iran was speeding towards a bomb (that was the peg for war).


      The sudden claim of Iran being very close to a bomb (that seemingly jumped out
      of ‘nowhere’ to leave Americans puzzling how could it happen that – in the blink
      of eye, we are going to war – was subsequently refuted by IAEA Chief Grossi to
      CNN on 17 June (but only after the abrupt attack on Iran already had taken place):


      “We did not have any evidence of a systematic effort [by Iran] to move to a nuclear
      weapon”, Grossi confirmed on CNN.


      This statement drew the following riposte from Iran by its Foreign Ministry Spokesman,
      Esmaeil Baqaei on 19 June:


      “This is too late, Mr. Grossi – you obscured this truth in your absolutely biased
      report that was instrumentalized by E3/U.S. to craft a resolution with baseless
      allegation of [Iranian] ‘non-compliance’; the same resolution was then utilized,
      as a final pretext, by a genocidal warmongering regime to wage a war of aggression
      on Iran and to launch an unlawful attack on our peaceful nuclear facilities. Do
      you know how many innocent Iranians have been killed/maimed as a result of this
      criminal war? You turned IAEA into a tool of convenience for non-NPT members to
      deprive NPT members of their basic right under Article 4. Any clear conscience?!”.


      To which Dr Ali Larijani, Advisor to the Supreme Leader, added:


      “When the war ends, we will hold the director of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, accountable”.


      What they are saying:


      The Russian Foreign Ministry’s Statement, in relation to the escalation of the
      Iranian-Israeli conflict –


      “It was precisely these “sympathisers” [EU3] who exerted pressure on the leadership
      of the [IAEA] Agency to prepare a controversial “comprehensive assessment” of
      Iran’s nuclear programme, the flaws of which were subsequently exploited to push
      through a biased anti-Iran resolution at the IAEA Board of Governors on 12 June
      [2025]. This resolution effectively provided a green light to actions by West
      Jerusalem, leading to tragedy” [i.e. to the sneak attack on the immediate day
      after, 13 June].


      Behind the scenes:


      The underpinnings to the 12 June 2025 IAEA Resolution – giving pretext for Israel
      to strike Iran (and crafted to sway President Trump to dismiss his own Director
      of National Intelligence’s warnings that there was no evidence of Iran moving
      towards weaponisation) – reportedly were drawn not from Mossad or other western
      intelligence services, but from IAEA software. As DD Geo-politics outlines, since
      2015, the IAEA has relied on Palantir’s Mosaic platform, a $50-million AI system
      that sifts through millions of data points – satellite imagery, social media,
      personnel logs – to predict nuclear threats:


      “Iran’s stockpile [of enriched uranium] had been growing steadily for months—yet
      the narrative of an imminent breakthrough surged only after the IAEA’s censure
      on June 6, 2025. That resolution, adopted 19–3, provided Israel the diplomatic
      cover it needed. Palantir’s Mosaic platform played a critical role in this pivot.
      Its data shaped the May 31 report, flagging anomalies at Fordow and Lavisan-Shian,
      and recycling prior allegations from Turquzabad—despite years-old Iranian denials
      and sabotage … Mosaic was conceived originally to identify insurgent activity
      in Iraq and Afghanistan”.


      Its algorithm looks to identify and infer ‘hostile intent’ from indirect indicators
      – metadata, behavioral patterns, signal traffic – not from confirmed evidence.
      In other words, it postulates what suspects may be thinking, or planning. On 12
      June, Iran leaked documents, which it claimed showed IAEA chief Rafael Grossi
      sharing Mosaic outputs with Israel. By 2018, Mosaic had processed more than 400
      million discrete data objects and had helped impute suspicion to over 60 Iranian
      sites such as to justify unannounced IAEA inspections of those sites, under the
      JCPOA. These outputs, though dependent largely on the algorithmic equations, were
      incorporated into formal IAEA safeguard reports and were widely accepted by UN
      member states and non-proliferation regimes as credible, evidence-based assessments.
      Mosaic however is not a passive system. It is trained to infer from its algorithm
      hostile intent, but when repurposed for nuclear oversight, its equations risk
      translating simple correlation into malicious intent.


      What leading Israeli commentators are saying:


      Leading Israeli centre-right commentator, Ben Caspit (Ma’ariv):


      “Was Iran’s ‘breakthrough’ to the nuclear weapon actually detected? Probably not.
      Was the [Supreme] Leader’s “order” to achieve a military nuclear weapon actually
      given? Probably not. So why did we go to war? Because there was no choice. They
      were promoting an Israeli annihilation plan and we had no choice… October 7: A
      cold shower woke up an entire country. All those involved need to understand that
      anyone who contemplates our destruction will be destroyed. Eyes on the ball and
      a bullet between the eyes … From now on, every move one of our enemies makes somewhere
      must be followed by action. Every snake’s head that rises must be beheaded … And
      there is something else: the rare and one-time historical window of opportunity
      that suddenly opened before us … All of this made the decision to go to this war
      the right one … Netanyahu is currently in euphoria”.


      Israeli commentator, Nahum Barnea (Yedioth Ahoronot):


      “The decision to start a war was all Netanyahu’s. And here he is, deciding and
      responsible: all the credit is his. Trump gave Israel the green light to start
      a war, provided that it does not present America as a partner and responsible.
      The Trump method does not distinguish between Zelensky’s Ukraine and Khamenei’s
      Iran: humiliation along the way is the guarantee of an agreement in the end”.


      Israeli & NY Times commentator, Ronan Bergman (Yedioth Ahoronot):


      “The need for the series of assassinations last week first emerged as a thought
      last September, among senior officials in Unit 8200, the research division in
      the Intelligence Directorate, the Mossad, and other parts of the system. The trigger
      was the defeat inflicted by the IDF on Hezbollah, followed by the successful attack
      on Iran and the destruction of its air defence system in October, followed in
      December by the collapse of the Assad regime in Damascus and the destruction of
      its air defence system by the IDF. The sequence of events led many senior Israeli
      officials to believe that an unprecedented opportunity had arisen, a window of
      a lifetime, to attack Iran… And so the beheading forum, which decided the fates
      of scientists thousands of miles away, sat down and decided who would be ranked
      at level A – the highest importance – and who at levels B, C or D – the lowest”.


      Big Picture:


      Seemingly, Trump had been convinced by Netanyahu, Ron Dermer and CENTOM’s General
      Kurilla (Politico reports that Kurilla was instrumental in persuading Trump that
      DNI Tulsi Gabbard was wrong in her assessment that Iran had ‘no bomb’). Trump
      sided with the Israelis, asserting that Iran was “very close” to having a bomb,
      and added that he ‘didn’t care what she [Gabbard] thinks’. Trump did speculate
      out loud – the day before the sneak 13 June – that an Israeli attack (on Iran)
      “could speed [up] a deal”. There is little doubt that Syria’s unexpectedly sudden
      ‘fall’ galvanized the neo-cons to imagine they might quickly repeat the exercise
      in Iran. This is why, too, so much emphasis is beinglaid on assassinating the
      Supreme Leader. When Iran did not collapse; when the Iranian system rebooted itself
      unexpectedly swiftly; and when Iran’s retaliatory strikes on Israel began, the
      pro-Israeli bloc panicked and exerted tremendous pressure on Trump for the U.S.
      to enter the war on Israel’s behalf.


      This left Trump facing a terrible dilemma – having to choose between the sirens,
      Scylla and Charybdis – either to alienate his MAGA support base (who voted for
      him precisely to prevent the U.S. joining another forever war (thus likely causing
      a GOP loss at the next midterms)), or to alienate his ultra-rich Jewish donors
      (such as Miriam Adelson, whose money holds sway over Congress, and whose resources
      are harnessed by the Deep State to pursue mutual interests with the Israeli-Firsters),
      who would turn against him.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      The Musk versus Trump fallout (at least for now) has a distinct ‘made for television’
      quality to it. But do not be deceived by the entertainment content. The spat illustrates
      a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the MAGA coalition. It is quite possible
      that this contradiction will erupt at some further point and may end up triggering
      the slow decay of Project Trump.


      A fulcral moment in the last U.S. election was the switch of Silicon Valley’s
      ultra-rich Tech oligarchs from their support for the Democrats to Trump. It brought
      both money and the potential glittering prize that America could seize a monopoly
      over global data storage; AI; and what Yanis Varoufakis calls ‘cloud capital’
      – the purported ability to extract rent (i.e. fees) for access to America’s putative
      massive data hoard and to Big Tech’s associated platforms. Such a data monopoly,
      it was believed, would then give the U.S. the ability to manipulate how the world
      thinks – and to define the products and planforms seen to be ‘cool’.


      The notion too was that a monopoly on data centres could potentially be as lucrative
      as the U.S. monopoly of the dollar used as the principal trade currency – which
      could provide major capital inflows to offset debt.


      The explosive quality to a coalition of Tech Oligarchs with the MAGA Populists,
      however, is that both factions hold irreconcilable visions – both for dealing
      with America’s structural debt crisis, as well as that of America’s cultural future.


      The ‘Tech Bros’ vision is wildly radical; it is ‘authoritarian libertarianism’.
      Peter Thiel, for example, argues that a small posse of Oligarchs should rule the
      empire, unfettered by any democratic limitation; that the future should be based
      in ‘disruptive technology’; be robotic and AI driven; and that the populace should
      be tightly ‘managed’ through AI control.


      The Trump Economic Team’s vision is quite different: Trump’s own primordial objective
      – to which geo-politics is subordinate – is to shore up the dollar as the world’s
      main trading currency. This objective however can only be sustained through addressing
      America’s unsustainable debt overhang.


      The overhang reflects the imbalance that built up after 1970 when the U.S. trade
      account slipped into deficit: On the one hand, the U.S. has facilitated an exaggeratedly
      large sphere of global dollar indebtedness to splurge worldwide; but at the same
      time, this massive inverted pyramid of debt rests on a diminutive and shrinking
      American production base.


      In other words, whilst America benefited enormously from these capital inflows,
      it can no longer expect to grow itself out of its own, self-created debt-trap.


      Team Trump proposes to address this imbalance through devaluing the dollar (perhaps
      by up to 30%), by corporate tax cuts (to induce a return of overseas manufacturing
      to the U.S.), and thus bringing about a managed shrinkage of the offshore dollar
      debt cloud relative to U.S. productive capacity.


      To be clear, this does not solve the debt problem – It just buys time.


      The Tariff ‘shock and awe’ strategy was intended to frighten the world into making
      unwise deals to accommodate this schema. The U.S. pressure on states for greater
      NATO defence spending too, similarly follows U.S. ‘bankruptcy best practice’ for
      the restructuring of existing creditors.


      So far, this has not worked out as planned, due in major part to Chinese resistance.
      As a result, the U.S. bond-market (debt market) remains today on tenderhooks,
      with every auction a nail-biter.


      Over simplifying things – one can see that the populist MAGA base are insisting
      on a return to a real human economy and well-paid employment prospects versus
      the contrasting dystopian view of theTech Bros, who see only a (non-human) disruptive
      tech, robotic and AI future. These visions are completely at odds with each other.


      Knowing this background may explain how Steve Bannon (a supporter of the MAGA
      populists) can be viscerally opposed to Elon Musk, labelling him an apostate,
      an ‘illegal migrant’, with the demand that he be deported.


      The question is, how did such contradictory visions find themselves joined into
      a single coalition?


      Well, first Trump was obliged to do a deal in order to be elected. He had to do
      a deal with the U.S. ‘money circus’ (the ultra-rich), not only on how to rescue
      the U.S. economy, but he then had to ‘square’ this with the panjandrums of the
      ‘dark’ Establishment who control much of America’s political ‘life’.


      These panjandrums serve as the ‘gods’ protecting a ‘sacred’ security architecture:
      the U.S.’ unqualified, bi-partisan support for Israel and the ancient visceral
      phobia towards Russia. However, they also harbour deep qualms for the security
      of America’s financial fortress – which is expressed as ‘China cannot be allowed
      to win the war for the future of global finance’.


      So what brought such disparate parts together?


      In a new book, The Haves and the Have-Yachts, Evan Osnos describes how one man,
      Lee Hanley,significantly shaped American Right-wing politics over recent decades.
      Steve Bannon, the original architect of Trump’s MAGA platform, called Osnos one
      of the “unsung heroes” of American history. “He had a real love of the hobbits,
      the deplorables”, Bannon said, “and he put his money where his mouth was”.


      Wessie du Toit writes that Hanley was one of the super-rich. He quotes Osnos who
      outlines that America’s super-rich are not united in a single faction. They are
      divided: Forbes reported on the eve of the 2024 election that Kamala Harris had
      more billionaire donors than Trump (83 versus 52), however “over two-thirds (70%)
      of billionaire-family contributions went in support of GOP candidates and conservative
      causes”. Forbes also reports that billionaire political spending is now an astonishing
      160 times higher than in 2010.


      What is going on? Du Toit quotes Osnos outlining how Hanley “uncannily prefigured
      Trump’s electoral strategy” by assembling “a coalition of conservative élites
      and the white working class”. In brief, members of America’s élite accepted the
      terms of Trumpism as the price that would need to be paid, were they to have keep
      the prospect of holding on to their power.


      “After Mitt Romney’s defeat in 2012, Hanley commissioned a pollster to look deeper
      into the underlying mood in the U.S. He was informed that “the level of discontent
      in this country was beyond anything measurable”. Hanley became convinced that
      Trump was the only politician capable of channelling this energy in a favourable
      direction, and set about converting other wealthy donors to the cause. It was
      a canny investment. Even as Trump gave expression to the anger of Bannon’s “hobbits”,
      his presidency brought immense material rewards [to these wealthy oligarchs]”.


      “Trump is a creature of the money-world, and, specifically, of a period of American
      thinking about greed, fairness, liberty, and dominance”. This was the ‘other revolution’
      to that of the MAGA populists, Osnos points out.


      Over the years, “a section of America’s élite has increasingly rejected constraints
      on their ability to accrue wealth, disavowing the notion that their great resources
      entail any special responsibility towards their fellow citizens. They have embraced
      a radical libertarian ethos which casts them simply as private individuals, responsible
      for their own fate, and entitled to enjoy their riches – as they alone see fit”.


      This brings us to the Trumpian riddle that Osnos sets out at the start of his
      book: “To understand why a voter could revile ‘the élite’ and [yet still] revere
      the billionaire scion of a New York real estate fortune”. Osnos may be correct
      in responding to this riddle that the ‘level of discontent’ found by Hanley in
      2012 had forced the élites to embrace unpredictable forms of populism in order
      to maintain their wealth and oligarchies”.


      The problem here is obvious: The values of the Populist revolutionaries run counter
      to those venture-capitalist backers of Trump – such as Peter Thiel, David Sachs,
      Elon Musk or Marc Andreessen.


      How might this be resolved? The MAGA fear is that the Silicon Valley Oligarchs
      possibly could rejoin the Democrats in time for the Mid-Term Congressional elections.
      Or even that Musk could launch a centrist Third Party (an idea that he has already
      mooted on social media).


      What makes these contradictions potentially incendiary is that none of Trump’s
      main foreign policy planks –dealing with China, bringing Iran and West Asia into
      normalisation with Israel, and striking a relationship with Russia – are proceeding
      as planned. Yet Trump needs quick tariff deals, because America’s debt and fiscal
      situation require it.


      These main geo-political proposed deals were predicated on America having negotiating
      dominance (holding the ‘aces’). Yet events have shown that Trump does not hold
      the bigger cards. China remains “very tough to deal with”, and Iran and Russia
      no less so.


      In fact, the aces are held not so much by Trump, but by the U.S. Senate which
      can hold approval of Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill hostage to the demands by a majority
      of Senators who seemingly favour escalation against Russia and ‘no enrichment’
      for Iran.


      Trump Team’s thinking that the attempted assault on Russia’s nuclear deterrence
      would pressure Putin into accepting a ceasefire on U.S. terms has backfired roundly.


      In spite of his (not very convincing) claims that he, Trump, was not aware of
      Ukraine’s attack on Russia’s strategic bombers, Russia takes the situation very
      seriously: Larry Johnson has reported from Moscow that retired General Evgeny
      Buzhinsky (who served in the Main Directorate of International Military Cooperation
      of the Russian Ministry of Defence) told him that “Putin was furious”. The General
      went on to warn that this moment marked the closest that the U.S. and Russia have
      come to the brink of nuclear war since the Cuban missile crisis.


      In Moscow, this episode has opened the question of whether Trump’s true aim –
      all along – has been to pressure Putin to accept a ceasefire that would weaken
      him politically, as well as to bind Russia into a situation of endless conflict
      with Ukraine – a framework that would allow Trump to pivot directly against China
      (an objective dating to 2016 and one which would be endorsed by all of America’s
      power centres).


      Firstly, Trump must have made the calculation that the U.S. Senate and the dark
      permanent state would be solidly opposed to any real transformation of relations
      with Russia – a transformation that would leave the Russian state stronger. And
      secondly (and more telling) is that Trump has not raised a finger to issue a new
      Presidential Policy ‘Finding’ cancelling the earlier Biden Administration finding
      authorising the CIA to pursue the strategic defeat of Russia. Why not? Where too
      are Trump’s incremental steps toward normalisation of relations?


      We do not know.


      But his Team’s misreading of the Russian temper has strengthened Russian and many
      others’ resolve to resist Washington’s attempts to compel outcomes that run against
      their own interests. Trump’s strategy to maintain the dollar as the primary trading
      currency, however, depends on the confidence others have in the U.S.


      Confidence is everything.


      And that ‘capital’ is being eroded rapidly.'

      a fundamental contradiction within the MAGA coalition, as the divergent visions
      of the populist base and the tech oligarchs regarding America's economic and cultural
      future may ultimately threaten the stability of Trump's political project.
    paragraph_summary: Alastair Crooke's article explores the tensions between Elon
      Musk and Donald Trump, highlighting a deeper contradiction within the MAGA coalition
      that could undermine Trump's political project. The article discusses how Silicon
      Valley's wealthy tech oligarchs shifted their support from Democrats to Trump,
      driven by the potential for a data monopoly that could enhance U.S. global influence.
      However, the contrasting visions of the tech elite, who advocate for an "authoritarian
      libertarianism" driven by AI and automation, clash with Trump's populist agenda
      focused on reviving American manufacturing and addressing the national debt. This
      discord raises questions about the sustainability of their alliance, especially
      as Trump's foreign policy efforts falter and the geopolitical landscape becomes
      increasingly complex. The article suggests that the underlying discontent among
      the populace and the elite's willingness to embrace populism for self-preservation
      could lead to a fracturing of the coalition, particularly if tech leaders like
      Musk realign with Democrats or pursue independent political ambitions. Ultimately,
      the article warns that the erosion of confidence in U.S. economic stability could
      have dire consequences for Trump's objectives.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      Russia’s leadership is in ‘conclave’ determining its riposte.


      Trump has been silent for two days. Unprecedented. In the last days, Ukraine and
      its facilitators attempted a massive attack on Russia’s strategic nuclear bomber-force;
      succeeded in collapsing two bridges onto civilian trains heading to Moscow; attacking
      the Kerch Bridge; and assassinating a Russian general via explosive body bomb.


      As Clausewitz noted two centuries ago, the point of military force is to compel
      an outcome: i.e. that an adversary finally does what is wanted of him. Thus, in
      respect to military adventures there is need for clarity of thought from the outset.
      It must have a realisable political objective that has a prospect to be implemented.


      What then, was the objective behind these Ukrainian ‘irregular’ attacks? One certainly
      was demonstrative – PR exercises to say that Ukraine and allied services are still
      capable of mounting special forces style, innovative operations. And are therefore
      worthy of continued support. As Colonel Doug Macgregor cautions:


      “For the most part it was a PR stunt to try and convey the impression that Ukraine
      is capable of carrying on the war. Anything you hear from the Western outlets
      … are probably untrue or at least grossly exaggerated … We damaged ourselves and
      our relationship – what there is left of it – with Moscow … that’s the real fallout
      from this”.


      Okay. But PR stunts are no strategy, nor do the attacks hold any prospect for
      a shift in the overall strategic military paradigm. It doesn’t say that the West
      or Ukraine has suddenly discovered a political strategy towards Russia per se.
      That doesn’t exist. For the most part, the innumerable western declarations come
      as a hodge-podge of fantasies.


      The second objective however, may indeed have had a clear strategic end-state
      – and has demonstrated feasibility and the possibility to compel a desired outcome:
      The various attacks have imposed on Trump the uncomfortable reality that he, as
      President, does not control U.S. foreign policy. The collective Deep State has
      just made that plain.


      As General Mike Flynn has warned:


      “The Deep State is now acting outside of the control of the elected leadership
      of our nation … These persons in our Deep State are engaged in a deliberate effort
      to provoke Russia into a major confrontation with the West, including the United
      States”.


      In effect, the likes of Generals Keith Kellogg and Jack Keane, with their adolescent
      narratives that only through pressure, more pressure and pain will compel Putin
      (always presumed to be weak) to accept a frozen conflict in the hope that it can
      obvert from an American defeat in Ukraine.


      The British during WW2 similarly believed that the Nazi regime was not strong,
      and could be overthrown by strategic bombing, intended to bring about the collapse
      of German society. Today, General Kellogg advocates ‘bombing’ Russia with sanctions
      – mirroring the British conviction that such tactics ‘must be bad for morale’.


      Trump’s advice from his Generals either did not meet the criterion of political
      realism – because it was based on fantasies of incipient Russian collapse and
      a hopeless misreading of Russia and its Army. Or perhaps his Advisers, either
      inadvertently or deliberately, ‘shafted’ Trump and his agenda of normalising relations
      with Russia.


      What will Trump say now to Putin? That he was indeed forewarned (recall his writing
      just days ago that “bad things – if it were not for me – I mean REALLY BAD things
      would already have happened to Russia”) and claim that his advisers did not give
      him the full details; or will he candidly admit that they deceived him? Alternatively,
      will he take the line that the CIA was merely operating to an old Presidential
      ‘Finding’ that authorised attacks into the depth of the Russian hinterland?


      All such putative answers would spell one thing – that Trump is not in control.
      That he and his European allies (such as Britain) cannot be trusted.


      Either way, Trump’s advisers will have understood that Zelensky and by extension
      his NATO enablers, were exploiting the SALT/START Treaties’ vulnerability – in
      order to use concealed drones, hidden in civilian containers, to attack the very
      bombers covered by USA-Russia treaties: Article XII of the START treaty specifically
      requires “a display in the open of all heavy bombers within the airbase”. This
      provision was a confidence building act (visible monitoring) to guard against
      a surprise ‘first strike’ nuclear attack.


      START 1 cut long-range or strategic nuclear arsenals by 30-40 percent. New START
      slashed accountable deployed strategic arms by another three-quarters. In 2021,
      Presidents Biden and Putin extended New START until February 2026.


      Of course, these unidentified enablers understood the gravity of striking the
      strategic nuclear force of a major rival nuclear weapons power.


      How would the U.S. respond if an adversary (perhaps a non-state actor) launched
      a strike against strategic long-range nuclear capable bombers in the USA using
      cheap and easily available drones hidden in containers? We are in a new era of
      risk – one in which pagers and cell phones can be weaponised as bombs – and of
      ‘sleeper’ drones that can be remotely activated to attack airfields, either civilian
      or military.


      Larry Johnson has observed that after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in
      December 1941, intended to destroy the U.S. aircraft carriers berthed there, the
      Japanese Admiral Yamamoto reportedly said the following in the aftermath of Japan’s
      great victory at Pearl Harbour: “I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping
      giant and fill him with a terrible resolve … We have won a great tactical victory
      at Pearl Harbour and thereby lost the war”.


      The silence of the bears will soon be ended and we will know more about Russian
      resolve; but a relationship in which Trump is understood to ‘mean what he says,
      and does what he says’ likely is over. The Russians are furious.


      What happens next is unknown.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the recent Ukrainian attacks on Russia,
      suggesting they were primarily PR stunts lacking a coherent strategy, while also
      highlighting the implications for U.S. foreign policy control under Trump, who
      may now be perceived as unable to manage relations with Russia amidst escalating
      tensions.
    paragraph_summary: In the wake of recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian infrastructure,
      including attempts to target strategic nuclear bombers and the assassination of
      a Russian general, Russia's leadership is deliberating its response while former
      President Trump remains unusually silent. The article suggests that these Ukrainian
      operations serve primarily as public relations stunts to demonstrate ongoing capabilities
      and secure Western support, rather than as part of a coherent military strategy.
      It also highlights concerns that the U.S. "Deep State" is acting independently
      of elected leadership, potentially provoking Russia into a confrontation. The
      author draws parallels to historical miscalculations, noting that the current
      situation reflects a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy dynamics, with Trump’s
      advisors possibly undermining his agenda of normalizing relations with Russia.
      The implications of these developments could lead to a deterioration of trust
      between the U.S. and Russia, with uncertain future consequences as Russia's response
      remains pending.

      “I believe we must start from the notion of defeat leading to revolution – to
      grasp the Trump revolution”.


      “The experience underway in the United States, even if we don’t know exactly what
      it will be, is revolution. Is it a revolution in the strict sense? Is it a counter-revolution?”


      So spoke the French historian and philosopher Emmanuel Todd in his April Moscow
      lecture, From Russia With Love.


      “This [Trump revolution] is, in my opinion, linked to defeat. Various people have
      reported to me conversations between members of the Trump team, and what is striking
      is their awareness of defeat. People like J.D. Vance, the Vice President, and
      many others, are people who understood that America had lost this war”.


      This American awareness of defeat, however, contrasts markedly with the Europeans’
      surprising lack of awareness – rather it is denial – at their defeat:


      “For the United States, it is fundamentally an economic defeat. The sanctions
      policy showed that the financial power of the West was not omnipotent. The Americans
      were reminded of the fragility of their military industry. The people at the Pentagon
      know very well that one of the limits to their action is the limited capacity
      of the American military-industrial complex”.


      “That America is in the midst of a serious revolution, right now – easily comparable
      to the end of the USSR – is understood by a few”. Yet our preconceptions – political
      and intellectual – often prevent us from seeing and assimilating the import of
      this reality”.


      Todd, to his credit, admits the difficulty with perception readily:


      “I must admit that when the Soviet system actually collapsed, I was unable to
      foresee the extent of the dislocation and the level of suffering this dislocation
      would cause for Russia. My experience taught me one important thing: The collapse
      of a system is as much mental as economic ... I didn’t understand that communism
      was not only an economic organization but also a belief system, a quasi-religion,
      that structured Soviet and Russian social life. The dislocation of belief would
      lead to psychological disorganization far beyond economic disorganization. We
      are reaching a situation of this type in the West today”.


      The psychological dislocation caused by ‘defeat’ may explain (but not justify)
      the West’s ‘curious’ inability to understand world events: The almost pathological
      dissociation from the real world that it displays in its words and actions: It’s
      blindness – for example, to the Russian experience of history and to the long
      history behind Shi’a defiance in Iran. Yet, even as the political situation deteriorates
      … there is no sign of the West becoming more reality-based in its understanding
      – and it is very likely that it will continue to live in its alternative construction
      of reality – until it is forcibly expelled.


      Yanis Varoufakis has pointed out that the reality of the prospect of U.S. economic
      ‘defeat’ was clearly spelled out by Paul Volcker, former chair of the Federal
      Reserve, when he said that what holds the entire globalist system together had
      been the massive flow of capital from abroad – running to more than $2 billion
      every working day – that sustained America’s comfortable, low inflationary lifestyle.


      Today, with the U.S. in an era of unsustainable structural budget deficits, Trump
      is laser-focused on America’s financial core: The Treasury bond market (America’s
      lifeline) and the stock market (America’s wallet). Both are fragile. And any external
      pressure could trigger a chain reaction:


      “In short, America is no longer confident in its own financial fortress. And China
      is no longer playing by the old rules. This isn’t just a trade war — it’s a war
      for the future of global finance”, Varoufakis states. Which is why Trump threatens
      war on anyone seeking to supplant or bypass the U.S. dollar trading monopoly.


      Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” therefore were never about balancing trade. What
      they amount to is an attempt to restructure creditors. “It’s what you do in bankruptcy”,
      as one commentator wryly notes. The demands for greater contributions from NATO
      states is precisely an exercise in demanding creditor revenue – as was Trump’s
      Gulf trip).


      The purpose of the New Cold War primordially consists in choking off China’s rise.
      This aim effectively represents common ground amongst all factions of the Establishment
      – protecting the dollar system from collapse.


      The notion of the U.S. recovering its former position as a world-class manufacturing
      centre is largely a diversional narrative crafted for domestic purposes. In 1950,
      the U.S. manufacturing labour force made up 33.7 percent of the domestic economy
      – a figure that has dwindled to less than 8.4 percent today. To revert would take
      a generational shift.


      So, aside from the China consensus, the Ruling Strata is split – with the likes
      of JD Vance, and the economic team of Stephen Miran and Russel Vought, concerned
      more by the risk of U.S. overreach undermining the dollar primacy, whilst the
      hawks advocate reinforcing the dollar hegemony, with clear demonstrative ‘shows’
      of U.S. military muscle.


      The re-structuring of creditors underpins too Trump’s hurry to do a ‘deal’ with
      Russia – one that could bring quick business opportunities and positive capital
      flows (and collateral) onto the U.S.’ capital account. A deal with Iran potentially
      could even yield Trump’s apotheosis of U.S. energy dominance, resulting in new
      revenue inflows that would buttress confidence in the dollar.


      In short, Trump’s agenda is not long-term strategic. It is the short-term corralling
      of aggregate demand for the dollar as the only currency which people demand, albeit
      even though they do not want to buy anything from the country creating the dollars.


      The crucial flaw is that Trump’s crude transactionalism is shredding his credibility
      as a serious geo-political actor and consequently compelling others to hedge against
      the dollar.


      In short, the collapse in credibility caused by Trump’s disdain for reading; for
      intel briefings; and his reliance on the he or she who last whispered in his ear,
      lends to policy flip-flops, and a general desire for others to disengage as far
      as possible from the unpredictable Trumpland.


      Emmanuel Todd warns that the classic response to a collapse in the belief system
      and the particular psyche that has animated the economic paradigm “is anxiety
      – rather than any state of freedom and well-being. The beliefs that accompanied
      Western triumphalism are collapsing. But as in any revolutionary process, we do
      not yet know which new belief is the most important, which belief will emerge
      victorious from the process of decomposition”.


      Revolutions though they generally destroy, their focus is to harness the energies
      sufficient to eradicate the institutions that were too rigid to integrate into
      the demand for change that provoked the revolution in the first place.


      In this context, the pursuit of a New Cold War against China precisely is centred
      around U.S. anxiety (as Todd maintains) – primarily the fear that China’s building
      of a digital ‘super highway’ for money will prove to be much more advanced than
      the rickety road that is the American dollar road.


      Today that super-wide highway may not be so widely used. That’s now. But already
      there is a migration from the old road to the Chinese Super highway, as Varoufakis
      underlines to the Chinese.


      For the American Establishment, the Chinese ‘super-highway’ constitutes a ‘clear
      and present’ danger to its hegemony. The anxiety is not really about Chinese intellectual
      property or ‘IP theft’. It is the fear that the U.S. cannot keep up with the new
      financial ecosystems being constructed by China, or the sophistication of the
      digital yuan.


      This anxiety is aggravated – not least – because the Fintech overlords of Silicon
      Valley are at daggers drawn with the big Wall Street clearing banks (who want
      to preserve their antiquated systems). China has the advantage here, as its financial
      and tech sectors are fused, as one.


      The fear is plain: Should China succeed, the U.S. would lose its ‘magic weapon’
      of monetary dominance:


      “And here is the ‘revolution’: No fireworks, no Western headlines. Just one quiet
      early morning in Beijing where the dollar’s crown slipped. The world’s financial
      plumbing just got a reroute—through the China [super highway]”


      “For the first time ever, China’s CIPS (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System)
      surpassed SWIFT in single-day transaction volume. A red banner flashed across
      Bank of China’s HQ at 1:30AM on April 16, 2025”.


      “CIPS [as Zerohedge tells it] processed a jaw-dropping ¥12.8 trillion RMB in just
      one day—roughly $1.76 trillion USD. That volume, if verified, overtakes the greenback-dominated
      SWIFT system in sheer daily cross-border throughput”.


      Yes – It’s all about money.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the notion of a "Trump revolution" in
      the U.S. as a response to perceived economic defeat, highlighting a disconnect
      between American and European awareness of this decline, while emphasizing the
      anxiety within the U.S. establishment regarding the rise of China's financial
      systems and the potential erosion of dollar dominance.
    paragraph_summary: In his lecture, historian Emmanuel Todd discusses the transformative
      political landscape in the United States, framing it as a revolution linked to
      a sense of defeat, particularly in economic terms, as evidenced by the fragility
      of the U.S. military-industrial complex and the financial system. He contrasts
      this American awareness of defeat with the European denial of their own failures.
      Todd argues that the psychological dislocation resulting from this defeat contributes
      to the West's inability to grasp global realities, particularly regarding Russia
      and Iran. He highlights Trump's focus on the financial core of the U.S., emphasizing
      the precariousness of the Treasury bond market and the dollar's dominance amidst
      rising competition from China. The article suggests that Trump's short-term, transactional
      approach may undermine U.S. credibility and provoke a shift away from dollar reliance,
      particularly as China's financial systems gain traction. Ultimately, Todd posits
      that the U.S. is in a state of revolutionary change, driven by anxiety over its
      declining hegemony and the emergence of alternative financial ecosystems led by
      China.

      Presentation at the XXIII International Likhachev Scientific Readings, St Petersburg
      University of Humanities and Social Sciences, 22-23 May 2025 – Transforming the
      World: Problems and Prospects’, XXIII International Likhachev Scientific Readings,
      St Petersburg


      Last year in St Petersburg, I asked the question: Will the West come out of its
      cultural war as a more amenable potential partner? Or will the West disaggregate,
      and resort to bellicosity in an effort to hold things together?


      Well, that was then. The ‘counter-revolution’ is now underway in the form of the
      Trump ‘Storm’. And the West already has come apart: Project Trump is turning America
      upside down – and in Europe, there is crisis, desperation and a fury to overturn
      Trump and ‘all his works’.


      Is this then ‘it’? The anticipated revolt against ‘Progressive’ cultural imposition?


      No. This is not the extent of the creeping, thunderous changes underway in the
      U.S. Those are provoking far more complicated political shifts. It will not be
      some courteous red versus blue affair. For there is yet another ‘shoe’ to drop
      – beyond the MAGA revolution.


      The real action in the U.S. is not happening in seminars at Brookings or in op-eds
      in the New York Times. It is happening backstage, out of sight; beyond the reach
      of polite society, and mostly off-script. America is undergoing a transformation
      more akin to what befell Rome in the age of Augustus.


      Which is to say, the main happening is the collapse of a paralytic élite order
      and the consequent unfolding of new political projects.


      The collapse of global liberalism’s intellectual paradigm – its delusions together
      with its associated technocratic structure of governance – transcends the red/blue
      schism in the West. The sheer dysfunctionality associated with western culture
      wars has underlined that the entire approach to economic governance must change.


      For thirty years Wall Street sold a fantasy – and that illusion just shattered.
      The 2025 trade war has exposed the truth: Most major U.S. companies were duct-taped
      together by fragile supply chains, cheap energy, and foreign labour. And now?
      It’s all breaking.


      Frankly put, liberal élites simply have demonstrated that they are not competent
      or professional in matters of governance. And they do not understand the gravity
      of the situation they face – which is that the financial architecture that used
      to produce easy solutions and effortless prosperity is well-past its ‘sell-by’
      date.


      The essayist and military strategist Aurelien has written in a paper entitled,
      The Strange Defeat (original in French), where ‘defeat’ consists in Europe’s ‘curious’
      inability to understand world events:


      “… i.e. the almost pathological dissociation from the real world that [Europe]
      displays in its words and actions. Yet, even as the situation deteriorates … there
      is no sign of the West becoming more reality-based in its understanding– and it
      is very likely that it will continue to live in its alternative construction of
      reality– until it is forcibly expelled”.


      Yes, some understand that the western economic paradigm of debt-led, hyper-financialised
      consumerism has run its course and that change is inevitable; but so heavily invested
      are they in the Anglo economic model that they stay paralysed in the spider’s
      web. There is no alternative (TINA) is the watch phrase.


      Thus, the West is continually out-pointed and disappointed when dealing with states
      who at least make an effort to look to the future in an organised fashion.


      The West is in crisis, but not in the way Progressives or the bureaucratic Technocrats
      think. Its problem is not populism or polarisation or whatever is the chosen ‘current
      thing’ of the week on the MSM talk shows. The deeper affliction is structural:
      Power is so diffused and fractured that no meaningful reform is possible. Every
      actor has veto power, and no actor can impose coherence. The political scientist
      Francis Fukuyama gave us the term for this: “vetocracy” – a condition where everyone
      can block, but no one can build.


      American commentator Matt Taibbi observes:


      “Pulling back, in a broader sense, we do have a crisis of competency in this country.
      It has had a huge impact on American politics”.


      In one sense, the lack of connection to reality – to competency – is ingrained
      in today’s global neo-liberalism. In part it may be attributed to Friedrich von
      Hayek’s Road to Serfdom’s acclaimed message that government interference and economic
      planning leads inevitably to serfdom. His message is regularly aired, whenever
      the need for change is mooted.


      The second plank (whilst Hayek was fighting the ghosts of what he called ‘socialism’)
      was that of Americans sealing a ‘union’ with the Chicago School of Monetarism
      – the child of which was to be Milton Friedman who would pen the ‘American edition’
      of The Road to Serfdom, which (ironically) came to be called Capitalism and Freedom.


      Economist Philip Pilkington writes that Hayek’s delusion that markets equal ‘freedom’
      has become widespread to the point of all discourse being completely saturated.
      In polite company, and in public, you can certainly be left-wing or right-wing,
      but you will always be, in some shape or form, neoliberal – otherwise you will
      simply not be allowed entry to discourse.


      “Each country may have its own peculiarities, but on broad principles they follow
      a similar pattern: debt-led neoliberalism is first and foremost a theory of how
      to reengineer the state in order to guarantee the success of the market– and that
      of its most important participants: modern corporations”.


      Yet the whole (neo)-liberal paradigm rests on this notion of utility-maximisation
      as its central pillar (as if human motivations are reductively defined in purely
      material terms). It postulates that motivation is utilitarian – and only utilitarian
      – as its foundational delusion. As philosophers of science like Hans Albert have
      pointed out, the theory of utility-maximisation rules out real world mapping,
      a priori, thus rendering the theory untestable.


      Its delusion lies in making man and community well-being subservient to markets
      and presumes that excess ‘consumption’ is sufficient recompensation for the inherent
      vassalage. This was taken to an extreme with Tony Blair who said that there was,
      in his day, no such thing as politics. As Prime Minister, he presided over a cabinet
      of technical experts, oligarchs and bankers, whose competence allowed them to
      steer the state accurately. Politics was over; leave it to the technocrats.


      “The British Conservative government elected in 1979 thus decided– rather than
      to imitate Britain’s successful competitors to do the opposite of what they did–
      and essentially to rely on magic. “Thus, all the government had to do was to create
      the right magical environment (low taxes, few regulations) and that the “animal
      spirits” of entrepreneurs would spontaneously do the rest, through the “magic”
      (interesting choice of words, that) of the “market.” The magician, however, having
      summoned up these powers, should make sure to stay well away from its workings”,
      as Aurelien has written.


      The ideas were taken from the American Left, but cosmopolitanism spread them across
      Europe.


      “The Anglo-Saxon (now more broadly western) fixation with archetypal heroic entrepreneurs
      and university dropouts has obscured the historical fact that no significant industry,
      and no key technology, has ever been developed without some level of planning
      and government encouragement”.


      Clearly such globalist liberal systems of ideas are ideological (if not magical),
      rather than scientific. And one ideology, when no longer effective, will in future
      be replaced by another.


      The lesson here – when a state becomes incompetent, someone eventually arises
      to govern it. Not by consensus, but by coercion. One historical cure for such
      political sclerosis is not dialogue or compromise; it is what the Romans called
      proscription – a formalized purge. Sulla knew this. Caesar perfected it. Augustus
      institutionalized it. Take the élite interests, deny them resources, strip them
      of property, and compel obedience … or else!


      As U.S. political and cultural critic Walter Kirn has predicted:


      “So, looking forward, it’s what are people going to want? What are people going
      to value? What are they going to prize? Are their priorities going to shift? I
      think they will shift big time …”. “[Americans] They’re going to want less concern
      for the philosophical and/or even long-term political questions of equity and
      so on, I predict; and they’re going to want to lay in a minimum expectation of
      competence. In other words, this is a time when the priorities shift and I think
      that big change is coming: big, big change, because we look like we’ve been dealing
      with luxury problems, and we’ve certainly been dealing with other countries’ problems,
      Ukraine or whoever it might be, with massive funding”.


      What does Brussels make of all this? Absolutely nothing. The EU technocracy is
      still entranced by the America of the Obama years – a land of soft power, identity
      politics, and cosmopolitan neoliberal capitalism. They hope (and expect) that
      Trump’s influence will be expunged at next year’s Mid-Term Congressional elections.
      The Brussels ruling strata still mistake the cultural power of the American left
      as being synonymous with political power.


      American conservatism then, it seems, is being rebuilt as something rougher, meaner,
      and far less sentimental. It aspires to emerge too, as also something more centralized,
      coercive, and radical. With many families in the U.S. and Europe skirting bankruptcy
      and possible dispossession as the real economy implodes, this segment of the population
      – now including an increasing proportion of the Middle Classes – despises both
      the oligarchs and the Establishment and is moving ever closer to a possibly violent
      response. Then the culture war will move from the public arena to the street ‘battleground’.


      Today’s U.S. Administration is, above all, attached to the ancient notion of greatness
      – to individual greatness and the contributions that greatness makes to all of
      civilization.


      The individual transgressive, for example, plays a significant role in Ayn Rand’s
      theories of the industrialist and the genius (in her novels, there is always a
      strong element of the outsider being this kind of criminal transgressor who bring
      a new measure of energy, which insiders cannot provide), political scientist Corey
      Robin writes.


      There is, in short, a not-so-secret affinity between today’s populist conservatism
      and radicalism. However, as Emily Wilson in her book, The Iliad, sets out, loss
      of ‘greatness seldom’ is easily recouped.


      One cannot escape The Iliad’s analogy for today – in which Trump seeks to recover
      his country’s ‘greatness’ (and in the process achieve undying personal kleos(reputation).
      Today, we might refer to it as one’s ‘legacy’. In The Iliad, it is definitional
      and gives mortal leaders the metaphorical ability to surpass death through honour
      and glory.


      However, it does not always end well: Hector, the protagonist, also seeking kleos,
      is tricked into combat and killed beneath Troy’s city walls. Trump might well
      heed the moral to The Iliad story.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the profound political and cultural
      upheaval in the West, particularly in the U.S., driven by the collapse of the
      liberal elite order and the emergence of a more radical and coercive form of conservatism,
      as traditional governance structures fail to address the realities of economic
      dysfunction and societal discontent.
    paragraph_summary: In his presentation at the XXIII International Likhachev Scientific
      Readings, Alastair Crooke discusses the ongoing transformation of the West, particularly
      the United States, amidst the upheaval caused by the Trump administration and
      the broader cultural wars. He argues that the West is experiencing a profound
      disintegration of its liberal elite order, leading to a crisis of governance characterized
      by a "vetocracy" where no meaningful reform is possible due to fractured power
      dynamics. Crooke critiques the prevailing neoliberal paradigm, which has failed
      to produce sustainable solutions and has left the West disconnected from reality.
      He suggests that as the political landscape shifts, there is a potential for a
      more coercive form of governance to emerge, reminiscent of historical precedents
      from Rome, as societal frustrations mount. The implications of this transformation
      may lead to significant changes in American conservatism, which is evolving into
      a more radical and centralized movement, potentially escalating conflicts beyond
      the political arena into societal unrest. Crooke concludes with a cautionary note
      about the pursuit of greatness, drawing parallels to themes in "The Iliad," suggesting
      that the quest for legacy and honor can lead to perilous outcomes.

  - title: ‘Transition’ To A New World Order Is Beyond Most In The West – OpEd

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      Even the need for transition – just to be clear – has only just begun to be recognised
      in the U.S.


      For the European leadership however, and for the beneficiaries of financialisation
      who haughtily lament Trump’s ‘storm’ unwisely unleashed on the world, his base
      economic theses are ridiculed as bizarre notions completely divorced from economic
      ‘reality’.


      That is completely untrue.


      For, as Greek Economist Yanis Varoufakis points out, the reality of the western
      situation and the need for transition was clearly spelled out by Paul Volcker,
      former chair of the Federal Reserve, as long ago as 2005.


      The harsh ‘fact’ of the liberal globalist economic paradigm was evident even then:


      “What holds together the globalist system is a massive and growing flow of capital
      from abroad, running to more than $2 billion every working day – and growing.
      There is no sense of strain. As a nation we don’t consciously borrow or beg. We
      aren’t even offering attractive interest rates, nor do we have to offer our creditors
      protection against the risk of a declining dollar”.


      “It’s all quite comfortable for us. We fill our shops and garages with goods from
      abroad, and the competition has been a powerful restraint on our internal prices.
      It’s surely helped keep interest rates exceptionally low despite our vanishing
      savings and rapid growth”.


      “And it’s [been] comfortable for our trading partners too, and for those supplying
      the capital. Some, such as China [and Europe, particularly Germany], have depended
      heavily on our expanding domestic markets. And for the most part, the central
      banks of the emerging world have been willing to hold more and more dollars, which
      are, after all, the closest thing that world has to a truly international currency”.


      “ The difficulty is that this seemingly comfortable pattern can’t go on indefinitely
      ”.


      Precisely. And Trump is in the process of blowing up the world trading system
      so as to re-set it. Those western liberals, who today are gnashing teeth and lamenting
      the advent of ‘Trumpian economics’, are simply in denial that Trump has at least
      recognised the most important American reality – ie. that the pattern can’t go
      on indefinitely, and that debt-led consumerism is way past its sell-by date.


      Recall that most participants in the western financial system have known nothing
      other than Volcker’s ‘comfortable world’ their entire life. No wonder they have
      difficulty thinking outside their sealed retort.


      That does not mean, of course, that Trump’s solution to the problem will work.
      Possibly, Trump’s particular form of structural rebalancing could make matters
      actually worse.


      Nonetheless, restructuring in some form clearly is inevitable. It comes down otherwise
      to a choice between bankruptcy slow, or fast and disorderly.


      The dollar-led globalist system worked well initially – at least from the U.S.
      perspective. The U.S. exported its post-WW2 manufacturing over-capacity to a newly
      dollarized Europe, who consumed the surplus. And Europe too, enjoyed the benefit
      of having its macroeconomic environment (export-led models, guaranteed by the
      U.S. market).


      The present crisis began however, when the paradigm inverted – when the U.S. entered
      on its era of unsustainable structural budget deficits, and when financialisation
      led Wall Street to build its inverted pyramid of derivative ‘assets’, resting
      upon a tiny pivot of real assets.


      The raw fact of the structural imbalance crisis is bad enough. But the western
      geo-strategic crisis goes much deeper than just the structural contradiction of
      inward capital flows and a ‘strong’ dollar eating the heart out of the U.S. manufacturing
      sector. Because it is bound up, too, with the concomitant collapse of core ideologies
      underpinning liberal globalism.


      It is because of this western deep devotion to ideology (as well as to the Volker
      ‘comfort’ provided by the system) that has triggered such a torrent of anger and
      outright derision towards Trump’s ‘rebalancing’ plans. Barely a western economist
      has a good word to say – and yet no plausible alternative framework is offered.
      Their passion directed at Trump simply underlines that western economic theory
      is bankrupt, too.


      Which is to say that the deeper geo-strategic crisis in the West consists in both
      a collapse of archetypal ideology AND of a paralytic élite order.


      For thirty years, Wall Street sold a fantasy (debt didn’t matter) … and that illusion
      just shattered.


      Yes, some understand that the western economic paradigm of debt-led, hyper-financialised
      consumerism has run its course and that change is inevitable. But so heavily invested
      is the West in the ‘Anglo’ economic model that, for the most part, the economists
      stay paralysed in the spider’s web. There is no Alternative (TINA) is the watch
      phrase.


      The ideological spine to the U.S. economic model lies firstly with Friedrich von
      Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom, which was understood to mean that any government
      involvement in the management of the economy was an infringement of ‘liberty’
      – and tantamount to socialism. And then secondly, following the Hayekian union
      with the Chicago School of Monetarism in the person of Milton Friedman who would
      pen the ‘American edition’ of The Road to Serfdom (which (ironically) came to
      be called Capitalism and Freedom), the archetype was set.


      Economist Philip Pilkington writes that Hayek’s delusion that markets equal ‘freedom’
      and were therefore consonant with the deeply embedded American Libertarian current
      “has become widespread to the point of all discourse being completely saturated”:


      “In polite company, and in public, you can certainly be left-wing or right-wing,
      but you will always be, in some shape or form, neoliberal; otherwise you will
      simply be not allowed entry to discourse”. “Each country may have its own peculiarities
      … but on broad principles they follow a similar pattern: debt-led neoliberalism
      is, first and foremost, a theory of how to re-engineer the state in order to guarantee
      the success of markets – and its most important participant: modern corporations
      ”.


      So here is the fundamental point: The crisis of liberal globalism is not just
      a matter of re-balancing a failing structure. Imbalance anyway is inevitable where
      all economies similarly pursue, all together, all at once, the export-led ‘open’
      Anglo-model.


      No, the bigger problem is that the archetypal myth of individuals (and oligarchs)
      pursuing their own separate and individual utility maximisation – thanks to the
      hidden hand of market magic – is such that in aggregate, their combined efforts
      will be to the benefit of the community as a whole (Adam Smith) has collapsed
      too.


      Effectively, the ideology to which the West clings so tenaciously – that human
      motivation is utilitarian (and only utilitarian) is a delusion. As philosophers
      of science like Hans Albert have pointed out, the theory of utility-maximisation
      rules out real world mapping, a priori, thus rendering the theory untestable.


      Paradoxically, Trump nonetheless, is of course the chief of all utilitarian maximisers!
      Is he then the prophet of a return to the era of swash-buckling American tycoons
      of the nineteenth century, or is he the adherent of a more fundamental re-think?


      Put plainly, the West cannot transition to an alternate economic structure (such
      as a ‘closed’, internal-circulation model) precisely because it is so heavily
      invested ideologically in the philosophical underpinnings to the present one –
      that to question those roots seems tantamount to a betrayal of European values
      and of the foundational libertarian values of America (drawn from the French Revolution).


      The reality is that today the western vision of its claimed Athenian ‘values’
      is as discredited as its economic theory in the rest of the world, as well as
      amongst a significant slice of its angry and disaffected own populations!


      So the bottom line is this: Do not look to the European élites for any coherent
      view on the emergent World Order. They are in collapse and are pre-occupied by
      trying to save themselves amidst the crumbling of the western sphere and the fear
      of retribution from their electorates.


      This new era does however also mark the end to ‘old politics’: The Red vs Blue;
      Right vs Left labels lose relevance. New political identities and groupings are
      already being formed, even if their contours are not yet defined.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the Western economic model, rooted
      in debt-led consumerism and liberal globalism, is facing an inevitable crisis
      that has been long recognized by economists, including Paul Volcker, and that
      while Trump's approach to rebalancing the economy may be flawed, it highlights
      the urgent need for a fundamental transition away from outdated ideological frameworks
      that are no longer viable.
    paragraph_summary: In his article, Alastair Crooke discusses the recognition of
      the need for economic transition in the U.S., contrasting it with European leaders
      who dismiss Trump's economic approach as misguided. He references former Federal
      Reserve Chair Paul Volcker's warnings from 2005 about the unsustainable nature
      of the liberal globalist economic paradigm, which relies heavily on foreign capital
      and has led to structural imbalances in the U.S. economy. Crooke argues that while
      Trump's methods may not be effective, a restructuring of the economy is inevitable,
      as the current debt-driven consumerism is reaching its limits. He critiques the
      ideological rigidity of Western economists, who are unable to envision alternatives
      to the prevailing neoliberal model, and suggests that the crisis of liberal globalism
      extends beyond mere economic imbalance to a collapse of the underlying ideologies
      that have long supported it. As the old political dichotomies lose relevance,
      Crooke posits that new political identities are emerging in response to the disintegration
      of the established order.

  - title: Why Doesn’t The ‘Deal-Maker’ Close The Deal? – OpEd
    url: https://www.eurasiareview.com/05052025-why-doesnt-the-deal-maker-close-the-deal-oped/
    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      The story, both on Ukraine and Iran, is that President Trump wants a ‘deal’ –
      and both deals are available – yet he seems nonetheless to have boxed himself
      in. Trump presents his Administration as being something rougher, meaner, and
      far less sentimental. It aspires to emerge, apparently, as also something more
      centralized, coercive, and radical.


      In domestic policy, there may be some truth to this categorisation of the Trumpian
      ethos. In foreign policy, however, Trump tergiversates. The reason is not clear,
      but the fact of it clouds his prospects in the three areas vital to his ‘peace-maker’
      aspiration – Ukraine, Iran and Gaza.


      Whilst it is true that Trump’s true mandate derived from rampant economic and
      social discontent, rather than from his claims to be a peacemaker – yet the two
      key foreign policy ends remain important to maintaining momentum forward.


      One possible answer is that in foreign negotiations, the President needs a grounded
      and experienced team to support him. And he does not have that.


      In advance of sending his Envoy Witkoff to talk to President Putin, General Kellogg,
      it seems, presented Trump with a Versailles-type Armistice proposal: A vision
      of Russia on the ropes (i.e. the plan was cast in terms more appropriate to Russian
      capitulation). Kellogg’s proposal implied also that Trump would be doing Putin
      a ‘big favour’ – by condescending to offer him a ladder down which to climb from
      his perch up the Ukraine ‘tree’. And this was exactly the line Trump took in January:


      Having stated that Russia had lost one million men (in the war), Trump then went
      on to say that “Putin is destroying Russia by not making a deal”. He further claimed
      that Russia’s economy was in ‘ruins’, and most notably, said that he would consider
      sanctioning or tariffing Russia. In a subsequent Truth Social post, he wrote,
      “I’m going to do Russia – whose Economy is failing – and President Putin, a very
      big FAVOR”.


      The President – duly briefed by his team – may have imagined that he would offer
      Putin a unilateral ceasefire and, hey presto, would have a quick deal to his credit.


      All the premises on which the Kellogg plan was based (Russia’s vulnerability to
      sanctions, huge losses of men, and a stalemated war) were false. Did no one on
      Trump’s team then do any due diligence on the Kellogg strategy? It seems (lazily)
      to have taken the Korean war as its template, without due consideration of whether
      it be appropriate, or not.


      In the Korean instance, the ceasefire along a Conflict Line preceded political
      considerations, which came only later. And which remain ongoing – and unresolved
      – until today.


      By launching premature demands for an immediate ceasefire during talks with Russian
      officials in Riyadh, Trump invited rejection. Firstly, because the Trump Team
      had no concrete plan for how to implement a ceasefire, simply presuming rather
      that all such details could be settled post-hoc. In short, it was presented to
      Trump as a ‘quick win’.


      Only it wasn’t.


      The outcome was fore-ordained – the ceasefire was declined. It should not have
      been allowed to happen, given competent staff work. Had none of Trump’s team been
      listening since 14 June of last year when Putin very clearly outlined MFA the
      Russian position on a ceasefire? And which has been repeated regularly ever since.
      Apparently not.


      Yet even so, when Trump’s Envoy, Witkoff, returned from a long meeting with President
      Putin to report on the latter’s personal, detailed explanation of why a political
      framework must precede any ceasefire (unlike Korea), Witkoff’s account reportedly
      was met with the flat retort that ‘the Ukrainians would never agree’ from General
      Kellogg.


      End of discussion, apparently. No decision taken.


      Several more flights to Moscow have not altered the basic situation. Moscow awaits
      evidence that Trump is able to consolidate his position and can take charge of
      the situation. But until then, Moscow stands ready to facilitate a ‘rapprochement
      of positionality’ – but will not approve a unilateral ceasefire. (And nor will
      Zelensky).


      The puzzle here is why Trump doesn’t cut off U.S. weapons and intelligence flows
      to Kiev, and tell the Europeans to butt out of Trump’s way? Does Kiev have some
      form of veto power? Does Team Trump not understand that the Europeans simply hope
      to disrupt Trump’s aim to normalise relations with Russia? They must do.


      It seems that the “debate” (if you can call it that) in the Trump Team largely
      excluded real life factors. It took place at some high normative level, where
      certain facts and truths are simply assumed.


      Maybe the Sunk Costs phenomenon weighed heavily – the longer you continue with
      a course of action (no matter how stupid), the less willing you are to change
      it. Changing it would be interpreted as acknowledging error – and acknowledging
      error is the first stage to losing power.


      And there is a parallel with the talks with Iran.


      Trump has a vision for a negotiated settlement with Iran that would achieve his
      objective of ‘no Iranian nuclear weapon’ – though the aim itself, is something
      of a tautology given that the U.S. intelligence community already has determined
      that Iran has NO nuclear weapon.


      How do you stop something that is not occurring? Well, ‘intent’ is an enormously
      difficult concept to ring-fence. So, the Team heads back to basics: to the original
      Rand Organisation’s firm doctrine that there exists no qualitative difference
      between peaceful and weapon-linked enrichment of uranium. So, no enrichment should
      be permitted.


      Only Iran does have enrichment – thanks to the Obama concession as part of the
      JCPOA, which allowed it, subject to limitations.


      Many ideas are floating around about how to square this circle – of Iran’s refusal
      to relinquish enrichment versus Trump’s ‘no capacity’ to weaponise dictum. None
      of the ideas is new: Importing into Iran enriched feedstock; exporting Iran’s
      highly enriched uranium to Russia (something already done as part of the JCPOA),
      and having Russia build Iran’s nuclear energy capacity to power its industry.
      The problem is that Russia is already doing that too. It has one plant already
      up, and another in construction.


      Israel naturally has its own proposals too: Root out all Iranian enrichment infrastructure
      and missile delivery capacity.


      Only Iran will never agree to this.


      So, the choice is either a jacked-up inspection and technical surveillance system
      in a JCPOA-like accord (which will not make either Israel or the pro-Israel Institutional
      leadership happy). Or military action.


      Which takes us back to the Trump Team and the internecine divisions within the
      Pentagon.


      Pete Hegseth sent the following message to Iran, posted on his social media account:


      “We see your LETHAL support to The Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing.
      You know very well what the U.S. Military is capable of – and you were warned.
      You will pay the CONSEQUENCE at the time and place of our choosing”.


      Plainly, Hegseth is frustrated. As Larry Johnson has noted:


      “The Trump team has been labouring under [another] false assumption that the Biden
      folks did not make a serious effort to destroy the Houthis’ arsenal of missiles
      and drones. The Trumpers believed that they could bomb the Houthis into submission.
      Instead, the U.S. is demonstrating to all countries in the region the limits of
      its naval and air power … Despite more than 600 bombing sorties, the Houthis continue
      to launch missiles and drones at U.S. ships in the Red Sea and targets inside
      Israel”.


      So, Team Trump has waded firstly into one conflict (Yemen), and secondly, into
      a complex negotiation with Iran, again seemingly without doing its homework on
      Yemen. Is this down to group think again:


      “In a situation of uncertainty like the present, solidarity comes to be seen as
      an end in itself, and nobody wants to be accused of ‘weakening the West’ or ‘strengthening
      Iran’. If you have to be wrong, best be wrong in the company of as many others
      as possible”.


      Will Israel let this pass? It is beavering away with General Kurilla (the U.S.
      General in command at CENTCOM) in the bunker under the Israeli Defence Department
      – preparing plans for a joint attack on Iran. Israel appears very keen on his
      work.


      Yet, the fundamental impediment to achieving an accord with Iran is more crucial
      – in that, as presently construed, the U.S. approach to the negotiations breaks
      all the rules about how to initiate a weapons-limitation treaty.


      On the one hand, there is Israel with a triad of nuclear weapons systems and delivery
      capacities: from submarines, aircraft and by missile. Israel has also threatened
      the use of nuclear weapons – recently in Gaza and earlier during the first Iraq
      war, in response to Saddam Hussein’s Scud missile capacity.


      The missing principle here is any modicum of reciprocity. Iran is said to threaten
      Israel – and Israel regularly threatens Iran. And Israel, of course, wants Iran
      neutered and disarmed and insists itself be untouched (no NPT, no IAEA inspections,
      no acknowledgment).


      The arms-limitation treaties initiated by JF Kennedy with Khruschev derived from
      the successful reciprocal negotiation by which the U.S. withdrew its missiles
      from Turkey before Russia removed its own missiles from Cuba.


      It must be clear to Trump and Witkoff that such a lopsided proposal as theirs
      for Iran bears no relation to geo-political realities – and is therefore likely
      to fail (sooner or later). Team Trump thus, is cornering itself into military
      action against Iran – which they will then own.


      Trump does not want that; Iran does not want that. So, has this been adequately
      thought through? Has the Yemen experience been taken fully into account? Has the
      Trump Team mooted some off-ramp?


      One creative way out of the dilemma – and which might restore at least some semblance
      to a classical arms limitation treaty exercise – would be for Trump to air the
      notion that now is time for Israel to enter the NPT and to have its weapons inspected
      by the IAEA.

    paragraph_summary: In his analysis, Alastair Crooke argues that President Trump's
      foreign policy approach, particularly regarding Ukraine and Iran, reveals a disconnect
      between his administration's aggressive rhetoric and the practical realities of
      negotiation. Despite Trump's desire for deals in these conflicts, he appears to
      lack a competent and experienced team to support him, leading to misguided strategies,
      such as a flawed ceasefire proposal to Russia that was based on incorrect assumptions
      about its military situation. Similarly, in negotiations with Iran, Trump's team
      struggles with the complexities of nuclear enrichment and lacks a reciprocal approach
      that could facilitate a successful arms limitation treaty. Crooke suggests that
      Trump's administration is trapped in a cycle of unrealistic expectations and military
      posturing, which could ultimately lead to conflict rather than resolution, while
      also highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of geopolitical dynamics
      and the importance of reciprocity in negotiations.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      Political warfare in Washington is endemic. But the body count at the Pentagon
      has started to rise precipitously. Three of Secretary of Defence Hegseth’s top
      advisors were placed on leave, and then fired. The war continues, with the Secretary
      now in the firing line.


      Why this matters is that the Hegseth attrition comes amid fierce internal debates
      in the Trump administration about Iran policy. Hawks want an definitive elimination
      of all Iran’s nuclear and weapons capabilities, whilst many ‘restrainers’ warn
      against military escalation; Hegseth reportedly was amongst those warning against
      an intervention in Iran.


      The recent Pentagon dismissals have all been identified as restrainers. One of
      the latter, Dan Caldwell, formerly Hegseth’s Top Adviser and an army veteran,
      wrote a post slamming the ‘Iran Hawks’ – and subsequently was fired. He was later
      interviewed by Tucker Carlson. Notably, Caldwell describes in scathing terms America’s
      wars in Iraq and Syria (“criminal”). This adverse sentiment concerning America’s
      earlier wars is a rising theme, it seems, amongst U.S. Vets today.


      The three Pentagon staffers essentially were fired, not as ‘leakers’, but for
      talking Hegseth out of supporting war on Iran, it would appear; the Israeli-Firsters,
      have not given up on that war.


      The inflamed fault lines between hawks and traditionalist ‘Republicans’ bleed
      across into the Ukraine issue, even if the faction membership may alter a tad.
      Israeli-Firsters and U.S. hawks more generally, are behind both the war on Russia
      and the maximalist demands on Iran.


      Conservative commentator Fred Bauer observes that when it comes to Trump’s own
      war impulses, they are conflicted:


      “Influenced by the Vietnam War of his youth … Trump seems deeply averse to long-term
      military conflicts, yet, at the same time, Trump admires a politics of strength
      and swagger. That means taking out Iranian generals, launching airstrikes on the
      Houthis, and boosting the defence budget to $1 trillion”.


      Hegseth’s potential exit – should the campaign for his removal succeed – could
      cause the struggle to grow fiercer. Its first casualty is already apparent – Trump’s
      hope to bring a quick end to the Ukraine conflict is over.


      This week, the Trump team (including both warring factions, Rubio, Witkoff and
      General Kellogg) met in Paris with various European and Ukrainian representatives.
      At the meeting, a Russian-Ukrainian unilateral ceasefire proposal was mooted by
      the U.S. delegation.


      After the meeting, at the airport, Rubio plainly said that the ceasefire plan
      was ‘a take-it-or-leave-it’ U.S. initiative. The various sides – Russia, Kiev
      and the European members of the ‘coalition of the willing’ – had only days to
      accept it, or else the U.S. was ‘out’, and would wash its hands of the conflict.


      The framework presented, as reported, is almost (maybe 95%) unadulteratedly that
      previously proposed by General Kellogg: i.e. it is his plan, first aired in April
      2024. It appears that the ‘Kellogg formula’ was adopted then as the Trump platform
      (Trump was at the time in mid-campaign, and unlikely to have been following the
      complicated minutiae of the Ukraine war too closely).


      General Kellogg is also the likely source for Trump’s optimism that the ending
      to the Ukraine war could come with a click of Trump’s fingers – through the limited
      application of asymmetric pressures and threats on both belligerents by Trump
      – and with the timing decided in Washington.


      In short, the plan represented a Beltway consensus that the U.S. could implement
      a negotiated end-state with terms aligned to U.S. and Ukrainian interests.


      Kellogg’s implicit assumptions were that Russia is highly vulnerable to a sanctions
      threat (its economy perceived as being fragile); that it had suffered unsustainably
      high casualties; and that the war was at a stalemate.


      Thus, Kellogg persuaded Trump that Russia would readily agree to the ceasefire
      terms proposed – albeit terms that were constructed around patently flawed underlying
      assumptions about Russia and its presumed weaknesses.


      Kellogg’s influence and false premises were all too evident when Trump, in January,
      having stated that Russia had lost one million men (in the war) then went on to
      say that “Putin is destroying Russia by not making a deal, adding (seemingly as
      an aside), that Putin may have already made up his mind ‘not to make a deal’”.
      He further claimed that Russia’s economy is in ‘ruins’, and most notably said
      that he would consider sanctioning or tariffing Russia. In a subsequent Truth
      Social post, Trump writes, “I’m going to do Russia – whose Economy is failing
      – and President Putin, a very big FAVOR”.


      All of Kellogg’s underlying assumptions lacked any basis in reality. Yet Trump
      seemingly took them on trust. And despite Steve Witkoff’s subsequent three lengthy
      personal meetings with President Putin, in which Putin repeatedly stated that
      he would not acceptany ceasefire until a political framework had been first agreed,
      the Kellogg contingent continued to blandly assume that Russia would be forced
      to accept Kellogg’s détente because of the claimed serious ‘setbacks’ Russia had
      suffered in Ukraine.


      Given this history, unsurprisingly, the ceasefire framework terms outlined by
      Rubio this week in Paris reflected those more suited to a party at the point of
      capitulation, rather than that of a state anticipating achieving its objectives
      – by military means.


      In essence, the Kellogg Plan looked to bring a U.S. ‘win’ on terms aligned to
      a desire to keep open the option for continuing attritional war on Russia.


      So, what is the Kellogg Plan? At base, it seeks to establish a ‘frozen conflict’
      – frozen along the ‘Line of Conflict’; with no definitive ban on NATO membership
      for Ukraine, (but rather, envisaging a NATO membership that is deferred well into
      the future); it places no limits on the size of a future Ukrainian army and no
      restrictions on the type or quantity of armaments held by the Ukrainian forces.
      (It foresees, contrarily, that after the ceasefire, the U.S. might re-arm, train
      and militarily support a future force) – i.e. back to the post-Maidan era of 2014.


      In addition, no territory would be ceded by Ukraine to Russia, save for Crimea
      which alone would be recognised by the U.S. as Russian (the unique sop to Witkoff?),
      and Russia would only ‘exercise control’ over the four Oblasts that it currently
      claims, yet only up to the Line of Conflict; territory beyond this line would
      remain under Ukrainian control (see here for the ‘Kellogg map’). The Zaporozhye
      Nuclear Power Plant would be neutral territory to be held, and managed, by the
      U.S. There is no mention made of the cities of Zaporozhye and Kherson that have
      been constitutionally incorporated into Russia, but lie beyond the contact line.


      Nothing about a political solution apparently was outlined in the plan, and the
      plan leaves Ukraine free to pursue its claim to all Ukraine’s former territories
      – save for only Crimea.


      Ukrainian territory west of the Dnieper River however, would be divided into three
      zones of responsibility: British, French and German zones (i.e. which NATO forces
      would manage). Finally, no American security guarantees were offered.


      Rubio subsequently passed details of the plan to Russian FM Lavrov, who calmly
      stated that any ceasefire plan should resolve the underlying causes to the conflict
      in Ukraine as its first task.


      Witkoff flies to Moscow this week to present this ‘pig’s ear’ of a plan to Putin
      – seeking his consent. The Europeans and Ukrainians are set to meet next Wednesday
      in London to give their riposte to Trump.


      What’s next? Most obviously, the Kellogg Plan will not ‘fly’. Russia will not
      accept it, and likely Zelensky will not either, (though the Europeans will work
      to persuade him – hoping to ‘wrong-foot Moscow’ by presenting Russia as the essential
      ‘spoiler’). Reportedly, Zelensky already has rejected the Crimea provision.


      For the Europeans, the lack of security guarantees or backstop by the U.S. may
      prove to be a killer for their aspiration to deploy a tripwire troop deployment
      to Ukraine, in the context of a ceasefire.


      Is Trump really going to wash his hands of Ukraine? Doubtful, given that the U.S.
      neo-conservative institutional leadership will tell Trump that to do so, would
      weaken America’s ‘peace through strength’ narrative. Trump may adopt supporting
      Ukraine ‘on a low flame’ posture, whilst declaring the ‘war was never his’ – as
      he seeks a ‘win’ on the business front with Russia.


      The bottom line is that Kellogg has not well-served his patron. The U.S. needs
      effective working relations with Russia. The Kellogg contingent has contributed
      to Trump’s egregious misreading of Russia. Putin is a serious actor, who says
      what he means, and means what he says.


      Colonel Macgregor sums it up thus:


      “Trump tends to view the world through the lens of dealmaking. [Ending the Ukraine
      war] is not about dealmaking. This is about the life and death of nations and
      peoples. There’s no interest in some sort of short-fused deal that is going to
      elevate Trump or his administration to greatness. There will be no win for Donald
      Trump personally in any of this. That was never going to be the case”.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the internal conflict within the Trump
      administration regarding Iran and Ukraine policies, highlighting the dismissal
      of key Pentagon advisors opposed to military intervention in Iran, the flawed
      assumptions behind a proposed ceasefire plan for Ukraine, and the implications
      of these dynamics on U.S. foreign policy and Trump's leadership.
    paragraph_summary: The article by Alastair Crooke discusses the escalating political
      turmoil within the Trump administration, particularly regarding Iran and Ukraine
      policies, as Secretary of Defense Hegseth faces internal strife and the dismissal
      of advisors who advocated against military intervention in Iran. This conflict
      reflects broader divisions between hawks advocating for aggressive military action
      and restrainers cautioning against escalation. The article also critiques the
      recent ceasefire proposal in Ukraine, known as the Kellogg Plan, which is seen
      as flawed and unlikely to gain acceptance from Russia or Ukraine, as it fails
      to address the underlying causes of the conflict and lacks security guarantees.
      Ultimately, Crooke argues that the U.S. needs to foster effective relations with
      Russia, and that Trump's approach, influenced by Kellogg's assumptions, misreads
      the complexities of the situation, emphasizing that resolving the Ukraine conflict
      is not merely about dealmaking but involves significant geopolitical stakes.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      Trump clearly is in the midst of an existential conflict. He has a landslide mandate.
      But is ringed by a resolute domestic enemy front in the form of an “industrial
      concern” infused with Deep State ideology, centred primarily on preserving U.S.
      global power (rather than on mending of the economy).


      The key MAGA issue however is not foreign policy, but how to structurally re-balance
      an economic paradigm in danger of an extinction event. Trump has always been clear
      that this forms his primordial goal. His coalition of supporters are fixed on
      the need to revive America’s industrial base, so as to provide reasonably well-paid
      jobs to the MAGA corps.


      Trump may for now have a mandate, but extreme danger lurks – not just the Deep
      State and the Israeli lobby. The Yellen debt bomb is the more existential threat.
      It threatens Trump’s support in Congress, because the bomb is set to explode shortly
      before the 2026 midterms. New tariff revenues, DOGE savings, and even the upcoming
      Gulf shake-down are all centred on getting some sort of fiscal order in place,
      so that $9 trillion plus of short-term debt – maturing imminently – can be rolled
      over to the longer term without resort to eye-watering interest rates. It is Yellen-Democrat’s
      little trip wire for the Trump agenda.


      So far, the general context seems plain enough. Yet, on the minutiae of how exactly
      to re-balance the economy; how to manage the “debt bomb;” and how far DOGE should
      go with its cuts, divisions in Trump’s team are present. In fact, the tariff war
      and the China tussle bring into contention a fresh phalanx of opposition: i.e.
      those (some on Wall Street, oligarchs, etc.) who have prospered mightily from
      the golden era of free-flowing, seemingly limitless, money-creation; those who
      were enriched, precisely by the policies that have made America subservient to
      the looming American “debt knell.”


      Yet to make matters more complex, two of the key components to Trump’s mooted
      “re-balancing” and debt “solution” cannot be whispered, let alone said aloud:
      One reason is that it involves deliberately devaluing “the dollar in your pocket.”
      And secondly, many more Americans are going to lose their jobs.


      That is not exactly a popular “sell.” Which is probably why the “re-balance” has
      not been well explained to the public.


      Trump launched the Liberation “Tariff Shock” seemingly minded to crash-start a
      restructuring of international trade relations – as the first step towards a general
      re-alignment of major currency values.


      China however, wasn’t buying into the tariff and trade restrictions “stuff,” and
      matters quickly escalated. It looked for a moment as if the Trump “Coalition”
      might fracture under the pressure of the concomitant crisis in the U.S. bond market
      to the tariff fracas that shook confidence.


      The Coalition, in fact, held; markets subsided, but then the Coalition fractured
      over a foreign policy issue – Trump’s hope to normalise relations with Russia,
      towards a Great Global Reset.


      A major strand within the Trump Coalition (apart from MAGA populists) are the
      neocons and Israeli Firsters. Some sort of Faustian bargain supposedly was struck
      by Trump at the outset through a deal that had his team heavily peopled by zealous
      Israeli-Firsters.


      Simply put, the breadth of coalition that Trump thought he needed to win the election
      and deliver an economic re-balance also included two foreign policy pillars: Firstly,
      the reset with Moscow – the pillar by which to end the “forever wars,” which his
      Populist base despised. And the second pillar being the neutering of Iran as a
      military power and source of resistance, on which both Israeli Firsters – and
      Israel – insist (and with which Trump seems wholly comfortable). Hence the Faustian
      pact.


      Trump’s “peacemaker” aspirations no doubt added to his electoral appeal, but they
      were not the real driver to his landslide. What has become evident is that these
      diverse agendas – foreign and domestic – are interlinked: A set-back in one or
      the other acts as a domino either impelling or retarding the other agendas. Put
      simply: Trump is dependent on “wins” – early “wins” – even if this means rushing
      towards a prospective “easy win” without thinking through whether he possesses
      a sound strategy (and ability) to achieve it.


      All of Trump’s three agenda objectives, it turns out, are more complicated and
      divisive than he perhaps expected. He and his team seem captivated by western-embedded
      assumptions such as first, that war generally happens “Over There;” that war in
      the post Cold War era is not actually “war” in any traditional sense of full,
      all-out war, but is rather a limited application of overwhelming western force
      against an enemy incapable of threatening “us” in a similar manner; and thirdly,
      that a war’s scope and duration is decided in Washington and its Deep State “twin”
      in London.


      So those who talk about ending the Ukraine war through an imposed unilateral ceasefire
      (ie, the faction of Walz, Rubio and Hegseth, led by Kellogg) seem to assume blithely
      that the terms and timing for ending the war also can be decided in Washington,
      and imposed on Moscow through the limited application of asymmetric pressures
      and threats.


      Just as China isn’t buying into the tariff and trade restriction “stuff,” neither
      is Putin buying into the ultimatum “stuff”: (“Moscow has weeks, not months, to
      agree a ceasefire”). Putin has patiently tried to explain to Witkoff, Trump’s
      Envoy, that the American presumption that the scope and duration of any war is
      very much up to the West to decide simply doesn’t gel with today’s reality.


      And, in companion mode, those who talk about bombing Iran (which includes Trump)
      seem also to assume that they can dictate the war’s essential course and content
      too; the U.S. (and Israel perhaps), can simply determine to bomb Iran with big
      bunker-buster bombs. That’s it! End of story. This is assumed to be a self-justifying
      and easy war – and that Iran must learn to accept that they brought this upon
      themselves by supporting the Palestinians and others who refuse Israeli normalisation.


      Aurelien observes:


      So we are dealing with limited horizons; limited imagination and limited experience.
      But there’s one other determining factor: The U.S. system is recognised to be
      sprawling, conflictual – and, as a result, largely impervious to outside influence
      – and even to reality. Bureaucratic energy is devoted almost entirely to internal
      struggles, which are carried out by shifting coalitions in the administration;
      in Congress; in Punditland and in the media. But these struggles are, in general,
      about [domestic] power and influence – and not about the inherent merits of an
      issue, and [thus] require no actual expertise or knowledge.




      The system is large and complex enough that you can make a career as an ‘Iran
      expert,’ say, inside and outside government, without ever having visited the country
      or speaking the language – by simply recycling standard wisdom in a way that will
      attract patronage. You will be fighting battles with other supposed ‘experts,’
      within a very confined intellectual perimeter, where only certain conclusions
      are acceptable.


      What becomes evident is that this cultural approach (the Think-Tank Industrial
      Complex) induces a laziness and the prevalence of hubris into western thinking.
      It is assumed reportedly, that Trump assumed that Xi Jinping would rush to meet
      with him, following the imposition of tariffs – to plead for a trade deal – because
      China is suffering some economic headwinds.


      It is blandly assumed by the Kellogg contingent too that pressure is both the
      necessary and sufficient condition to compel Putin to agree to an unilateral ceasefire
      – a ceasefire that Putin repeatedly has stated he would not accept until a political
      framework was first agreed. When Witkoff relays Putin’s point within the Trump
      team discussion, he stands as a contrarian outside the “licensed discourse” which
      insists that Russia only takes détente with an adversary seriously after it has
      been forced to do so by a defeat or serious setback.


      Iran too repeatedly has said that it will not be stripped naked of its conventional
      defences; its allies and its nuclear programme. Iran likely has the capabilities
      to inflict huge damage both on U.S. forces in the region and on Israel.


      The Trump Team is divided on strategy here too – crudely put: to Negotiate or
      to Bomb.


      It seems that the pendulum has swung under intense pressure from Netanyahu and
      the Jewish institutional leadership within the U.S.


      A few words can change everything. In an about face, Witkoff shifted from saying
      a day earlier that Washington would be satisfied with a cap on Iranian nuclear
      enrichment and would not require the dismantling of its nuclear facilities, to
      posting on his official X account that any deal would require Iran to “stop and
      eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program … A deal with Iran
      will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.” Without a clear reversal on this
      from Trump, we are on a path to war.


      It is plain that Team Trump has not thought through the risks inherent to their
      agendas. Their initial “ceasefire meeting” with Russia in Riyadh, for example,
      was a theatre of the facile. The meeting was held on the easy assumption that
      since Washington had determined to have an early ceasefire then “it must be.”


      “Famously,” Aurelien wearily notes, “the Clinton administration’s Bosnia policy
      was the product of furious power struggles between rival American NGO and Human
      Rights’ alumni – none of whom knew anything about the region, or had ever been
      there.”


      It is not just that the team is insouciant towards the possible consequences of
      war in the Middle East. They are captive to manipulated assumptions that it will
      be an easy war.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses Trump's existential conflict as he navigates
      a complex political landscape filled with domestic opposition and foreign policy
      challenges, emphasizing his focus on economic re-balancing and the looming threat
      of national debt, while highlighting divisions within his team regarding strategies
      towards China, Russia, and Iran, ultimately suggesting that their simplistic assumptions
      about international relations may lead to significant miscalculations and potential
      conflict.

      facing Donald Trump as he navigates an existential conflict marked by a strong
      mandate yet significant opposition from entrenched domestic and foreign interests,
      particularly the Deep State and the Israeli lobby. Trump's primary focus is on
      restructuring the U.S. economy to revive its industrial base, but he faces imminent
      threats, notably the looming "debt bomb" that could jeopardize his support in
      Congress before the 2026 midterms. While aiming for a rebalancing of trade and
      currency values through tariffs, Trump's coalition is fracturing under the pressure
      of foreign policy disputes, particularly regarding relations with Russia and Iran.
      Crooke highlights the internal divisions within Trump's team over strategies,
      such as whether to negotiate or resort to military action, and critiques their
      reliance on outdated assumptions about international relations. The article underscores
      the precariousness of Trump's agenda, suggesting that without a clear and coherent
      strategy, the risks of conflict, particularly in the Middle East, remain high.

      The Trump ‘shock’ – his ‘de-centring’ of America from serving as pivot to the
      post-war ‘order’ via the dollar – has triggered a deep cleavage between those
      who gained huge benefit from the status quo, on the one hand; and on the other,
      the MAGA faction who have come to regard the status quo as inimical – even an
      existential threat – to U.S. interests. The sides have descended into bitter,
      accusatory polarisation.


      It is one of the ironies of the moment that President Trump and right-wing Republicans
      have insisted on decrying – as a “resource curse” – the benefits of the Reserve
      Currency status that precisely brought the U.S. the wave of inward global savings
      that has permitted the U.S. to enjoy the unique privilege of printing money, without
      adverse consequence: Until now that is! Debt levels finally matter, it seems,
      even for the Leviathan.


      Vice-President Vance now likens the Reserve Currency to a “parasite” that has
      eaten away the substance of its ‘host’ – the U.S. economy – by forcing an overvalued
      dollar.


      Just to be clear, President Trump believed there was no choice: Either he could
      upend the existing paradigm, at the cost of considerable pain for many of those
      dependent on the financialised system, or he could allow events to wend their
      way towards an inevitable U.S. economic collapse. Even those who understood the
      dilemma the U.S. faces, nonetheless have been somewhat shocked by the self-serving
      brazenness of him simply ‘tariffing the world’.


      Trump’s actions, (as many claim), were neither ‘spur of the moment’, nor whimsical.
      The ‘tariff solution’ had been pre-prepared by his team over recent years, and
      formed an integral part to a more complex framework – one that complemented the
      debt-reduction and revenue effects of tariffs, by a programme to coerce the repatriation
      of vanished manufacturing industry back to America.


      Trump’s is a gamble that may, or may not, succeed: It risks a bigger financial
      crisis, as financial markets are over-leveraged and fragile. But what is clear
      is that the de-centring of America that will follow from his crude threats and
      humiliation of world leaders ultimately will cause a counter-reaction both for
      relations with the U.S., and also in global willingness to continue to hold U.S.
      assets (such as U.S. Treasuries). China’s defiance of Trump will set a ‘tone’,
      even for those who lack China’s ‘heft’.


      Why then should Trump take such a risk? Because, behind Trump’s boldfaced actions,
      notes Simplicius, lies a harsh reality facing many MAGA supporters:


      “it remains inarguable that the American workforce has been gutted by the triple
      threat of mass migration; general worker anomie as consequence of cultural decay
      – and in particular, by the mass alienation and disenfranchisement of conservatively-minded
      men. These have been strongly contributing factors to the current crisis of doubt
      about the ability of ‘American manufacturing’ to ever return to a semblance of
      its previous glory, no matter how big an axe Trump takes to the stricken ‘World
      Order’”.


      Trump is mounting a Revolution in order to invert this reality – an end to the
      American anomie – by (Trump hopes) bringing back U.S. industry.


      There is a current of western public opinion – “by no means limited to intellectuals”,
      nor to Americans alone – that despairs of their own country’s ‘lack of will’,
      or its inability to do what needs to be done – its fecklessness and its ‘crisis
      of competence’. These people hanker for a leadership believed to be tougher and
      more decisive – a longing for unconstrained power and ruthlessness.


      One highly-placed Trump supporter puts it quite brutally: “We are now at a very
      important inflection point. If we are going to face ‘The Big Ugly’ with China,
      we cannot afford divided loyalties … It’s time to get mean, brutally, harshly
      mean. Delicate sensibilities must be dispatched like a feather in a hurricane”.


      It is no surprise that, against the general context of western nihilism, a mindset
      that admires power and ruthless technocratic solutions – almost ruthlessness for
      its own sake – could take hold. Take note – we are all in for a turbulent future.


      The West’s economic unravelling has been made more complicated by Trump’s often
      contradictory statements. It may be a part to his repertoire; yet nonetheless,
      the haphazardness evokes the thought that nothing is trustworthy; nothing is constant.


      It has been reported by ‘White House insiders’ that Trump has lost all inhibition
      when it comes to bold action: “He’s at the peak of just not giving a f**k anymore”,
      a White House official familiar with Trump’s thinking told the Washington Post:


      “Bad news stories? He doesn’t give a f**k. He’s going to do what he’s going to
      do. He’s going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail”.


      When some portion of a country’s population despairs of their own country’s “lack
      of will” or inability to “do what needs to be done”, Aurelian argues, they begin,
      from time to time, to identify emotionally with ‘Another Country’, believed to
      be tougher and more decisive. In this particular moment, “the mantle” of being
      “some sort of Nietzschean super-hero – beyond considerations of good and evil”
      … “landed upon Israel” – at least for an influential layer of both the U.S. and
      European policy-makers. Aurelian continues,


      “Israel, whose combination of a superficially western-style society with audacity,
      ruthlessness and a total disregard for international law and human life, was exciting
      to many and has become a model for emulation. Western support for Israel in Gaza
      makes much more sense when you realise that western politicians, and parts of
      the intellectual class, secretly admire the ruthlessness and brutality of Israel’s
      war”.


      Yet, despite the disruption and the pain caused by the U.S. ‘turn’, it nonetheless
      represents a huge opportunity too – an opportunity to shift to an alternate societal
      paradigm beyond neo-liberal financialism. This has been ruled out, until now,
      by the élite insistence on TINA (there is no alternative). Now the door is open
      a crack.


      Karl Polyani, in his Great Transformation (published some 80 years ago), held
      that the massive economic and social transformations that he had witnessed during
      his lifetime – the end of the century of “relative peace” in Europe from 1815
      to 1914, and the subsequent descent into economic turmoil, fascism and war, which
      was still ongoing at the time of the book’s publication – had but a single, overarching
      cause:


      Prior to the 19th century, Polyani insisted, the human ‘way of being’ (economics
      as an organic component of society) had always been ‘embedded’ in society, and
      subordinatedto local politics, customs, religion and social relations; i.e. subordinated
      to a civilisational culture. Life was not treated as separate; not reduced to
      distinct particulars, but was viewed as parts to an organic whole – that is, to
      Life itself.


      Post-modern nihilism (that descended into unregulated neo-liberalism of the 1980s)
      turned this logic on its head. As such, it constituted an ontological break with
      much of history. Not only did it artificially separate the ‘economic’ from the
      political and ethical ‘way of being’, but open, free-trade economics (in its Adam
      Smith formulation) demanded the subordination of society to the abstract logic
      of the self-regulating market. For Polanyi, this “meant no less than the running
      of community as an adjunct to the market”, and nothing more.


      The answer – clearly – was to make society again the dominant part to a distinctly
      human community; i.e. given its meaning through a living culture. In this sense,
      Polanyi also emphasised the territorial character of sovereignty – the nation-state
      as the sovereign pre-condition to the exercise of democratic politics.


      Polanyi would have argued that, absent a return to Life itself as the central
      pivot to politics, a violent backlash was inevitable. Is such a backlash what
      we are seeing today?


      At a conference of Russian industrialists and entrepreneurs, on 18 March 2025,
      Putin referred precisely to a ‘National Economics’ alternate solution for Russia.
      Putin highlighted both the imposed siege on the state, and set out the Russian
      response it – a model which is likely to be adopted by much of the globe.


      It is a mode of economic thinking that is already practiced by China which had
      anticipated Trump’s Tariff Blitz.


      Putin’s address – metaphorical speaking – constitutes the financial counterpart
      to his 2007 Munich Security Forum speech, at which he accepted the military défie
      posed by ‘collective NATO’. Last month however, he went further – Putin stated
      clearly that Russia had accepted the challenge posed by the Anglo ‘open economy’
      financial order.


      Putin’s address was in one sense nothing really new – It was the shift from the
      ‘open economy’ model towards ‘National Economics’.


      The ‘National Economic’s School’ (of the nineteenth century) argued that Adam
      Smith’s analysis, which was heavily focused on individualism and cosmopolitanism,
      overlooked the crucial role of the national economy.


      The result of a general free trade would not be a universal republic, but, on
      the contrary, a universal subjection of the less advanced nations by the predominant
      manufacturing and commercial and powers. Those advocating for a national economy
      countered Smith’s open economy by advocating a ‘closed economy’ to allow nascent
      industries to grow and become competitive on the global stage.


      “Hold to no illusions: There is nothing beyond this reality”, Putin warned the
      gathered Russian industrialists in March 2025. “Set illusions aside”, he told
      delegates:


      “Sanctions and restrictions are today’s reality – together with a new spiral of
      economic rivalry already unleashed”.


      “Sanctions are neither temporary nor targeted measures; they constitute a mechanism
      of systemic, strategic pressure against our nation. Regardless of global developments
      or shifts in the international order, our competitors will perpetually seek to
      constrain Russia and to diminish its economic and technological capacities”.


      “You should not hope for complete freedom of trade, payments and capital transfers.
      You should not count on Western mechanisms to protect the rights of investors
      and entrepreneurs… I’m not talking about any legal systems – they just don’t exist!
      They exist there only for themselves! That’s the trick. Do you understand?!”


      Our [Russian] challenges exist, ‘yes’, Putin said; “but theirs are abundant also.
      Western dominance is slipping away. New centres of global growth are taking centre
      stage”.


      These challenges are not the ‘problem’; they are the opportunity, Putin argued:
      We will prioritise domestic manufacturing and the development of tech industries.
      The old model is over. Oil and gas production will be simply the adjunct to a
      largely internally circulating, self-sufficient ‘real economy’ – with energy no
      longer its driver. We are open to western investment – but only on our terms –
      and the small ‘open’ sector of our otherwise closed, self-circulating real economy
      will of course still trade with our BRICS partners.


      Russia is returning to the National Economy model, Putin implied. ‘This makes
      us sanction and tariff resistant’. ‘Russia is also inducement resistant – being
      self-sufficient in energy and raw materials’, Putin said. A clear alternate economic
      paradigm in the face of an unraveling world order.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how Trump's actions have polarized American
      society by challenging the established financial order and Reserve Currency status,
      leading to a potential economic crisis while reflecting a broader desire for decisive
      leadership amidst feelings of national decline, as well as the emergence of alternative
      economic paradigms in response to global tensions.
    paragraph_summary: In his article, Alastair Crooke discusses the significant shift
      in U.S. economic and political dynamics brought about by Donald Trump's presidency,
      particularly his challenge to the established post-war order centered around the
      dollar as the reserve currency. This shift has led to a stark division between
      those benefiting from the status quo and the MAGA supporters who view it as a
      threat to American interests. Trump’s approach, including tariffs and a push for
      repatriating manufacturing, is framed as a necessary gamble to avert economic
      collapse, despite the risks of exacerbating financial instability. Crooke highlights
      a growing sentiment among some in the West who admire ruthlessness and decisive
      leadership, drawing parallels to Israel's aggressive policies. He also references
      Karl Polanyi's ideas on the need for an economic model that prioritizes societal
      well-being over market forces, suggesting that the current upheaval could lead
      to the emergence of alternative economic paradigms, as seen in Russia's shift
      towards a "National Economics" model under Putin, which emphasizes self-sufficiency
      and resilience against Western dominance.

      Ultimatum That Likely Cannot Be Met – OpEd'

      Trump’s ultimatum to Iran? Colonel Doug Macgregor compares the Trump ultimatum
      to Iran to that which Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia in 1914: An offer, in
      short, that ‘could not be refused’. Serbia accepted nine out of the ten demands.
      But it refused one – and Austria-Hungary immediately declared war.


      On 4 February, shortly after his Inauguration, President Trump signed a National
      Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM); that is to say, a legally binding directive
      requiring government agencies to carry out the specified actions precisely.


      The demands are that Iran should be denied a nuclear weapon; denied inter-continental
      missiles, and denied too other asymmetric and conventional weapons capabilities.
      All these demands go beyond the NPT and the existing JCPOA. To this end, the NSPMdirects
      maximum economic pressure be imposed; that the U.S. Treasury act to drive Iran’s
      oil exports to zero; that the U.S. work to trigger JCPOA Snapback of sanctions;
      and that Iran’s “malign influence abroad” – its “proxies” – be neutralised.


      The UN sanctions snapback expires in October, so time is short to fulfil the procedural
      requirements to Snapback. All this suggests why Trump and Israeli officials give
      Spring as the deadline to a negotiated agreement.


      Trump’s ultimatum to Iran appears to be moving the U.S. down a path to where war
      is the only outcome, as occurred in 1914 – an outcome which ultimately triggered
      WW1.


      Might this just be Trump bluster? Possibly, but it does sound as if Trump is issuing
      legally binding demands such that he must expect cannot be met. Acceptance of
      Trump’s demands would leave Iran neutered and stripped of its sovereignty, at
      the very least. There is an implicit ‘tone’ to these demands too, that is one
      of threatening and expecting regime change in Iran as its outcome.


      It may be Trump bluster, but the President has ‘form’ (past convictions) on this
      issue. He has unabashedly hewed to the Netanyahu line on Iran that the JCPOA (or
      any deal with Iran) was ‘bad’. In May 2014, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA
      at Netanyahu’s behest and instead issued a new set of 12 demands to Iran – including
      permanently and verifiably abandoning its nuclear programme in perpetuity and
      ceasing all uranium enrichment.


      What is the difference between those earlier Trump demands and those of this February?
      Essentially they are the same, except today he says: If Iran “doesn’t make a deal,
      there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen
      before”.


      Thus, there is both history, and the fact that Trump is surrounded – on this issue
      at least – by a hostile cabal of Israeli Firsters and Super Hawks. Witkoff is
      there, but is poorly grounded on the issues. Trump too, has shown himself virtually
      totalitarian in terms of any and all criticism of Israel in American Academia.
      And in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, he is fully supportive of Netanyahu’s far-right
      provocative and expansionist agenda.


      These present demands regarding Iran also run counter to the 25 March 2025 latest
      annual U.S. Intelligence Threat Assessment that Iran is NOT building a nuclear
      weapon. This Intelligence Assessment is effectively disregarded. A few days before
      its release, Trump’s National Security Adviser, Mike Waltz clearly stated that
      the Trump Administration is seeking the “full dismantlement” of Iran''s nuclear
      energy program: “Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world
      can see”, Waltz said. “It is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire
      to have a nuclear weapon”.


      On the one hand, it seems that behind these ultimata stands a President made “pissed
      off and angry” at his inability to end the Ukraine war almost immediately – as
      he first mooted – together with pressures from a bitterly fractured Israel and
      a volatile Netanyahu to compress the timeline for the speedy ‘finishing off’ of
      the Iranian ‘regime’ (which, it is claimed, has never been weaker). All so that
      Israel can normalise with Lebanon –and even Syria. And with Iran supposedly ‘disabled’,
      pursue implementation of the Greater Israel project to be normalised across the
      Middle East.


      Which, on the other hand, will enable Trump to pursue the ‘long-overdue’ grand
      pivot to China. (And China is energy-vulnerable – regime change in Tehran would
      be a calamity, from the Chinese perspective).


      To be plain, Trump’s China strategy needs to be in place too, in order to advance
      Trump’s financial system re-balancing plans. For, should China feel itself besieged,
      it could well act as a spoiler to Trump''s re-working of the American and global
      financial system.


      The Washington Post reports on a ‘secret’ Pentagon memo from Hegseth that “China
      [now] is the Department’s sole pacing threat , [together] with denial of a Chinese
      fait accompli seizure of Taiwan — while simultaneously defending the U.S. homeland”.


      The ‘force planning construct’ (a concept of how the Pentagon will build and resource
      the armed services to take on perceived threats) will only consider conflict with
      Beijing when planning contingencies for a major power war, the Pentagon memo says,
      leaving the threat from Moscow largely to be attended by European allies.


      Trump wants to be powerful enough credibly to threaten China militarily, and therefore
      wants Putin to agree speedily to a ceasefire in Ukraine, so that military resources
      can quickly be moved to the China theatre.


      On his flight back to Washington last Sunday evening, Trump reiterated his annoyance
      toward Putin, but added “I don’t think he’s going to go back on his word, I’ve
      known him for a long time. We’ve always gotten along well”. Asked when he wanted
      Russia to agree to a ceasefire, Trump said there was a “psychological deadline”
      – “If I think they’re tapping us along, I will not be happy about it”.


      Trump’s venting against Russia may, perhaps, have an element of reality-TV to
      it. For his domestic audience, he needs to be perceived as bringing ‘peace through
      strength’ – to keep up the Alpha-Male appearance, lest the truth of his lack of
      leverage over Putin becomes all too apparent for the American public and to the
      world.


      Part of the reason for Trump’s frustration too, may be his cultural formation
      as a New York businessman; that a deal is about first dominating the negotiations,
      and then quickly ‘splitting the difference’. This, however, is not how diplomacy
      works. The transactional approach also reflects deep conceptual flaws.


      The Ukraine ceasefire process is stalled, not because of Russian intransigence,
      but rather because Team Trump has determined that achieving a settlement in Ukraine
      comes firstly through insisting on a unilateral and immediate ceasefire – without
      introducing temporary governance to enable elections in Ukraine, nor addressing
      the root causes of the conflict. And secondly, because Trump rushed in, without
      listening to what the Russians were saying, and/or without hearing it.


      Now that initial pleasantries are over, and Russia is saying flatly that current
      ‘ceasefire’ proposals simply are inadequate and unacceptable, Trump becomes angry
      and lashes out at Putin, saying that 25% tariffs on Russian oil could happen ANY
      moment.


      Putin and Iran are both now under ‘deadlines’ (a ‘psychological’ one in Putin’s
      case), so as to enable Trump to proceed with credibly threatening China to come
      to a ‘deal’ soon – as the global economy is already wobbling.


      Trump fumes and spits fire. He tries to hurry matters along by making a big show
      of bombing the Houthis, boasting that they have been hit hard, with many Houthi
      leaders killed. Yet, such callousness towards Yemeni civilian deaths sits awkwardly
      with his claimed heart-rendering empathy for the thousands of ‘handsome’ Ukrainian
      young men needlessly dying on the front lines.


      It all becomes reality-TV.


      Trump threatens Iran with “bombing [the] likes of which they have never seen before”
      over an ultimatum that likely cannot be met. Simply put, this threat (which includes
      the possible use of nuclear weapons) is not given because Iran poses a threat
      to the U.S. It does not. But it is given as an option. A plan; a ‘thing’ placed
      calmly on the geo-political table and intended to spread fear. “Cities full of
      children, women, and the elderly to be killed: Not morally wrong. Not a war crime”.


      No. Just the ‘reality’ that Trump takes the Iranian nuclear programme to be an
      existential threat to Israel. And that the U.S. is committed to using military
      force to eliminate existential threats to Israel.


      This is the heart to Trump’s ultimatum. It owes to the fact that it is Israel
      – not America, and not the U.S. intelligence community – that views Iran as an
      existential threat. Professor Hudson, speaking with direct knowledge of the background
      policy (see hereand here) says, “it''s NOT just that Israel as we know it – must
      be safe and secure and free from terrorism”. That''s Trump and his Team’s ‘line’;
      that''s the Israeli and its supporters narrative too. “But the mentality [behind
      it] is different”, Hudson says.


      There are some 2-3 million Israelis who see themselves as destined to control
      all of what we now call the Middle East, the Levant, what some call West Asia
      – and others call “Greater Israel”. These Zionists believe that they are mandated
      by God to take this land – and that all who oppose them are Amalek. They believe
      the Amalek to be consumed with an overwhelming desire to kill Jews, and who therefore
      should be annihilated.


      The Torah records the story of Amalek: Parshat Ki Teitzei, when the Torah states,
      machoh timcheh et zecher Amalek—that we must erase Amalek’s memory. “Every year
      we [Jews] are obligated to read – not how God will destroy Amalek – but how we
      should destroy Amalek”. (Though many Jews puzzle how to reconcile this mitzvah
      with their ingrained contrarian values of compassion and mercy).


      This commandment in the Torah is in fact one of the key factors that lies at the
      root of Israel’s obsession with Iran. Israelis perceive Iran as an Amalek tribe
      plotting to kill Jews. No deal, no compromise therefore is possible. It is also,
      of course, about Iran’s strategic challenge (albeit secular) to the Israeli state.


      And what has made the Trump ultimatum so pressing in Washington’s view – apart
      from the China-pivot considerations – was the assassination of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.
      That assassination marked a big shift in U.S. thinking, because, before that,
      we inhabited an era of careful calculation; incremental moves up an escalator
      ladder. What is understood now is that ‘we''re no longer playing chess’. There
      are no rules anymore.


      Israel (Netanyahu) is going hell-for-leather on all fronts to mitigate the divisions
      and turmoil at home in Israel through igniting the Iranian front – even though
      this course might well threaten Israel’s destruction.


      This latter prospect marks the reddest of ‘red lines’ to ingrained Deep State
      structures.'
    one_sentence_summary: Trump's ultimatum to Iran, which demands the dismantling of
      its nuclear program and military capabilities under the threat of severe military
      action, mirrors the historical precedent of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia
      in 1914, suggesting a path towards potential conflict driven by Israeli interests
      rather than American security concerns.
    paragraph_summary: In an analysis by Alastair Crooke, the article compares President
      Trump's ultimatum to Iran to Austria-Hungary's demands on Serbia in 1914, suggesting
      that Trump's demands are similarly impossible to accept without leading to conflict.
      Signed shortly after his inauguration, Trump's National Security Presidential
      Memorandum outlines stringent requirements for Iran, including the complete dismantling
      of its nuclear program and military capabilities, while imposing maximum economic
      pressure. The article posits that these demands, which disregard U.S. intelligence
      assessments indicating Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons, may be driven by
      Trump's alignment with Israeli interests and a desire to pivot U.S. focus towards
      China. The ultimatum is seen as a potential precursor to war, with Trump's aggressive
      rhetoric suggesting a willingness to use military force against Iran, which is
      framed as an existential threat to Israel rather than the U.S. The article highlights
      the deep-rooted Israeli perceptions of Iran as a threat and the implications of
      Trump's strategy for broader geopolitical dynamics, particularly concerning China
      and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      The post-WWII geo-political outcome effectively determined the post-war global
      economic structure. Both are now undergoing huge change. What remains stuck fast
      however, is the general (Western) weltanschauung that everything must “change”
      only for it to stay the same. Things financial will continue as before; do not
      disturb the slumber. The assumption is that the oligarch/donor class will see
      to it that things remain the same.


      However, the power distribution of the post-war era was unique. There is nothing
      “forever” about it; nothing inherently permanent.


      At a recent conference of Russian industrialists and entrepreneurs, President
      Putin highlighted both the global fracture, and set out an alternate vision which
      is likely to be adopted by BRICS and many beyond. His address was, metaphorically
      speaking, the financial counterpart to his 2007 Munich Security Forum speech,
      at which he accepted the military défie posed by “collective NATO.”


      Putin is now hinting that Russia has accepted the challenge posed by the post-war
      financial order. Russia has persevered against the financial war, and is prevailing
      in that too.


      Putin’s address last week was, in one sense, nothing really new: It reflected
      the classic doctrine of the former premier, Yevgeny Primakov. No romantic about
      the West, Primakov understood its hegemonic world order would always treat Russia
      as a subordinate. So he proposed a different model – the multipolar order – where
      Moscow balances power blocs, but does not join them.


      At its heart, the Primakov Doctrine was the avoidance of binary alignments; the
      preservation of sovereignty; the cultivation of ties with other great powers,
      and the rejection of ideology in favour of a Russian nationalist vision.


      Today’s negotiations with Washington (now narrowly centred on Ukraine) reflect
      this logic. Russia isn’t begging for sanctions relief or threatening anything
      specific. It is conducting strategic procrastination: waiting out electoral cycles,
      testing Western unity, and keeping all doors ajar. Yet Putin is not adverse either
      to exerting a little pressure of his own – the window for accepting Russian sovereignty
      of the four eastern oblasts is not forever: “This point can also move,” he said.


      It is not Russia racing ahead with the negotiations; quite the reverse – it is
      Trump who is racing ahead. Why? It appears to hark back to the American attachment
      to Kissinger-esque triangulation strategy: Subordinate Russia; peel away Iran;
      and then peel Russia from China. Offer carrots and threaten to “stick” to Russia,
      and once subordinated in this way, Russia might then be detached from Iran – thus
      removing any Russian impediments to an Israel-Washington Axis attack on Iran.


      Primakov, were he here, likely would be warning that Trump’s “Big Strategy” is
      to tie Russia into subordinate status quickly, so that Trump can continue the
      Israel normalisation of the entire Middle East.


      Witkoff has made Trump’s strategy very plain:


      The next thing is: we need to deal with Iran … they’re a benefactor of proxy armies
      … but if we can get these terrorist organisations eliminated as risks … Then we’ll
      normalise everywhere. I think Lebanon could normalise with Israel …That’s really
      possible … Syria, too: So maybe Jolani in Syria [now] is a different guy. They’ve
      driven Iran out … Imagine if Lebanon … Syria … and the Saudis sign a normalisation
      treaty with Israel … I mean that would be epic!


      US officials say the deadline for an Iran “decision” is in the spring …


      And with Russia reduced to supplicant status and Iran dealt with (in such fantastical
      thinking), Team Trump can turn to the main adversary – China.


      Putin, of course, understands this well, and duly debunked all such illusions:
      “Set illusions aside,” he told delegates last week:


      Sanctions and restrictions are today’s reality – together with a new spiral of
      economic rivalry already unleashed ….




      Hold to no illusions: There is nothing beyond this reality ….




      Sanctions are neither temporary nor targeted measures; they constitute a mechanism
      of systemic, strategic pressure against our nation. Regardless of global developments
      or shifts in the international order, our competitors will perpetually seek to
      constrain Russia and diminish its economic and technological capacities ….




      You should not hope for complete freedom of trade, payments and capital transfers.
      You should not count on Western mechanisms to protect the rights of investors
      and entrepreneurs … I’m not talking about any legal systems – they just don’t
      exist! They exist there only for themselves! That’s the trick. Do you understand?!


      Our [Russian] challenges exist, “yes” – “but theirs are abundant also. Western
      dominance is slipping away. New centres of global growth are taking centre stage,”
      Putin said.


      These [challenges] are not the “problem;” they are the opportunity, Putin outlined:
      “We will prioritise domestic manufacturing and the development of tech industries.
      The old model is over. Oil and gas production will be simply the adjunct to a
      largely internally circulating, self-sufficient ‘real economy’ – with energy no
      longer its driver. We are open to western investment – but only on our terms –
      and the small ‘open’ sector of our otherwise closed economy will of course still
      trade with our BRICS partners.”


      What Putin outlined effectively is the return to the mainly closed internally-circulating
      economy model of the German school (à la Friedrich List) and of the Russian Premier,
      Sergei Witte.


      Just to be clear – Putin was not just explaining how Russia had transformed into
      a sanctions-resistant economy that could equally disdain the apparent enticements
      of the West, as well as its threats. He was challenging the Western economic model
      more fundamentally.


      Friedrich List had, from the outset, been wary of Adam Smith’s thinking that formed
      the basis of the “Anglo-model.” List warned that it would ultimately be self-defeating;
      it would bias the system away from wealth creation, and ultimately make it impossible
      to consume as much, or to employ so many.


      Such a shift of economic model has profound consequences: It undercuts the entirety
      of the transactional “Art of the Deal” mode of diplomacy on which Trump relies.
      It exposes the transactional weaknesses. “Your enticement of the lifting of sanctions,
      plus the other inducements of western investment and technology, now mean nothing”
      – for we will accept these things henceforth: on our terms only,” Putin said.
      “Nor,” he argued, “do your threats of a further sanctions siege carry weight –
      for your sanctions were the boon that took us to our new economic model.”


      In other words, be it Ukraine, or relations with China and Iran, Russia can be
      largely impervious (short of the mutually destructive threat of WWIII) to US blandishments.
      Moscow can take its sweet time on Ukraine and consider other issues on a strictly
      cost-benefit analysis. It can see that the US has no real leverage.


      Yet the great paradox to this is that List and Witte were right – and Adam Smith
      was wrong. For it is now the US that has discovered that the Anglo model indeed
      has proved to be self-defeating.


      The US has been forced into two major conclusions: First, that the budget deficit
      coupled with exploding Federal debt finally has turned the “Resource Curse” back
      onto the US.


      As the “keeper” of the global Reserve Currency – and as JD Vance explicitly said
      – it has necessarily made America’s primordial export to become the US dollar.
      By extension, it means that the strong dollar (buoyed by a global synthetic demand
      for the reserve currency) has eviscerated America’s real economy – its manufacturing
      base.


      This is “Dutch Disease,” whereby currency appreciation suppresses the development
      of productive export sectors, and turns politics into a zero-sum conflict over
      resource rents.


      At last year’s Senate hearing with Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair, Vance
      asked the Fed Chairman whether the US dollar’s status as the global Reserve Currency
      might have some downsides. Vance drew parallels to the classic “resource curse,”
      suggesting the dollar’s global role contributed to financialization at the expense
      of investment in the real economy: The Anglo model leads economies to overspecialize
      in their abundant factor, be it natural resources, low-wage labour, or financialised
      assets.


      The second point – related to security – a subject which the Pentagon has been
      harping on for ten years or so, is that the Reserve Currency (and consequentially
      strong dollar) has pushed many US military supply lines out to China. It makes
      no sense, the Pentagon argues, for the US to depend on Chinese supply lines to
      provide the inputs to US military manufactured weapons – by which it would then
      fight China.


      The US Administration has two answers to this conundrum: First, a multilateral
      agreement (on the lines of the 1985 Plaza Accord) to weaken the value of the dollar
      (and pari passu, therefore, to increase the value of the partner states’ currencies).
      This is the “Mar-a-Lago Accord” option. The US’ solution is to force the rest
      of the world to appreciate their currencies in order to improve US export competitiveness.


      The mechanism for achieving these objectives is to threaten trade and investment
      partners with tariffs and withdrawal of the US security umbrella. As a further
      twist, the plan considers the possibility to revalue US gold reserves – a move
      that would inversely cut the valuation of the dollar, US debt, and foreign holdings
      of US Treasuries.


      The second option is the unilateral approach: In the unilateral approach, a “user
      fee” on foreign official holdings of US Treasuries would be imposed to drive reserve
      managers out of the dollar – and thus weaken it.


      Well, it is obvious, is it not? A US economic “re-balancing” is coming. Putin
      is right. The post-WWII economic order “is gone.”


      Will bluster and threats of sanctions force big states to strengthen their currencies
      and accept US debt restructuring (i.e. haircuts imposed on their bond holdings)?
      It seems improbable.


      The Plaza Accord realignment of currencies depended on the co-operation of major
      states, without which unilateral moves can turn ugly.


      Who is the weaker party? Who has the leverage now in the balance of power? Putin
      answered that question on 18 March 2025.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how the post-WWII geopolitical and economic
      structures are undergoing significant changes, with President Putin advocating
      for a multipolar world and a shift away from reliance on Western economic models,
      while the U.S. grapples with the implications of its own financial and military
      dependencies, suggesting that the established global order is no longer sustainable.
    paragraph_summary: In his article, Alastair Crooke discusses the shifting geopolitical
      and economic landscape following World War II, emphasizing that the post-war financial
      order is no longer stable. He highlights President Putin's recent address, which
      reflects a strategic pivot towards a multipolar world and a rejection of the traditional
      Western economic model, advocating for a self-sufficient Russian economy that
      prioritizes domestic manufacturing and technology. Crooke argues that Russia is
      strategically biding its time in negotiations with the U.S., particularly regarding
      Ukraine, while also recognizing the challenges posed by Western sanctions. He
      critiques the U.S. reliance on the Anglo economic model, suggesting it has led
      to detrimental effects on its manufacturing base and military supply chains. The
      article concludes that a significant economic rebalancing is imminent, as the
      post-WWII order is unraveling, with Russia asserting its sovereignty and redefining
      its economic strategies on its own terms.

      Ultimatum To Iran – OpEd

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      The phone call on 18 March between Presidents Trump and Putin has happened. It
      was a success, insofar as it allowed both sides to label the result as ‘positive’.
      And it did not lead to a breakdown (by virtue of the smallest of concessions from
      Putin – an energy infrastructure truce) – something easily it could have done
      (i.e. devolve into impasse – with Trump excoriating Putin, as he has done to Zelensky),
      given the fantastical and unrealistic expectations being woven in the West that
      this would be the ‘decider meeting’ for a final division of Ukraine.


      It may have been a success too, insofar as it has laid the groundwork for the
      absent homework, now to be handled by two teams of experts on the detailed mechanics
      of the ceasefire. It was always a puzzle why this had not been earlier tackled
      by the U.S. team in Riyadh (lack of experience?). It was, after all, because the
      ceasefire was treated as a self-creating entity, by virtue of an American signature,
      that western expectations took flight in the belief that details did not matter;
      All that remained to do – in this (flawed) estimation – was to ‘divvy out the
      cake’.


      Until the mechanics of a ceasefire – which must be comprehensive since ceasefires
      almost always break down – there was little to discuss on that topic on Tuesday.
      Predictably, then, discussion (reportedly) seemed to have turned to other issues:
      mainly economic ones and Iran, underlining again that the negotiation process
      between the U.S. and Russia does not boil down to just Ukraine.


      So, how to move to ceasefire implementation? Simple. Begin to unravel the ‘cats
      cradle’ of impedimenta blocking normalised relations. Putin, plucking out just
      one strand to this problem, observed that:


      “Sanctions [alone] are neither temporary nor targeted measures. They constitute
      [rather], a mechanism of systemic, strategic pressure against our nation. Our
      competitors perpetually seek to constrain Russia and diminish its economic and
      technological capacities … they churn out these packages incessantly”.


      There is thus much cumulated geo-strategic debris to be addressed, and corrected,
      dating back many years, before a Big Picture normalisation can start in earnest.


      What is apparent is that whilst Trump seems to be in a tearing hurry, Putin, by
      contrast, is not. And he will not be rushed. His own constituency will not countenance
      a hastily fudged accord with the U.S. that later implodes amidst recriminations
      of deceit – and of Moscow again having been fooled by the West. Russian blood
      is invested in this strategic normalisation process. It needs to work.


      What is behind Trump’s evident hurry? Is it the need for breakneck speed on the
      domestic front to push ahead, before the cumulated forces of the opposition in
      the U.S. (plus their brethren in Europe) have the time to re-group and to torpedo
      normalisation with Russia?


      Or does Trump fear that a long gap before ceasefire implementation will enable
      opposition forces to push for the recommencement of arms supplies and intelligence
      sharing – as the Russian military steamroller continues its advance? Is the fear,
      as Steve Bannon has warned, that by rearming Ukraine, Trump effectively will ‘own’
      the war, and shoulder the blame for a massive western and NATO defeat?


      Or, perhaps Trump anticipates that Kiev might unexpectedly cascade into a systemic
      collapse (as occurred to the Karzai government in Afghanistan). Trump is acutely
      aware of the political disaster that befell Biden from the images of Afghans clinging
      to the tyres of departing U.S. transport planes (à la Vietnam), as the U.S. evacuated
      the country.


      Yet again, it might be something different. I learned from my time facilitating
      ceasefires in Palestine/Israel that it is not possible to make a ceasefire in
      one place (say Bethlehem), whilst Israeli forces were concurrently setting Nablus
      or Jenin ablaze. The emotional contagion and anger from one conflict cannot be
      contained to one locality; it would overflow to the other. It was tried. The one
      contaminated the implied sincere intentions behind the other.


      Is the reason for the Trump haste mainly that he suspects his unconstrained support
      for Israel eventually will lead him to embrace major war in the Middle East? The
      world of today (thanks to the internet) is much smaller than before: Is it possible
      to be a ‘peacemaker’ and a ‘warmaker’ simultaneously – and have the first taken
      seriously?


      Trump and those U.S. politicians ‘owned’ by the pro-Israeli lobby, know that Netanyahu
      et al. want the U.S. to help eliminate Israel’s regional rival – Iran. Trump cannot
      both retrench the U.S. as a western hemisphere ‘Sphere of Influence’, yet continue
      to throw the U.S.’ weight around as world Hegemon, causing the U.S. government
      to go broke. Can Trump successfully retrench the U.S. to Fortress America, or
      will foreign entanglements – i.e. an unstable Israel – lead to war and derail
      Trump’s administration, as all is intertwined?


      What is Trump’s vision for the Middle East? Certainly, he has one – it is one
      that is rooted in his unstinting allegiance to the Israeli interest. The plan
      is either to destroy Iran financially, or to decapitate it and empower a Greater
      Israel. Trump’s letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei included a two-month
      deadline for reaching a new nuclear deal.


      A day after his missive, Trump said the U.S. is “down to the final moments” with
      Iran:


      “We can’t let them have a nuclear weapon. Something is going to happen very soon.
      I would rather have a peace deal than the other option, but the other option will
      solve the problem”.


      U.S. journalist Ken Klippenstein has noted that on 28 February, two B-52 bombers
      flying from Qatar dropped bombs on an “undisclosed location” – Iraq. These nuclear-capable
      bombers were carrying a message whose recipient “was clear as day; The Islamic
      Republic of Iran”. Why B-52s and not F-35s which also can carry bombs? (Because
      ‘bunker-buster’ bombs are too heavy for F-35s? Israel has F-35s, but does not
      have B-52 heavy bombers).


      Then on 9 March, Klippenstein writes, a second demonstration was made: A B-52s
      flew alongside Israeli fighter jets on long-range missions, practicing aerial
      refuelling operations. The Israeli press correctly reported the real purpose of
      the operation – “readying the Israeli military for a potential joint strike with
      the U.S. on Iran”.


      Then, last Sunday, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz boasted that multiple
      Anglo-U.S. airstrikes “took out” top Houthi officials, making it very clear that
      this is all about Iran:


      “This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders
      and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership,
      and two, holding Iran responsible”.


      Marco Rubio elaborated on CBS: “We’re doing the entire world a favour by getting
      rid of these guys”.


      Trump then followed up with the same theme:


      “Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward,
      as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be
      held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be
      dire!”


      In a further piece, Klippenstein writes:


      “Trump’s menu of options for dealing with Tehran now includes one he didn’t have
      in his first term: full-scale war – with “nuclear weapons on the table” (the Trident
      II low-yield option) Pentagon and company contracting documents I’ve obtained
      describe “a unique joint staff planning” effort underway in Washington and in
      the Middle East to refine the next generation of “a major regional conflict” with
      Iran. The plans are the result of a reassessment of Iran’s military capabilities,
      as well as a fundamental shift in how America conducts war”.


      What is new is that the “multilateral” component includes Israel working in unison
      with Arab Gulf partners for the first time, either indirectly or directly. The
      plan also includes many different contingencies and levels of war, according to
      the documents cited by Klippenstein, from “crisis action” (meaning response to
      events and attacks), to “deliberate” planning (which refers to set scenarios that
      flow from crises that escalate out of control). One document warns of the “distinct
      possibility” of the war “escalating outside of the United States Government’s
      intention” and impacting the rest of the region, demanding a multifaceted approach.


      War preparations for Iran are so closely restricted, that even contracting companies
      involved in war planning are prohibited from even mentioning unclassified portions,
      notes Klippenstein:


      “While a range of military options are often provided to presidents in an attempt
      on the part of the Pentagon to steer the President to the one favoured by the
      Pentagon, Trump already has shown his proclivity to select the most provocative
      option”. “Equally, Trump’s green light for the Israeli air-strikes on Gaza, killing
      hundreds, [last] Monday, but ostensibly targetted on the Hamas leadership can
      be seen as consonant with the pattern of taking the belligerent option”.


      Following his successful assassination of Iran’s top general Qassim Suleimani
      in 2020, Trump seems to have taken the lesson that aggressive action is relatively
      cost-free, Klippenstein notes.


      As Waltz noted in his press interview:


      “The difference is these [Yemen attacks] were not pinpricks, back and forth, what
      ultimately proved to be feckless attacks. This was an overwhelming response that
      actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out”.


      Klippenstein cautions that, “2024 may be behind us but its lessons aren’t. Israel’s
      assassination of top Hezbollah officials in Lebanon was largely perceived by Washington
      to be a resounding success with few downsides. Trump likely took back the same
      message, leading to his strike on [the] Houthi leadership this week”.


      If western observers are seeing all of what’s going on as some repeat of Biden’s
      tit-for-tat or limited attacks by Israel on Iran’s early warning and air defences,
      they may be misunderstanding what’s going on behind the scenes. What Trump might
      now do, which is right out of the Israeli playbook, would be to attack Iran’s
      command and control, including Iran’s leadership.


      This – very certainly – would have a profound effect on Trump’s relations with
      Russia – and China. It would eviscerate any sense in Moscow and Beijing that Trump
      is agreement capable. What price then his ‘peacemaker’ ‘Big Picture’ reset were
      he, in the wake of wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, to start a war with Iran?
      Does Trump see Iran through some disturbed optic – that in destroying Iran, he
      is bringing about peace through strength?'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the recent phone call between Presidents
      Trump and Putin, highlighting its perceived success in avoiding a breakdown in
      relations and laying groundwork for future ceasefire negotiations, while also
      exploring the complexities of U.S.-Russia relations, Trump's urgency in addressing
      domestic and international pressures, and the potential for escalating military
      actions against Iran amid a backdrop of strategic normalization efforts.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Alastair Crooke discusses the implications
      of the phone call between Presidents Trump and Putin on March 18, which was deemed
      a success for both leaders despite unrealistic Western expectations that it would
      resolve the Ukraine conflict. The conversation highlighted the need for detailed
      negotiations on a ceasefire, which had been overlooked by U.S. officials. Crooke
      notes the contrasting urgency of Trump, who appears eager to push for normalization
      with Russia amid domestic pressures and fears of opposition, and Putin, who is
      cautious and unwilling to rush into a potentially flawed agreement. The article
      also explores Trump's aggressive stance towards Iran, suggesting that his administration
      is preparing for a possible military conflict while attempting to balance his
      support for Israel and the need for a stable Middle East. Crooke raises concerns
      about how these actions could undermine Trump's credibility as a peacemaker and
      complicate relations with Russia and China, questioning whether Trump believes
      that military aggression could ultimately lead to peace.

      Israel is deeply fractured. The schism has become bitter and heated as both sides
      see themselves to be in an existential war for the future of Israel. The language
      used has become so venomous (particularly in reserved channels in Hebrew) that
      calls for a coup and for civil war are far from uncommon.


      Israel is nearing the precipice and the seemingly irreconcilable differences may
      soon erupt into civil unrest – as Uri Misgav writes this week, the “Israeli spring”
      is on its way.


      The point here is that President Trump’s utilitarian and determinedly transactional
      style may work effectively in the secular western hemisphere, but with Israel
      (or Iran) Trump may find little or no traction amongst those with an alternative
      weltanschauung that expresses a fundamental different concept of morality, philosophy
      and epistemology, to the classic western deterrence paradigm of material ‘carrots
      and sticks’.


      Indeed, the very attempt to impose deterrence – and to threaten ‘all hell breaking
      out’ if his injunctions are not followed – may produce the opposite to that which
      he seeks: i.e. it may trigger new conflicts and wars.


      An angry plurality in Israel (led for now, by Netanyahu) have taken the reins
      of powerafter a long march through the institutions of Israeli society, and now
      have their sights focussed on dismantling the ‘Deep State’ within Israel. Equally,
      there is a furious push-back to this perceived take-over.


      What exacerbates this societal fracture are two things: Firstly, it is ethno-cultural;
      and second it is ideological. The third component is the most explosive – Eschatology.


      At the last national election in Israel, the ‘underclass’ finally broke the glass
      ceiling to win election and to take office. The Mizrahi (Jews from the Middle
      East and North Africa) have been long treated as the poorer, lower order in society.


      The Ashkenazi (European, largely liberal-secular Jews) form much of the urban
      professional (and until recently) the security class. These are the élites whom
      the coalition of National Religious and Settler Movement displaced at the last
      election.


      This present phase to a long struggle to power perhaps can be put at 2015. As
      Gadi Taub has recorded,


      “It was then, Israel’s Supreme Court judges removed sovereignty itself—that is,
      the power of final decision over the whole realm of law and politics—from the
      elected branches of government and transferred it to themselves. One unelected
      branch of government officially holds power, against which there are neither checks,
      nor balances, by any counterforce”.


      In the optic of the Right, the self-awarded power of Judicial Review, gave to
      the Court power, Taub writes,


      “to prescribe the rules of the political game – and not just its concrete results”.
      “Law enforcement then became the huge investigative arm of the press. As was true
      of the “Russiagate” hoax, The Israel Police and State Attorney were not so much
      collecting evidence for a criminal trial as they were producing political dirt
      for leaks to the press”.


      The ‘Deep State’ in Israel is a consuming point of contention for Netanyahu and
      his cabinet: In a speech at the Knesset this month – as one example – Netanyahu
      savaged the media, accusing news outlets of “full cooperation with the deep state”
      and of creating “scandals”. “The cooperation between the bureaucracy in the deep
      state and the media didn’t work in the United States, and it won’t work here”,
      he said.


      Just to be clear, at the time of the last general election, the Supreme Court
      was composed of 15 Judges, all of whom were Ashkenazi, bar one Mizrahi.


      Nevertheless, it would be wrong to see the war of the rival blocs as some arcane
      dispute about the usurpation of executive power – and a lost ‘separation of state
      powers’.


      The struggle is rooted rather, in a profound ideological dispute about the future
      and character of the State of Israel. Will it be a messianic, Halacha state obedient
      to Revelation? Or, in essence, will there be a democratic, liberal, largely secular
      ‘state’. Israel is shredding itself on the blade of this debate.


      The cultural component is that the Mizrahim (loosely defined) and the Right view
      the European liberal sphere as barely truly Jewish. Hence their determination
      that the Land of Israel should be wholly immersed in Jewishness.


      It was the events of 7 October that absolutely crystalized this ideological struggle,
      which is the second key factor largely mirroring the general schism.


      Israel’s classical security vision (dating from the Ben-Gurion era) was configured
      to provide an answer to the enduring Israeli dilemma: Israel cannot impose an
      end to conflict on its enemies, yet at the same time, it cannot maintain a large
      army in the long term.


      Therefore, Israel – in this optic – had to rely on a reserve army that needed
      adequate security warning before any war occurred. Advance intelligence warning
      of coming war therefore, was a paramount requirement.


      And that key presumption blew apart on 7 October.


      The shock and sense of collapse arising from 7 Oct led many to think that the
      Hamas attack had irrevocably broken the Israeli concept of security – the policy
      of deterrence had failed and the proof of that was that Hamas was not deterred.


      But here, we approach the crux of the Israeli internal war: What was destroyed
      on 7 Oct was not just the old security paradigm of the Labour Party and the old
      security elites. It did that; but what arose from its ashes was an alternative
      weltanschauung that expressed a fundamentally different concept in philosophy
      and epistemology to the classic deterrence paradigm:


      “I was born in Israel; I grew up in Israel … I served in the IDF”, says Alon Mizrahi;


      “I was exposed to it. I was indoctrinated this way, and for many years of my life
      I believed it. This represents a serious Jewish problem: It is not just [a matter
      of one mode of] Zionism … How can you teach your children – and this is almost
      universal – that everyone who is not Jewish wants to kill you. When you put yourself
      in this paranoia, you give yourself permission to do anything to everyone … It
      is not a good way to create a society. It is so dangerous”.


      See here in the Times of Israel an account of a High School presentation (post-7
      Oct) on the Morality of Wiping out Amalek: A student raises the question: “Why
      do we condemn Hamas for murdering innocent men, women, and children – if we are
      commanded to wipe out Amalek?”


      “How can we have normality tomorrow”, Alon Mizrahi asks, “if this is who we are
      today”?


      The National Religious Right is leading the charge for a radical change to the
      Israeli concept of security; they no longer believe in the classic Ben Gurion
      paradigm of deterrence – particularly in the wake of 7 October. Nor does the Right
      believe in reaching any settlement with the Palestinians – and absolutely does
      not want a bi-national state. In the concept of Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s security
      theory henceforth must include a continuous war against Palestinians – until they
      are expelled or eliminated.


      The Old (Liberal) Establishment is outraged – as one of its members, David Agmon
      (former IDF Brigadier-General and former bureau chief to Netanyahu), articulated
      this week:


      “I accuse you, Bezalel Smotrich, of destroying religious Zionism! You are leading
      us to a state of Halacha and Haredi Zionism, not religious Zionism … Not to mention
      the fact that you joined the terrorist Ben Gvir, who diverts lawbreakers, hillbilly
      boys, to continue breaking the law, who attacks the government, the judicial system,
      and the police under his responsibility. Netanyahu is not the solution. Netanyahu
      is the problem, he is the head of the snake. The protest should act against Netanyahu
      and his coalition. The protest should demand the overthrow of the malicious government”.


      Netanyahu is in one sense secular; but in another, he embraces the Biblical mission
      of Greater Israel – with all its enemies annihilated. He is, (if you like a label)
      a neo-Jabotinskyist (his father was private secretary to Jabotinsky), and, in
      practice, exists in a relationship of mutual dependency with figures like Ben
      Gvir and Smotrich.


      “What do these people want?”, asks Max Blumenthal; “What is their ultimate goal?”


      “It is apocalypse”, warns Blumenthal, whose book Goliath traces the rise of Israel’s
      eschatological Right:


      “They have an eschatology that is based on the Third Temple ideology – in which
      the Al-Aqsa Mosque will be destroyed and be replaced with a Third Temple and traditional
      Jewish ritual will be practiced”.


      And in order to bring that about, they need a ‘Big War’.


      Smotrich always has been frank about this: The project of ultimately removing
      all the Arabs from the ‘Land of Israel’ will require an emergency – a ‘big war’
      – he has said.


      The big question is: Do Trump and his team grasp any of this? For it has profound
      implications for Trump’s methodology of transactional deal-making. ‘Carrots and
      Sticks’ and secular rationality will carry little weight amongst those whose epistemology
      is quite different; those who take Revelation literally as ‘truth’, and who believe
      it commands complete obedience.


      Trump says he wants to end the conflicts in the Middle East, and bring about a
      regional ‘peace’.


      His secular, transactional approach to politics, however, is wholly unsuited to
      resolving eschatological conflict. His bravura style of threatening ‘all hell
      will break out’ if he doesn’t get his way will not work, when one or other party
      actually wants Armageddon.


      “All hell break out”? ‘Bring it on’, might well be the response Trump gets.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the deepening societal fractures in
      Israel, driven by ideological, ethno-cultural, and eschatological divides, particularly
      in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack, which has led to a radical shift in
      security paradigms and a potential for civil unrest, while also highlighting the
      challenges of applying a transactional approach to peace by figures like Trump
      in the face of such complex and divergent worldviews.
    paragraph_summary: The article by Alastair Crooke discusses the deepening societal
      fractures within Israel, where a bitter ideological schism has emerged between
      the Mizrahi and Ashkenazi populations, exacerbated by the recent Hamas attack
      on October 7, which shattered the traditional security paradigm and intensified
      calls for a radical shift in Israel's approach to conflict. The current leadership,
      primarily represented by Netanyahu and the National Religious Right, seeks to
      dismantle what they perceive as a 'Deep State' and advocate for a more messianic,
      Halacha-based state, rejecting the liberal, secular vision of Israel's future.
      This ideological battle is not merely a political struggle but is rooted in profound
      cultural and eschatological beliefs, with some factions openly desiring a 'Big
      War' to achieve their goals. Crooke argues that former President Trump's transactional
      approach to diplomacy may be ill-suited to navigate these complex dynamics, as
      it fails to resonate with those who hold a fundamentally different worldview that
      prioritizes religious and existential imperatives over material negotiations.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      President Trump wants Ukraine settled, full stop. This is so that he can move
      ahead quickly – to normalise with Russia, and begin the ‘big picture’ project
      of setting a new World Order, one that will end wars and facilitate business ties.


      The point here – which Europe feigns to not understand – is that the end to the
      Ukraine conflict simply is Trump’s ‘gateway’ to the entire rationale and platform
      on which he stood: The Great Reset of the Geo-Political landscape. Ukraine, simply
      said, is the obstacle to Trump’s pursuit of his primordial objective: The Global
      Reset.


      Starmer, Macron and the eastern wing of the Euro-élites are blind to the sheer
      scale of the global vibe-shift towards traditionalist U.S. politics and ethics.
      They miss too, the barely concealed fury in the Trump world that exists behind
      this nascent revolution. “The Maga Right has none of the inhibitions of its predecessors.
      It is planning to leverage the power of a recaptured state to annihilate its enemies”,
      Allister Heath writes.


      The European Ruling Class is in desperate trouble and increasingly isolated, in
      a world shifting ‘Rightward’ at breakneck speed. “The U.S. is now the enemy of
      the West”, the FT proclaims. European leaders wantonly won’t understand.


      The reality is that the U.S. is engaged now in rolling up Europe’s foreign policy.
      And, is about to start exporting U.S. traditional Republican values to roll up
      the European wokeist belief-system. The European Ruling strata – far removed from
      its base – has failed to grasp the threat to its own interests (a scenario outlined
      here).


      The Trump administration is trying to rebuild the ailing Republic, and Americans
      in this new era do not care for the European obsession with ancient feuds and
      their entailing wars.


      Trump reportedly views with utter disdain the UK and European boast that should
      the U.S. not do it, then Europe will. The Brussels class claims to be able still
      – after three years of losing in Ukraine – to be able to inflict a humiliating
      defeat on President Putin.


      More profoundly, however, Team Trump – committed to the task of taking down the
      American Deep State as the ‘inexorable enemy’ – perceives (rightly) the British
      security state to be co-joined at the hip with their American counterparts, as
      a part of its global meta-structure. And its oldest and deepest component has
      always been the destruction of Russia, and its dismemberment.


      So when Macron, in an address to the nation this week, rejected a ceasefire in
      Ukraine and declared that “peace in Europe is only possible with a weakened Russia”,
      calling the country a direct threat to France and the continent, many in ‘Trump
      world’ will interpret this defiant declaration (that ‘Ukraine defeating Russia
      is preferable to ‘peace’’) is nothing more than Macron and Starmer ventriloquising
      the aims of the Meta Deep State.


      This notion is lent substance by the sudden plethora of articles appearing in
      the European-(managed) MSM to the effect that Russia’s economy is much weaker
      than it appears and might collapse in the next year. Of course it is nonsense.
      This is about managing the European public to believe that keeping the war going
      in Ukraine is a ‘good idea’.


      The absurdity of the European position was perhaps best captured, as Wolfgang
      Münchau notes, in its full hubris last year by the historian and writer Anne Applebaum
      when she won a prestigious German peace prize. During her acceptance speech, she
      maintained that victory was more important than peace, asserting that the West’s
      ultimate goal should be regime change in Russia: “We must help Ukrainians achieve
      victory, and not only for the sake of Ukraine,” she said.


      Zelensky and his European fans want ‘to negotiate’ – though later, rather than
      sooner (perhaps in a year, as one European Foreign Minister reportedly told Marco
      Rubio privately).


      “This”, Münchau writes, “is what the very public disagreement in the Oval Office
      [last week] was all about. Peace through untrammelled victory — essentially the
      Second World War model — as the lens through which virtually all European leaders,
      and most commentators view the Russia-Ukraine conflict”.


      America sees things differently: It views almost certainly the European Deep State
      to be putting a spoke into Trump’s ‘normalisation with Russia’ wheel – a normalisation
      to which they are viscerally opposed. Or, at the very least, as the Europeans
      chasing a “mirage that no longer exists, stubbornly hiking ‘tax and spend’, whilst
      doubling down on mass immigration and overpriced energy, oblivious to the flashing
      red lights in the [financial markets] as government debt yields rocket to their
      highest levels since 1998”, as Allister Heath outlines.


      In other words, the suggestion is that Friedrich Merz, Macron and Starmer are
      talking about how they are going to turn around their countries – via a massive
      infusion of debt – into defence superstates. Yet, at some level of consciousness,
      they must realise that it is not doable, so they settle instead for presenting
      themselves as ‘world leaders on the international stage’.


      The European élites are deeply unstable ‘leaders’ who are risking the prosperity
      and stability of the continent. It is clear these countries do not have the military
      capacity to intervene in any concerted manner. More than anything, it is the European
      economy circling the drain that is the reality at the gates.


      Zelensky is accomplice to the European insistence that defeating Russia takes
      priority over achieving peace in Ukraine, in spite of lacking any strategic rationale
      as to how it may be achieved after three years of a worsening military situation.
      Both plans – crushing the Russian economy with sanctions and attrition of the
      Russian military to the point of collapse – have failed. Why then does Zelensky
      resist Trump’s peace proposals? On the surface, it makes no sense.


      The explanation likely goes back to the post-Maidan era when the western ‘Meta
      Security State’ (principally, the British and the Americans) entrenched hardline
      Banderites (then a tiny minority) into the Ukrainian Police, Intelligence and
      Security State. They are still today the controlling force. Even were this faction
      to acknowledge that their war cannot be won, they understand what happens if they
      lose:


      Russia will not deal with them. They view them as extremists (if not war criminals)
      who are in no way ‘agreement capable’ and must be replaced by a leadership who
      is actually capable of compromise. Russia would likely pursue and bring these
      men to trial. Zelensky has to be frightened at what the Banderites might do to
      him (despite his British team of bodyguards).


      Well, Trump is not entertaining these European ‘games’: He is administering a
      slap-down to Zelensky and European leaders, perhaps bringing Zelensky into line;
      or perhaps not … Team Trump, Politico reports, has now entered into direct talks
      with the Ukrainian opposition on holding early elections to unseat Zelensky –
      who is on his way to being removed, members of Team Trump say.


      Zelensky may be finished, but interestingly Zaluzhniy wasn’t discussed either.
      He is being groomed by the British as a replacement – it looks like the Americans
      are going to make this decision independently of the British, too.


      President Trump has ordered intelligence sharing with Ukraine stopped. What he
      technically did was to stop allowing Ukraine to use exclusive U.S. targeting systems
      controlled by U.S. Intelligence, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office and
      the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. What has been suspended is the
      exchange of so-called ‘lethal’ data, including information for HIMARS targeting.
      However, the defensive information needed for protection is still being provided
      to Ukraine.


      “The extent of the intelligence-sharing freeze, which appears to have been imposed
      alongside the halt in military aid Mr Trump announced on Monday, initially appeared
      to be somewhat limited … But by Wednesday afternoon it became clear that the Trump
      administration, ignoring overtures from Mr Zelensky the previous evening, had
      gone much further. A military intelligence officer in Kyiv told The Telegraph
      that the freeze amounted to “more or less a total blackout””.


      Put bluntly, the earlier munitions freeze will undoubtedly affect Ukraine’s military
      abilities over time, however the impact might not be felt for some weeks. The
      loss of vital intelligence, however, will make its mark immediately. It will –
      simply put – blind Ukraine. In Ukrainian command posts, the battle tracking and
      satellite online feeds on tablets and TV screens have indeed been disconnected.


      What Trump’s slap-down has done is to puncture the fiction that Ukraine is able
      to defend itself with a little substitute of European support. That has always
      been nonsensical bravado. NATO, the CIA and the global Intelligence Community
      have been in control of the war fighting from the outset. And that, for now, has
      been switched off.


      So, Europe wants to shoulder the U.S. burden? Bloomberg reports that European
      bond markets are in meltdown. If Europe pretends to replace the U.S., it is going
      to be extremely expensive, very politically costly, and it will fail.'
    one_sentence_summary: President Trump aims to resolve the Ukraine conflict to facilitate
      a normalization with Russia and advance his vision for a new global order, while
      European leaders remain oblivious to the shifting political landscape and the
      implications of their stance on the war.
    paragraph_summary: In his article, Alastair Crooke argues that President Trump seeks
      to resolve the Ukraine conflict as a means to normalize relations with Russia
      and advance his vision of a new global order, which he believes would end wars
      and enhance business ties. Crooke contends that European leaders, such as Macron
      and Starmer, fail to recognize the significant shift towards traditionalist U.S.
      politics and the growing frustration within Trump's base regarding the ongoing
      conflict in Ukraine. He suggests that the European ruling class is increasingly
      isolated and disconnected from its populace, clinging to outdated foreign policy
      strategies that prioritize defeating Russia over achieving peace. The article
      highlights Trump's recent actions, including halting intelligence sharing with
      Ukraine, which could severely impact Ukraine's military capabilities, indicating
      a shift in U.S. involvement and a potential move towards supporting a change in
      Ukrainian leadership. Ultimately, Crooke posits that Europe's attempts to assert
      its own foreign policy in the face of U.S. disengagement are misguided and unsustainable.

      They (the Euro-élites) don’t have a chance: “If Trump imposes this tariff [25%],
      the U.S. will be in a serious trade conflict with the EU”, the Norwegian Prime
      Minister threatens. And what if Brussels does retaliate?


      “They can try, but they can’t”, Trump responded. Von der Leyen has, however, already
      promised that she will retaliate. Nonetheless, the combined suite of the Anglo
      administrative forces is still unlikely to compel Trump to put U.S. military troops
      on the ground in Ukraine to protect European interests (and investments!).


      The reality is that every European NATO member – to varying degrees of self-embarrassment
      – admits publicly now that none of them want to participate in securing Ukraine
      without having U.S. military troops provide ‘backstop’ to those European forces.
      This is a palpably obvious scheme to inveigle Trump into continuing the Ukraine
      war – as is Macron and Starmer’s dangling of the mineral deal to try to trick
      Trump to recommit to the Ukraine war. Trump plainly sees through these ploys.


      The fly in the ointment, however, is that Zelensky seemingly fears a ceasefire,
      more than he fears losing further ground on the battlefield. He too, seems to
      need the war to continue (to preserve continuing in power, possibly).


      Trump calling time on the Ukraine war that has been lost has seemingly caused
      European elites to enter some form of cognitive dissonance. Of course, it has
      been clear for some time that Ukraine would not retake its 1991 borders, nor force
      Russia into a negotiating position weak enough for the West to be able to dictate
      its own cessation terms.


      As Adam Collingwood writes:


      “Trump has torn a huge rip in the interface layer of the fantasy bubble … the
      governing élite [in the wake of Trump’s pivot] can see not just an electoral setback,
      but rather a literal catastrophe. A defeat in war, with [Europe] left largely
      defenceless; a de-industrialising economy; crumbling public services and infrastructure;
      large fiscal deficits; stagnating living standards; social and ethnic disharmony
      – and a powerful populist insurgency led by enemies just as grave as Trump and
      Putin in the Manichean struggle against vestiges of liberal times – and strategically
      sandwiched between two leaders that both despise and disdain them …”.


      “In other words, through the tear in the fantasy bubble, Europe’s elites see their
      own demise …”.


      “Anybody who could see reality knew that things would only get worse on the war
      front from autumn 2023, but from their fantasy bubble, our élites couldn’t see
      it. Vladimir Putin, like the ‘Deplorables’ and ‘Gammons’ at home, was an atavistic
      daemon who would inevitably be slain on the inexorable march to liberal progressive
      utopia”.


      Many in the Euro ruling-strata clearly are furious. Yet what can Britain or Germany
      actually do? It has quickly become clear that European states do not have the
      military capacity to intervene in Ukraine in any concerted manner. But more than
      anything, as Conor Gallagher points out, it is the European economy, circling
      the drain – largely as a result of the war against Russia – that is dragging reality
      to the forefront.


      The new German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has shown himself to be the most implacable
      European leader advocating both military expansion and youth conscription – in
      what amounts to an European resistance model mounted to confront Trump’s pivot
      to Russia.


      Yet Merz’s winning CDU/CSU achieved only 28% of votes cast, whilst losing significant
      voter share. Hardly an outstanding mandate for confronting both Russia – and America
      – together!


      “I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of EU states
      and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible,
      so that we achieve independence from the U.S., step by step”, Friedrich Merz said.


      Second place in the German election was taken by the Alternative for Germany (AfD)
      with 20% of the national vote. The party was the top vote getter in the 25-45
      year-old demographic. It supports good relations with Russia, an end to the Ukraine
      war, and it wants to work with Team Trump, too.


      Yet AfD absurdly is outcast under the ‘firewall rules’. As a ‘populist’ party
      with a strong youth vote, it becomes automatically relegated to the ‘wrong side’
      of the EU firewall. Merz has already refused to share power with them, leaving
      the CDU as pig-in-the-middle, squeezed between the failing SPD, which lost the
      most voter share, and the AfD and Der Linke, another firewall outcast, which,
      like AfD, gained voter share, especially among the under-45s.


      The rub here – and it is a big one – is that the AfD and the Left Party, Der Linke
      (8.8%), which was the top vote getter in the 18-24 demographic, are both anti-war.
      Together these two have more than one third of the votes in parliament – a blocking
      minority for many important votes, especially for constitutional changes.


      This will be a big headache for Merz, as Wolfgang Münchau explains:


      “For one thing, the new Chancellor had wanted to travel to the NATO summit this
      June, with a strong commitment to higher defence spending. And even though the
      Left Party and the AfD hate each other in every other respect, they agree that
      they won’t give Merz the money to strengthen the Bundeswehr. More important, though,
      is the fact that they won’t support a reform to the constitutional fiscal rules
      (the debt brake) that Merz and the SPD are desperate for”.


      The Rules are complicated, but in gist dictate that if Germany wants to spend
      more money on defence and aid to Ukraine, it had to be saved from elsewhere in
      the budget (most likely from social spending). But politically, saving on social
      spending to pay for Ukraine hasn’t played well with the German electorate. The
      last coalition failed on precisely this issue.


      Even with the Greens, Merz still will be short of the two-thirds majority necessary
      to make constitutional changes, and the ‘Centre’ just doesn’t have the fiscal
      space for challenging Russia without U.S. funding. Von der Leyen will try to ‘magic’
      money for defence from somewhere, “but German youth are voting against the Establishment
      parties who are hated. They can build a few Leopards if they want. They won’t
      get recruits”.


      Whilst the EU and Britain are proposing to raise billions to arm themselves against
      some imaginary Russian invasion, it will be done against the backdrop of Trump
      saying explicitly – on the threat of a Russian invasion of NATO – “I don’t believe
      that; I don’t believe it, not one little bit”.


      Another Euro-shibboleth ripped by Trump.


      Thus, how will the European public, which has largely soured on the Ukraine war,
      react to higher energy costs and more tax and social service cuts, in order to
      pursue an unwinnable war in Ukraine? Starmer already has been warned that the
      (government debt) ‘bond vigilantes’ will react badly to yet more UK government
      debt as the fiscal situation wobbles precariously.


      There are no obvious solutions to Europe’s current predicament: It is, on one
      hand, an existential conundrum for Merz. And on the other, it is the same one
      that dogs the EU as a whole: To get anything done, a parliamentary majority is
      a basic necessity.


      The ‘firewall’, though primordially intended to protect the ‘Centrists’ in Brussels
      from Rightist ‘populists’, was subsequently turbo-charged in Brussels by Biden’s
      issuing of a foreign policy determination to all U.S. foreign policy ‘actors’
      to the effect that populism was a ‘threat to democracy’ and must be contested.


      The practical outcome however, has been that across the EU, blocking coalitions
      were formed of odd (minority party) bed-fellows agreeing to keep the Centrists
      in power, but which rather has led to endless stasis and an ever increasing detachment
      from ‘we, the people’.


      Angela Merkel governed in this way, kicking the can of reform down the road for
      years – until the situation ultimately became (and still is) insoluble.


      “Can another coalition of short-sighted centrists arrest the decline of the economy,
      fix the failure of leadership, and free the nation from its pernicious political
      trap? I think we know the answer”, writes Wolfgang Münchau.


      There lies a bigger problem however: As Vance very explicitly warned at the recent
      Munich Security Forum, Europe’s enemy lies not with Russia; It lies within. It
      derives, Vance implied, from the fact of having a permanent bureaucracy, assuming
      to itself the exclusive prerogative of autonomous governing power, yet incrementally
      becoming ever-more remote from its own base.


      Tear down the firewalls, Vance advocated, in order to return to the (abandoned)
      principles of that earlier democracy originally shared between the U.S. and Europe.
      Implicitly, Vance is targeting the Brussels Administrative (Deep) State.


      The Eurocrats see in this new front an alternate American-supported attack on
      their Administrative State – and perceive therein their own demise.


      In the U.S., there is acknowledgement that there is an “institutional resistance
      to Trump” in the DOD, DOJ and the FBI. It proves, Margot Cleveland argues, that
      those touting the need for “institutional resistance” and the supposed independence
      from the executive branch, are the opponents to democracy – and to Trump.


      Given the close nexus between the U.S., the British and European Deep States,
      the question arises as to why there is such strong parallel resistance to Trump
      amongst European leaders also.


      Ostensibly, it is not in Europe’s interest to mount a concerted resistance against
      the U.S. President over a failed war. Is the European frenzy then fuelled by a
      wider (U.S.) Deep State desire to neuter the ‘Trump Revolution’ by demonstrating,
      in addition to the U.S. domestic opposition at home, that Trump is causing havoc
      amongst the U.S.’ European allies? Is Europe being pushed further down this path
      than they would otherwise have chosen to venture?


      For Germany to change course – albeit unthinkable for Merz – it would require
      only a minimal amount of imagination to envision Germany again linked to Eurasia.
      The AfD gained 20% of the vote on just such a platform. Really, there probably
      is little other option.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the European elites' struggle to navigate
      the geopolitical landscape shaped by Trump's policies, particularly regarding
      the Ukraine war, revealing their fears of military inadequacy and economic decline,

    paragraph_summary: In the context of rising tensions between the U.S. and the EU,
      particularly regarding trade tariffs and military involvement in Ukraine, Alastair
      Crooke discusses the precarious position of European leaders as they grapple with
      the implications of Trump’s policies. The article highlights the reluctance of
      European NATO members to engage in military actions in Ukraine without U.S. support,
      revealing a broader cognitive dissonance among European elites who are increasingly
      aware of their declining power and the unsustainable nature of the ongoing conflict.
      The political landscape in Germany is shifting, with the rise of the Alternative
      for Germany (AfD), which advocates for better relations with Russia and an end
      to the Ukraine war, complicating Chancellor Friedrich Merz's efforts to strengthen
      military capabilities amid a faltering economy. Crooke argues that the EU's bureaucratic
      structure and the influence of the U.S. Deep State contribute to a stasis that
      prevents effective governance, leaving Europe vulnerable to internal and external
      challenges while facing a potential crisis of legitimacy and public support for
      continued military engagement.

      Pivots In US Policy – OpEd'

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      The bits are falling into a distinct pattern – a pre-prepared pattern.


      Defence Secretary Hegseth at the Munich Security Conference gave us four ‘noes’:
      No to Ukraine in NATO; No to a return to pre-2014 borders; No to ‘Article 5’ peacekeeper
      backstops, and ‘No’ to U.S. troops in Ukraine. And in a final flourish, he added
      that U.S. troops in Europe are not ‘forever’ – and even placed a question mark
      over the continuity of NATO.


      Pretty plain speaking! The U.S. clearly is cutting away from Ukraine. And they
      intend to normalise relations with Russia.


      Then, Vice-President Vance threw his fire cracker amongst the gathered Euro-élites.
      He said that the élites had retreated from “shared” democratic values; they were
      overly reliant on repressing and censoring their peoples (prone to locking them
      up); and, above all, he excoriated the European Cordon Sanitaire (‘firewall’)
      by which European parties outside the Centre-Left are deemed non-grata politically:
      It’s a fake ‘threat’, he suggested. Of what are you really so frightened? Have
      you so little confidence in your ‘democracy’?


      The U.S., he implied, will no longer support Europe if it continues to suppress
      political constituencies, arrest citizens for speech offenses, and particularly
      cancel elections as was done recently in Romania. “If you’re running in fear of
      your own voters”, Vance said, “there is nothing America can do for you”.


      Ouch! Vance had hit them where it hurts.


      It is difficult to say what specifically most triggered the catatonic European
      breakdown: Was it the fear of the U.S. and Russia joining together as a major
      power nexus – thus stripping Europe from ever again being able glide along on
      the back of American power, through the specious notion that any European state
      must have exceptional access to the Washington ‘ear’?


      Or was it the ending of the Ukraine/Zelensky cult which was so prized amongst
      the Euro-élite as the ‘glue’ around which a faux European unity and identity could
      be enforced? Both probably contributed to the fury.


      That the U.S. would in essence leave Europe to their own delusions would be a
      calamitous event for the Brussels technocracy.


      Many may lazily assume that the U.S. double act at Munich was just another example
      of the well-known Trumpian fondness for dropping ‘wacky’ initiatives intended
      to both shock and kickover frozen paradigms. The Munich speeches did exactly that
      all right! Yet that does not make them accidental; but rather parts that fit into
      a bigger picture.


      It is clear now that the Trump blitzkrieg across the American Administrative State
      could not have been mounted unless carefully pre-planned and prepared over the
      last four years.


      Trump’s flurry of Presidential Executive Orders at the outset of his Presidency
      were not whimsical. Leading U.S. constitutional lawyer, Johnathan Turley, and
      other lawyers saythat the Orders were well drafted legally and with the clear
      understanding that legal challenges would ensue. What’s more, that Trump Team
      welcome those challenges.


      What is going on? The newly confirmed head of the Office of Budget Management
      (OBM), Russ Vought, says his Office will become the “on/off switch” for all Executive
      expenditure under the new Executive Orders. Vought calls the resulting whirlpool,
      the application of Constitutional radicalism. And Trump has now issued the Executive
      Order that reinstates the primacy of the Executive as the controlling mechanism
      of government.


      Vaught, who was in OBM in Trump 01, is carefully selecting the ground for all-out
      financial war on the Deep State. It will be fought out firstly at the Supreme
      Court – which the Trump Team expect confidently to win (Trump has the 6-3 conservative
      majority). The new régime will then be applied across all agencies and departments
      of state. Expect shrieks of pain.


      The point here is that the Administrative State – aloof from executive control
      – has taken to itself prerogatives such as immunity to dismissal and the self-awarded
      authority to shape policy – creating a dual state system, run by unelected technocrats,
      which, when implanted in departments such as Justice and the Pentagon, have evolved
      into the American Deep State.


      Article Two of the Constitution however, says very bluntly: Executive power shall
      be vested in the U.S. President (with no ifs or buts at all.) Trump intends for
      his Administration to recover that lost Executive power. It was, in fact, lost
      long ago. Trump is re-claiming too, the Executive’s right to dismiss ‘servants
      of the State’, and to ‘switch off’ wasteful expenditure at his discretion, as
      part of a unitary executive prerequisite.


      Of course, the Administrative State is fighting back. Turley’s article is headlined:
      They Are Taking Away Everything We Have: Democrats and Unions Launch Existential
      Fight. Their aim has been to cripple the Trump initiative through using politicised
      judges to issue restraint orders. Many mainstream lawyers believe Trump’s Unitary
      Executive claim to be illegal. The question is whether Congress can stand up Agencies
      designed to act independently of the President; and how does that square with
      the separation of powers and Article Two that vests unqualified executive power
      with one sole elected official – the U.S. President.


      How did the Democrats not see this coming? Lawyer Robert Barnes essentially says
      that the ‘blitzkrieg’ was “exceptionally well-planned” and had been discussed
      in Trump circles since late 2020. The latter team had emerged from within a generational
      and cultural shift in the U.S.. This latter had given rise to a Libertarian/Populist
      wing with working class roots who often had served in the military, yet had come
      to despise the Neo-con lies (especially those of 9/11) that brought endless wars.
      They were animated more by the old John Adams adage that ‘America should not go
      abroad in search of monsters to slay’.


      In short, they were not part of the WASP ‘Anglo’ world; they came from a different
      Culture that harked back to the theme of America as Republic, not as Empire. This
      is what you see with Vance and Hegseth – a reversion to the Republican precept
      that the U.S. should not become involved in European wars. Ukraine is not America’s
      war.


      The Deep State, it seems, were not paying attention to what a posse of ‘populist’
      outliers, tucked away from the rarefied Beltway talking shop, were up to: They
      (the outliers) were planning a concerted attack on the Federal expenditure spigot
      – identified as the weak spot about which a Constitutional challenge could be
      mounted that would derail – in its entirety – the expenditures of the Deep State.


      It seems that one aspect to the surprise has been the Trump Team’s discipline:
      ‘no leaks’. And secondly, that those involved in the planning are not drawn from
      the preeminent Anglo-sphere, but rather from a strand of society that was offended
      by the Iraq war and which blames the ‘Anglo-sphere’ for ‘ruining’ America.


      So Vance’s speech at Munich was not disruptive – merely for the sake of being
      disruptive; he was, in fact, encouraging the audience to recall early Republican
      Values. This was what is meant by his complaint that Europe had turned away from
      “our shared values” – i.e. the values that animated Americans seeking escape from
      the tyranny, prejudices and corruption of the Old World. Vance was (quite politely)
      chiding the Euro-élites for backsliding to old European vices.


      Vance implicitly was hinting too, that European conservative libertarians should
      emulate Trump and act to slough-off their ‘Administrative States’, and recover
      control over executive power. Tear down the firewalls, he advised.


      Why? Because he likely views the ‘Brussels’ Technocratic State as nothing other
      than a pure offshoot to the American Deep State – and therefore very likely to
      try to torpedo and sink Trump’s initiative to normalise relations with Moscow.


      If these were Vance’s instincts, he was right. Macron almost immediately summoned
      an ‘emergency meeting’ of ‘the war party’ in Paris to consider how to frustrate
      the American initiative. It failed however, descending reportedly into quarrelling
      and acrimony.


      It transpired that Europe could not gather a ‘sharp-end’ military force greater
      than 20,-000-30,000 men. Scholtz objected in principle to their involvement; Poland
      demurred as a close neighbour of Ukraine; and Italy stayed silent. Starmer, however,
      after Munich, immediately rang Zelensky to say that Britain saw Ukraine to be
      on an irrevocable path to NATO membership – thus directly contradicting U.S. policy
      and with no support from other states. Trump will not forget this, nor will he
      forget Britain’s former role in supporting the Russiagate slur during his first
      term in office.


      The meeting did however, underline Europe’s divisions and impotence. Europe has
      been sidelined and their self-esteem is badly bruised. The U.S. would in essence
      leave Europe to their own delusions, which would be calamitous for the Brussels
      autocracy.


      Yet, far more consequential than most of the happenings of the past few days was
      when Trump, speaking with Fox News, after attending Daytona, dismissed Zelensky’s
      canard of Russia wanting to invade NATO countries. “I don’t agree with that; not
      even a little bit”, Trump retorted.


      Trump does not buy into the primary lie intended as the glue which holds this
      entire EU geo-political structure together. For, without the ‘Russia threat’;
      without the U.S. believing in the globalist linchpin lie, there can be no pretence
      of Europe needing to prepare for war with Russia. Europe ultimately will have
      to come to reconcile its future as a periphery in Eurasia.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the U.S. government's apparent shift
      away from supporting Ukraine and its implications for Europe, highlighting Defense
      Secretary Hegseth's and Vice-President Vance's remarks at the Munich Security
      Conference that signal a potential normalization of relations with Russia and
      a critique of European political practices, while also outlining Trump's strategic
      plans to reclaim executive power and challenge the Deep State in the U.S. government.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent analysis, Alastair Crooke discusses the implications
      of U.S. Defense Secretary Hegseth's statements at the Munich Security Conference,
      which signaled a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding Ukraine and
      NATO, indicating a potential normalization of relations with Russia. Vice-President
      Vance criticized European elites for suppressing democratic values and warned
      that the U.S. would not support Europe if it continued to stifle political dissent.
      This reflects a broader trend of the Trump administration's efforts to reclaim
      executive power and challenge the entrenched "Deep State," which has operated
      independently of presidential control. Crooke suggests that the U.S. is distancing
      itself from European conflicts, particularly the Ukraine crisis, and that this
      could lead to a recalibration of Europe's geopolitical stance, forcing it to confront
      its diminished role on the global stage. The article highlights the fractures
      within Europe and the potential consequences of U.S. disengagement, as well as
      the ideological shift within American politics towards a more isolationist approach.

      How to do the impossible? America is instinctively an expansionist power, needing
      new fields to conquer; new financial horizons to master and to exploit. The U.S.
      is built that way. Always was.


      But – if you are Trump, wanting to withdraw from wars on the empire’s periphery,
      yet nonetheless wanting too, to cast a shiny image of a muscular America expanding
      and leading global politics and finance – how to do it?


      Well, President Trump – ever the showman – has a solution. Disdain the now-discredited
      intellectual ideology of muscular American global hegemony; suggest rather, that
      these earlier ‘forever wars’ should never really have been ‘our wars’; and, as
      Alon Mizrahi has advanced and suggested, set about re-colonising that which was
      already colonised: Canada; Greenland; Panama – and Europe too, of course.


      America thus will be bigger; Trump will act with decisive muscularity (i.e. as
      in Colombia); make a big ‘show’ of things, but at the same time, shrink the mainstream
      U.S. security interest to centre on the Western Hemisphere. As Trump keeps observing,
      Americans live in the ‘western hemisphere’, not in the Middle East or elsewhere.


      Trump thus attempts to detach from the American expansionist war periphery – ‘the
      outside’ – to proclaim that the ‘inside’ (i.e. the western hemisphere’s sphere),
      has become bigger and is unquestionably American. And that is what matters.


      It is a big shift, yet it has the virtue of beginning to be recognized by many
      Americans as a more accurate reflection of reality. America’s instinct remains
      expansionary (that doesn’t change), but many Americans advocate a focus on American
      domestic needs, and its ‘near neighbourhood’.


      Mizrahi calls this inside-out adjustment ‘self-cannibalisation’: Europe is part
      of the western sphere of interest.Indeed, ‘Europe’ regards itself as its progenitor,
      yet the Trump team has set about re-colonising it – albeit in a Trump vein.


      Robert Cooper, a senior British diplomat sent to Brussels, famously in 2002 coined
      the term liberal imperialism as Europe’s new purpose. It was to be imperialism
      of soft-power. Yet, still Cooper couldn’t quite let go of European ‘old empire
      orientalism’, writing:


      “The challenge to the postmodern world is to get used to the idea of double standards.
      Among ourselves, we operate on the basis of laws and open cooperative security.
      But when dealing with more old-fashioned kinds of states outside the postmodern
      continent of Europe, we need to revert to the rougher methods of an earlier era
      – force, pre-emptive attack, deception, whatever is necessary to deal with those
      who still live in the nineteenth century world of every state for itself. Among
      ourselves however, we keep the law: But when we are operating in the jungle, we
      must also use the laws of the jungle”.


      Cooper’s world-view was influential in the thinking of Tony Blair, as well as
      in the development of European Security and Defence Policy.


      The EU élite however, began optimistically to see itself as having top-table (real)
      ‘empire’ status (global clout),based on its regulatory control of a market of
      400 million consumers. It didn’t work. The EU had adopted the Obama stratagem
      that promised a ‘mind control’ framework which asserts that reality can be ‘created’
      through managed narrative.


      Europeans were never properly told that an EU trans-national empire implied (and
      required) the relinquishment of their sovereign parliamentary decision-making.
      They imagined, rather, that they were joining a free-trade area. Instead, they
      were being taken to an EU identity through stealth and the careful management
      of a confected EU ‘reality’.


      That European liberal empire aspiration – in the wake of the Trump cultural assault
      in Davos – looks very passé. The atmospherics hint rather at the passage from
      one cultural zeitgeist to another.


      Elon Musk seems to be tasked with tipping Germany and Britain out from the old
      worldview and into the new. This is important for the Trump agenda, as these two
      states are the primary agitators for war to sustain a global – rather than a western
      hemisphere – primacy. Europe’s decision-making failures over the last years, however,
      makes Europe an obvious target to a President determined on radical cultural change.


      There is precedent for Trump’s Inside-Out ploy: Old Rome too, withdrew from its
      peripheral imperial provinces to concentrate on its core, when distant wars drained
      too many resources at the centre, and its army was being outmatched in the Field.
      Rome would never openly admit to the retreat.


      Which takes us back to today’s ‘radical Inside-Out solution’: It seems to consist
      of ‘go like a demented whirlwind’ domestically – which is what matters most to
      his base – and, in the international sphere, project confusion and unpredictability.
      Continue repeating the ancient régime’s ideological shibboleths and counter-factual
      statistics, but then brace it up with occasional contrarian throw-away comments
      (such as saying in reference to the Gaza ceasefire that it is ‘their [Israel’s]
      war’, and that Israel’s interests may not always be those of the U.S., and, seemingly
      as an aside – that Putin may have already made up his mind ‘not to make a deal’
      on Ukraine).


      Dissing Putin as a loser in Ukraine perhaps was more addressed to the U.S. Senate
      and its ongoing confirmation hearings. Trump made these comments days before Tulsi
      Gabbard faces Senate hearings. Gabbard already is criticised by U.S. ‘hawks’ for
      allegedly holding ‘pro-Putin’ sentiments, as well as being subjected to a media
      slur campaign by the deep state.


      Was Trump’s apparent disrespect toward Putin and Russia (which caused anger in
      Russia) said primarily for the ears of U.S. Senators? (The Senate is home to some
      of the most ardent ‘never-Trumpers’).


      And were Trump’s egregious comments about ‘cleansing’ Gaza’s Palestinians to Egypt
      or Jordan (co-ordinated with Netanyahu, according to an Israeli Minister) intended
      primarily for the ears of the Israeli Right? According to that Minister, the issue
      of encouraging voluntary Palestinian migration is now back on the agenda, just
      as the Right-wing parties have long wanted – and many in Netanyahu’s Likud had
      hoped. Music to their ears.


      Was it then a Trumpian pre-emptive move, designed to save Netanyahu’s government
      from imminent collapse over the ceasefire’s second-stage, and the threat of a
      walk-out by his Right Wing contingent? Was Trump’s target audience in this case
      then Ministers Ben Gvir and Smotrich?


      Trump pointedly confuses us – by never making it clear to which audience he is
      addressing his ruminations at any one time.


      Is there nonetheless some substance sedimented within Trump’s comment that any
      Palestinian state must be resolved ‘in some other way’ than the Two-State formula?
      Maybe. We should not discount Trump’s strong leanings towards Israel.


      Netanyahu faces harsh criticism for mis-handling both the Gaza and Lebanese ceasefires.
      He has been guilty of promising one thing to one party and the opposite to the
      other (an old vice): He has promised the Right a return to war in Gaza, yet committed
      to the unequivocal end to war in the actual ceasefire agreement. In Lebanon, Israel
      was committed to withdrawal by 26 January on the one hand, yet its military is
      still there, provoking a human wave of Lebanese returning to the south, hoping
      to reclaim their homes.


      Consequently, Netanyahu at this juncture is utterly dependent on Trump. The PM’s
      wiles will not be enough to get him off the hooks: Trump has him where he wants
      him. Trump will get ceasefires, and will tell Netanyahu,no attack on Iran (at
      least until Trump has explored the possibility of a deal with Tehran).


      With Putin and with Russia, the opposite is the case. Trump there has no leverage
      (the favourite word in Washington). He has no leverage for four reasons:


      Firstly, since Russia steadfastly refuses the idea of any compromise that “boils
      down to freezing the conflict along the line of engagement, that will give time
      to the U.S. and NATO to rearm the remnants of the Ukrainian army – and then start
      a new round of hostilities”.


      Secondly, because Moscow’s conditions for ending the war will prove to be unacceptable
      to Washington, as they would not be susceptible to being presented as an American
      ‘win’.


      Thirdly, because Russia holds the clear military advantage: Ukraine is about to
      lose this war. Major Ukrainian strongholds are now being taken by Russian forces
      without resistance. This ultimately will lead to a cascade effect. Ukraine may
      cease to exist if serious negotiations do not take place before summer, the head
      of the Ukrainian Military Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov recently warned.


      But fourthly, because history is not reflected at all in the word leverage. When
      peoples who occupy the same geography have different and often irreconcilable
      versions of history, the western transactional ‘split the power spectrum’ simply
      doesn’t work. The opposed sides will not be moved – unless some solution recognises
      and takes account of their history.


      The U.S. needs to always to ‘win’. So does Trump understand that the ineluctable
      dynamics of this war militate against presenting any transactional outcome as
      a clear ‘win’ for the U.S.? Of course he does (or will do, when professionally
      briefed by his team).


      The logic of the Ukraine situation, to be blunt, suggests that President Putin
      should quietly advise President Trump to walk away from the Ukraine conflict –
      to avoid taking ownership of a western débacle.


      Putin hinted this week that the Ukraine conflict could end in weeks, so Trump
      may not have a long wait.


      Should Trump want a ‘win’ (highly likely), then he should be steered by Putin’s
      many hints: Intermediate missile deployments by both parties are creating heightened
      risk and ‘cry out’ for a new limitation agreement. Trump could say that he saved
      us all from WW3 – and there could be more than a grain of truth to it.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how President Trump seeks to reshape
      America's global role by focusing on expanding influence within the Western Hemisphere
      while distancing from traditional military engagements abroad, suggesting a strategy
      of "self-cannibalization" that re-colonizes areas like Europe and emphasizes domestic
      priorities, all while navigating complex international dynamics, particularly
      regarding Russia and the Ukraine conflict.
    paragraph_summary: In his article, Alastair Crooke explores the paradox of President
      Trump's approach to American expansionism, advocating for a shift from traditional
      overseas interventions to a focus on the Western Hemisphere. Trump aims to project
      an image of a strong, muscular America while withdrawing from foreign conflicts,
      suggesting that past "forever wars" were not truly America's. He proposes a re-colonization
      of regions like Canada and Europe, emphasizing a more significant role for the
      U.S. in its immediate neighborhood. This strategy aligns with a growing sentiment
      among Americans to prioritize domestic needs over distant military engagements.
      Crooke draws parallels to historical precedents, such as Rome's retreat from peripheral
      provinces, and critiques the EU's failed aspirations for global influence. He
      also discusses Trump's complex interactions with global leaders, particularly
      regarding Israel and Russia, highlighting the challenges of achieving a clear
      victory in the Ukraine conflict. Ultimately, Crooke suggests that Trump’s strategy
      may involve navigating these geopolitical tensions while maintaining a focus on
      American interests at home.

      Trump’s rhetoric about Russia having lost one million men in the Ukraine conflict
      is not just nonsense (the real number not even reaching 100,000), but his resort
      to it underlines that the usual meme of Trump being just woefully misinformed
      is looking less and less plausible.


      After touting the one million Russian deaths, Trump then suggeststhat Putin is
      destroying Russia by not making a deal. Adding (seemingly as an aside), that Putin
      may have already made up his mind “not to make a deal.”


      Instead, in a curiously disinterested way, Trump remarks that negotiations would
      depend entirely on whether Putin is interested or not. He further claims that
      Russia’s economy is in ruins, and most notably says that he would consider sanctioning
      or tariffing Russia, if Putin does not make a deal. In a subsequent Truth Social
      post, Trump writes, “I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President
      Putin, a very big FAVOR.”


      This – plainly said – is a narrative of an entirely different order: No longer
      is it his Envoy Kellogg or another team member saying it; it is Trump’s own words
      as President. Trump answers a journalist’s question “Would [he] sanction Russia”
      should Putin not come to the negotiating table? To which he responds, “that sounds
      likely.”


      What, we might ask, is Trump’s strategy? It seems more as though it is Trump that
      is preparing for a “no deal.” He must be aware that Putin repeatedly has made
      plain that he is both interested and open to talks with Trump. There is no doubt
      about that.


      Yet Trump subsequently contradicts the “loser discourse” in yet another apparent
      after-thought: “I mean … it’s a big machine so, eventually things will happen
      ….”


      Here he appears to be saying that the Russian “big machine” ultimately will win.
      Russia will be a winner – and not a loser.


      Maybe Trump is thinking simply to let the dynamics of the military “trial of strength”
      play out. (If that is his thinking, he cannot utter such sentiment out loud –
      explicitly – as the Euro-élites would sink even further into a pathological tailspin).


      Alternatively, were Trump to be seriously seeking productive negotiations with
      Putin, it is certainly not a good way to start by being deeply disrespectful towards
      the Russian people – depicting them and President Putin as “losers” who desperately
      need a deal; whereas the reality was that it was Trump who earlier had touted
      getting a deal within 24 hours. His disrespect will rankle – not just with Putin
      – but for most Russians.


      The “loser narrative” simply will stiffen Russian opposition to a Ukraine compromise.


      The backdrop is that Russia in any case collectively eschews the idea of any compromise
      that “boils down to freezing the conflict along the line of engagement: that will
      give time to rearm the remnants of the Ukrainian army, and then start a new round
      of hostilities. So, that we have to fight again, but this time from less advantageous
      political positions,” as Professor Sergei Karaganov has noted.


      Moreover, “the Trump administration has no reason to negotiate with us on the
      terms we [Russia] have set. The war is economically beneficial to the US … and
      [possibly] also to removing Russia as the powerful strategic support of America’s
      main competitor ? China.”


      Professor Dmitri Trenin similarly predicts that,


      Trump’s bid to secure a ceasefire along Ukraine’s battle lines will fail. The
      American plan ignores Russia’s security concerns and disregards the root causes
      of the conflict. Meanwhile, Moscow’s conditions will remain unacceptable to Washington,
      as they would effectively mean Kiev’s capitulation and the West’s strategic defeat.
      In response Trump will impose additional sanctions on Moscow. Despite strong anti-Russian
      rhetoric, US aid to Ukraine will decrease, shifting much of the burden onto Western
      European nations.


      So why cast Russia as contemptible “losers,” unless this forms Trump’s strategy
      for walking away from the Ukraine issue? If a clear-cut US “victory narrative”
      seems beyond reach, then why not invert the narrative?”Mission accomplished” being
      obstructed solely by Russia’s “loser streak.”


      This inevitably leads to the question of what is the meaning – exactly – of the
      return of America’s “most famous criminal defendant to the White House,” and his
      promise of a “revolution of common sense”?


      “There is no doubt that it is revolutionary,” Matt Taibbi argues:


      Trump galvanized [income mal-distribution] resentment, creating a political Sherman’s
      march that left institutional America smouldering. The corporate press is dead.
      The Democratic Party is in schism. Academia is about to swallow a giant bottle
      of bitter pills, and after the executive orders signed Monday: a lot of DEI instructors
      will have to learn to code [i.e., will be unemployed].


      Yes, Taibbi observes,


      it makes me nervous to see a murderer’s row of censorious CEOs (particularly Bezos,
      Pinchai, and the repulsive Cook) sitting in front of Trump, together with other
      Wall Street luminaries … nonetheless, if the deal was support for Trump in exchange
      for platforms going back to being merely self-interested profit-gobblers, I’ll
      take it over the previous cabal. The Wall Street Journal was probably closest
      to capturing the essence of that idea of the event with yesterday’s header, ‘The
      New Oligarchy is a Vast Improvement on the Old‘.


      Yet to many Russians, however, the impression left by Trump’s “loser” discourse
      is that “nothing changes” – the idea of inflicting “strategic defeats” on Russia
      has been a cornerstone of US policy for so long a time that it transcends party
      lines and is implemented regardless of which administration occupies the White
      House. And today, a new impetus is apparent – as Nikolai Patrushev warns, Moscow
      expects Washington artificially to foment friction between Russia and China.


      Steve Bannon however, in his usual florid language, goes some way to explain the
      conundrum of a revolutionary Trump and his disappointing “loser discourse.”


      Bannon warns that Ukraine risks becoming “Trump’s Vietnam,” should Trump fail
      to make a “clean break,” and allow himself to be sucked deeper into the Ukraine
      war. “That’s what happened to Richard Nixon. He ended up owning the war and it
      went down as his war – not Lyndon Johnson’s,” Bannon noted.


      Bannon “advocates ending America’s all-important military aid to Kyiv, but fears
      his old boss is going to fall into a trap being set by an unlikely alliance of
      the US defence industry, the Europeans and even some of Bannon’s own friends,
      whom he argues are now misguided.”


      Bannon’s underpinning premise was made clear during his Zoom call with Alex Krainer.
      He confirmed that Trump and his team will go on the offensive from day one in
      office: “The days of thunder begin on Monday.” Bannon wasn’t talking about Trump
      going on the offensive against the Chinese, Iranians or the Russians, however.
      Trump and his team are preparing to take on the “they”.


      “They,” in Bannon’s words, “are the people who control the world’s most powerful
      empire and, elections or no elections, democracy or no democracy, they will not
      voluntarily relinquish their privileges and the control: there will be a fight.”


      Yes, the “real war” is the domestic one — not that against Russia, China or Iran,
      which could become diversions from the main battle.


      For comparative purposes, were Trump’s aim truly to agree a negotiated Ukraine
      “compromise,” we need to contrast his rhetorical blatant “loser” jibe with that
      of John F. Kennedy’s attempt, 59 years ago, to break the cycle of mutual antipathy
      that had frozen relations between East and West since 1945. Stung by the Cuban
      Missile Crisis in 1962, Kennedy wanted to break an ossified paradigm. Kennedy
      – like Trump – sought to “End Wars”; to be recorded in history as a “peace-maker.”


      In a speech at the American University in Washington on 10 June, 1963, JFK praised
      the Russians. He spoke of their achievements in science, the arts and industry;
      he saluted their sacrifices in the Second World War where they lost 25 million
      people, one-third of their territory and two-thirds of their economy.


      It was no exercise in empty rhetoric. Kennedy proposed the Limited Nuclear Test
      Ban Treaty – the first of the arms-control agreements of the 1960s and 1970s.


      Well, there may be inklings of a Bannon-inspired tentative “clean break” beginning
      – as Larry Johnson notes:


      “The Pentagon reportedly has fired or suspended all personnel directly responsible
      for managing military assistance to Ukraine. They will all face an investigation
      into the use of US budget money.


      Laura Cooper, the Pentagon’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Russia, Ukraine, and
      Eurasia, has already resigned, marking the beginning of what some see as a strategic
      pivot. Cooper was a key figure in overseeing $126 billion in military aid to Ukraine.
      Her departure, coupled with what appears to be a housecleaning of Pentagon staff
      tied to Kiev’s war effort, casts doubt on whether Ukraine will continue to enjoy
      the open spigot of US weapons and funding it received under Biden.




      The restructuring also casts a shadow over the Ukraine Defence Contact Group,
      which under Lloyd Austin had expanded into a 50-nation coalition supporting Kiev.


      The US has reportedly withdrawn all applications to contractors for logistics
      through Rzeszow, Constanta and Varna. At NATO bases in Europe, all shipments to
      Ukraine have been suspended and closed. This falls under Trump’s Executive Order
      halting global US assistance for 90 days – pending an audit and cost-benefit analysis.


      Meanwhile, Moscow and China are duly preparing against the prospect of diplomatic
      re-engagement with the now President Trump. Xi and Putin held a 95 minute video
      call a few hours after Trump’s impromptu news conference in the Oval Office –
      Xi gave Putin the details of his conversation with Trump (which was not timed
      to coincide with Trump’s inauguration, but rather had been scheduled in December).


      Both leaders appear to be sending a common message to Trump — i.e., the alliance
      between China and Russia is not ephemeral. They are united in common cause to
      work jointly to assert their respective national interests. They are willing to
      talk to Trump and engage in serious negotiations. Yet, they refuse to be bullied
      or threatened.


      Nikolai Patrushev, Adviser to Putin and member of Russia’s Security Council, gave
      the Russian context to this video call between the two leaders:


      “For the Biden administration, Ukraine was an unconditional priority. It is clear,
      [Patrushev says], that the relationship between Trump and Biden is antagonistic.
      Therefore, Ukraine will not be among Trump’s priorities. He cares more about China.”


      Pointedly, Patrushev warned:


      I think Washington’s disagreements with Beijing will worsen, and the Americans
      will inflate them, including artificially. For us, China has been and remains
      the most important partner with whom we are connected by relations of privileged
      strategic cooperation.




      As for the Russian line in relation to Ukraine, it remains unchanged. It is important
      for us that the tasks of the Special Operation are solved. They are known and
      have not changed. I believe that negotiations on Ukraine should be conducted between
      Russia and the United States without the participation of other Western countries.




      I want to emphasize once again that the Ukrainian people remain close to us: brotherly
      and bound by centuries-old ties with Russia, no matter how much Kiev propagandists
      obsess with ‘Ukrainianness’ claim to the contrary. We care about what is happening
      in Ukraine. It is especially disturbing [therefore] that violent coercion to neo-Nazi
      ideology and ardent Russophobia destroy the once prosperous cities of Ukraine,
      including Kharkiv, Odessa, Nikolaev, Dnipropetrovsk.




      It is possible that in the coming year Ukraine will cease to exist altogether.'
    one_sentence_summary: Trump's recent comments on Russia's losses in Ukraine and
      his approach to negotiations suggest a strategic pivot that may prioritize a "no
      deal" scenario while simultaneously disrespecting Russia, potentially complicating
      any future diplomatic efforts and reflecting a broader domestic political battle
      rather than a clear foreign policy direction.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent analysis, Alastair Crooke critiques Donald Trump's
      rhetoric regarding the Ukraine conflict, particularly his claim that Russia has
      suffered one million casualties, which he argues is misleading and reflects a
      deeper strategy rather than mere misinformation. Trump suggests that negotiations
      with Putin hinge on the Russian leader's willingness to engage, while simultaneously
      portraying Russia as economically weakened and in need of a deal. This "loser
      narrative" could alienate potential Russian cooperation and undermine any prospects
      for a compromise in Ukraine, as it contradicts the reality of Russia's strategic
      interests and resilience. Crooke contrasts Trump's approach with John F. Kennedy's
      more conciliatory rhetoric during the Cold War, highlighting the potential for
      a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy under Trump, especially as he appears
      to prioritize relations with China over Ukraine. The article also notes that recent
      changes within the Pentagon may signal a pivot away from extensive military support
      for Ukraine, suggesting a broader reevaluation of U.S. engagement in the region.
      Ultimately, Crooke posits that Trump's return to power could reshape U.S.-Russia
      relations, but his current framing risks entrenching conflict rather than fostering
      dialogue.

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      The essayist and military strategist, Aurelien, has written a paper entitled:
      The Strange Defeat (original in French). The ‘strange defeat’ being that of Europe’s
      ‘curious’ inability to understand Ukraine or its military mechanics.


      Aurelien highlights the strange lack of realism by which the West has approached
      the crisis —


      “ …and the almost pathological dissociation from the real world that it displays
      in its words and actions. Yet, even as the situation deteriorates, and the Russian
      forces advance everywhere, there is no sign that the West is becoming more reality-based
      in its understanding – and it is very likely that it will continue to live in
      its alternative construction of reality until it is forcibly expelled”.


      The writer continues in some detail (omitted here) to explain why NATO has no
      strategy for Ukraine and no real operational plan:


      “It has only a series of ad hoc initiatives, linked together by vague aspirations
      that have no connection with real life plus the hope that ‘something [beneficial]
      will occur’. Our current Western political leaders have never had to develop such
      skills. Yet it is actually worse than that: not having developed these skills,
      not having advisers who have developed them, they cannot really understand what
      the Russians are doing, how and why they are doing it. Western leaders are like
      spectators who do not know the rules of chess or Go – and are trying to figure
      out who is winning”. “What exactly was their goal? Now, responses such as ‘to
      send a message to Putin’, ‘complicate Russian logistics’, or ‘improve morale at
      home’ are no longer allowed. What I want to know is what is expected in concrete
      terms? What are the tangible results of their ‘messaging’? Can they guarantee
      that it will be understood? Have you anticipated the possible reactions of the
      Russians – and what will you do then?”


      The essential problem, Aurelien bluntly concludes, is that:


      “our political classes and their parasites have no idea how to deal with such
      crises, or even how to understand them. The war in Ukraine involves forces that
      are orders of magnitude larger than any Western nation has deployed on operations
      since 1945 … Instead of real strategic objectives, they have only slogans and
      fanciful proposals”.


      Coldly put, the author explains that for complex reasons connected with the nature
      of western modernity, the liberal élites simply are not competent or professional
      in matters of security. And they do not understand its nature.


      U.S. cultural critic Walter Kirn makes rather similar claims in a very different,
      yet related, context: California Fires and America’s Competency Crisis –


      “Los Angeles is in flames, yet California’s leaders seem helpless, unmasking a
      generation of public investment in non-essential services [that leaves the Authorities
      floundering amidst the predicted occurrence of the fires]”.


      On a Joe Rogan podcast earlier this month, a firefighter goes: “It’s just going
      to be the right wind and fire’s going to start in the right place and it’s going
      to burn through LA all the way to the ocean, and there’s not a f***ing thing we
      can do about it”.


      Kirn observes:


      “This isn’t the first fire or set of fires in Malibu. Just a few years ago, there
      were big fires. There always are. They’re inevitable. But having built this giant
      city in this place with this vulnerability, there are measures that can be taken
      to contain and to fend off the worst”. “To fob it off on climate change, as I
      say, is a wonderful thing to tell yourself, but none of this started yesterday.
      My only point is this, has it done everything it can to prepare for an inevitable,
      unavoidable situation that perhaps in scale differs from the past, but certainly
      not in kind? Are its leaders up to the job? There’s not a lot of sign that they
      are. They haven’t been able to deal with things like homelessness without fires.
      So the question of whether all those things have been done, whether they’ve been
      done well, whether there was adequate water in fire hydrants, whether they were
      working at all, things like that, and whether the fire department was properly
      trained or properly staffed, all those questions are going to arise”. “And as
      far as the competency crisis goes, I think that there will be ample material to
      portray this as aggravated by incompetence. California’s a state that’s become
      notorious for spending a lot of money on things that don’t work, on high-speed
      rail lines that never are constructed, on all sorts of construction projects and
      infrastructure projects that never come to pass. And in that context, I think
      this will be devastating to the power structure of California”. “In a larger sense
      though, it’s going to remind people that a politics that has been for years now
      about language and philosophical constructs such as equity and so on, is going
      to be seen as having failed in the most essential way, to protect people. And
      that these people are powerful and influential and privileged is going to make
      that happen faster and in a more prominent fashion”.


      To which his colleague, journalist Matt Taibbi, responds:


      “But pulling back in a broader sense, we do have a crisis of competency in this
      country. It has had a huge impact on American politics”. Kirn: “[Americans] They’re
      going to want less concern for the philosophical and/or even long-term political
      questions of equity and so on, I predict, and they’re going to want to lay in
      a minimum expectation of competence in natural disasters. In other words, this
      is a time when the priorities shift and I think that big change is coming, big,
      big change, because we look like we’ve been dealing with luxury problems, and
      we’ve certainly been dealing with other countries’ problems, Ukraine or whoever
      it might be, with massive funding. There are people in North Carolina right now
      still recovering from a flood and having a very difficult time as winter comes,
      which it doesn’t in LA in the same way, or as winter consolidates itself, I guess”;
      “So looking forward, it’s not a question of blame, it’s what are people going
      to want? What are people going to value? What are they going to prize? Are their
      priorities going to shift? I think they will shift big time. Los Angeles will
      be a touchstone and it will be a touchstone for a new approach to government”.


      So we have this ‘divorce from reality’ and consequent ‘Competency Crisis’ – whether
      in California; Ukraine or Europe. Where lie the roots to this malaise? U.S. writer
      David Samuels believes this to be the answer:


      “In his last days in office … President Barack Obama made the decision to set
      the country on a new course. On Dec. 23, 2016, he signed into law the Countering
      Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, which used the language of defending
      the homeland to launch an open-ended, offensive information war, a war that fused
      the security infrastructure with the social media platforms – where the war supposedly
      was being fought”.


      However, collapse of the 20th-century media pyramid and its rapid replacement
      by monopoly social media platforms, had made it possible for the Obama White House
      to sell policy – and reconfigure social attitudes and prejudices – in entirely
      new ways.


      During the Trump years, Obama used these tools of the digital age to craft an
      entirely new type of power centre for himself – one that revolved around his unique
      position as the titular, though pointedly never-named, head of a Democratic Party
      which he succeeded in refashioning in his own image, Samuels writes.


      The ‘permission structure’ machine that Barack Obama and David Axelrod (a highly
      successful Chicago political consultant), built to replace the Democratic Party
      was in its essence a device for getting people to act against their beliefs by
      substituting new and ‘better’ beliefs through the top-down controlled and leveraged
      application of social pressure – effectively turning Axelrod’s construct into
      ‘an omnipotent thought-machine’, Samuels suggests:


      “The term ‘echo chambers’ describes the process by which the White House and its
      wider penumbra of think tanks and NGOs deliberately created an entirely new class
      of experts who mutually credentialed each other on social media in order to advance
      assertions that would formerly have been seen as marginal or not credible”.


      The aim was for a platoon of aides, armed with laptops or smart phones, to ‘run’
      with the latest inspired Party meme and to immediately repeat, and repeat it,
      across platforms, giving the appearance of an overwhelming tide of consensus filling
      the country. And thus giving people the ‘permission structure’ of apparent wide
      public assent to believe propositions that formerly they would never have supported.


      “Where this analysis went wrong is the same place that the Obama team’s analysis
      of Trump went wrong: The wizards of the permission structure machine had become
      captives of the machinery that they built. The result was a fast-moving mirror
      world that could generate the velocity required to change the appearance of “what
      people believe” overnight. The newly minted digital variant of “public opinion”
      was rooted in the algorithms that determine how fads spread on social media, in
      which mass multiplied by speed equals momentum—speed being the key variable”.
      “At every turn over the next four years, it was like a fever was spreading, and
      no one was immune. Spouses, children, colleagues, and supervisors at work began
      reciting, with the force of true believers, slogans they had only learned last
      week. It was the entirety of this apparatus, not just the ability to fashion clever
      or impactful tweets, that constituted the party’s new form of power”.


      “In the end, however, the fever broke”. The credibility of Élites imploded.


      Samuels account amounts to a stark warning of the danger associated with distance
      opening up between an underlying reality and an invented reality that could be
      successfully messaged, and managed, from the White House. “This possibility opened
      the door to a new potential for a large-scale disaster – like the war in Iraq”,
      Samuels suggests. (Samuels does not specifically mention Ukraine, although this
      is implied throughout the argument).


      This – both the Obama tale, as told by David Samuels, and Walter Kirn’s story
      of California – augment Aurelien’s point about Ukraine and European military incompetence
      and lack of professionalism on the field: It is one of allowing a schism to open
      up between contrived narrative and reality – “which”, Samuels warns “is to say
      that, with enough money, operatives could create and operationalize mutually reinforcing
      networks of activists and experts to validate a messaging arc that would short-circuit
      traditional methods of validation and analysis, and lead unwary actors and audience
      members alike to believe that things that they had never believed; or even heard
      of before: Were in fact not only plausible, but already widely accepted within
      their specific peer groups”.


      It constitutes the path to disaster – even risking nuclear disaster in the case
      of the Ukraine conflict. Will the ‘Competency Crisis’ reaching across such varied
      terrain trigger a re-think as Walter Kirn – a writer on cultural change – insists?'
    one_sentence_summary: Aurelien's analysis critiques the West's unrealistic approach
      to the Ukraine crisis and broader competency issues, arguing that political leaders
      lack the necessary skills and understanding to effectively navigate such complex
      situations, leading to a disconnect from reality that parallels failures seen
      in California's management of natural disasters.
    paragraph_summary: In his analysis, Aurelien's paper "The Strange Defeat" critiques
      the West's failure to grasp the complexities of the Ukraine conflict and highlights
      a broader "Competency Crisis" affecting political leaders in Europe and the U.S.
      He argues that Western leaders lack realistic strategies and understanding of
      military dynamics, likening them to spectators unfamiliar with the rules of chess,
      while their responses to the crisis are merely ad hoc and disconnected from tangible
      outcomes. This disconnect is echoed by cultural critic Walter Kirn, who points
      to California's leadership inadequacies in managing natural disasters, suggesting
      that a focus on philosophical constructs has undermined practical governance.
      Both Aurelien and Kirn imply that this detachment from reality, exacerbated by
      the digital age's echo chambers, risks significant consequences, including potential
      disaster in Ukraine. David Samuels further warns that the manipulation of public
      perception through social media has created a dangerous schism between reality
      and constructed narratives, which could lead to catastrophic outcomes if not addressed.
      Ultimately, the article calls for a critical reassessment of priorities and competencies
      in governance to effectively confront pressing crises.

  - title: Trump, Iran And The Obama Strategic Blueprint – OpEd
    url: https://www.eurasiareview.com/14012025-trump-iran-and-the-obama-strategic-blueprint-oped/
    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      Like a smashed antique clock – with its elaborate cogs, ratchet wheels and innards
      splayed out from the casing – so the mechanics of the Middle East lie similarly
      exposed and broken. All the region is in play – Syria, Lebanon, Qatar, Jordan,
      Egypt and Iran.


      The original Obama strategic blueprint for containing and balancing the potentially
      violent energies of West Asia was subsequently handed to Team Biden at the end
      of the Obama term – and it still clearly bore the Obama imprimatur right up until
      its collapse after 7 Oct 2023.


      Netanyahu deliberately smashed its mechanics: In acts of wanton destruction, he
      destroyed the prevailing status quo, which he saw as an American straitjacket
      preventing the attainment of a Greater Israel reaching out to its ‘Grand Victory’.
      Netanyahu resented the American constraints – though by breaking the extant mechanism,
      paradoxically, instead of liberating Israel, he may have unleashed dynamics that
      will prove far more threatening (i.e. in Syria).


      The cornerstone to the Obama ‘balanced region’ was contained in a secret letter
      sent to Iran’s Supreme Leader in 2014, in which, as the WSJ relates, Obama proposed
      to Khamenei joint efforts in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State (where ISIS
      controlled territory). This joint action however, was made contingent on Iran
      reaching a nuclear deal with the U.S.


      The letter explicitly acknowledged Iran’s ‘equities’ in Syria: To assuage Iran’s
      concerns about the future of its close ally, President al-Assad, the letter stated
      that the U.S.’s military operations inside Syria were not targeted at President
      Assad or his security forces.


      The Obama understanding with Khamanei, it must be noted, thus implicitly extended
      to Hizbullah who were joined with Iran in fighting ISIS in Syria:


      “Among other messages conveyed to Tehran, according to U.S. officials at the time,
      is that U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria aren’t aimed at weakening Tehran
      or its allies”.


      Of course, the Obama undertakings to Iran were lies: Obama had already signed
      in 2012 (or earlier), a secret Presidential Finding (i.e. an instruction) for
      U.S. intelligence support to Syria’s rebels in their bid to oust President Assad).


      Were Iran to participate in a nuclear ‘deal’, the 2014 letter proposed that its
      regional ‘equities’ would be respected and could extend to Lebanon as a geography
      of international joint adjudication (as exemplified in U.S. Envoy Hochstein’s
      mediation of the Lebanese-Syrian Maritime borders).


      The purpose to this highly complex blueprint was Obama’s primordial obsession:
      To arrive at a proto-Palestinian State, albeit as another internationally administered
      protectorate, supported internationally, rather than as a sovereign nation-state.


      Why did Obama insist on a scheme that was such anathema to the Israeli Right and
      American Israel-Firsters? It seems that he (with good reason) both distrusted
      Netanyahu and knew well the latter’s determination to prevent any Palestinian
      State from ever coming to fruition.


      Obama’s balance of powers initiative was an attempt indirectly to bind Iran and
      its allies to Obama’s Palestinian ‘State’ concept – i.e. deliberately planned
      as an escalating pressure point on Israel to concede a State. Without intense
      pressure on Israel, it was clear to Obama that a Palestinian State was a dead
      letter.


      Netanyahu had made his intent to see the complete emptying of the Palestinian
      presence in the West Bank only too evident as far back as the 1970s (this was
      clear in the interviewthat he gave to author Max Hastings, who was writing a book
      on Netanyahu’s brother).


      Netanyahu disliked and distrusted Obama – as much as Obama distrusted him.


      In the wake of 7 October 2023, with the ‘ring of fire’ (seven ‘wars’) closing
      in on Israel, Netanyahu determined to break the straitjacket restraints. And he
      did.


      It’s not sure however, whether Obama’s highly elaborated structure would ever
      have worked. In any case, Netanyahu – by openly defying the White House – decided
      to override the Obama-Biden ‘restraints’ and to smash the entire Iranian-centred
      project of Obama.


      The logic of the Israeli serial destruction in the Region suggests to Netanyahu,
      as well as to many Israelis and American Israel-Firsters, that Iran now is “staggeringly
      vulnerable” (in the words of General Jack Keane), because of the loss of Syria
      – the ‘central’ node to the Axis of Resistance.


      Axios reports:


      “Iran’s recent nuclear advances give President-elect Trump a crucial decision
      to make in his first months in office: to neutralize the [Iranian nuclear] threat
      through negotiations and [escalating] pressures; or order a military strike. Several
      Trump advisers privately concede Iran’s program is now so far along that this
      [early] strategy might no longer be effective. That makes a military option a
      real possibility”. “After Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer met
      Trump at Mar-a-Lago in November, Dermer came away thinking there was a high likelihood
      Trump would either support an Israeli military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities
      — something the Israelis are seriously considering — or even order a U.S. strike.
      Some top advisers to President Biden have privately argued in recent weeks for
      striking Iran’s nuclear sites before Trump takes office, with Iran and its proxies
      so badly weakened”.


      Yet this may prove to be wishful thinking. Trump reposted on 7 Jan 2025, a video
      on the Truth Social platform featuring Columbia University Professor Jeffrey Sachs,
      in which he discussed the CIA’s covert efforts to destabilise Syria’s government
      and to overthrow Assad; the influence of Netanyahu; the Israeli lobby’s role in
      pushing the U.S. into the Iraq War; and Netanyahu’s continued attempts to involve
      the U.S. in a potential conflict with Iran. Sachs explained that the wars in Iraq
      and Syria were manufactured by Netanyahu, and had nothing to do with “democracy”.


      “Netanyahu is still trying to get us to fight Iran to this day. He is a deep dark
      son of a bitch because he’s gotten us into endless wars”, Professor Sachs said
      in the re-postedinterview.


      However, as Barak Ravid notes, “Others close to Trump expect that he’ll seek a
      deal before considering a strike”. When asked about the possibility of war with
      Iran in November, Trump replied, “Anything can happen, It’s a very volatile situation”.


      What then does this mean for Iran?


      Essentially, Iran has two options: Firstly to signal to the U.S. its readiness
      to enter into some sort of a new nuclear deal with the Trump team (a signal its
      Foreign Minister already has given), and then to wait on a subsequent successful
      Trump–Putin meeting to re-set the global post-war security architecture. From
      that ‘big picture’ global deal, Tehran might hope to negotiate its own separate
      ‘big picture’ accord with the U.S.


      Of course, this would be optimal.


      However, Ambassador Chas Freeman has said that although a sustainable peace between
      the U.S. and Russia (theoretically) is possible, it will be “very difficult” to
      achieve. To which Ray McGovern has added repeatedly that Trump is ‘plenty smart
      enough’ to know that he holds a weak hand with regard to Russia in the Eurasian
      space, and that Trump, the realist, has “bigger fish to fry”.


      Is this why Trump and Musk are stirring the geo-political ‘pot’ so blatantly:
      On the one hand, Canada, Greenland and Panama as part of the U.S.? These may be
      Trumpian ‘talking points’, but Greenland and Canada together could change the
      leverage calculus with Russia: Is Trump planning to use added leverage via the
      Arctic to threaten control over Russia’s northern borders? (It is the shortest
      flight time for missiles targeted at Russia).


      And on the other hand, Musk, in parallel, has started a firestorm in Europe with
      his Tweets – and his invitation to a livestream with Alice Weidel of AfD. Germany
      is the heart of NATO and the EU. Were Germany to ‘flip’ away from war with Russia
      – in company with other European ‘flips’ already in the works – then Trump plausibly
      could end a major economic burden (troop deployment in the EU) weighing on the
      U.S. economy. As Col. Doug Macgregor says, how many times do we have to tell people:
      “Americans don’t live in Europe – we live in the Western hemisphere!”.


      Musk effectively has lobbed a (free speech) grenade into the European media hegemony
      that both tightly controls discourse across the continent, and is in the pay of
      the Anglo Deep State.


      Will this bring the settlement with Russia and the Asian Heartland that Trump
      seeks? We must see.


      The alternative option for Iran is higher risk (and is contingent on the Iranian
      Intelligence assessment of the likelihood of Israel attempting a pre-emptive strike
      on Iran): i.e. Iran has the option of a further ‘Operation True Promise’. No longer
      meant to deter (unlike in earlier versions of True Promise), but rather, as Shivan
      Mahendrarajah explains, through exposing the ‘improbability of victory’ and demonstrating
      the ‘unacceptable cost’ of conflict, to dismantle Israel’s illusory narrative
      of perpetual ‘victory’.


      In 2003, as Mahendrarajah has noted, Iran proposed the U.S. a ‘grand bargain’.
      It was rejected by the Bush Administration. Can it be revived – not through nuclear
      talks, in which Iran has the weaker hand – but by the calibrated use of force.
      It would be an audacious, and big, bet.'

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      Russian FM Lavrov last week dismissed Team Trump’s floated peace proposals for
      Ukraine as unsatisfactory. Essentially, the Russian view is that the calls for
      a frozen conflict precisely miss the point: From the Russian perspective, such
      ideas – frozen conflicts, ceasefires and peacekeepers – do not begin to qualify
      as the type of treaty-based, ‘Big Picture’ deal the Russians have been advocating
      since 2021.


      Without a sustainable, permanent end to conflict, the Russians will prefer to
      rely on a battlefield outcome –even at the high risk of their refusal bringing
      continuing escalatory – even nuclear – U.S. brinkmanship.


      The question rather is: Sustained peace between the U.S. and Russia – Is it even
      possible?


      The death of former President Jimmy Carter recalls to us that the turbulent 1970s
      policy ‘revolution’ which became encapsulated in the writings of Zbig Brzezinski,
      Carter’s National Security Adviser – a revolution that bedevils U.S.-Russia relations
      from then, until today.


      The Carter era saw a major inflection point with Brzezinski’s invention of weaponised
      identitarian conflict, and his espousal of the same identitarian tools – as applied
      more widely – in order to bring western societies under the control of a technocratic
      élite “[practicing] continuous surveillance over every citizen … [together with
      élite] manipulation of the behaviour and intellectual functioning of all people
      …”.


      Brzezinski’s seminal books, in short, advocated a managed cosmopolitan identitarian
      sphere, that would swap out communal culture – i.e. national values. It is in
      the hostile reaction to this technocratic ‘control’ vision that we can root today’s
      trouble breaking out everywhere, on all global fronts.


      Put plainly, current events are in many ways a replay of the turbulent 1970s.
      Today’s march toward anti-democratic norms began with the Trilateral Commission’s
      seminal The Crisis of Democracy (1975) – the fore-runner to WEF(‘Davos’) and Bilderberg
      – with, (in Brzezinski’s words), international banks and multinational corporations
      being crowned as the principal creative force in the place of the “the nation-state
      as the fundamental unit of man’s organised life”.


      Brzezinski’s jaundiced perception of Russia was nothing new. Rather, it reaches
      back to the Hudson Institute in the 1970s and to Senator Henry “Scoop” Jackson,
      twice a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 1972 and 1976 Presidential
      elections. Jackson (of Norwegian descent) simply hated communism; he hated Russians,
      and he had had a lot of support within the Democratic Party.


      Brzezinski, Polish by origin, shared Scoop Jackson’s Russophobia. He persuaded
      President Carter (in 1979) to insert a radicalised, jihadist identity-culture
      into Afghanistan to attrite the secular socialist culture of Kabul, which Moscow
      was supporting. The Afghan war outcome subsequently was portrayed as a huge American
      victory (which it wasn’t).


      Yet – and this is the point – the victory claim nonetheless underpinned the notion
      of Islamic insurgents being the ideal ‘solvents’ in regime change projects (and
      still is, as we witness in Syria today).


      But Brzezinski had yet more advice to give President Carter. In his 1997 Grand
      Chessboard, Brzezinski argued that America and Kiev might potentially leverage
      ancient cultural and linguistic complexities (as was done in Afghanistan) to form
      the hinge around which heartland power could be dissolved by denying Russia control
      of Ukraine:


      “Absent Ukraine, Russia would never become the heartland power; but with Ukraine,
      Russia can and would [be a Heartland power]”, he insisted. Russia needed to be
      enmeshed in a similar Ukrainian cultural-identity quagmire, he advocated.


      Why was this policy decision so damaging to the prospects of ultimate peace between
      the U.S. and Russia? It was because Kiev, egged on by the CIA, promoted the entirely
      false identitarian claim that ‘Europe ends at Ukraine’ – and that beyond it, lie
      ‘the Slavs’’.


      This manipulation alone allowed Kiev to morph into an icon for total cultural-identity
      war on Russia, despite the fact that the Ukrainian language (correctly known as
      Ruthenian) is not a Germanic language. Nor is there any Viking (Germanic) DNA
      to be found among modern-day western Ukrainians.


      In its desire to support Kiev and to please Biden, the EU jumped at this Ukrainian
      strategic revisionism: ‘Ukraine’ crafted as ‘European values’ defending against
      ‘Russian’ (Asian) values. It was a pole, albeit a false one, around which European
      unity could be forged at a time when the reality was that of EU unity dissipating.


      So, is ‘sustainable peace’ with Russia possible? Were it to be attempted in terms
      of seeking to sustain a rump Ukraine as a bellicose isthmus of ‘Europe and its
      values’ ranged against the ‘regressive Slav sphere’, then peace is not possible.
      For its underpinning premise would be wholly fake and would assuredly lead to
      renewed conflict in the future. Moscow almost certainly would reject such a deal.


      Yet, there is growing anxiety amongst the American public that the war in Ukraine
      seems locked into forever escalation, with palpable public fears that Biden and
      the ‘hawks’ in Congress are taking the U.S. towards a ‘nuclear holocaust’.


      Are we – humanity – to continue teetering at the brink of annihilation if a Trump
      ‘deal’ – narrowly confined to Ukraine – is refused in Moscow? The urgency to halt
      the slide towards escalation is clear; yet the space for political manoeuvre continuously
      shrinks, as the compulsion of the Washington-Brussels hawks to land a fatal strike
      on Russia is not spent.


      But seen from the perspective of Team Trump, the task of negotiating with Putin
      is anything but straight forward. The western public simply has never been psychologically
      conditioned to expect the possibility of a stronger Russia emerging. On the contrary,
      they have endured western ‘experts’ sneering at the Russian military; denigrating
      the Russian leadership as incompetent; and its leadership being presented on their
      TVs as purely evil.


      Bearing in mind Brzezinski’s seminal contribution on democracy, and its later
      ‘concentrate’ in an élite techno-managed ‘identarian sphere’, it is not difficult
      to see how a country as fragmented as America finds itself back footed as the
      world slips towards a culturally-based multi-polarity.


      Of course, it’s not exactly true to say that America has no communal culture,
      given the wide diversity of immigrant cultures in the U.S. But it is true that
      what is seen as traditional culture has been under siege. This, after all, was
      at the crux of the recent Presidential election – and of elections in many other
      nations.


      The notion that once the Trump envoys have been initially to Moscow, and gone
      away empty-handed, that Trump will sweep in to conclude an Ukraine deal, does
      not reflect what Moscow has been endlessly highlighting. What is required is a
      ‘Big Picture’ treaty-based deal that settles the security architecture and frontiers
      between Heartland and the Rimland security interests.


      But will such a deal be seen by many Americans as ‘weakness’; as conceding U.S.
      ‘leadership’ and ‘Greatness’? Of course, it will be perceived that way – because
      Trump would be effectively sealing America’s defeat and repositioning the U.S.
      as one state amongst equals in a new Concert of Powers – i.e. in a multipolar
      world.


      It is a big ‘ask’. Can Trump do it – swallow American pride? One viable way forward
      would be to return to the original Gordian Knot, and to untie it: i.e. to untie
      the knot of there being no post-WW2 written treaty delimiting NATO’s ever-forward
      movement, and by so doing, ending the pretence that NATO’s displacement to wheresoever
      it choses is no one’s business but its own.


      Unfortunately, the other possible way to ‘balance’ the appearance of American
      and NATO defeat over Ukraine, might be seen by Trump’s hawkish advisers to be
      to pulverise Iran – as a signal of American ‘virility’.


      Negotiations, in the final instance, are about interests, and the nous to solve
      the riddle of two parties perceiving how ‘the other’ sees itself being perceived
      – as weakness or as strength. Trump, if stumped in a literal impasse over Ukraine,
      might simply escalate the metaphysical staircase to simply say that he alone has
      the vision to save America from WW3. To save America from itself.'

      back to the 1970s, highlighting the influence of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who advocated
      for a strategy that undermined Russian influence in Ukraine and promoted a cultural-identity
      war against Russia. He argues that without a genuine, treaty-based resolution
      that acknowledges Russia's security concerns, sustainable peace is unlikely. The
      article raises questions about whether American leaders, particularly Trump, can
      navigate the political landscape to forge a new multipolar world order without

      The Syria story, it seems, is not so simple as ‘President Assad fell’ and the
      ‘technocratic Salafists’ rose to power.


      At one level, the collapse was predictable. Assad was known to have been influenced
      by Egypt and UAE for some years past. They had been urging him to break with Iran
      and Russia, and to shift to the West. For some 3-4 years he had been incrementally
      signalling and implementing such a move. Iran especially faced increasing obstacles
      over operational matters in which they were co-operating with Syrian forces. His
      shift was meant as a message to Iran.


      The financial situation of Syria – after years of U.S. Caesar sanctions, plus
      the loss of all agricultural and energy revenues seized by the U.S. in occupied
      north-east Syria – was catastrophic. Syria simply had no economy.


      No doubt, reaching out to Israel and Washington was presented to Assad as the
      only practical exit to his dilemma. ‘Normalisation’ could lead to the lifting
      of sanctions, they implored him. And Assad, according tothose in touch with him,
      (even at the eleventh hour before the HTS ‘invasion’) was believing that Arab
      States close to Washington would have opted for his continued leadership, rather
      than see Syria fall prey to Salafist zealots.


      To be clear: Moscow and Tehran had warned Assad that his army (as a whole) was
      too fragile, too underpaid, and too penetrated and bribed by foreign intelligence
      services, to be expected to defend the state effectively. Assad also was warned
      repeatedly about the threat from Idlib jihadists planning to take Aleppo, but
      the President not only ignored the warnings – he rebutted them.


      He was offered a very large external military force not once, but twice, even
      in ‘the last days’, as Jolani’s militia were advancing. Assad refused. “We are
      strong”, he told an interlocutor on the first occasion; yet shortly afterwards,
      on a second occasion, he admitted: “My army is running away”.


      Assad was not abandoned by his allies. It was by then too late. He had flip-flopped
      once too often. Two of the principal actors (Russia and Iran) were frustrated
      and rendered unable to help – absent Assad’s consent.


      A Syrian who knew the Assad family, and who spoke with the President at some length
      just prior the Aleppo invasion, had found him surprisingly sanguine and unflustered
      – assuring his friend that there were forces enough (2,500) in Aleppo to deal
      with Jolani’s threats, and hinting that President Sissi might be ready to step
      in with aid for Syria. (Egypt of course feared Muslim Brotherhood Islamists taking
      power in a former secular Ba’athist state).


      Ibrahim Al-Amine, editor of Al-Akhbar, noted a similar perception by Assad:


      “Assad seemed to have become more confident that Abu Dhabi was capable of resolving
      his problem with the Americans and some Europeans, and he heard a lot about economic
      temptations if he agreed to the strategy of exiting the alliance with the resistance
      forces. One of Assad’s workers, who stayed with him until the last hours before
      he left Damascus, says that the man was still hoping for something big to happen
      to stop the armed factions’ attack. He believed that “the Arab and international
      community” would prefer that he remain in power, rather than Islamists take over
      the administration of Syria”.


      Yet, even as the Jolani forces were on the M5 highway linking to Damascus, the
      wider Assad family and key officials were making no efforts to prepare for a departure,
      or to warn close friends to think about such contingencies, the interlocutor said.
      Even as Assad was heading to Hmeimin en route to Moscow, no advice to ‘get out’
      was sent to friends.


      The latter said that they did not know after Assad’s silent departure to Moscow
      who exactly, or when, ordered the Syria army to stand down and to prepare for
      transition.


      Assad briefly visited Moscow on 28 November – a day after the HTS attacks in Aleppo
      province and their swift advance south (and a day after the ceasefire in Lebanon).
      The Russian authorities have said nothing about the content of the President’s
      meetings in Moscow, and the Assad family said that the President had returned
      tight-lipped from Russia, too.


      Subsequently, Assad departed finally to Moscow (either on 7 December, after despatching
      a private plane on multiple flights to Dubai, or on 8 December) – again telling
      virtually nobody in his immediate and family circle that he was departing for
      good.


      What caused this out-of-character mindset? No one knows; but family members have
      speculated that Bashar Al-Assad had been seriously disorientated emotionally by
      the grave illness of his wife, Asma, to whom he is devoted.


      Put frankly, whilst the three main players could see clearly the direction events
      were heading (the fragility of the state was no surprise), nevertheless, Assad’s
      denial mindset and the consequent speed of the military dénouement was the surprise.
      That was the true ‘black swan’.


      What triggered events? Erdogan has for several years demanded that Assad firstly
      negotiate with the ‘legitimate Syrian opposition’; secondly that he re-draft the
      Constitution; and thirdly that he meet face-to-face with President Erdogan (something
      Assad consistently refused to do). All three powers pressed Assad to negotiate
      with the ‘opposition’, but he would not, and nor would he meet with Erdogan. (Both
      loathe each other). Frustration on these counts was high.


      Erdogan now indisputably ‘owns’ ‘former-Syria’. Ottoman irredentist sentiment
      is ecstatic and demanding more Turkish revanchism. Others – the more secular city
      dwellers of Turkey however – are less enthused by the display of Turkish religious
      nationalism.


      Erdogan however, may well be (or may soon be) experiencing buyer’s remorse: Yes,
      Turkey stands tall as Syria’s new landlord, but he is now ‘the responsible’ for
      what happens next. (HTS is plainly exposed as a Turkish proxy). Minorities are
      being killed; brutal sectarian executions are accelerating; sectarianism becoming
      more extreme. There is still no Syrian economy in sight; no revenues, and no fuel
      for the gasoline refinery (previously supplied by Iran).


      Erdogan’s espousal of a re-branded and westernised al-Qaeda always risked proving
      to be paper-thin (as the sectarian killings are cruelly demonstrating). Will Jolani
      manage to impose his al-Qaeda-in-a suit makeover across his heterodox followers?
      Abu Ali al-Anbari, al-Baghdadi’s top aide at the time (2012-2013), gave this scathing
      appraisal of Jolani:


      “He is a cunning person; two-faced; adores himself; does not care about his soldiers;
      is willing to sacrifice their blood in order to make a name for himself in the
      media – glows when he hears his name mentioned on satellite channels”.


      In any event, one clear outcome is that Erdogan’s ploy has re-ignited formerly
      (and mostly) quiescent Sunni sectarianism and Ottoman imperialism. The consequences
      will be many and will ripple across the region. Egypt is already anxious – as
      is King Abdullah in Jordan.


      Many Israelis see themselves as the ‘winners’ from the Syrian up-ending – since
      the Axis of Resistance supply line has been severed at its middle. Israeli security
      chief Ronan Bar was most likely briefed by Ibrahim Kalin, Turkish Head of Intelligence,
      when they met in Istanbul on 19 November on the expected Idlib invasion – in time
      for Israel to institute the Lebanon ceasefire, and to obstruct the passage of
      Hizbullah forces into Syria(Israel immediately bombed all the border crossings
      between Lebanon and Syria).

      Russia will concentrate on the war in Ukraine and stay aloof from the Middle East
      quagmire – to focus on the slow global restructuring that has been happening,
      and on the Big Picture attempt to have Trump in due course come to acknowledge

      of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, highlighting his misguided attempts to shift
      alliances and the failure to heed warnings from allies, ultimately leading to
      his downfall amidst rising Salafist forces and regional tensions.
    paragraph_summary: The article by Alastair Crooke delves into the complexities surrounding
      the recent developments in Syria, highlighting that the narrative of President
      Assad's fall and the rise of Salafists is overly simplistic. It outlines how Assad,
      influenced by Egypt and the UAE, attempted to pivot away from Iran and Russia
      towards the West, believing that normalization with Israel and the U.S. could
      alleviate Syria's dire economic situation exacerbated by sanctions. Despite warnings
      from his allies about the fragility of his military and the imminent threat from
      jihadists, Assad remained in denial, ultimately leading to a swift military collapse.
      The article also discusses the implications of Turkey's involvement in Syria,
      particularly under Erdogan, who now bears the responsibility for the region's
      instability and rising sectarian violence. The piece concludes by noting that
      while some regional players may perceive themselves as beneficiaries of the upheaval,
      the resurgence of Salafist extremism poses long-term risks, including for Israel
      and the broader geopolitical landscape.

      Begins – OpEd'

    text: 'By Alastair Crooke


      James Jeffrey, former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Turkey, in a March 2021 interview
      with PBS Frontline, laid out very plainly the template for what has just happened
      in Syria this month:


      “Syria, given its size, its strategic location, its historical importance, is
      the pivot point for whether [there can be] an American-managed security system
      in the region … And so you’ve got this general alliance that is locked in with
      us. But …the stress point is greatest in Syria”.


      Jeffrey explained (in the 2021 interview) why the U.S. shifted its to support
      to Jolani and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS):


      “We got Mike Pompeo to issue a waiver to allow us to give aid to HTS – I received
      and sent messages to HTS” -The messages coming back from HTS were: “We [HTS] want
      to be your friend. We’re not terrorists. We’re just fighting Assad””.


      The PBS Frontline interviewer asks: The U.S. was “supporting indirectly the armed
      opposition”? To which Jeffrey responds:


      “It was important to us that HTS not disintegrate … our policy was … was to leave
      HTS alone … And the fact that we haven’t targeted [HTS] ever, the fact that we
      have never raised our voice to the Turks about their cohabitation with them —
      in fact, I used this example the last time I was talking to very senior Turks
      – when they started bitching about this relationship we [the U.S.] have with the
      SDF [in eastern Syria]”.


      “I said to them, “Look, Turkey has always maintained that you want us in northeast
      Syria, which they do. But you don’t understand. We can’t be in northeast Syria
      without the platform, because we only have hundreds of troops there”; … I said:
      “It’s just like you in Idlib …”.


      “We want you to be in Idlib, but you can’t be in Idlib without having a platform,
      and that platform is largely HTS. Now, unlike the SDF, HTS is a UN-designated
      official terrorist organisation. Have I ever, or has any American official ever,
      complained to you about what you’re doing there with HTS? No …”.


      David Miller, a British academic, has noted that in 2015, prominent Syrian Sunni
      Muslim scholar, Shaykh al-Yaqoubi (who is anti-Assad), was unconvinced by Jolani’s
      efforts to rebrand Al Qa’ida as Jabhat al-Nusra. Jolani, in his al-2013 Al-Jazeera
      interview twice confirmed his allegiance to al-Qa’ida, saying that he received
      orders from its leader, Dr Ayman [al-Zawahiri] … and those were to not target
      the West. He confirmed his own position as being that of hardline intolerance
      toward those who practiced a ‘heretical’ Islam.


      Miller comments:


      “While ISIS put on suits; allowed Syria to be carved up by the U.S.; preach peace
      with the Zionist state; want free markets; and cut gas deals with their regional
      patrons – their ‘true-believers’… in the Sunni identitarian diaspora haven’t yet
      clocked that they’ve been sold out – as was always the plan”.


      “In private, the planners of this war in NATO states laugh about sending young
      Salafi cannon fodder from around the world into a meat grinder. The $2000 salaries
      are a mere speck of sand compared to the gas and construction wealth that is expected
      to be returned to Turkish, Qatari, Israeli and American coffers. They killed Palestine
      for this, and they’ll spend the next 30 years justifying it, based on whatever
      line the very expensive PR firms hired by the NATO and Gulf states shill to them…The
      Syrian regime change operation is the rug pull of the century”.


      Of course, James Jeffrey’s account was nothing new. Between 1979 and 1992, the
      CIA spent billions of dollars funding, arming, and training Afghan Mujahideen
      militia (like Osama bin Laden) in an attempt to bleed the USSR dry by pulling
      it into a quagmire. It was from the ranks of the Mujahideen that al-Qa’eda emerged.


      “And yet, by the 2010s, even as the U.S. was ostensibly at war with al-Qaeda in
      Iraq and Afghanistan – it was secretly working with it – in Syria on a plan to
      overthrow Assad. The CIA spent around $1 billion per year training and arming
      a wide network of rebel groups to this end. As Jake Sullivan, told Secretary of
      State Hillary Clinton in a leaked 2012 email, “AQ [al-Qaeda] is on our side in
      Syria”, as Alan Macleod observes in Consortium News.


      Turkish press accounts largely confirm this Jeffrey scenario was the current gameplan:
      Ömer Önhon, former senior Ambassador and Deputy Under-Secretary in charge of Middle
      East and Asia at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, writesthat:


      “the operation to overthrow Assad’s regime in Syria was meticulously planned for
      over a year, with coordinated involvement from Turkey, the United States, and
      several other nations. Through various statements it has become clear that Assad’s
      departure resulted from an intricate web of agreements between virtually all stakeholders.
      Whilst HTS is actively working to rebrand itself – this transformation remains
      to be proven.”


      This HTS story has a precedent: In the summer following Israel’s 2006 (unsuccessful)
      war on Hizbullah, Dick Cheney sat in his office loudly bemoaning Hizbullah’s continuing
      strength; and worse still, that it seemed to him that Iran had been the primary
      beneficiary from the U.S. 2003 Iraq war.


      Cheney’s guest – the then Saudi Intelligence Chief, Prince Bandar – vigorously
      concurred (as chronicled by John Hannah, who participated in the meeting) and,
      to general surprise, Prince Bandar proclaimed that Iran yet could be cut to size:
      Syria was the ‘weak’ link that could be collapsed via an Islamist insurgency.
      Cheney’s initial scepticism turned to elation as Bandar said that U.S. involvement
      might be unnecessary. He – Bandar – would orchestrate and manage the project:
      ‘Leave it to me’, he said. Bandar separately told John Hannah: “The King knows
      that other than the collapse of the Islamic Republic itself, nothing would weaken
      Iran more than losing Syria”.


      Well … that first effort did not succeed. It led to bloody civil war, but ultimately
      President Assad’s government survived.


      So, Jeffrey was simply reiterating in 202 its sequel: the original Wahabbi-led
      ‘rug pull’ on Syria by the Gulf was simply to be reverse engineered into a HTS
      hit by a rebranded amalgam of various militia made up primarily of former fighters
      (many not Syrian) from al-Qaeda/al-Nusra and ISIS, directed – in this second iteration
      – by Turkish Intelligence and financed by Qatar.


      Syria thus has been disintegrated and pillaged in the name of ‘liberating’ Syrians
      from the threat of ISIS, which they – Washington – had installed in the first
      place, and which the U.S. then used to justify the north-east of Syria’s occupation
      by U.S. forces. In the same mode, the unspoken part of this plan is to make secular
      Syria – with its legal system taken from France – ‘Islamic’ (“we will implement
      Islamic law”) to justify the Israeli attacks and land grabs, which are being presented
      as ‘defensive measures against jihadists’.


      Of course, it is correct that there is likely money to be made from these events.
      It was never proven, but seismic surveys before the first Syria war began in 2011,
      seemed to show that there may well be substrata deposits of oil or gas in Syria,
      beyond the relatively small fields in the north-east. And yes, re-construction
      will be a bonanza for Turkey’s languishing construction sector.


      Syria’s ailing military was no direct military threat to Israel per se. So you
      may wonder, why are they tearing the place apart? “Israel’s goal here is to basically
      wreck Syria”, Professor Mearsheimer opines. “It’s not in large part because of
      Israel, by the way. I think the Americans and the Turks played a much more important
      role than Israel did – in wrecking Syria”. “The country is wrecked and I don’t
      know anybody who thinks that the rebels who are now in control in Damascus are
      going to be able to restore order in that country … From Israel’s point of view,
      this is a perfectly fine situation”, Mearsheimer adds.


      U.S. anti-Russia hawks also hoped that Russia might take the bait of a wrecked
      Syria to get enmired into a widening Middle East quagmire.


      All of which takes us directly back to Jeffrey’s statement: “Syria, given its
      size, its strategic location, its historical importance, is the pivot point for
      whether [there can be] an American-managed security system in the region …”.


      Syria has been from the outset – from 1949 – ‘the balancer’ to Israel in the region.
      That is now over, leaving only Iran to balance the Israeli thrust to a ‘Greater
      Israel’. It is no surprise then that the Israelis are agitating for the Americans
      to join with them in another orgy of destruction – this time to be visited on
      Iran.


      Did Russia have foreknowledge of what was afoot in Idlib, and the orchestration
      of a transition of power? Of course! The very effective Russian services must
      have known, as this Syria project has been ongoing since the mid 1970s (through
      the Hudson Institute and Senator Scoop Jackson).


      Assad had been signalling over the last four years, his desperate plan with Saudi,
      UAE and Egypt to a move towards a more pro-Israeli/pro-Western stance, in the
      hope of normalising with Washington and thereby gaining some sanctions relief.


      Assad’s ploy failed – and Syria likely will emerge as ‘Greek tragedy’ whereby
      tragedy evolves as actors play out their own natures. Quiescent ethnic and sectarian
      tensions likely will re-kindle; wildfires will catch. The lid is off. And Russia
      was never going to take the bait of plunging in.


      The U.S.-Israeli alliance has long wanted Syria. And now, they have got it. Any
      concomitant mayhem is down to them. Yes, the U.S. – in theory – may applaud itself
      for achieving more of “an American managed security [and energy dominant flow]
      system”.


      But the U.S. ruling strata, however, were never going to let Europe be energy
      independent. The U.S. needs West Asia’s energy assets for itself – to collateralise
      its debt-overload. European states are left to tumble, as the fiscal crunch bites
      and European growth tails away.


      Others may see a collateral scenario – that a conflicted and possibly re-radicalised
      Middle East will inflict further strain onto the already ‘livid’ domestic social
      tensions in Europe.


      Israel nonetheless is relishing its ‘win’. Winning what? Former IDF Chief of Staff
      and Defence Minister ‘Bogie’ Ya’alon puts it this way:


      “The current Israeli government’s path is to conquer, annex, commit ethnic cleansing
      … and to establish Jewish settlements. Polls show some 70% of Israelis, sometimes
      more, support this – AND for Israel to be a liberal democracy”.


      “This [contradictory] path will lead us to destruction”, he concludes.


      What other can be the final end to this Zionist project? There are more than seven
      million Palestinians between the ‘River and the Sea’. Are they all to vanish from
      the map?'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the strategic significance of Syria
      in U.S. foreign policy, highlighting how American support for groups like Hayat
      Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) reflects a broader agenda to reshape the region, while also
      critiquing the historical and ongoing manipulation of local conflicts by Western
      powers to achieve geopolitical goals, ultimately leading to Syria's disintegration
      and the entrenchment of foreign interests.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article by Alastair Crooke, the strategic importance
      of Syria is highlighted through the lens of James Jeffrey, a former U.S. Ambassador,
      who asserts that Syria serves as a pivotal point for an American-managed security
      system in the region. Jeffrey reveals that the U.S. has shifted its support to
      Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group previously linked to al-Qaeda, under the guise
      of fighting against the Assad regime. This support reflects a broader strategy
      where the U.S. has historically manipulated various factions in Syria, including
      the use of jihadist groups, to achieve its geopolitical objectives. The article
      critiques the U.S. and its allies, including Turkey and Israel, for their roles
      in destabilizing Syria, suggesting that their actions are driven by a desire to
      weaken Iran and reshape the region in favor of their interests. The narrative
      also touches on the implications of this turmoil for Europe and the potential
      for renewed sectarian violence, ultimately questioning the sustainability of the
      current Israeli and American strategies in the Middle East.
