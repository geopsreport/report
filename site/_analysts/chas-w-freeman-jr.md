summary: |
  As the global order continues its transformation, the latest analyses highlight the intensifying Sino-American contention and the broader decline of Western dominance. Ambassador **Chas W. Freeman, Jr.** underscores that this period is marked by both significant challenges and opportunities, with the U.S. and China at the center of a shifting geopolitical landscape. The need for nuanced diplomacy and strategic foresight is more urgent than ever, as both powers navigate an era defined by complex interdependencies rather than simple rivalries.
  
  A key development is the emergence of what Freeman terms a "multi-nodal" world order, where influence is distributed across interconnected centers of power, rather than concentrated in a few dominant states. This shift is particularly evident in the Asia-Pacific, where China is reasserting itself as a central actor, while the U.S. faces mounting challenges to its traditional leadership. Freeman warns that the U.S. reliance on sanctions and militarization is proving counterproductive, further isolating the West and accelerating the rise of alternative governance structures.
  
  On the European front, the ongoing war in Ukraine remains a stark example of the limitations of Western strategy. Freeman argues that the conflict has failed to achieve its objectives of weakening Russia or integrating Ukraine into Western alliances. Instead, it has devastated Ukraine and reinforced Russia’s position. Without a realistic peace framework that addresses Russia’s security concerns, he predicts continued instability and the potential for Ukraine’s further fragmentation. There is a high chance, Freeman notes, that unless Western policies shift toward inclusive diplomacy, Europe will face a prolonged period of insecurity.
  
  Looking ahead, the majority view among analysts is that the West’s current trajectory—marked by ideological rigidity and a lack of diplomatic engagement—will likely lead to greater fragmentation of the international system. Freeman most definitely predicts that unless the U.S. and its allies adapt to the realities of a multi-nodal world and prioritize diplomacy over confrontation, they risk marginalization in the emerging global order. The call for a reassessment of grand strategy and a renewed commitment to professional diplomacy is growing ever more urgent.

      on Artificial Intelligence in Sino-American Relations


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      By Video, 28 May 2025


      I’m glad to be back at a Committee for the Republic salon, if only by video link.
      It has been a pleasure to interact with our speaker tonight, to whom John Henry
      introduced me only a few months ago. You are in for a treat.


      Alvin Graylin is that rare American who not only understands artificial intelligence,
      having started at least four companies involved with the development of AI, but
      who is au courant with China’s AI industry as well as our own. He is a thinker
      who has important things to say and who says them clearly, even if he tosses in
      an acronym or two. I remember reading a science fiction novel as a kid in which,
      on page 3, it was revealed that the Pentagon had had to be torn down after it
      was discovered that acronyms cause cancer. I’ve asked Alvin to keep the acronyms
      to a minimum in case there are people here tonight who are less immersed in the
      culture and jargon of Silicon Valley or 中关村 than he is.


      Alvin sees AI as bringing huge benefits to humankind and can persuasively describe
      these. Of course, he also recognizes that the first thing human beings usually
      do with new interactive technologies, like the internet, is use them for one-upmanship,
      warfare, the dissemination of pornography, and the perpetration of scams. As Confucius
      remarked, the essence of man is gluttony and lust. (For some reason, he did not
      mention greed. I guess he wasn’t a hedge fund guy.)


      Alvin believes that it is crucial for the two nations leading the development
      of AI – China and the United States – to cooperate to maximize the enormous benefits
      it promises and minimize the risks it poses. I find his arguments convincing.
      I think many of you will too. We have a great deal to gain from AI if we put the
      best American and Chinese minds to work at gaining it. Conversely, if we don’t
      work together, we face risks that should be countered or avoided.


      Will AI manage the battlefields of the future by treating human beings as expendable
      cannon fodder? Will it do to white collar workers what automation has done to
      blue collar workers, eliminating their jobs and making them redundant? Will it
      do what another science fiction story I read long ago posited? In that story,
      all the world’s computers were connected so that scientists could ask the array
      a pressing question. The scientists turned it on and asked it: “Is there a god?”
      A lightning bolt then struck its on/off switch, and it spoke, saying: “Now there
      is!”


      There is an urgent need for China and the United States to explore how to use
      AI to optimize the betterment of the human future while limiting its downside.
      Alvin Graylin has thought a lot about why and how to do this, as you will hear.
      Please join John and me in welcoming him.'
    one_sentence_summary: Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. introduces Alvin Graylin,
      an expert in artificial intelligence with insights into both the U.S. and Chinese
      AI industries, emphasizing the importance of cooperation between the two nations

      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. introduced Alvin Graylin, an expert in artificial
      intelligence (AI) with extensive experience in both American and Chinese AI industries.
      Freeman praised Graylin for his clear insights into the potential benefits and
      risks of AI, emphasizing the importance of cooperation between the U.S. and China
      to harness AI's advantages while mitigating its dangers. He highlighted concerns
      about AI's impact on warfare, employment, and ethical dilemmas, urging both nations
      to collaborate for a better future. Freeman expressed confidence in Graylin's
      perspectives and invited attendees to engage with his ideas on optimizing AI for
      humanity's benefit.

      Remarks to a Conference on Strategic Challenges and the Emerging New Order


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      By video, 24 May 2025


      In the West, this is a time of forever wars. Forever wars have no defined or achievable
      objectives. Therefore, they include no plan for their termination or the reconciliation
      of the parties to their results. In forever wars, what passes for strategy is
      the fantasy that the will of the enemy will somehow evaporate, leading to its
      unconditional surrender. But ‘we will win, they will lose’ is a pipe dream, not
      a program. Even wars of attrition need steadfast purposes that both sides can,
      eventually, reluctantly agree to.


      In the West, this is an era of fantasy foreign policy. In it, governments and
      media oligopolies use addictive modern technologies to dictate fictional versions
      of trends and events. This century has shown that determined propagandists can
      now fool most of the people most of the time. But reality exists whether people
      believe in it or not. Policies built on delusions cannot overcome it. What has
      been lost on the ground can be denied at pep rallies, but it cannot be recovered
      at the negotiating table.


      The war in Ukraine has not “weakened and isolated Russia.” Far from it. But it
      has devastated and depopulated Ukraine. Ukraine’s ambition to ban the language
      and culture of its Russian and other minorities and to quell their resistance
      to forcible assimilation has failed. The war has put paid to the West’s effort
      to incorporate Ukraine into an alliance hostile to Russia. Europe’s need for post-Cold
      War security architecture to make it “whole and free” remains unfulfilled.


      Peace is the restrained tolerance of a postwar status quo by those with the capability
      to alter it by violence. The West is without any plan for peace. And rather than
      a “Europe whole and free,” the Ukraine war has produced a Europe divided and in
      the process of abandoning free speech and liberal democracy.


      Those who are in the process of losing wars can be forgiven for dreaming of ceasefires
      but not for failing to recognize that they cannot impose a ceasefire on an advancing
      enemy. Nor can they credibly issue ultimatums. An enemy that is unbowed will predictably
      insist on terms that serve its interests and the war aims it has set for itself.
      As the Roman statesman Seneca observed, “it is expedient for the victor to wish
      for peace, [but] for the vanquished it is necessary.” To imagine otherwise is
      to compound disaster. Ukraine is not vanquished, but it is being broken. If there
      is no peace, it risks further dismemberment as well as suffering and the possible
      loss of its access to the sea.


      Any negotiating position that ignores realities because they are unpalatable is
      bound to fail. A triumphant enemy has a veto over what is possible. Basing peace
      talks on the attribution to Russia of nefarious objectives it has never professed
      guarantees impasse. The West needs to get a grip on reality and cure itself of
      fears of Russian plans to conquer Europe for which there is no evidence. In three
      years of warfare, Russia has not conquered Ukraine. Both its ambitions and its
      capabilities fall well short of Europe’s hallucinatory view of them.


      Over three decades, Russia consistently asked how to construct a peaceful order
      in Europe. The West’s adamant refusal to address the issues of concern to Russia
      finally provoked it to go to war. One of Russia’s questions has found a costly
      answer in that war. The West now has no choice but to address those questions
      that remain.


      Russian speakers in Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson are now under
      Russian protection. They will not accept subjugation by Ukraine and Russia will
      not ask them to do so. But the other questions that sparked the war have not changed.


      Can Ukraine enjoy security by returning to the neutrality it proclaimed at its
      independence? If so, with what assurances and under what guarantees from whom?


      Can Europe, including Russia, replace division and confrontation with unity in
      diversity and cooperation among all its states? What framework can be agreed to
      enable this?


      If Americans and Europeans do not at last address these questions forthrightly,
      there will be no peace in Ukraine, in Europe, or with Russia. A peace can yet
      arise from the ashes of war in Europe if Europeans pursue it with the realism
      and empathy that are the foundation of all sound statecraft.'
    one_sentence_summary: Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. argues that the ongoing war
      in Ukraine has not weakened Russia but has devastated Ukraine and highlighted
      the West's lack of a realistic peace strategy, emphasizing the need for honest
      negotiations that address the underlying issues and concerns of all parties involved
      to achieve lasting peace in Europe.
    paragraph_summary: In his remarks at a conference on strategic challenges, Ambassador
      Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the ongoing war in Ukraine, characterizing it as
      part of a broader pattern of "forever wars" driven by unrealistic foreign policy
      fantasies. He argues that the conflict has not weakened Russia but has instead
      devastated Ukraine and failed to achieve Western objectives of isolating Russia
      or integrating Ukraine into a hostile alliance. Freeman emphasizes that without
      a realistic plan for peace, which acknowledges the realities on the ground and
      addresses Russia's concerns, the situation will remain dire, leading to further
      suffering and potential dismemberment of Ukraine. He calls for a reassessment
      of the West's approach, advocating for a framework that fosters unity and cooperation
      among European states, including Russia, to achieve lasting peace in the region.

    text: 'Notes for a Panel on Sino-American Perceptions and Misperceptions


      Watson Institute , Brown University


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      Providence, Rhode Island May 8, 2025


      There is now an effective American ideological blackout on Chinese realities.
      The default American position is hostility to a China that mostly exists only
      in our imaginations.


      People believe what they hear. And all they hear about China is highly prejudicial.
      None of the three branches of the U.S. government now has active exchanges with
      China. Members of Congress pretend to know all about China without ever having
      visited the place.


      All sorts of false or unsubstantiated statements are now taken by Americans as
      axiomatic. Official policy reflects these distorted perceptions, to include:


      A supposed Chinese desire to emulate the late, unlamented USSR by imposing its
      rule on its neighbors and its authoritarian ideology on the world or the United
      States.


      The assertion that, because the Chinese system doesn’t resemble our self-described
      democracy, it is inherently illegitimate and is regarded as such by the Chinese
      people, whom we should support in efforts to engineer regime change in Beijing.


      Charges that it’s China rather than the United States that rejects the institutions
      and rules governing international economic and political interaction and scoffs
      at or ignores the UN, WTO, and international treaties and conventions and that
      it is China that takes a scofflaw position on everything from genocide to the
      laws of war.


      Various evidence-free ideological conceits. For example, the notions that Constitutional
      democracy is a prerequisite for scientific and technological innovation, the gangsterish
      idea that every adversary has a breaking point or one at which its subordination
      can be bought, and “Democratic peace theory,” which asserts that countries that
      practice Western-style democracy are peace-loving while other regime types are
      not.


      Attributing U.S. manufacturing job losses to Chinese competition rather than to
      steadily increasing productivity achieved through automation and to U.S. corporate
      decisions to outsource labor costs instead of retaining and retraining workers.


      Treating China’s development of increasingly formidable self-defense capabilities
      as a threat to the United States rather than a challenge to American amour propre
      and military domination of the other side of the Pacific.


      Extrapolating a threat to third countries’ sovereignty and territories from Beijing’s
      efforts to pressure Taipei to negotiate a resolution of the unfinished Chinese
      civil war.


      Dismissing China’s claims to land features in the South China Sea out of hand
      while championing those of other countries with equally dubious claims.


      Intemperate Chinese reactions to American diatribe about these and other matters
      have reinforced mutual animosities. Congressional grandstanding on these issues
      has deeply offended Chinese. Mike Pompeo’s patriotic invective epitomized this.
      Meanwhile, former Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian totally turned
      off Americans with his equally chauvinistic and counterproductive “wolf warrior
      diplomacy.”


      China’s militant defense of its claims to islets, rocks, and reefs in the South
      and East China Seas has led to occasional confrontations with the U.S. Navy, while
      its escalating pressure on Taiwan has been answered with escalating American violations
      of the Sino-American agreements that had kept the peace between the two sides
      of the Taiwan Strait for five decades.


      China foolishly ignored widening complaints about intellectual property theft
      and unfair trade and investment practices. Whatever the merits of these complaints,
      they cost China the support of the American political elite and much of the U.S.
      business community.


      Beijing did itself no favors by first tyrannizing, then pitching out most of the
      Western press, which now reports on China from Taipei, Seoul, and other places
      remote from Chinese realities. When China denies anyone remotely critical of it
      a visa or participation in a dialogue it violates its own “united front” theory.
      Beijing’s security agencies have in effect gone out of their way to turn foreign
      media against it and to give foreigners real axes to grind.


      These actions by China aside, there are many more self-referential American reasons
      for our delusional view of it:


      Despite official information warfare and unprecedentedly shallow reporting by
      U.S. media, an increasing number of Americans are aware that China is rising while
      we are not.


      China’s rapid return to wealth and power is psychologically hard to take because
      it not only challenges U.S. primacy but also refutes the core beliefs of laissez-faire
      capitalist ideology.


      The rise of China and other shifts in the world’s balances threaten American primacy.
      Despite the disappearance of the circumstances that originally justified them,
      the United States seeks to retain global and regional economic, diplomatic, and
      military privileges and prerogatives


      Hostile attitudes toward China that carried over from the era of “containment”
      during the Korean and Vietnam Wars persist.


      Paranoia replicating fears of “Japan as number one” in the 1980s has translated
      into equally psychotic fantasies about a rising China in the 21 st


      Today’s xenophobic racism echoes the era of the “Yellow Peril” and the internment
      of Japanese Americans in World War II.


      The demise of the USSR deprived Americans of a credible challenge to the warfare
      state and our military-industrial complex. Our cure for the resulting “enemy deprivation
      syndrome” was to designate China as the default enemy. China helpfully provided
      and continues to furnish the perceived high-tech threat needed to sustain the
      warfare state.


      Americans have embraced xenophobic protectionism as an imagined cure for our domestic
      ills. A China that is beating us at our own capitalist game is the ideal bête
      noire.


      Popular American stereotypes about “Communist Parties” substitute presuppositions
      for empirically observed realities. They lead to the culturally illiterate conclusion
      that, if you’ve seen one Communist, you’ve seen them all. In fact, few of the
      politicians pontificating on this subject have ever met a member of any Communist
      Party other than the Vietnamese (about whom they say nothing on the grounds that
      they are presumed to be anti-Chinese).


      Americans now exhibit an odd combination of self-doubt, complacency, and hubris.
      The decay of constitutional democracy in America, the increasing decadence and
      culture wars affecting American society, and the diminishing capacity of the U.S.
      government to meet the expectations of its citizens have combined to produce a
      lack of self-confidence that feeds truculence.


      Ingrained mutual hostility has ended diplomatic dialogue worthy of the name with
      Beijing, by contrast with Moscow during the Cold War. There is no dialogue between
      the political elites of the two countries beyond the performative. But there is
      intimate dialogue with Taipei, which remains determined to enlist the United States
      in its resistance to cross-Strait negotiations and its pursuit of expanded independence
      from the rest of China.


      We live in an era in which the weird has been normalized. Some of the truly weird
      theories we now have invite comparison to those attributed:


      to the dark fantasies and charlatanism of Rasputin as Czarist Russia collapsed,


      to the socioeconomic lunacy of Mao Zedong’s attempts to make China great again
      in the “Great Leap Forward” or the Cultural Revolution, or


      to Pol Pot’s self-destructive animosity to the Cambodian administrative state.


      Among the more deranged theories now guiding American policies and opinions are:


      The idiosyncratic economics of Peter Navarro. He has persuaded our president that
      prosperity is best achieved by reducing the exchange of things we have for things
      we don’t. This is an approach that has begun to leave our Treasury with abundant
      little green paper portraits of dead presidents while depriving ordinary Americans
      of the stuff they used to get in exchange for them.


      Stephen Miran’s plan to balance the U.S. trade account by persuading China and
      other countries to stop buying the Treasury bonds that finance chronic U.S. budget
      deficits while somehow preserving the dollar as the global reserve currency.


      The Trumpian notion that Americans can use our waning economic power to strong-arm
      allies, friends, and adversaries into funding continuing U.S. global hegemony.


      The claim that our president has the power to force China, the EU, and others
      to capitulate even as he quails before the sovereign might of El Salvador and
      Israel.


      Enough, already.


      Americans need to get a grip on reality. Daniel Patrick Moynihan wisely observed
      that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but that no one is entitled to
      their own facts. We have now reversed that. Everyone is entitled to their own
      facts while no one is entitled to an opinion that differs from the prevailing
      political narrative.


      Our problems result from things we did to ourselves. Picking fights with China
      will not cure our problems. We need to do that.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the United States harbors a distorted
      and hostile perception of China, largely fueled by ideological biases, misinformation,
      and a lack of direct engagement, which undermines diplomatic relations and exacerbates
      tensions between the two nations.
    paragraph_summary: In his remarks at the Watson Institute, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman,
      Jr. critiques the pervasive ideological bias in American perceptions of China,
      arguing that the U.S. government and public are largely influenced by misconceptions
      and prejudices that distort the reality of Chinese society and politics. He highlights
      the absence of meaningful dialogue between the two nations, exacerbated by hostile
      rhetoric from U.S. officials and China's own counterproductive diplomatic strategies.
      Freeman identifies various unfounded beliefs driving U.S. policy, such as the
      notion that China's political system is inherently illegitimate and poses a threat
      to global order, while also addressing the psychological impact of China's rise
      on American self-perception and national identity. He calls for a reassessment
      of these views, emphasizing that America's challenges stem from internal issues
      rather than external adversaries, and warns that continued antagonism towards
      China will not resolve domestic problems but rather deepen misunderstandings and
      conflict.

      Remarks to the Boston Community Church & East Bay Citizens for Peace


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      Boston, Massachusetts & Bristol, Rhode Island April 18 & 19, 2025


      We Americans have bet our future on competition with China. The keys to winning
      this competition are domestic economic and technological renewal as well as enhanced
      influence abroad. So far, the evidence suggests that we are achieving neither,
      yet we have just started an economic forever war with China. What is happening
      reminds me of the saying: QUOS DEUS VULT PERDERE, PRIUS DEMENTAT. “Whom the gods
      would destroy, they first make mad.”


      Our country now disparages public service. It is taking a chain saw to its institutions.
      Such self-sabotage weakens our state capacity, reduces our situational awareness,
      clouds our decision making, degrades essential government services, and fuels
      rather than alleviates popular discontent. These trends invite adversaries to
      exploit American decline. They also cost us the respect and support of allies
      and friends.


      We Americans have long been in denial about our many domestic and foreign problems.
      They are now visibly getting worse. Subconsciously, we appear to understand this,
      but we blame it on everyone but ourselves. Our allies and friends see us chaotically
      making threats, imposing tariffs, and coveting territory. They view our predatory
      behavior as an irrational and incoherent response by us to challenges that are
      largely of our own making.


      Just short of 30 percent of Americans chose Donald J. Trump as our president in
      the hope that he would “make America great again.” But what he and his unelected
      billionaire buddies, band of talking heads, and digital delinquents are doing
      is not correcting the bumbling Biden administration’s legacy but undermining both
      our long-term competitiveness and our standing abroad.


      Let me count the ways:


      Our alliances. We are alarming and alienating those countries historically most

      of their livelihood, more Mexicans will flee their country in a desperate search
      for a better life in ours. Military threats are more likely to drive Mexico into
      the arms of our adversaries than to secure its cooperation. We have transformed
      Panamá from a reliable friend and manager of the canal it operates into a fearful
      target of potential aggression by our armed forces. By alienating neighbors, we
      are opening our formerly secure sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere
      to inroads by great powers beyond it.

      Our economic and technological competitiveness . Protectionism is an explicit
      admission that many elements of our economy as currently structured can no longer
      stand up to foreign competition. Our new habit of banning technological innovations
      made elsewhere from our market is even more damaging. This subsidizes and preserves
      uncompetitive backwardness. (Consider the steel industry, electric vehicles, TikTok,
      DeepSeek, solar panels, wind power, and telecommunications as examples.) By denying
      ourselves the benefits of intellectual advances by others, we have chosen a path
      that leads inexorably to technological inferiority.

      inferiority. Our leading companies’ markets. Denying U.S. IT companies access
      to China, their largest overseas market, deprives them of the revenue they need
      to stay ahead of their Chinese and other competitors.


      As the saying goes, when the winds of change blow, some people build walls, while
      others build windmills. Rather than focusing on self-improvement and seizing opportunities,
      Americans have chosen to throw our declining weight around internationally. We
      rely on brute-force economic, financial, or military coercion to bring other countries
      to heel. This is no way to compete with China or any other rising or resurgent
      great power. And it is no way to “secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves
      and our Posterity.”


      Meanwhile, despite many difficulties and not a few mistaken policies, China continues
      to power ahead. While we scapegoat and bully others, the Chinese remain single-mindedly
      focused on enhancing their economic, scientific, and technological prowess. They
      are ready, willing, and able to reach out to the foreign partners we are alienating.
      China had a couple of bad centuries, but it is back – and in the process of resuming
      its millennial position as the world’s largest economy. [slide 2]


      China’s growth has slowed, but it is still growing twice as fast as the United
      States. In purchasing power terms – which avoid the significant distortions imposed
      by an overvalued U.S. dollar – the Chinese economy is already one-third larger
      than ours. [slide 3] China produces more than one third of the world’s manufactures.
      [slide 4] It is the world’s largest trading nation and the principal trading partner
      of more than 100 countries. Over one-fourth of the world’s STEM workers are Chinese.
      That proportion is growing. Nearly half of the world’s patent applications now
      originate in China. [slide 5]


      U.S. export controls, sanctions, and other efforts to hamstring or reverse Chinese
      advances are demonstrably not working. Their main effects have been to stimulate
      China to redouble its efforts to become self-sufficient, to boost its commitment
      to science and technology, to further improve its already formidable educational
      standards, and to explore ways to counter U.S. financial hegemony. The latest
      “Nature Index” rates Harvard as the world’s number one university in natural and
      health sciences, with MIT in tenth place. Chinese universities hold places two
      through nine.[1]


      China’s challenges to our global preeminence are economic, scientific, and technological.
      There are no Chinese warships or bombers off our coasts. China espouses no territorial
      claims against us. But, in accordance with our heavily militarized approach to
      foreign affairs, our response to China’s resurgence is almost entirely military.
      We have ringed China with bases aimed at it. [slide 6] We conduct three or four
      aggressive patrols of its coasts and island bastions daily.


      Seventy-five years ago, we intervened militarily to protect the losing side of
      the Chinese civil war by separating it and Taiwan from the rest of China. Since
      then, the Taiwan issue has been an embryonic Sino-American casus belli. We refuse
      to say whether we would use force to counter an attempt by Beijing to recover
      it. But the Chinese assume we would. They are acting accordingly.


      The result is escalating Sino-American tension and an arms race that our military
      commanders suggest we are in the process of losing. Of course, we can’t be sure
      this isn’t just their usual use of threat inflation to further inflate their budgets
      and gratify the military-industrial complex they expect to join upon retirement.


      Still, Chinese military innovations are indeed impressive.


      A huge arsenal of very accurate missiles, including some capable of striking naval
      vessels at long distances, others that are hypersonic, and many that are road
      mobile.


      By far the world’s largest navy, including ever more capable aircraft and carriers
      for them as well as submarines, world-beating drones, innovative landing craft,
      long-range ship-to-ship missiles, and rail guns.


      The world’s third largest air force, including both fifth generation and prototype
      “sixth generation” aircraft. Advanced air defenses and electronic warfare as well
      as cyber-attack capabilities.


      The initial battleground in any US-China war would be in China, including Taiwan,
      and China’s near seas. China would be fighting on its own doorstep, enjoying very
      short lines of communication and supply lines. The United States be projecting
      power to a battlefield over 7,000 miles away from our West Coast. China would
      enjoy the many advantages of being on the defensive. From Beijing’s perspective,
      the war would be about recovering and defending Chinese territory against foreign
      attack – about things that Chinese care much more about than Americans do.


      Multiple wargames predict that a US-China war over Taiwan could cost both sides
      the bulk of their navies and aircraft. China has the industrial surge capacity
      to replace its ships and aircraft, but we do not. Losses on the scale predicted
      would cripple the United States as a global power, not just cost it its eight-decade-old
      dominance of Pacific Asia.


      The one certain outcome of a war over the political status of Taiwan would be
      the destruction of its democracy as well as its prosperity and industrial base.
      The ruin of Taiwan’s advanced electronic industries would ensure huge collateral
      damage to the world economy. Such a war would have no winners even if it did not
      escalate to the nuclear level (which both sides assume it could).


      Notwithstanding this, the focus of U.S. policy in Pacific and South Asia at present
      is on preparing for a trans-Pacific war with China and on persuading U.S. allies
      in the region to let Americans use bases on their territory against China. In
      response, China is preparing for war with America.


      The U.S. and China’s defense budgets are structured so differently that it is
      hard to compare them. Both omit significant amounts of military-related spending
      and cover them in other budgets. All in all, however, China now appears to be
      spending less than 2 percent of its GDP on national defense, while the U.S. defense
      department’s budget alone is about 3.6 percent of GDP. Including U.S. military-related
      spending in other departments’ and agencies’ budgets brings total U.S. military
      spending to about 5.4 percent of U.S. GDP.


      The disparity in spending levels reflects many factors, not least of which is
      the People’s Liberation Army’s exclusive focus on the security of the Chinese
      homeland and adjacent areas versus a U.S. military force structure designed to
      preserve U.S. global primacy by projecting American power to every corner of the
      world rather than to defend the American homeland. Our “defense department” is
      misnamed. In reality, it is an “offense department.” If Americans’ concern were
      truly limited to defending ourselves, we would spend a lot less. We would also
      consider diplomacy as a cheaper and more reliable way to make more friends and
      fewer enemies.


      Of course, defense budgets do not decide the outcome of warfare. But the balance
      of fervor often does, as the failure of our effort to prevent the unification
      of Vietnam or to pacify Afghanistan should remind us. In a bloody American rendezvous
      with Chinese nationalism over Taiwan, the balance of fervor would strongly favor
      China. So, increasingly, would the military balance. The more both sides prepare
      for war, the more likely it becomes.


      U.S. policy has shifted from favoring a peaceful settlement of the divisions between
      Taipei and Beijing to de facto support for Taiwan’s indefinite separation from
      the China mainland. This approach rejects diplomacy to rely entirely on military
      posturing against China. It is a direct challenge to China’s sovereignty, territorial
      integrity, and national security as well as to its amour-propre.


      China sees unsettling analogies to the evolution of U.S. policy toward the war
      in Ukraine. The U.S. objective has not been to promote Ukraine’s wellbeing or
      its domestic tranquility – still less to save Ukrainian lives – but to counter,
      “isolate, and weaken Russia.”


      Similarly, in the case of Taiwan, the U.S. seems less concerned about Taiwan and
      its inhabitants than about showing China who’s boss, weakening it, and containing
      its influence abroad. China is as opposed to the strategic use of Taiwan against
      it as Russia has been to the incorporation of Ukraine into an alliance hostile
      to it, or as the United States was to a menacing Soviet presence on the island
      of Cuba.


      Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine has been carefully limited. It
      may seem to demonstrate that superpowers can conduct a proxy war without resorting
      to nuclear weapons. But a war over Taiwan would not be a proxy war fought in a
      third country like Korea, Vietnam, or Ukraine but a war conducted directly between
      U.S. and Chinese forces on territory universally acknowledged to be Chinese –
      Taiwan and the China mainland. Such a war could not and would not be “limited.”


      The Chinese would inevitably respond to U.S. devastation of parts of their homeland
      by counterattacking ours. Each side would be tempted to employ nuclear weapons
      to incapacitate the other. The United States is currently engaged in a massive
      program of nuclear force modernization aimed explicitly at prevailing in a war
      with China.


      The United States remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons against
      another people. U.S. nuclear doctrine explicitly authorizes a nuclear first strike
      on enemies, whether nuclear-armed or not. In the past, on at least three occasions,
      our government has threatened to launch a nuclear attack on China. We have provided
      no assurance that we will not do so again.


      This and the mounting likelihood of a Sino-American war over Taiwan have catalyzed
      a change in Chinese nuclear strategy. China was long content with a minimal nuclear
      capability – a force de frappe – one able to respond to a nuclear attack by taking
      enough of a bite out of the enemy to cause it to think twice about using nuclear
      weapons to attack any part of China. But China is now embracing “mutually assured
      destruction” and building a nuclear force that could destroy the United States,
      if Americans use nuclear weapons to attack it.


      A war that not only cannot be won but that also risks becoming existential should
      obviously never be fought. Our diplomacy should focus on ensuring that it never
      is. A diplomacy-free, all-military-all-the-time U.S. policy toward China like
      our current policy therefore makes no sense.


      China’s military posture is defensive. Our military is in China’s face. The People’s
      Liberation Army is not in ours. It will not appear off our coasts or in our hemisphere
      unless we drive it to reciprocate our threatening presence on its borders. Our
      current policies risk convincing China eventually to do just that.


      This underscores the absurdity of how Americans are dealing with China’s return
      to its millennial wealth and power. China’s eclipse of U.S. global primacy and
      dominance of Pacific Asia is grounded in its growing scientific, technological,
      and economic dynamism. [slide 7] It is not military, even if the People’s Republic
      has now built a formidable capacity to defend itself.


      Unlike the Soviet Union, China does not occupy other countries or seek to impose
      its authoritarian ideology on them or us. Unlike Nazi Germany, China is not in
      search of “Lebensraum.” Unlike Imperial Japan or European imperialists, China
      does not pursue military-colonial control of foreign natural resources or labor.
      Nor does China seek to replicate the imperial market preferences and mercantilism
      of past empires.


      These analogies are false. But groupthink born of anxieties about American decline
      has transformed them and evidence-free conjectures into accepted “axioms” that
      are constantly reiterated and that cannot be questioned. Our present China policies
      are based on “politically correct” assumptions born of conjectures rather than
      the realities they misdescribe. They are dogmatic, delusional, and dangerous.
      And they come with high opportunity costs.


      The ironies in this situation abound.


      We Americans accuse China of seeking to replace the US-sponsored world order with
      its own. But China is far more committed to the post-war order’s core ideas of
      free trade and multilateralism than we now are. It has integrated itself into
      that order and used its rules to advance Chinese interests. Unlike us, China has
      not withdrawn from the World Trade Organization (WTO), launched protectionist
      trade wars, or condemned international institutions like the World Court (ICJ)
      for doing their job. The new institutions China has helped create, like the Asian
      Infrastructure Development Bank, complement Bretton Woods institutions like the
      World Bank and mirror their rules. They supplement rather than replace the pre-existing
      world order. China is among the staunchest supporters of the United Nations Charter
      and the Westphalian order it is meant to regulate.


      We accuse China of “aggression.” China has indeed defended its longstanding claims
      to islets, reefs, and fishing grounds against other claimants in its near seas
      and its disputed border with India, but it has not made all-out war on, invaded,
      dismembered, or occupied other countries as we have. It does not seek to annex
      the territories or take possession of the canals in other countries. Unlike us,
      China has not backed others, like Israel, in wars of annihilation and territorial
      aggrandizement. Instead, it has made itself available as a peacemaker and mediator,
      most notably between Saudi Arabia and Iran.


      We accuse China of attempting to thwart our campaign to “isolate and weaken” Russia.
      But China has not recognized the separation of Crimea and other Russian-speaking
      oblasts from Ukraine any more than it has recognized NATO’s forced separation
      of Kosovo from Serbia. China continues to trade with both Ukraine and Russia.
      If China is definitely not “with us,” it is not necessarily “against us.”


      We accuse China of “malign behavior.” In practice, this seems to mean any reduction
      in our international influence, wherever it occurs, whatever the cause. China
      has emerged as the largest contributor to the economic development of countries
      in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It may or may not now attempt to fill the
      vacuum that our sudden embrace of protectionism and our mean-spirited cessation
      of foreign assistance have created. Other countries are poised to ask it to do
      so. We shall see how it responds.


      There are lots of things to criticize about China and its political system. China
      also has more than its fair share of problems. But it is for Chinese, not us,
      to deal with them. In this context, mirror-imaging to produce a portrait of China
      that much of the world would say better describes us is not just a faulty basis
      for policy but counterproductive.


      It is entirely correct to describe China as a “systemic challenge” to our current
      internal disorder and decadence, fiscal improvidence, oligopoly- and plutocracy-dominated
      economy, complacent sense of superiority, jingoistic foreign policy, job-stripping
      financial capitalism, and collapsing educational standards. But the operative
      question for Americans is what to do about these things. There are many elements
      of the Chinese system from which we might usefully draw inspiration, but China’s
      authoritarianism and disrespect for the rule of law, which we are now inadvertently
      emulating, should not be among them.


      We cannot replay the strategy of “containment” that successfully isolated the
      Soviet Union until it succumbed to its own defects. Attempting to do so with China
      will isolate and impoverish us rather than the Chinese. China is outperforming
      us. It faces many challenges, but it is socially stable, economically productive,
      ever more scientifically and technologically capable, increasingly innovative,
      and internationally engaged. We may snarl at globalization, but it is continuing
      without us. And China remains both at its center and a major beneficiary of it.


      Attempting to perpetuate our global primacy and Pacific-Asian hegemony by cutting
      ourselves off from China and the world is an evasion of the pressing need to reform
      our system to make it more competitive. Focusing on hamstringing China rather
      than getting our own act together entails huge opportunity costs.


      We live on credit rollovers and pyramiding debt, yet we refuse to accept investment
      from China, which is capital rich and prepared to finance improvements in our
      failing infrastructure, establish new factories here, and help expand U.S. agricultural
      production to assure food supplies for its own population as well as ours. China
      has the renewable energy technologies we need to go electric, but we seem determined
      to obstruct or ban our companies from importing or adopting them. Our economies
      are complementary, as their interdependence has amply demonstrated. We need a
      reset with China.


      In this connection, diatribe is no substitute for diplomatic dialogue. It alienates
      and does not persuade. The Trump administration has at least one thing very right.
      U.S. security does not depend on coercing foreigners into conformity with our
      values. We could “make America [truly] great again” by moving away from a mindset
      that quixotically insists on compelling others to conform to our increasingly
      unrealistic self-image. Instead, we should seek to understand other peoples –
      including the Chinese, respect them for who and what they are, and do our best
      to leverage their prosperity and technological advances to enhance our own.

    one_sentence_summary: Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. argues that the U.S. is undermining
      its own competitiveness against China through self-sabotage, alienation of allies,
      and a failure to invest in domestic renewal and international cooperation, which
      could lead to a decline in its global standing and influence.
    paragraph_summary: In his remarks to the Boston Community Church and East Bay Citizens
      for Peace, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the U.S. approach to competition
      with China, arguing that America is failing to renew its domestic economy and
      technology while simultaneously alienating allies through aggressive and self-sabotaging
      policies. He highlights the detrimental effects of protectionism, military posturing,
      and a lack of diplomatic engagement, which not only undermine U.S. global standing
      but also empower China to advance economically and technologically. Freeman warns
      that the U.S. reliance on military solutions, particularly regarding Taiwan, risks
      escalating tensions into a catastrophic conflict, emphasizing that a defensive
      Chinese military posture contrasts sharply with the U.S. offensive strategy. He
      calls for a reevaluation of U.S. policy to prioritize diplomacy over militarization,
      stressing that a war with China would have no winners and could lead to existential
      consequences.

      Remarks to an international conference on ending the disaster in Ukraine


      organized by Radio Roma News TV / Amici Network


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      By video February 22, 2025


      How wars end matters. The Napoleonic wars ended in the reconciliation of Europe’s
      great powers, including the defeated French, at the Congress of Vienna. The resulting,
      inclusive “Concert of Europe” ensured a long, if imperfect, peace that ended only
      in World War I.


      That war was fought mainly in Europe. It was followed by the vindictive exclusion
      of two great European powers from any role in or commitment to sustaining stability
      in Europe. The excommunication of Germany and Russia laid the basis for World
      War II, which – for Americans – was both transatlantic and transpacific. That
      war ended not in a peace but in a cold war – a tense but stable order sustained
      by mutual deterrence through military confrontation between the Soviet Union and
      the United States.


      The failure to include a role for Russia in Europe commensurate with its power
      has now once again brought war to the continent. The lessons of history are clear.
      There can be no stable order in Europe that excludes any of its great powers.
      Those with no peaceful way to ensure respect for their security interests will
      see no reason not to use force to defend them. And if there is no prospect of
      a sustainable framework to safeguard their interests, they will prefer outcomes
      on battlefields to those contrived at the negotiating table.


      This is the story of the Ukraine War. After nearly three decades of indifference
      and rejection of Russian security concerns by the United States and NATO, Russia
      issued an ultimatum demanding negotiations on three of these concerns:


      (1) neutrality for Ukraine rather than its incorporation into NATO – an alliance
      premised on armed hostility to Russia;


      (2) respect for the linguistic and cultural rights of Ukraine’s large Russian-speaking
      population; and


      (3) agreement on Europe-wide security arrangements that could mitigate and relieve
      Russian security anxieties as well as those of the West.


      The West flatly refused to discuss these issues. This left Russia with a choice
      between abandoning its ultimatum and accepting NATO and American forces everywhere
      on its western borders or going to war to prevent this. Russia quite predictably
      chose war, though it limited this to what it called a “special military operation.”
      Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was followed within weeks by a draft treaty in which
      Ukraine met the basic Russian requirements. But the West was more interested in
      “isolating and weakening” Russia than in a ceasefire. It persuaded Ukraine to
      repudiate what it had agreed to.


      The Ukraine War is now about to enter its fourth year. It has been catastrophic
      for Ukraine and humiliating for the West. Ukraine is on its last legs, depopulated,
      deindustrialized, depleted of military manpower, shorn of its democracy, bankrupt,
      and territorially reduced. Meanwhile, Russia has not been isolated or weakened.
      It has continued to limit its objectives, but its terms for peace are hardening.
      Ukraine’s options continue to narrow.


      Russia will not cease to insist on a Ukraine that does not threaten it and a broader
      framework for peace in Europe. There will be no ceasefire or Korean-style “demilitarized
      zone” between Russia and the West in Ukraine. The West has failed to prevail on
      the battlefield. It will not prevail at the negotiating table.


      The alternative to war in Ukraine is nothing less than a peace that sets agreed
      borders between Ukraine and Russia and prevents the division of Europe into mutually
      hostile blocs. Achieving this will require Russia and the West each to address
      and take actions to alleviate the other’s fears and suspicions. That will not
      be easy for either side. But it is time for both to try.


      An agreement to end the war has clearly been made more difficult by the ways in
      which the world has changed since it began.


      The United States has become a serial violator of the principle of PACTA SUNT
      SERVANDA (“agreements must be kept”). No one, least of all Russia, now trusts
      Washington to honor its word.


      The collective West’s shameless backing for Israel’s sadistic genocide in Palestine,
      attacks on its neighbors, and territorial expansion have made it clear that the
      Atlantic community no longer adheres to or feels bound by international law.


      The blatant double standards the West has applied to Ukraine and Palestine have
      cost it its moral authority with all the peoples it formerly colonized.


      The “global majority” sees Western policies as unjust. The promiscuous imposition
      by the United States and G-7 of sanctions and other coercive measures on other
      countries has resulted in their almost universal withdrawal of respect for Western
      leadership and willingness to follow it.


      Strained and worsening relations between the West and resurgent powers like Brazil,
      India, and China that are interested in helping broker peace in Ukraine ensure
      that they will be less supportive of the West than they might otherwise have been.


      The cumulative effect of these and other recent changes in the world order will
      be either mounting chaos or the emergence of a new international system in which
      renewed respect for the sovereign equality of nations and for their security concerns
      replaces the current global anarchy. How the war in Ukraine ends will determine
      which of these alternatives rules our future.'
    one_sentence_summary: Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. argues that the ongoing Ukraine
      War highlights the necessity of including all major powers, particularly Russia,
      in peace negotiations to avoid further conflict and chaos in Europe, as the West's
      refusal to address Russian security concerns has led to a catastrophic situation
      for Ukraine and a hardened stance from Russia.
    paragraph_summary: In his remarks to an international conference on the Ukraine
      conflict, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. emphasizes the critical importance of
      how wars conclude, drawing parallels to historical conflicts and their resolutions.
      He argues that the exclusion of major powers like Russia from European security
      discussions has led to the current war in Ukraine, as Russia's security concerns
      were dismissed by the West. The ongoing conflict has devastated Ukraine and failed
      to weaken Russia, which continues to demand a peace framework that respects its
      security interests. Freeman warns that without addressing mutual fears and suspicions,
      the prospects for a stable European order are bleak, potentially leading to chaos
      or a new international system based on sovereign equality. He critiques the West's
      loss of moral authority due to perceived double standards and violations of agreements,
      suggesting that the resolution of the Ukraine war will significantly influence
      the future of global relations.

      Remarks to the Community Church of Boston


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      By Video, 4 October 2024


      There will always be an Israel. It is a theological ideal and mythic memory that
      has survived millennia in the minds of observant Jews. Some Christians link Jewish
      dominance of Palestine to the second coming of Christ and the End of Days. The
      multinational religious communities that profess Judaism will ensure Israel’s
      permanence as an idea. But both the Zionist State of Israel and the Jews who inhabit
      it are now in jeopardy. Palestine is where the humane values of Judaism have gone
      to die.


      An abbreviated history seems appropriate.


      The first Christians were Jews, but European Christendom never applied the brotherly
      love Jesus taught to the Jews in its midst. Instead, it classified them as socioreligious
      pariahs – an alien caste. Like the castes of India, Jews married only each other,
      had a distinctive religious identity, and were restricted to specialized socioeconomic
      roles. In the case of European Jews this meant occupations involving money lending
      and other sorts of financial engineering. European xenophobia, called “antisemitism”
      when directed at Jews, resulted not just in their persecution but in their occasional
      pillage and murder, for example by Crusaders preparing to conquer the Holy Land
      from its mostly Muslim inhabitants. It is fair to say that the Holocaust – the
      greatest atrocity of the 20th century among many – was less an innovation than
      the culmination of centuries of prejudice and persecution of Jews by other Europeans.


      Against this background, it is easy to understand the appeal of Zionism – an effort
      to transform Jewish religious identity into a national identity and to set up
      a state in which Jews would be a ruling majority rather than a vulnerable minority.
      Zionism’s proponents argued that Jews, like other European ethnolinguistic groups,
      were entitled to self-determination. Ironically, Zionism thus embraced European
      Christendom’s antisemitic designation of Jews not as adherents of a religious
      faith but as a “people” distinct from other Europeans.


      European antisemites thought it would be just dandy to get rid of the Jews in
      their midst. But where should they go? What better than to export them to one
      of European colonialism’s many overseas colonial dominions?


      Most of the original Zionists were not themselves religious but they judged correctly
      that locating their proposed state in the mythic homeland of Judaism – Palestine
      – would grant it a religious legitimacy it would otherwise lack. As Ilan Pappé,
      the noted Israeli historian, has quipped: they did not believe in God but insisted
      that He had promised Palestine to them. And, with the racist condescension typical
      of European imperialism, they ignored the presence of an indigenous population
      in their proposed homeland, describing Palestine as “a land without people” for
      the “people without land” that they were in the process of inventing.


      As the Ottoman Empire imploded during the First World War, Britain – in an act
      intended to undermine Jewish support for Germany – declared its support for “the
      establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,” provided
      that “nothing shall be done … [to] prejudice the … rights of existing non-Jewish
      communities” there.[1] But for the Jews colonizing Palestine the whole point was
      to establish Jewish supremacy there, not to affirm the rights of its non-Jewish
      inhabitants. A multifaceted Zionist campaign to dispossess the indigenous Palestinian
      Arab population was soon underway.


      In the late 1930s, the increasingly brutal Nazi persecution of Jews in Germany
      led to a surge in Jewish emigration to Palestine. This set off the 1936 – 1939
      “Great Palestinian Revolt” against both British rule and Zionist colonization.
      Britain reacted in 1939 by issuing a “White Paper” proclaiming a policy of establishing
      a Jewish homeland through regulated Jewish immigration to an unpartitioned, independent
      state of Palestine, which was to come into being within ten years.[2] Palestinian
      leaders feared this policy would dispossess them and firmly rejected it. For their
      part, armed Zionist settlers violently resisted its implementation, charging that
      it would put them at the mercy of Palestine’s Arab Muslim and Christian majority.


      Prior to World War II, most European Jews opposed Zionism or were indifferent
      to it. The Nazi Holocaust understandably convinced them that to protect themselves
      and their posterity from genocide they needed to set up an exclusively Jewish
      state in Palestine.


      After the war, with more desirable safe havens – like the United States – denied
      to them, a mounting flood of European Jews sought resettlement in Palestine. Zionist
      paramilitaries simultaneously launched violent campaigns against the British authorities,
      Palestinian Arabs, and Jewish dissenters. Their aim was to achieve self-determination
      and establish an exclusively Jewish state by ridding Palestine of its indigenous
      inhabitants. Their targets included civilians as well as security personnel, government
      figures, and infrastructure. (In 1991, Yitzhak Shamir, a participant in this terrorist
      campaign who had become the prime minister of Israel, justified Jewish terrorism
      on the grounds that the Jews, stateless and persecuted, had no choice but to engage
      in it. By contrast, he asserted, the Palestinians, are “fighting for land that
      is not theirs. This is the land of the people of Israel.”) Zionism’s morally blind
      sense of entitlement and reliance on terrorism against its opponents have never
      varied.


      In the face of this, in 1947, the British threw up their hands and tossed the
      problem of Palestine into the lap of the United Nations. The UN – then dominated
      by colonial powers – imperiously recommended the partition of Palestine into two
      states, one Jewish and one Arab, with the city of Jerusalem under international
      control. At the time, the population of Palestine was two-thirds Arab and one-third
      European Jewish. The UN plan nonetheless awarded fifty-six percent of the country,
      including most of its best agricultural land, to Jewish colonists, while allocating
      only forty-two percent of it to its native Arabs.


      Palestinian leaders, joined by every state in the region and newly independent
      India, opposed both partition and the UN plan for it as unfair. For newly independent
      states, the award of territory in Palestine to European Jewish settlers was a
      terminal affront as the age of racist Western colonialism sputtered to an end.


      Under intense pressure, including death threats from Zionist activists, the UN
      General Assembly voted to approve the plan. Zionist leaders accepted it, while
      complaining that it would burden their proposed state in Palestine with a forty
      percent Arab minority. They began planning to seize more territory and Jerusalem
      if they could.


      The British right to rule in Palestine was due to expire at midnight on May 14,
      1948. In April of that year, newly augmented Zionist forces began an offensive
      to secure the cities and territories the UN partition plan had allotted to the
      proposed Jewish state, to encourage its indigenous inhabitants to leave, and to
      position themselves to seize even more land if the opportunity presented itself.


      A few hours before the British began their scheduled withdrawal from Palestine,
      the World Zionist Organization proclaimed the State of Israel and mobilized its
      armed forces. The next day military contingents from Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and
      Iraq entered Palestine. In the ensuing conflict, Zionist forces – many of them
      battle-hardened by warfare in Europe – took not only the territory assigned by
      the UN to a Jewish state but sixty percent of the territory designated for Palestine’s
      Arabs. The new Israeli armed forces and Jewish militias conducted over seventy
      documented massacres of Palestinians and terrorized over 720,000 of them into
      abandoning their homes and fleeing to neighboring countries. Israeli forces also
      seized West Jerusalem, voiding its proposed status as part of an international
      city and complicating Jerusalem’s continuation as a point of pilgrimage for the
      world’s Muslims and Christians, for whom it was also a holy city.


      While Jews in the new state of Israel celebrated, those in the broader Arab world
      almost at once suffered the consequences of their European coreligionists’ violent
      expulsion of over half of Palestine’s Arab Muslim and Christian populations. Over
      the course of the next decade, the hate-filled reaction to this catastrophe –
      النَّكْبَة – in Arab countries led increasing numbers of Jewish Arabs to abandon
      their homes and flee to Israel. Israel’s surprise attacks on Egypt in 1956 and
      on Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in 1967 as well as its several invasions of Lebanon
      then cemented Arab enmity to the Zionist state, fomented Arab and Muslim antisemitism,
      and resulted in the departure of all but a few of the ancient Jewish communities
      in the Islamic world. Once in Israel, Arab Jews were indoctrinated in the evils
      of the European Holocaust and assimilated to a national culture based on fear
      of renewed slaughter of Jews by hateful antisemites – equated with the 99.08 percent
      of non-Jewish human beings.


      In its 1967 “Six Day War,” Israel gained control of all of Palestine, including
      East Jerusalem, as well as Syria’s Golan Heights. This marked a fateful choice
      for Zionism. Having invented a “Jewish people” to populate what it had proclaimed
      was “a land without people,” Zionists now faced the inconvenient reality that
      the land they had seized was, in fact, already populated. Israel could use its
      victory and its control of Palestine to dictate a basis for Israeli-Palestinian
      coexistence. Or it could persist in implementing policies designed to rid the
      West Bank and Gaza of its captive Arab populations. True to its Zionist origins,
      Israel chose to pursue the goal of eradicating all but a vestigial Arab Muslim
      and Christian presence in the Holy Land.


      In the territories of pre-1967 Israel, a system of apartheid evolved, in which
      the twenty-percent Israeli Arab Muslim and Christian minority is discriminated
      against, segregated from Jewish Israelis, and denied many of the benefits available
      to Jewish citizens. In the West Bank, martial law evolved into a Kafkaesque system
      of checkpoints that oppressed and atomized its Palestinian inhabitants by separating
      them into 165 or so disconnected enclaves and progressively evicting them to make
      way for Jewish settlements and outposts in hundreds of places selected for their
      military value to the Israeli occupation and its annexationist agenda.


      The cumulative result is the Israel of today, in which non-Jewish Arab Israelis
      are second-class citizens, Arabs in the occupied West Bank are disenfranchised
      and subject to Jewish settler and military terrorism, while the inhabitants of
      Gaza are being slaughtered and starved to death. As I speak, the extermination
      campaign in Gaza has been extended to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.


      Occupation brutalizes the forces conducting it. Israel has been no exception.
      As time has gone on, the Israeli occupation forces and the conscripts that man
      them have become ever less constrained by morality or empathy for those they violently
      oppress.


      In the beginning, Israel used pseudo-legal procedures to dispossess Palestinians
      in Jerusalem and the West Bank but, as time went on, it came to rely ever more
      on terrorism by Jewish settlers, aided and abetted by the Israeli military. It
      is now openly applying the murderous techniques it pioneered in Gaza to the West
      Bank and Lebanon.


      After the withdrawal of Israeli settlements from Gaza in 2005, Israel transformed
      it into the world’s largest concentration camp. It controlled Gaza with periodic
      invasions and massacres of its inhabitants in a policy that it sardonically called
      “mowing the grass.” On October 7 last year, Palestinians in Gaza – a persecuted
      people without a state of their own – responded by applying the logic of Yitzhak
      Shamir’s justification of Zionist terrorism to the Israeli settlers and military
      reservists on Gaza’s periphery.


      The Zionist state’s aim has been to create conditions so intolerable that Palestinians
      would voluntarily leave, transforming Palestine into the “land without people”
      it originally envisaged. In its effort to rid Palestine of its non-Jewish inhabitants,
      Israel has emerged as the world’s most brazen violator of the norms enshrined
      in international law and the post-war Geneva conventions. Ironically, the world
      enacted these conventions precisely to preclude a recurrence of the cruelties
      that the Nazis and Japanese militarists had inflicted on occupied populations
      during World War II – most notably the genocide of Europe’s Jews. With its behavior,
      Israel has turned the star of David on its flag into a global symbol not of resilience
      and redemption but of genocide and other crimes against humanity.


      Israel’s policies toward its captive Palestinian populations now blatantly violate
      the norms the post-war conventions enshrine. To cite a few obvious examples:


      Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention stipulates that an occupying power
      must not transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies,
      yet the Zionist state’s settlement of occupied Palestinian lands is still its
      central mission and activity. Some 720,000 illegal Israeli settlers have dispossessed
      and now lord it over Palestinians in the West Bank.


      The same article provides that “collective penalties and all measures of intimidation
      or terrorism are prohibited. Pillage is prohibited. Reprisals against protected
      persons and their property are prohibited.” Yet these measures are the very means
      by which Israel has long terrorized the inhabitants of both Gaza and the West
      Bank.


      Article 76 of the same Convention prohibits an occupying power from murdering,
      torturing, mutilating, beating, or otherwise brutalizing the population under
      its control. Yet Israel relies on such sadistic practices – including sodomy and
      rape – to punish Palestinian prisoners, many of whom are detained without charge.


      The separate Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
      of 1948 defines genocide as destroying a national, ethnic, racial, or religious
      group in whole or in part. It criminalizes this behavior, the conspiracy to commit
      it, public incitement of it, the attempt to commit it, or complicity in it. The
      government of Israel and its army are currently committing every one of these
      crimes. The foreign governments supplying Israel with arms and protecting it in
      the United Nations have yet to face formal charges at the Hague but are full accomplices
      in this genocide.


      The United Nations Charter demands that all states refrain from the threat or
      use of force against other states. Customary international law requires reprisals
      for violations of this prohibition to be proportional to the injury suffered.
      It restricts preemptive or anticipatory defensive actions to circumstances in
      which there is “a necessity of self-defense, instant, overwhelming, leaving no
      choice of means, and no moment of deliberation.” Yet Israel repeatedly retaliates
      disproportionately to any and all affronts, attacks its neighbors preemptively
      without regard to whether there is evidence of an imminent threat from them, and
      assassinates both their own officials and Palestinians on their soil.


      This is not, by any means, a complete list of Israel’s violations of international
      law and human decency. Israel offends these norms – to which the United States
      and Europe loudly proclaim allegiance – because it has Western backing to do so.


      The Zionist state has gotten away with criminally scofflaw behavior because:


      Europeans guilty of antisemitism, including aiding and abetting the round up and
      slaughter of Europe’s Jews, have conferred compensatory immunity on the Jews of
      Israel.


      A powerful, unregistered lobby in the United States and United Kingdom, directed
      by the Israeli government and funded by native Jewish plutocrats, has made it
      politically fatal to criticize the behavior of the Zionist state.


      The Western bloc in the UN Security Council – the United States, United Kingdom,
      and France – has shamelessly protected Israel by vetoing every and all attempts
      to hold it accountable for its outrageously illegal behavior.


      Until recently, Israel – aided by biased, self-censoring Anglo-American media
      – was careful to keep its gross violations of Palestinian human rights below the
      radar screen. But the October 7 breakout of Palestinians from their incarceration
      in Gaza inevitably focused global attention on the outrageous Israeli treatment
      of them that had inspired their criminal atrocities against Israelis just outside
      Gaza. Israel’s subsequent effort to exterminate the Palestinians in Gaza has indelibly
      shattered the image of Israeli and other Jews as eternal victims. The world now
      sees Israelis not as survivors of genocide but as vengeful perpetrators of it,
      heirs to the Nazis who sought to exterminate them as they now seek to exterminate
      the Palestinians. In much of the world, the Star of David has come to evoke the
      same revulsion as the Nazi swastika does in the West.


      Israel is not a casual scofflaw. Since its establishment, it has systematically
      sought to normalize behavior that contravenes international law. As a former head
      of the Israeli Defense Forces’ (IDF) Legal Department argued:


      “If you do something for long enough the world will accept it. The whole of international
      law is now based on the notion that an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible
      if executed by enough countries . . .. International law progresses through violations.”


      A colleague of his pointed out that:


      “The more often Western states apply principles that originated in Israel to their
      own non-traditional conflicts in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, then the greater
      the chance these principles have of becoming a valuable part of international
      law.”


      This Israeli strategy of “lawfare” has succeeded in eroding international law
      and eliminating American compliance with it. Tolerance of illegality abroad fosters
      tolerance of it at home and vice versa. American enablement of Israel’s brutal
      oppression of its captive Arab population and its wanton warfare on its neighbors
      has corrupted American politics and constitutional democracy in the United States
      as much as it has deformed American foreign policy.


      The result is the current U.S. advocacy of an autocratic, so-called “rules-based
      order” as an alternative to traditional consensus-derived international law. The
      United States and its close allies assert the right to proclaim the rules and
      decide to whom they should and should not apply. Might is once again to make right.
      The strong are to do what they can and the weak to suffer what they must. The
      world at large considers this approach, which the unconditional U.S. protection
      of Israel epitomizes for them, to be prima facie sociopathic.


      For Israel and its neoconservative sycophants in the United States, the ends justify
      the means, and the ends transparently equate to the establishment of Jewish supremacy
      not just in Palestine but in West Asia. Since its founding in 1948, Israel has
      steadily expanded without agreeing borders with either the Palestinians or its
      Arab neighbors. The stripes on the Israeli flag symbolize bodies of water – a
      river and a sea or another river. The uniforms of some Israeli troops are adorned
      with a notorious map that depicts the State of Israel as extending from the Euphrates
      to the Nile. This reflects the belief of religious Zionists that God once promised
      this vast territory, consisting of part of Egypt, most of Iraq, all of Jordan,
      Lebanon, and Syria as well as northern Saudi Arabia to the Jews. This is a vision
      of depopulation through slaughter.


      Israel now exists. Does Israel justly claim “a right to exist?” Not if that implies
      that no one else has the right to exist “between the river and the sea.” Does
      it deserve to exist? Not if its existence depends on sadistic violations of human
      decency and international law. Can the world tolerate the existence of a state
      that has institutionalized an ethnoreligious democracy that survives by dehumanizing
      and terrorizing a disenfranchised captive population, while aspiring to exterminate
      it? Can it fail forever to take action to stop Israel’s indiscriminate slaughter
      of Palestinians and Lebanese? What’s your answer to that?


      These questions have become, I believe, the transcendent moral issues of our times.
      The world is watching and weighing the amorality of American enablement of Israeli
      genocide, persecution, and ethnic cleansing of its captive Arab populations. America’s
      reputation and global leadership are at an historic nadir. Ever more Americans
      of conscience object to Washington’s complicity in Israel’s gross violations of
      human rights and international law.


      If there is no path to peace in the Holy Land, Israel’s state terrorism will inevitably
      stoke terrorism against it and the United States as well as the escalating opprobrium
      of Israel’s neighbors and the global majority. To preclude this, Israel now seeks
      a regional conflagration – an apocalypse from which its current government believes
      that, with American backing, it will emerge triumphant.


      The blank check we have given to Israel is not a strategy. It is a tragedy in
      the making. And it is one for which the world will justly hold the United States
      responsible.


      Let us not forget that U.S. taxpayers pay for the Zionist state’s misdeeds. Israel
      has been and still is by far the largest single recipient of U.S. foreign aid.
      In 1964, in return for financial support from wealthy Jewish American donors for
      his presidential campaign, then President Lyndon Johnson agreed to drop America’s
      post-Suez arms embargo on Israel. Since then, the United States has provided about
      $250 billion in military aid to Israel. Keeping Egypt at peace with Israel has
      cost the United States another $165 or so billion. Americans are responsible for
      Israel’s persecution of the Palestinians and wars on its neighbors in ways we
      are not in other countries whose evil behavior we do not subsidize but whose conduct
      we condemn.


      In normal times, Washington funds about fifteen percent of the Israeli defense
      budget, while unofficially suspending the Leahy law, which prohibits arms transfers
      to countries using them to violate human rights and international law. The International
      Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court have both found that that
      is exactly what Israel is doing. Washington has nonetheless continued to support
      Israel’s extermination campaign in Gaza, turned a blind eye to its pogroms in
      the West Bank, and backed its murderous attacks on Syria and now Lebanon with
      at least another $40 billion in emergency aid and over 50,000 tons of weaponry.
      The government of the United States is funding, arming, and excusing Israel’s
      inexcusable behavior toward both the Palestinians and its neighbors.


      The world is now calling Americans to account. Will we continue to exempt Israel
      from accountability for its gross violations of our proclaimed values, our laws,
      and international norms? Will we persist in allowing it to manipulate our elections
      to facilitate its suicidal policies? Will we continue to enable its campaign of
      genocide in Palestine and now Lebanon? Will we follow it into the wider war in
      West Asia that its current government persists in trying to ignite?


      I heard nothing at all about these questions at either of our major parties’ national
      conventions.


      What is to be done? And if we don’t demand that it be done, who will?

      currently at risk due to their policies towards Palestinians. Freeman outlines
      the evolution of Zionism, which arose from centuries of European antisemitism
      and aimed to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, often at the expense of the
      indigenous Arab population. He details the violent history of Zionist expansion,
      including the dispossession of Palestinians and the establishment of an apartheid-like
      system that discriminates against non-Jewish citizens. Freeman criticizes Israel's
      ongoing violations of international law and human rights, suggesting that its
      actions have transformed the global perception of Israel from a victim of genocide
      to a perpetrator of it. He concludes by highlighting the moral and legal implications
      of Israel's policies, warning that they undermine both its legitimacy and the
      broader principles of international law.

    text: 'Opening Remarks to a Workshop on China Policy


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      July 24, 2024


      [As delivered. Introductory comments omitted.]


      I’ve spent sixty years watching and dealing with China. Full disclosure. I do
      not share either the stated or unstated presuppositions that are driving our current
      policies. I do not believe that they form part of a coherent strategy. I do not
      think they will help Americans deal with China or the emerging world order of
      shifting power balances, in which the United States can no longer compete internationally
      with wealth and weaponry alone.


      I have lived through several wars in which Washington attributed objectives to
      the other side that they didn’t have.


      Deductive reasoning by analogy as opposed to inductive reasoning from empirically
      verified reality has a bad track record. It took a while but, in the end, we came
      to realize that the Korean and Vietnam Wars were not – as we had supposed – wars
      of conquest by either China or the Soviet Union. They were civil wars that lent
      themselves to becoming proxy wars. The fact that they were not in fact motivated
      by a strategic challenge to us by other great powers is why we were able to limit
      them.


      China is not Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, or the Soviet Union. China would love
      to see our hubristic global hegemony disappear. But it has no desire to assume
      the burdens we bear. It is not in search of Lebensraum, the annexation of its
      neighbors, or the imposition of its largely incomprehensible ideology on them
      or on us, still less the replacement of our global dominance by its own or that
      of any other overlord. “Heute Taiwan, morgen die Welt” does not compute. Leninism
      with Chinese characteristics is introverted, unlike the globally ambitious Soviet
      Communist Party (CPSU). China demands respect from its neighbors. It does not
      demand subservience from them or anyone else.


      We’ve picked a fight with China. We are in its face. For now, it is not in ours.
      Any fight will be mostly on China’s turf, not ours.


      Both deductive reasoning by analogy and self-fulfilling paranoia are dangerous.
      Both deny reality and, with enough charismatic effort, can be contagious. We profess
      to be defending China’s neighbors against it, but we have had to make a significant
      effort to persuade them to agree that they need us to do that. Most would rather
      we backed them as they come to grips with China’s return to wealth and power.


      In many respects, China now not only overmatches us, but is widening the gap.
      It produces thirty-six percent of the world’s manufactures to our one-sixth. Its
      domestic economy is one-third larger than ours in purchasing power. It lends the
      world $1 trillion or more each year, while we borrow more than that just to keep
      our government operating and our economy afloat. China has become the undisputed
      center of its region’s economy. It has more diplomatic representation in more
      places around the world than we do. And, of course, it now has a larger navy,
      a highly competitive air force, and the world’s most capable rocket force. China
      is, of course, no match for us in power projection capability but that is irrelevant.
      It is focused on defending its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and periphery
      against us, not crossing the Pacific Ocean to attack us. In anticipation of a
      showdown with us, it is building a very credible nuclear second-strike capability.


      Enough said.


      Declared policy and actual policy are seldom the same. We are not blind to the
      hypocrisy of others. We should not assume that they are blind to ours. To the
      extent that our China policy now has identifiable goals, our de facto objectives
      appear to be:


      To retard or reverse China’s rise to wealth and power, including its scientific
      and technological progress, thereby preventing the eclipse of our own.


      To deny China a sphere of influence in Pacific Asia or political or economic influence
      in other regions and countries.


      To perpetuate the political and strategic separation of Taiwan from the rest of
      China through a combination of overt military deterrence and covert subversion
      of any cross-Strait negotiation of unification.


      To limit Chinese dual-use exports to Russia for use in the production of weapons
      it might deploy in Ukraine.


      To delegitimize the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its ruling Communist
      Party (CPC) in hopeful anticipation of regime change in Beijing.


      The successes or failures of policies do not depend on their political righteousness
      but on their results. So far, our vociferous antagonism to China has:


      Nurtured a strategic partnership between China and Russia that looks very much
      like the Eurasian hegemonic coalition that U.S. strategists have always feared
      and sought to preclude. This partnership now leads the BRICS grouping and the
      Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which are merging into a rapidly expanding
      global coalition against U.S. hegemony.


      Boosted transfers of Russian weapons and military technology to China as well
      as joint Sino-Russian research and development (R&D) of weapons systems and activities
      in space, as symbolized by the plan for a joint Sino-Russian lunar base. We can
      no longer rule out the possibility that Russia will actively support a People’s
      Liberation Army (PLA) military operation against Taiwan.


      Transferred the U.S. role in shaping the evolving trade and investment regimes
      in Pacific Asia to China, Japan, and ASEAN. We have abandoned the Trans-Pacific
      Partnership (TPP) and its Japanese-sponsored successor, ignored the Regional Comprehensive
      Economic Partnership (RCEP), and sabotaged the World Trade Organization (WTO)
      while adopting national security-based protectionism and refusing to negotiate
      bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements (FTAs).


      Significantly increased the danger of a Sino-American war, including a possible
      nuclear exchange, over Taiwan. Current U.S. policies are diplomacy-free, leave
      no apparent path to peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, and rely exclusively
      on military support for Taipei that demonstrably provokes rather than deters Beijing.


      Turned territorial disputes between rival claimants in the South China Sea into
      a focus of Sino-American naval confrontation that risks the accidental outbreak
      of hostilities, while making no effort to promote the peaceful resolution of these
      disputes.


      Supercharged the Chinese effort to achieve scientific and technological supremacy.
      The Australian Strategic Technology Institute’s (ASTI’s) “critical technology
      tracker” reports that China has now seized the lead in thirty-seven of the forty-four
      technologies it tracks.


      Stimulated an intensified search by ever more nations for ways to avoid the dollar
      in trade settlement. Should they succeed, U.S. global hegemony will collapse,
      the American standard of living will abruptly fall, domestic inflation will reach
      catastrophic levels, and the U.S. national debt will become utterly unsustainable.


      We should honor the rule of holes. When in a deepening hole, stop digging. Our
      China policies are not keeping China down or pushing it back. They are doing the
      opposite, and they are at the same time progressively reordering the world to
      our disadvantage.


      We cannot afford continued hubris and complacency.


      It is a mistake to imagine that China policy can be fixed in isolation from overall
      U.S. grand strategy. A strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve a desired
      objective through the lowest possible investment of effort, resources, and time
      with the fewest adverse consequences for oneself. At the moment we have a determination
      to sustain our global primacy and our post-World War II sphere of influence in
      Pacific Asia but no strategy to accomplish this. Doubling down on military spending
      will not do so. Neither will isolating our economy from international competition
      with higher tariffs. We must consider not only what might sustain our global and
      regional hegemony but whether it is, in fact, sustainable, and, if not, what alternatives
      to attempting to do so will yet “insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
      common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty
      to ourselves and our Posterity.”


      In my view, that is what we should be discussing in this forum.

    one_sentence_summary: Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. argues that current U.S. policies
      towards China lack coherence and effectiveness, ultimately exacerbating tensions
      and failing to address the realities of China's rising power and influence, while

      to maintaining U.S. global primacy.
    paragraph_summary: In his opening remarks at a workshop on China policy, Ambassador
      Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the current U.S. approach to China, arguing that
      it lacks coherence and fails to recognize the complexities of the relationship.
      He emphasizes that China is not an expansionist power like Nazi Germany or the
      Soviet Union, but rather seeks respect and stability in its region. Freeman warns
      that U.S. policies aimed at containing China's rise have inadvertently strengthened
      its partnerships, particularly with Russia, and have escalated tensions, especially
      regarding Taiwan. He contends that the U.S. is losing its competitive edge in
      various domains, including manufacturing and technology, and that its strategies
      are leading to greater risks of conflict rather than effective deterrence. He
      calls for a reevaluation of U.S. grand strategy, advocating for a more nuanced
      and realistic approach to China that considers sustainable alternatives to maintaining
      global hegemony.

      Remarks to Chinese Attendees at the Cambridge Executive Leadership Program[1]


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      Visiting Scholar, Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown
      University


      By Video, 10 July 2024


      A new world order is coming into being. Many call it “multipolar,” but it is better
      described as “multi-nodal.”[2] A “pole” is the end of a line between two points.
      But the emerging order is a three-dimensional network, not a two-dimensional axis,
      or even a collection of axes. “Nodes” [节点] are places where many connections of
      diverse sizes and intensities originate, terminate, and intersect on differing
      vectors. Multi-nodal is a more accurate depiction of the geopolitical geometry
      that is now emerging.


      In the emerging, unfamiliar international system, countries interact and connect
      with each other in a multidimensional – not just a bilateral context – and in
      multiple, often inconsistent, ways. A nation may have poor political relations
      or military confrontations with countries with which it nonetheless has a lot
      of economic interdependence.


      This is a fair description of the current Sino-American bilateral relationship.
      Or, for that matter, Sino-Vietnamese relations, despite the two countries’ ideological
      similarity. Or, as in the case of U.S. relations with Vietnam, major ideological
      differences may coexist with a flourishing economic relationship and a modest
      amount of cautious geopolitical cooperation.


      This was the spirit of the recent meeting of the Chinese and Japanese premiers
      with the president of the Republic of Korea in Seoul. We will see more of this
      sort of complexity in relationships in future.


      To the dismay of anti-Chinese or anti-American zealots, the international interests
      and aspirations of China or the United States cannot be understood or predicted
      by reference solely to their bilateral interactions. Each connects to the other
      in varying ways, and each has complex interactions with other countries and groups
      of countries. Such countries and groupings connect in their own ways to still
      others. Important as the Sino-American relationship is, it is only part of the
      context in which Beijing and Washington interact and behave at home and abroad.


      After a century and a half of decline, China is today once again at the center
      of Pacific Asia. For the first time in history, it is also a world power – a nation
      whose interests and preferences must be acknowledged and addressed in the management
      of every human domain and activity. In its comprehensive global and regional influence,
      China now resembles the United States. As of 2024, there is no other great power
      with a claim to do so.


      But regional and middle-ranking powers are flourishing in the post-post-Cold War
      environment.


      Japan is a global power in economic terms and is cautiously returning to a leading
      role in the political and military affairs of Pacific Asia.


      Russia has global military reach but is not a major player in global trade and
      investment outside the energy sector.


      India is the hegemon in South Asia but currently has little influence beyond that
      region.


      Europe has global economic reach but is too disunited to act decisively even in
      its own region, still less beyond it.


      Britain and France retain strong but receding intellectual and cultural influence
      in their former imperial domains.


      The Arab world has no cohesion and remains unable to manage its own affairs effectively,
      still less those of others.


      Brazil, Ethiopia, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Poland, Saudi Arabia,
      South Africa, and Türkiye are growing in power in their regions but lack decisive
      global clout.


      All seek to increase their strategic autonomy. None is willing to subordinate
      itself to China, the United States, or any other potential overlord.


      So, the assertion that the international system and its dynamics are now defined
      by great power rivalry will not withstand scrutiny. This is a peculiarly American
      reaction to the progressive loss of U.S. dominance in every global domain other
      than the military. In a world no longer dominated by the bipolar order of the
      Cold War, all states have agency – the power to make a difference and to conduct
      themselves as they perceive their interests to dictate.


      The world does not share the Biden administration’s insistent conjecture that
      history is culminating in a great battle between democracy and autocracy. America’s
      obsession with democratic ideology arises not from foreign efforts to subvert
      constitutional democracy in the United States but from internal factors that are
      eroding democracy and the rule of law domestically. Constitutional democracy can
      only be built and sustained at home. It cannot be dismantled by foreign refusal
      to emulate it.


      The prerequisites for constitutional democracy include the combination of the
      rule of law with freedom of speech. This Western-invented composite has historically
      enabled debate among an informed citizenry so that they can advise and consent
      to government rulemaking. If the United States is becoming less constitutionalist
      and more authoritarian, as it is, this is disturbing to those who, like me, treasure
      the values of the European Enlightenment, but it is the result of decisions made
      by Americans, not manipulation by China, Russia, or any other foreign power.


      The Western concept of the “rule of law” (法制) is quite different from the Chinese
      Legalist theory of “rule by law” (以法治国), which is now almost everywhere de facto
      gaining ground. The ‘rule of law’ is a system in which rulers as well as citizens,
      institutions, and entities are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated,
      equally enforced, and independently adjudicated. “Rule by law” empowers a presumptively
      wise ruler to make rules that can remain unpublished, that are alterable on a
      case-by-case basis to produce desired results, and that do not constrain the ruler’s
      own decisions or behavior.


      “Rule by law,” as most clearly advocated by Han Feizi (韩非子), proposes a system
      of governance in which decisions by the ruler can and often should be made in
      secret and enabled by an explicit policy of keeping citizens uninformed (愚民政策)
      so that they cannot challenge their ruler’s dictates. This system defines any
      view inconsistent with the officially approved narrative as “disinformation” that
      must be suppressed. It repudiates due process, is subservient to political power
      and privilege, and allows the rules to be applied selectively, based on who did
      what to whom rather than what was done and whether it was right or wrong.


      These are quite different concepts of governance, and the world’s nations differ
      on which is most effective and desirable. These ideological differences matter.
      They manifest themselves in nations’ varied approaches to international interactions
      as well as in their views of the merits and legitimacy of domestic political systems.
      So be it. 百花齊放，百家爭鳴. “Let a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought
      contend.” As a great reformer once said, “practice is the sole criterion of truth”
      – “以实践为真理的唯一标准.”


      International law is the intellectual legacy of Western societies committed to
      the rule of law. It is the product of international consensus or of institutions
      like the United Nations created by international consensus that have been empowered
      to make rules governing the actions of sovereign states or interactions between
      them. It resembles the rule of law in that it represents community values, is
      not the product of the arbitrary dictates of a single nation or group of nations,
      is openly declared, embraces the concept of the sovereign equality of states,
      and has established standards and authorized quasi-judicial mechanisms for the
      non-violent resolution of disputes.


      The purpose of international law is to protect the weak against the strong. That
      is why its greatest champions today are nations that lack the power or ambition
      to impose their political or economic preferences on others.


      Ironically, given the historical U.S. role in promoting international law, the
      “rules-based order” now promoted by Washington is a modern version of “rule by
      law.” Han Feizi would recognize and approve of it. It supposes that the United
      States – or the United States plus the club of former imperialist powers called
      the “G7” – can make the rules, alter them at will, exempt themselves from them,
      and determine to whom else they do or do not apply. This system is rejected as
      illegitimate by the global majority, which much prefers one based on the United
      Nations Charter and the decisions of the international community.


      Meanwhile, the institutions of global governance created after World War II are
      disintegrating. The United Nations system has been unable to concert an effective
      response to war and state collapse, global warming, mass migration, pandemics,
      genocide, species extinction, nuclear proliferation, and other challenges to human
      existence. The Security Council is paralyzed. Regulatory regimes like the World
      Trade Organization have played a crucial role in fostering global prosperity and
      the expansion of the global economy but are now under attack and crumbling. The
      UN Charter and the international conventions that once constrained national behavior
      and made the world somewhat safe and predictable are now ever more widely flouted.


      Like constitutional democracy, respect for international law is now in retreat.
      It is unclear whether it will be displaced by a version of “rule by law” or by
      an anarchy in which, as Thucydides wrote, “the strong do what they can and the
      weak suffer what they must.” Sadly, Thucydides would not be surprised by what
      is happening in Ukraine, in Palestine, at the United Nations, or at the International
      Court at the Hague.


      If we cannot fix the UN, we must replace it, as we did the League of Nations.
      Sub-global institutions with less than universal membership, limited cohesion,
      uncertain authority, and no demonstrated capacity to address planetwide problems
      increasingly substitute for the global institutions and legal frameworks created
      by the international community after World War II. Sadly, my country will not
      lead the effort to reform these institutions or to preserve international law.
      Therefore, others must do this as best they can.


      America’s distraught response to its loss of economic and political primacy has
      been to adopt protectionist trade and investment policies and to militarize its
      foreign policy. But neither protectionism nor militarism can or will “make America
      great again.” And neither is an answer to hegemonic overextension – “trying to
      squash ten fleas at once with all ten fingers” – “十个手指按十个跳蚤“ – an absurd effort
      that is both futile and debilitating.


      In effect, in place of “reform and opening,” Washington has adopted a national
      politico-economic strategy of industrial constipation and hunger strike. Unable
      to compete with Chinese electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels, or wind turbines,
      it is barring them from the U.S. market. This may seem like an unprecedented response
      to the challenges posed by competition from advanced technology originating in
      a more dynamic foreign economy, but it is not.


      Walling out products with which the United States cannot compete recapitulates
      the bungled response of Qing China to its encounter with the industrial revolution
      in 1793. In that year, having inspected the wide range of innovative products
      presented at his court by a large British trade mission, the Emperor Qian Long
      [乾隆] dismissed the opportunity to leverage Western industrial prowess to China’s
      advantage, saying complacently that he and China already “[possessed] all things,”
      while condescendingly adding that he and China “set no value on objects strange
      or ingenious, and [had] no use for [such foreign] manufactures.”


      This smugly arrogant refusal to recognize the merits of opening China to trade
      with a rising West or to collaborate with foreign scientists, technologists, engineers,
      and mathematicians led to economic stagnation, military defeat, and internal disorder.
      It culminated in the overthrow of the very primacy and regional “Pax Sinica” that
      Beijing sought to preserve. Shutting the door to superior goods and services perpetuated
      China’s competitive inferiority and entrenched mediocrity rather than promoting
      self-improvement.


      Obviously, when self-reliance is overdone it can backfire. 闭门造车 – trying to manufacture
      everything yourself behind closed doors – is a losing politico-economic strategy.
      As the coarse but pertinent saying: 拉不出屎来不要站着茅房 – advises: “if you can’t crank
      out the crap, don’t fart around in the outhouse.” There is no reason to believe
      that Washington’s constipated response to the challenges posed by an economically
      dynamic and increasingly innovative China will lead to a different result.


      China now produces thirty-six percent of the world’s manufactures, and its economy
      is one-third larger than America’s in terms of domestic purchasing power. For
      the first time in two centuries, China has a convincing self-defense capability,
      but China’s major challenges to the world are not primarily military. An American
      military response to them will not overcome them. Still, the United States has
      chosen an almost exclusively military response to China’s return to wealth and
      power. Diversion of investment to forever wars, military buildups, and arms races
      with China and Russia has led to deteriorating U.S. domestic infrastructure, declining
      educational standards, disinvestment in scientific research and public health,
      and rising debt.


      In the nuclear age, no great power should wish to make an implacable enemy of
      another. But that is how Washington is currently treating both Beijing and Moscow.
      Meanwhile, the threat of nuclear escalation is demonstrably no longer an effective
      deterrent against conventional warfare between nuclear powers. Russia is the world’s
      most heavily armed nuclear power, but the United States has become engaged in
      a losing proxy war with it in Ukraine. India and Pakistan have fought each other
      despite their nuclear arsenals. But the risk of escalation to the nuclear level
      is serious. Just wait till a nuclear power faces a threat of defeat it regards
      as existential!


      It’s worth noting that no navy of any great power has fought a major battle in
      seventy-nine years. There have been no major amphibious landings since 1950 (seventy-four
      years ago). There have been no direct air battles between peer competitors since
      1954 in Korea, when the embryonic Chinese air force and north Korean planes piloted
      by Russians engaged in dog fights with the US Air Force. That was seventy years
      ago. Western combat experience against all but insurgencies is lacking.


      Everywhere but in Russia and Ukraine, awareness of how technology has changed
      warfare has made little headway against political posturing based on wishful thinking.
      All Western militaries are configured to fight opponents with inferior technology
      and no air forces or navies. All envisage short, victorious wars, not protracted
      wars of attrition. No Western economy has the industrial surge capacity or stamina
      to win a war of attrition against a “peer competitor.”


      A Sino-American war over Taiwan might decide the island’s status but, even if
      it did, it would lead to protracted hostility between China and the United States.
      A war of attrition or catastrophic mutual destruction through a nuclear exchange
      might prove unavoidable. The one certainty, should such a war occur, is the destruction
      of Taiwan’s prosperity and democracy, the elimination of its semiconductor and
      other advanced technology exports, and the loss by both China and the United States
      of the greater part of their respective navies and air forces. It is said that
      a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. For many reasons, the
      same is true of a Sino-American war over Taiwan.


      The United States now habitually substitutes coercive measures short of war for
      diplomatic dialogue. Sanctions and ostracism have displaced negotiation as the
      preferred American response to disagreements with other countries. But in international
      relations, as in warfare, one should never lose contact with one’s adversary.
      Empathy – 知己知彼 – [“knowing yourself and knowing your opponent] is as indispensable
      to success in diplomacy as it is to victory on the battlefield.


      The United States and its Western partners now routinely use unilateral sanctions
      to isolate countries and their economies, deny them access to trade settlement
      mechanisms, freeze or confiscate their government assets, bar their access to
      technology, curtail their exports and investments, prohibit transactions with
      them, and bar the issuance of visas to their officials and citizens. Sanctions
      create resentment and fuel the recalcitrance of their targets, while distorting
      markets and creating vested interests in their perpetuation. They entrench rather
      than solve problems, but they have a devoted following, especially in my country.


      The net effect of American sanctioneering and protectionism is to make the world
      ever less than the previous sum of its parts. The new U.S. stand on trade and
      investment:


      Substitutes geopolitical risk judgments based on national security paranoia for
      comparative price and quality as the basis for business decisions, thereby reducing
      global economic efficiency, growth, and prosperity.


      Exempts uncompetitive domestic oligopolies – which now dominate the American economy
      – from competitive pressures to produce better, cheaper products.


      Deprives U.S. producers of economically desirable production inputs and locks
      in inflation.


      Replaces quasi-judicial dispute settlement mechanisms in international trade with
      zero-sum contests of economic power.


      Undermines global monetary reserve and trade settlement systems and encourages
      the formation of competing currency blocks and exchange mechanisms.


      Divides the world into multiple segregated political and economic blocs, restricting
      trade and investment flows with other blocs or countries to the detriment of global
      prosperity and economic efficiency.


      Constitutes a pivot to further stagnation and technological decline, not a realistic
      approach to reindustrializing America.


      Drives the world toward attempted military rather than diplomatic solutions to
      problems, most of which cannot be resolved on the battlefield.


      The U.S. political elite portrays its new stance on trade and investment as consolidating
      alliance relationships while fending off unfair competition from foreigners. But
      from a global perspective what is happening is:


      the resurgence of civilizational states like China, India, Japan, and Russia.


      the strengthening renaissance of the Islamic world.


      the reassertion of strategic autonomy by France and other European powers.


      the rise of new middle-ranking powers like Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Korea,
      Mexico, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.


      the emergence of ASEAN as a significant independent factor in the global economy;
      and


      the beginning of Africa’s realization of its tremendous demographic and economic
      potential.


      This looks more like a G7 retreat into a defensive citadel than a reassertion
      of the global centrality of Atlantic civilization. It risks placing the West on
      the fringe rather than at the center of the future, marginalizing its previously
      dominant role in human progress as parallel international communities and orders
      emerge. The de facto isolation of the West from the global majority is exacerbated
      by worldwide ideological shifts as well as by behavior driven by the loss of self-confidence
      by the nations of the Atlantic world.


      The trends at work include the rise of religious zealotry in Christianity, Hinduism,
      Islam, and Judaism as well as radical shifts in the norms of social behavior in
      Western societies. Even as much of the world reaffirms traditional values, Western
      elites extol the virtues of gender fluidity, hedonism, and other aspects of so-called
      “wokeism,” which intolerantly demands tolerance of behavior long universally considered
      to be immoral.


      Meanwhile, the United States and the G7 continue to insist on the adoption by
      other countries of models of governance and rules the West itself seems to be
      abandoning. The domestic divisions, instability, and decadence of the United States
      and its G7 allies find expression in self-contradictory and ineffectual statements
      and actions abroad. The global majority sees Euro-American behavior on issues
      like the wars in Ukraine and Palestine as transparently hypocritical, based on
      double standards, and justified by narratives that belie visible realities. The
      countries that the West once colonized or dominated are no longer prepared to
      follow its lead in world affairs.


      In short, we are witnessing the end of a unified, Western-dominated global order
      and its replacement by a hodgepodge of collaborations and rivalries at the sub-global
      level. Something similar happened to cause the devastating chaos of the “Thirty
      Years’ War” in Europe. That was a disorder composed of warring states, much like
      the history of China before the Qin unification or India before Aśoka. But the
      “Thirty Years’ War” ended in the establishment in the Peace of Westphalia of a
      system of peaceful coexistence between multiple sovereign states that respected
      their cultural diversity. Its result is memorialized in the “five principles of
      peaceful coexistence.”


      The question for your generation and the next in China, the West, and the rest
      of the world is whether we can replicate that outcome and end our descent into
      anarchy. We need to craft a peace based on mutual respect for each other’s territorial
      integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each
      other’s internal affairs, tolerance, and equality and cooperation for mutual benefit.
      If we cannot not do this, we risk more than our prosperity. We risk our very existence.

    text: 'In a world of shifting power balances, Americans can no longer compete internationally
      with wealth and weaponry alone. We live in a world in which other nations no longer
      automatically defer to the United States. Our national margin for error has demonstrably
      narrowed. In several regions war has already replaced the Pax Americana. It threatens
      to do the same in still others. Our highly professional military remains peerless,
      but our diplomacy – our first line of defense – increasingly lacks traction. Our
      country needs to get a lot better at diplomatic reasoning and the practice of
      diplomacy. To match the professionalism of our competitors, we must professionalize
      our own diplomacy. But what is diplomatic professionalism?


      On Diplomatic Professionalism


      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      July 2024


      The members of professions warrant that they possess expertise that distinguishes
      them from amateurs. Lawyers, theologians, soldiers, and physicians affirm they
      can conduct and resolve disputes, parse indignation to extract right from wrong,
      apply force to impose their nation’s will on opponents, or sustain or restore
      health more effectively than lay, non-experts can. Their profession of unique
      competence in efficient problem-solving is the source and raison d’être of their
      authority.


      Every profession develops its own mode of reasoning and specialized vocabulary.
      The specialized knowledge of professionals is crystallized in doctrine drawn from
      the experience of previous generations of practitioners. The doctrines professionals
      espouse, and their distinctive associated vocabularies, define the questions with
      which they deconstruct issues, provide the tools of critical thinking with which
      they understand problems, and supply a menu of choices for dealing with relevant
      factors and interests.


      Diplomacy is a political performing art whose objective is to alter foreign behavior
      to the advantage of the diplomat’s government and homeland. The professed expertise
      of diplomats is the management of relations between states and peoples to advance
      and defend their nation’s interests and augment its security and well-being. To
      this end, diplomats use measures short of war, define feasible purposes for nonetheless
      necessary uses of force, organize or disrupt coalitions of foreign states and
      peoples, and translate the results of war or other forms of international competition
      into the most advantageous and sustainable modus vivendi possible.


      To advance the interests in their charge, diplomats seek to convince foreign decision
      makers that the choices they are urging them to make would be more beneficial
      than costly to their nation than those it otherwise might favor. To induce their
      interlocutors to agree to what they advocate, they employ both peaceful persuasion
      and reminders of the power of their state, including its potential to impose pain
      on its opponents. For adjustments in relations or behavior to last, diplomats
      must invent and arrange non-zero-sum outcomes that will be seen by the parties
      as superior to repudiating what has been agreed or resorting to subversion or
      the use of force.


      To formulate arguments that can persuade foreigners that it is in their interest
      to do what the diplomats’ government desires them to do demands skill at cross-cultural
      communication based on empathetic comprehension of foreign histories, political
      systems, cultures, languages, and perspectives. Such expertise is essential for
      diplomats to be able effectively:


      To advocate and promote foreign understanding of their state and society and its
      policies and beliefs,


      To persuade foreigners to identify their own national interests with those of
      the government the diplomats represent,


      To enable their own government to understand how best to protect and advance its
      interests in its interactions with others,


      To propose policies and programs and to carry out activities abroad to safeguard
      and promote the sovereignty, prosperity, security, and domestic tranquility of
      their homeland,


      To settle or mitigate disputes with foreign states and peoples,


      To build coalitions of foreign support for their nation’s policies and to weaken
      and divide competing coalitions, and


      To quell controversies and restore international tranquility by reconciling antagonists
      to the outcomes of conflicts and confrontations that they are tempted to resist.


      These tasks of diplomacy require acuity of observation and skill in negotiation
      as well as grounding in the principles and practices that make diplomacy a learned
      profession. These reflect thousands of years of recorded experience, transcend
      the differences between states and peoples, and define the profession of diplomacy.
      The lessons of millennia are ignored at a nation’s peril.


      Like lawyers, diplomats both negotiate the terms of contractual obligations and
      serve as advocates for the parties (in their case, governments) to disputes. But
      unlike lawyers, they cannot appeal to a judge, jury, or other third party to enforce
      agreements or sustain them. Moral or legal opinions may define the desired outcomes
      of disputes and inspire fervor in those seeking them, but they do not determine
      outcomes. The peaceful resolution of differences in international relations depends
      on diplomats bringing the parties’ perceptions of their national interests and
      relative power into alignment. If they cannot do this, the parties to international
      disputes will attempt to impose their desired outcomes unilaterally.


      The absence of supranational enforcement authority means that the understandings
      diplomats contrive must either be self-executing or voluntarily implemented. To
      be able to implement treaties and agreements, those who conclude them must convince
      domestic elites that they are more congruent with the national interest than available
      alternatives. This is true even on those rare occasions when the parties to disputes
      can be persuaded to submit them to a neutral third party for arbitration. The
      parties to an accord must be brought to see keeping their word as more advantageous
      to them and their interests than attempting to impose better terms by resorting
      to coercive, or subversive measures.


      A great part of diplomacy is the patient cultivation of friendships with foreign
      officials in positions of authority or likely in time to occupy such positions.
      To achieve this, diplomats must demonstrate empathetic appreciation of the distinctive
      norms, beliefs, and perceptions of those they seek to befriend and influence.
      They work with and among foreigners who, by definition, have notions and perspectives
      that differ from their own and those of their compatriots. They must show respect
      to people they do not believe deserve it, not as tribute to their character but
      as a demonstration of their own. Diplomats should never insult someone else unintentionally
      as this is generally, though not always, counterproductive. They must master the
      art of tactfully refraining from giving offense while avoiding the hypocritical
      endorsement of discreditable ideas and patterns of behavior. Tact is the knack
      of making a point without making an enemy. Hypocrisy begets both distrust and
      contempt.


      Diplomats understand that insisting on blaming one side or the other for a confrontation
      is more likely to entrench differences, exacerbate animosities, and reinforce
      confrontations than to reduce them. They are specialists in problem-solving that
      benefits their country rather than in humiliating the other side. While insisting
      that the government they represent is in the right, they habitually focus on determining
      what each of the parties could gain or lose from resolving their differences or
      setting them aside, rather than on assigning blame or extracting admissions of
      culpability.


      Overt threats tend to evoke recalcitrance rather than acquiescence in opponents,
      so diplomacy relies more on implicit menaces than on explicit threats or ultimatums.
      For the same reason, diplomats seek to discover and design affordable incentives
      for better behavior that can obviate a resort to coercive or punitive measures.
      Dismissing another state’s demands as non-negotiable ultimata rather than as an
      unacceptable initial bargaining position is a mistake, especially when these demands
      involve its vital strategic interests. Failing to test its position through dialogue
      can leave it with no alternative to the use of force.


      If international differences cannot be composed or resolved through negotiated
      compromise, diplomats typically seek a basis on which to set them aside for later
      resolution. This can provide opportunities to craft circumstances that will eventually
      cause the parties to see alternatives to ongoing or escalating confrontation.
      Sometimes refusing to negotiate is a form of negotiation designed to gain time.
      But acquiescence in impasse requires buttressing the status quo with military
      or other deterrent threats. This entails risks.


      Apparently disconnected trends and events can transform issues that had seemed
      deferable into matters of perceived urgency for one side or another. With time,
      unresolved disputes may become more, rather than less irritating and explosive.[1]
      The balance of power may shift, with one side gaining a convincing new capacity
      to impose a solution on the other. Abandonment of efforts to settle disputes with
      the potential to escalate or erupt into violence is therefore strategically unwise.
      This is especially true in the nuclear age, in which wars between nuclear powers
      risk escalation to levels that have the potential not just to destroy the combatants
      but to put an end to the human species.


      Even when differences between states seem irreconcilable, diplomats will seek
      to reduce the risk of confrontations leading to war or to limit the potential
      scope and consequences of conflict with reciprocal arms control and disarmament
      agreements. The prerequisite for a partial relaxation of tensions [détente] to
      manage risk is respect for the other side’s right to have views of its own – erroneous
      as they may appear – and de facto acceptance of them as an unresolved factor in
      interactions with it. The recognition and accommodation of clashing interests
      is essential to manage relations between states without warfare.


      War is the ultimate argument of statecraft and a not-infrequent response to a
      refusal by another state to negotiate. Its purpose is to compel adjustments of
      borders, behavior, and relations between states that cannot be achieved by mutual
      accommodation. Politicians start wars. Soldiers fight them. Diplomats limit and
      end them. War seeks to establish a new sustainable status quo – a peace — that
      is less threatening and more advantageous to the war’s initiator than the situation
      that it finds unacceptable. It is the negotiation of change by violence. Like
      any kind of antagonistic interaction, war requires those who engage in it to have
      a clear sense of priorities, distinguishing between aims that are essential and
      those that are merely desirable.


      Diplomacy embodies an ethos that requires issues to remain open to peaceful resolution
      through dialogue. Productive dialogue depends on perceived mutual reliability
      and trust. So, even when declaring war, diplomats bear in mind that they may be
      called upon to negotiate a post-war peace with the enemy. While their political
      masters may passionately denounce the enemy, diplomats must try to convey the
      reasons for the decision to go to war to the enemy’s representatives in as dignified
      and courteous a way as possible. All wars must end. Preserving respectful relations
      with adversaries enhances diplomats’ ability to obtain their acquiescence in new
      relationships when war ends. Conversely, menacing enemies with post-conflict punishment
      deprives them of any incentive to compromise or capitulate and therefore prolongs
      wars.


      War is a gamble. Those who start wars must first consider their minimal as well
      as their maximal objectives and how – whatever the outcome – they can end the
      war, on what terms, and with whom. Wars do not end when those who triumph on the
      battlefield proclaim victory but only when those who are defeated accept their
      defeat and resign themselves to the circumstances it has created. If the vanquished
      are decapitated and left without credible leadership, there will be no one with
      whom to make an effective peace. This is a common cause of postwar low intensity
      conflict and insurgency.[2]


      War is the province of militaries, but the formation and sustainment of alliances
      and ententes to conduct it is the domain of diplomacy. Diplomacy does not end
      when war begins, it sometimes provokes war, and it accompanies and supports it.
      War often involves complex logistical problems that depend on other countries
      agreeing to rights of transit, basing, the transport and storage of materiel,
      and legal immunities for forces engaged in these activities. The nation’s armed
      forces look to diplomats to help arrange such facilitation of their operations.


      The negotiation of terms for war’s termination, and the translation of battlefield
      results into stable postwar political adjustments in relations between the victors
      and the defeated are quintessentially diplomatic tasks. Diplomacy vindicates military
      sacrifices and consolidates battlefield achievements by translating them into
      a sustainable status quo. Former combatants must be brought to agree that, going
      forward, it is in their interest to acquiesce in the realities combat has produced,
      rather than to attempt to subvert or overturn the new status quo. In victory,
      magnanimity – appropriate restraint by the victors in their demands of the vanquished
      — is usually the key to sustainable outcomes. This is because war termination
      requires reconciling the vanquished to the losses they have suffered as well as
      satisfying the victor that it has gained what it wanted.


      Like physicians, with whom they share an ethic of doing no harm, diplomats soon
      learn that mitigating one problem will not eliminate the need to address others.
      Foreign affairs are an endless process in which the successful resolution of one
      issue as often as not complicates or creates still others. Every interaction on
      an immediate issue is also the negotiation of a longer-term relationship with
      an opponent and helps determine the extent to which future agreements with that
      opponent will be feasible. This is why diplomats take care not to deceive those
      with whom they deal. Trust, once forfeited, can never be fully restored.


      Diplomacy contributes to national well-being by exploiting unforeseen opportunities
      to advance state interests[3] or reducing wasteful defense spending through détente,
      arms control, or disarmament accords. A great deal of diplomacy consists of ensuring
      that the natural frictions inherent in relations between states and peoples are
      minimized and restrained,[4] that needless confrontations and blunders into warfare
      are avoided, and that when war does occur its scope and level of violence are
      appropriately constrained. Such risk management challenges the skills of diplomats
      at cultivating foreign counterparts and leaders and sustaining productive interactions
      with them as well as their relationships with their own government, which is inevitably
      focused more on managing the domestic politics of foreign relations than on those
      relations themselves.


      Diplomatic dialogue is the key to the fashioning of strategic relationships and
      the management of conflicting interests with foreign governments. Its conduct
      requires diplomats to approach the discussion of issues with firm objectives but
      an open mind about how best to achieve them and to keep their own views in reserve.
      It begins with their asking their interlocutors to explain how they see a situation
      at issue, how they believe it is likely to develop, whether they view this or
      alternative evolutions as likely to be helpful or hurtful to their interests.
      If so, why, and what do they plan to do to support desired outcomes or preclude
      unfavorable ones? Soliciting the views of those diplomats hope to persuade to
      do things they want them to do helps convince them they are being taken seriously
      and have something to gain by being reasonable. The insights they provide may
      also suggest how a diplomat can bring their views closer to his or her own government’s.


      If diplomatic dialogue reveals analyses and interests that are in part congruent
      with those of the diplomat’s government, the way is open for a discussion of what
      each side might do separately in parallel or together to promote the outcomes
      both aspire to shape. If it reveals differing analyses but compatible interests,
      diplomats will want to understand the unstated presuppositions that explain these
      analytical differences and seek to persuade the other side to reconsider them.
      If the two sides’ analyses are similar but their appraisals of the consequences
      for their nations’ interests differ, diplomats will want to consider how best
      to persuade the other side that its interests are not incompatible with those
      of their own government and are therefore not a plausible cause for discord.


      It is at the strategic level that diplomacy can make its greatest mark.[5] The
      instruments of statecraft are warriors, spies, and diplomats. “The art of statesmanship
      is to foresee the inevitable and to expedite its occurrence,”[6] while gaining
      and preserving every conceivable advantage for one’s state. Today, major, often
      unpredictable shifts in the balance of power and the pattern of international
      relations are occurring, international law is increasingly disrespected, and the
      limitations of the use of force and the risks of war escalating to Armageddon
      have never been more apparent. No world power now enjoys automatic deference from
      others. The alignments of many regional powers are in play.


      The crafting of a new strategic order conducive to peace is the diplomatic challenge
      of our times. This is a task for well-trained professionals, not for those attempting
      to deal with a world order they have yet to realize no longer exists, still less
      for untutored amateurs.[7]


      [1] A prime example of this is U.S. policies toward north Korea – the “Democratic
      People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK” – that have relied exclusively on military
      deterrence. In the absence of follow-up to the 1953 armistice, which called for
      the conclusion of a peace in Korea, endless confrontation has resulted in the
      emergence of a previously unthinkable danger of a Korean nuclear strike on the
      U.S. homeland. A similar focus on military deterrence by the United States accompanied
      by failure to promote a peaceful resolution of the Chinese civil war and the Taiwan
      issue has resulted in escalating risks of war, including a possible nuclear exchange,
      with the People’s Republic of China.


      [2] The anarchy and insurgency that followed the U.S. disbanding of the Iraqi
      government after invading Iraq in 2003 are a classic instance of this.

      [6] Talleyrand


      [7] As François de Callières put it three centuries ago: “Diplomacy is a profession
      by itself which deserves the same preparation and assiduity of attention that
      men give to other recognized professions. The qualities of a diplomatist and the
      knowledge necessary to him cannot, indeed, all be acquired. The diplomatic genius
      is born, not made. But there are many qualities which may be developed with practice,
      and the greater part of the necessary knowledge can only be acquired by constant
      application to the subject. In this sense diplomacy is certainly a profession
      capable of occupying a man’s whole career, and those who think to embark upon
      a diplomatic mission as a pleasant diversion from their common task only prepare
      disappointment for themselves and disaster for the cause which they serve. The
      veriest fool would not entrust the command of an army to a man whose sole badge
      of merit was his eloquence in a court of law or his adroit practice of the courtier’s
      art in the palace. All are agreed that military command must be earned by long
      service in the army. In the same manner it should be regarded as folly to entrust
      the conduct of negotiations to an untrained amateur.”'
    one_sentence_summary: In an era where the United States can no longer rely solely
      on military might and wealth to assert its influence, the article emphasizes the
      urgent need for the U.S. to enhance its diplomatic professionalism and skills
      to effectively manage international relations and conflicts.
    paragraph_summary: In a rapidly changing global landscape where the United States
      can no longer rely solely on its wealth and military might, the article emphasizes
      the urgent need for the U.S. to enhance its diplomatic capabilities to effectively
      navigate international relations. Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. argues that
      diplomacy, as a specialized profession, requires a deep understanding of foreign
      cultures, histories, and political systems to persuade other nations to align
      their interests with those of the U.S. The piece outlines the essential skills
      of diplomats, including negotiation, empathetic communication, and the ability
      to foster long-term relationships, while also highlighting the importance of managing
      conflicts and preventing wars through dialogue and strategic partnerships. Ultimately,
      the article calls for a professionalization of U.S. diplomacy to address the complexities
      of modern statecraft and to craft a new strategic order conducive to peace in
      an increasingly multipolar world.

      Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.)


      By Video, 15 June 2024


      Ladies and gentlemen:


      It is an honor to join the Schiller Institute in today’s conference. Someone must
      speak out for peace. Someone must advocate and organize diplomacy rather than
      war as the answer to the tensions now afflicting Europe. I commend the Institute
      and Helga Zepp-Larouche, its founder and leader, for speaking out and for convening
      us.


      We are here to sound the alarm about where the cycle of escalation and counter-escalation
      between NATO and the Russian Federation is taking Europe, Russia, and America
      and to consider what to do about this. Red lines have been drawn, then repeatedly
      abandoned. Each side has said it will not do this or that, and then gone ahead
      and done it. Now, in response to NATO backing direct Ukrainian strikes on targets
      deep inside Russian territory, Russia is not only striking back at strategic targets
      in Ukraine but threatening retaliation elsewhere. What has been a proxy war now
      risks becoming direct conflict between the United States, NATO, and the Russian
      Federation.


      The good news is that President Putin has said that, for now, he does not plan
      to retaliate against Western escalation of attacks on his homeland with his enormous
      nuclear arsenal. But it is a sign of how dangerous this moment is that he has
      announced that he will instead arm the enemies of the United States and other
      NATO countries involved in attacking Russia. It is unclear whether he means to
      restrict this reprisal to states or whether he will include nonstate actors. That
      is bad enough, but, given the short half-life to date of any red line involving
      Ukraine, his next retaliatory step could well be nuclear.


      Sometimes history is the product of strategic design, sometimes of miscalculations
      and blunders. The peace managed by the Concert of Europe was an artifact of statecraft.
      World War I was a mishap that ushered in almost a half-century of ruinous turmoil.
      Bretton Woods and the post-World War II order were the creations of statesmen.
      Ours is an age of irrational antagonisms born of strategic misjudgments and bungling.
      It is off to a dangerous start.


      There is renewed warfare between great powers in Europe and open antagonism between
      the United States and China. It is pointless to ask who is to blame. Future generations
      of historians will render judgments on this that transcend our current passions.


      The international system in which we have cooperated and prospered is disintegrating.
      For seventy-three years – from 1944 to 2017 – the world was mainly regulated by
      internationally agreed norms, obligations, and conventions grounded in the United
      Nations Charter. This system was originally advocated by Washington, though not
      necessarily always respected by it. It worked out well for the United States until
      many Americans thought it did not. Then a disgruntled American electorate elected
      a populist administration that was long on resentment of the constraints of the
      international order, untutored in statecraft, economically nationalist, and indifferent
      to critical foreign opinion.


      The current U.S. administration has doubled down on both its predecessor’s national
      security-based protectionism and its economic warfare against presumed adversaries.
      And it has doggedly sought to extend the American sphere of influence in Europe
      to the very borders of Russia, while dismissing Moscow’s objections and refusing
      to acknowledge, let alone address its strategic concerns. Russia has not ceased
      to propose negotiations to devise a security architecture in Europe in which it
      does not feel threatened by the United States and its European allies, and Europeans
      similarly do not feel threatened by Russia. The United States and NATO have consistently
      refused to talk with Russia about this.


      The stated war aim of the West is to “isolate and weaken Russia.” The results
      of this policy and the sanctions adopted to promote it have been:


      First, to decouple Russia from Europe and North America and reorient it toward
      China, India, the Middle East, and Africa.


      Second, to revive the Russian economy and deindustrialize Germany and other members
      of the European Union formerly dependent on Russian energy exports. In purchasing
      power terms, Russia now has the largest economy in Europe.


      Third, to double the size of the Russian defense budget, armed forces, and armaments
      production and to stimulate Russian development of counters to NATO’s military
      doctrines and weaponry.


      And fourth, to catalyze the alienation of the so-called “Global South” or “Global
      Majority” from the West and to isolate the West in global institutions.


      For Ukraine – whose abandonment of its neutrality provided the casus belli for
      Russia – the war has been a national catastrophe. Ukraine has lost one-third of
      its population and an entire generation of brave men of military age. It has already
      lost one-fifth of its territory and it lacks the capacity to prevent further losses.
      Its infrastructure has been devastated. Before this war, Ukraine was the poorest
      and most corrupt country in Europe. It has been further impoverished. War fosters
      corruption, and Ukraine is more corrupt than ever. Ukraine’s democracy has been
      superseded by martial law. Its political parties have been outlawed, its media
      nationalized, and its elections canceled. It is now more authoritarian than Russia
      and far less tolerant of ethno-linguistic diversity.


      The West’s proxy war on Russia has been a failure. It has enhanced Russia’s global
      influence and strengthened it militarily. It has not prevented Russia from gutting
      Ukraine. And it has raised rather than allayed fears of a wider war in Europe.
      It now threatens to go nuclear.


      You might suppose that what has happened would lead the West and Ukraine to stop
      reinforcing failure and to seek a diplomatic rather than a military solution to
      a situation that increasingly threatens not just the peace and prosperity of Europe
      but escalation to the nuclear level.


      But no. The United States and NATO are doubling down on a purely military approach
      to managing European security and relations with the Russian Federation. The West
      has no strategy that holds out any realistic prospect of regaining any of the
      territory Ukraine has lost. Ukraine is in danger of losing still more, possibly
      endangering its access to the Black Sea. And there is no war termination strategy.
      Instead, the West proposes to fight to the last Ukrainian and continues to dream
      of imposing a humiliating defeat on Russia – the very outcome that Russian military
      doctrine stipulates would justify Moscow’s use of nuclear weapons against its
      attackers. Meanwhile, President Zelensky has joined the West in insisting that
      there can be no negotiations with Russia to end the war.


      The course we are following is based on miscalculations and blunders. It is a
      march of folly that, if continued, leads only to tragedy. It is destroying Ukraine.
      It has taken us to the brink of nuclear war between the United States, NATO, and
      the Russian Federation. But it is not too late to take another path.


      Once before, the world trembled at the prospect of a nuclear exchange that would
      have made our planet uninhabitable. That was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.
      It led President John F. Kennedy to the conclusion that we should “never negotiate
      out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.” That is as sound advice today
      as it was sixty-two years ago.


      We should learn from the contrast between the way in which the Napoleonic Wars
      ended and how we ended World War I. The convenors of the Congress of Vienna were
      careful to include their former French enemy in the crafting of what became the
      Concert of Europe – an arrangement based on a balance of power that kept Europe
      largely at peace for a century. The victors in World War I excluded both Germany
      and Russia from any role in the management of the peace negotiated at Versailles.
      The result was World War II, followed by the Cold War. There can be no peace in
      Europe based on the ostracism of Russia or any other great European power.


      In many ways, the breakdown of the post-Cold War peace in Europe has brought us
      to what Chancellor Scholtz called a Zeitenwende – a turning point in history that
      demands the crafting of a new order in international relations. Helga Zepp-Larouche
      has likened this challenge to that faced by the nations of Europe after the Thirty
      Years War. It took protracted negotiations to produce the Peace of Westphalia
      and overcome the religious, territorial, and regime change impulses that had devastated
      Central Europe. The understandings that grew from that peace live on. They were
      affirmed by the newly independent states of the post-colonial era at Bandung in
      1955 in the form of the “Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.” These are mutual
      respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression,
      mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and co-operation
      for mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence. It is time for Europe, including
      Russia, to rediscover and adapt this diplomatic heritage to the challenges of
      the day.


      The outcome of the recent European Parliament elections suggests that Europeans
      are ready for new thinking about Europe’s future. Interestingly, it is the European
      Right, like the American Right, which is most disillusioned by the forever war
      in Ukraine and most dissatisfied with the economic decline of the West. There
      is a basis for something like the conferences in Münster and Osnabrück that crafted
      the Peace of Westphalia to explore and affirm principles for a new European order
      that can bring peace to Ukraine, refashion European-American relations to enhance
      European strategic autonomy, bring Russia back to an appropriate relationship
      with the rest of Europe, and create international understandings to sustain security
      and stability in Europe. But are there leaders with the imagination, drive, and
      diplomatic skills to accomplish this?


      We must hope there are. If there are not, the risks are high and the prospects
      dire. I look forward to a lively discussion among the distinguished participants
      in this conference.


      Thank you.'

    paragraph_summary: In his remarks to the Schiller Institute conference, Ambassador
      Chas W. Freeman, Jr. emphasized the urgent need for diplomacy over military escalation
      in the ongoing conflict between NATO and Russia, warning that the situation risks
      escalating into direct conflict and potentially nuclear war. He criticized the
      West's approach, which aims to isolate and weaken Russia, arguing that it has
      only strengthened Russia's global influence and military capabilities while devastating
      Ukraine. Freeman called for a reevaluation of strategies, advocating for negotiations
      that include Russia to establish a new European security order, reminiscent of
      historical peace agreements like the Peace of Westphalia. He highlighted the necessity
      of mutual respect and cooperation among nations to prevent further conflict and
      ensure stability in Europe, urging leaders to embrace diplomatic solutions before
      it's too late.
