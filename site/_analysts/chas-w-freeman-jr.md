    summary: "In his remarks at a conference on strategic challenges, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the ongoing war in Ukraine, characterizing it as part of a broader pattern of "forever wars" driven by unrealistic foreign policy fantasies. He argues that the conflict has not weakened Russia but has instead devastated Ukraine and failed to achieve Western objectives of isolating Russia or integrating Ukraine into a hostile alliance. Freeman emphasizes that without a realistic plan for peace, which acknowledges the realities on the ground and addresses Russia's concerns, the situation will remain dire, leading to further suffering and potential dismemberment of Ukraine. He calls for a reassessment of the West's approach, advocating for a framework that fosters unity and cooperation among European states, including Russia, to achieve lasting peace in the region."

    date: "2025-05-08 20:19"
    summary: "In his remarks at the Watson Institute, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the pervasive ideological bias in American perceptions of China, arguing that the U.S. government and public are largely influenced by misconceptions and prejudices that distort the reality of Chinese society and politics. He highlights the absence of meaningful dialogue between the two nations, exacerbated by hostile rhetoric from U.S. officials and China's own counterproductive diplomatic strategies. Freeman identifies various unfounded beliefs driving U.S. policy, such as the notion that China's political system is inherently illegitimate and poses a threat to global order, while also addressing the psychological impact of China's rise on American self-perception and national identity. He calls for a reassessment of these views, emphasizing that America's challenges stem from internal issues rather than external adversaries, and warns that continued antagonism towards China will not resolve domestic problems but rather deepen misunderstandings and conflict."

    url: https://chasfreeman.net/how-competitive-is-the-u-s-with-china/
    date: "2025-04-19 01:24"
    summary: "In his remarks to the Boston Community Church and East Bay Citizens for Peace, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the U.S. approach to competition with China, arguing that America is failing to renew its domestic economy and technology while simultaneously alienating allies through aggressive and self-sabotaging policies. He highlights the detrimental effects of protectionism, military posturing, and a lack of diplomatic engagement, which not only undermine U.S. global standing but also empower China to advance economically and technologically. Freeman warns that the U.S. reliance on military solutions, particularly regarding Taiwan, risks escalating tensions into a catastrophic conflict, emphasizing that a defensive Chinese military posture contrasts sharply with the U.S. offensive strategy. He calls for a reevaluation of U.S. policy to prioritize diplomacy over militarization, stressing that a war with China would have no winners and could lead to existential consequences."

    date: "2025-02-22 16:00"
    summary: "In his remarks to an international conference on the Ukraine conflict, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. emphasizes the critical importance of how wars conclude, drawing parallels to historical conflicts and their resolutions. He argues that the exclusion of major powers like Russia from European security discussions has led to the current war in Ukraine, as Russia's security concerns were dismissed by the West. The ongoing conflict has devastated Ukraine and failed to weaken Russia, which continues to demand a peace framework that respects its security interests. Freeman warns that without addressing mutual fears and suspicions, the prospects for a stable European order are bleak, potentially leading to chaos or a new international system based on sovereign equality. He critiques the West's loss of moral authority due to perceived double standards and violations of agreements, suggesting that the resolution of the Ukraine war will significantly influence the future of global relations."

    date: "2024-10-05 00:57"
    summary: "In his remarks to the Community Church of Boston, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. discusses the historical and contemporary challenges facing the state of Israel, arguing that while the idea of Israel as a theological and cultural entity will endure, the Zionist state and its Jewish inhabitants are currently at risk due to their policies towards Palestinians. Freeman outlines the evolution of Zionism, which arose from centuries of European antisemitism and aimed to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, often at the expense of the indigenous Arab population. He details the violent history of Zionist expansion, including the dispossession of Palestinians and the establishment of an apartheid-like system that discriminates against non-Jewish citizens. Freeman criticizes Israel's ongoing violations of international law and human rights, suggesting that its actions have transformed the global perception of Israel from a victim of genocide to a perpetrator of it. He concludes by highlighting the moral and legal implications of Israel's policies, warning that they undermine both its legitimacy and the broader principles of international law."

    url: https://chasfreeman.net/opening-remarks-to-a-workshop-on-china-policy/
    date: "2024-07-24 19:29"
    summary: "In his opening remarks at a workshop on China policy, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. critiques the current U.S. approach to China, arguing that it lacks coherence and fails to recognize the complexities of the relationship. He emphasizes that China is not an expansionist power like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, but rather seeks respect and stability in its region. Freeman warns that U.S. policies aimed at containing China's rise have inadvertently strengthened its partnerships, particularly with Russia, and have escalated tensions, especially regarding Taiwan. He contends that the U.S. is losing its competitive edge in various domains, including manufacturing and technology, and that its strategies are leading to greater risks of conflict rather than effective deterrence. He calls for a reevaluation of U.S. grand strategy, advocating for a more nuanced and realistic approach to China that considers sustainable alternatives to maintaining global hegemony."

    date: "2024-07-10 14:41"
    summary: "In his remarks to the Cambridge Executive Leadership Program, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. discusses the emergence of a new "multi-nodal" world order, which contrasts with the traditional "multipolar" concept, emphasizing the complex, interconnected relationships among nations that go beyond simple bilateral interactions. He argues that the geopolitical landscape is shifting, with China reasserting itself as a central power in Pacific Asia and the U.S. facing challenges to its dominance from various regional powers. Freeman critiques the U.S. approach of relying on sanctions and militarization, suggesting that this strategy is counterproductive and risks further isolating the West from a rapidly evolving global landscape. He highlights the need for empathy and dialogue in international relations, warning that the current trajectory could lead to increased conflict and a fragmented world order, where the West may find itself marginalized. Ultimately, he calls for a reevaluation of global governance structures and a recognition of the diverse political ideologies shaping international interactions."

    date: "2024-07-08 11:22"
    summary: "In a rapidly changing global landscape where the United States can no longer rely solely on its wealth and military might, the article emphasizes the urgent need for the U.S. to enhance its diplomatic capabilities to effectively navigate international relations. Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. argues that diplomacy, as a specialized profession, requires a deep understanding of foreign cultures, histories, and political systems to persuade other nations to align their interests with those of the U.S. The piece outlines the essential skills of diplomats, including negotiation, empathetic communication, and the ability to foster long-term relationships, while also highlighting the importance of managing conflicts and preventing wars through dialogue and strategic partnerships. Ultimately, the article calls for a professionalization of U.S. diplomacy to address the complexities of modern statecraft and to craft a new strategic order conducive to peace in an increasingly multipolar world."

    summary: "In his remarks to the Schiller Institute conference, Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. emphasized the urgent need for diplomacy over military escalation in the ongoing conflict between NATO and Russia, warning that the situation risks escalating into direct conflict and potentially nuclear war. He criticized the West's approach, which aims to isolate and weaken Russia, arguing that it has only strengthened Russia's global influence and military capabilities while devastating Ukraine. Freeman called for a reevaluation of strategies, advocating for negotiations that include Russia to establish a new European security order, reminiscent of historical peace agreements like the Peace of Westphalia. He highlighted the necessity of mutual respect and cooperation among nations to prevent further conflict and ensure stability in Europe, urging leaders to embrace diplomatic solutions before it's too late."
