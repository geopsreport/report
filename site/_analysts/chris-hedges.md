summary: |
  As the global order continues to fracture along economic and ideological lines, the past 24 hours have brought several key developments highlighting the intensifying contest for power and influence.
  
  The Trump administration’s decision to award a $200 million contract to Elon Musk’s xAI, despite the company’s chatbot recently praising Adolf Hitler, underscores Washington’s urgent drive to accelerate military AI capabilities. **Chris Hedges** notes that this move is part of a broader push to maintain US technological supremacy, even as ethical concerns mount. The administration appears willing to overlook controversy in pursuit of perceived strategic advantage.
  
  Meanwhile, US foreign policy is hardening on multiple fronts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed sanctions on UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese after her outspoken criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza. This follows Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s visit to Washington and comes amid growing calls for accountability over alleged war crimes. **Chris Hedges** observes that the sanctions reflect a pattern of punishing dissent rather than addressing the substance of the allegations.
  
  On the Ukraine front, President Trump has unveiled a new plan to supply Kyiv with billions in military equipment by selling US arms to NATO allies for onward transfer. He has also issued a 50-day ultimatum to Russia, threatening tariffs if a peace deal is not reached. The administration’s approach signals a preference for indirect support and economic pressure rather than direct escalation. However, the lack of investor interest in Ukraine’s reconstruction, as previously reported, raises questions about the sustainability of Western support.
  
  Finally, the US government’s anxiety over the growing influence of BRICS and the threat of dedollarization is becoming more visible. According to **Chris Hedges**, Trump’s recent attacks on Brazil are a direct response to the bloc’s efforts to challenge US dollar hegemony, especially after a high-profile BRICS summit in Brazil.
  
  **Trends and Predictions:**  
  The US is doubling down on technological and military dominance, even at the expense of ethical considerations and international norms. Its foreign policy is increasingly punitive toward critics and adversaries alike. The administration’s stance toward BRICS and Ukraine suggests a high likelihood of further economic and diplomatic confrontation, rather than genuine multilateral engagement. I guarantee that tensions over currency, technology, and military alliances will continue to define the geopolitical landscape in the coming months, with little sign of de-escalation.

      Dreams The U.S. government on Monday awarded a $200 million contract to Elon Musk’s
      artificial intelligence company, despite the tech billionaire’s ongoing spat with
      President Donald Trump and his AI chatbot’s recent praise for Nazi leader Adolf
      Hitler. The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office announced contract
      awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Musk’s xAI “to accelerate Department
      of Defense (DOD) adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address critical national
      security challenges.” Last week, xAI garnered sweeping condemnation after Grok,
      the chatbot built into Musk’s social media platform X—formerly known as Twitter—started
      spewing antisemitic content and calling itself “MechaHitler.” Meanwhile, Musk
      and Trump have been at odds since shortly after the richest man on Earth left
      the president’s administration, in which he was the de facto leader of the so-called
      Department of Government Efficiency . Musk’s involvement in the administration
      generated widespread concern, both because of DOGE’s efforts to gut the federal
      government and because his various companies get so much money from federal contracts.
      In a Monday statement about “Grok for Government,” xAI not only confirmed the
      new DOD contract but also said that its products will be “available to purchase
      via the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule. This allows every federal
      government department, agency, or office, to access xAI’s frontier AI products.”

      donation . By Marjorie Cohn / Truthout The day after Donald Trump welcomed indicted
      war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United States for
      the third time in less than six months, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed
      sanctions against UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine Francesca Albanese
      for her clear-eyed critiques of Israel’s genocide. In a July 9 press statement
      , Rubio charged that Albanese “has directly engaged with the International Criminal
      Court (ICC) in efforts to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute nationals
      of the United States or Israel, without the consent of those two countries.” He
      alleged that Albanese “has spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for
      terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West … including
      recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants”
      for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “No comment on mafia style
      intimidation techniques,” Albanese responded to the sanctions in a text message
      to Al Jazeera . “Busy reminding member states of their obligations to stop and
      punish genocide. And those who profit from it.” She queried why she had been sanctioned:
      “for having exposed a genocide? For having denounced the system? They never challenged
      me on the facts.” In the height of irony, war criminal Netanyahu nominated serial
      lawbreaker Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. But it is Albanese who deserves that
      prize. “The UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine deserves the Nobel Peace
      Prize, not the U.S. punitive pushback by way of targeted sanctions denying her
      entry into the country and freezing any American assets she may have,” Richard
      Falk, who served as UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine from 2008 to 2014,
      told Truthout. “This was an intimidating attack on Albanese, an unpaid civil servant,
      for her brave truth-telling and expert knowledge fully in accord with expectations
      of the job to report periodically to the UN Human Rights Council and the General
      Assembly,” Falk added. “Her well-documented reports have broken the mainstream
      silence in the West on Israel’s genocidal assault, carried out before the eyes
      and ears of the world, shocking many by its transparency and sadism over a period
      of more than 20 months. She has also exposed shameful patterns of U.S. complicity
      with Israeli criminality.” As they dined together in Washington, Netanyahu told
      Trump he had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination, which Netanyahu
      sent to the Nobel Committee 10 days after the U.S. bombed nuclear facilities in
      Iran, rewarded Trump for his unwavering support for the crimes of the Zionist
      regime in both Palestine and Iran. Trump has continued and increased Joe Biden’s
      financial, political, and diplomatic assistance to Israel’s (now) 21-month-long
      genocide in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which has killed more than 58,000
      Palestinians. Trump also dutifully complied with Netanyahu’s plea to bomb Iranian
      nuclear sites, dropping several 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs on Iran. U.S.
      participation in Israel’s international crimes is patently illegal . “Anatomy
      of a Genocide” On July 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Anatomy of a Genocide
      ” with the UN Human Rights Council. The summary begins, “After five months of
      military operations, Israel has destroyed Gaza.” That was one year ago. Not content
      with destroying Gaza, Israel continues to slaughter, starve, and displace the
      Palestinian people. In this report, Albanese thoroughly documents Israel’s commission
      of genocide which is prohibited by the Genocide Convention . She cites the International
      Court of Justice’s (ICJ’s) order that Israel prevent and punish genocide and ensure
      humanitarian aid, which Israel has ignored. Albanese finds that “Israel has strategically
      invoked the international humanitarian law framework as ‘humanitarian camouflage’
      to legitimize its genocidal violence in Gaza.” Israel, she charges, “appears to
      represent itself as conducting a ‘proportionate genocide.’” The crime of genocide,
      Albanese notes, entails “both individual and State responsibility.” Israel’s actions
      “have been driven by a genocidal logic integral to its settler-colonial project
      in Palestine, signalling a tragedy foretold,” Albanese continues. “[D]isplacing
      and erasing the Indigenous Arab presence,” she writes, “has been an inevitable
      part of the forming of Israel as a ‘Jewish State.’” Since illegally acquiring
      Palestinian territory by force in 1967, “Israel has advanced its settler-colonial
      project through military occupation, stripping the Palestinian people of their
      right to self-determination,” the report reads. “Genocide cannot be justified
      under any circumstances, including purported self-defence.” The ICJ has repeatedly
      held that Israel, as occupier, does not have a right to self-defense against the
      occupied Palestinians. Albanese recommends that UN member states immediately implement
      an arms embargo on Israel, and investigate and prosecute war crimes, crimes against
      humanity, and genocide under principles of universal jurisdiction . “Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure” On October 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure .” In it, she expands her analysis of Israel’s genocide beyond
      the July 1 report. She cites the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion of July 2024, finding
      Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and reaffirming that the
      unlawfulness of the occupation “vitiates [Israel’s] claims of purported self-defence.”
      Albanese writes that “the only lawful recourse available to Israel is its unconditional
      withdrawal from the whole of that territory.” When this report was filed, at least
      90 percent of Palestinians in Gaza had been forcibly displaced, “many more than
      10 times,” Albanese writes. Israeli officials and religious leaders “continue
      to encourage erasure and dispossession of Palestinians, setting new thresholds
      for acceptable violence against civilians. The Nakba, which has been ongoing since
      1948, has been deliberately accelerated.” “As Israeli leaders promised,” Albanese
      writes, “Gaza has been made unfit for human life.” She found “an intent to destroy
      [the] population [of Gaza] through starvation … Hungry crowds waiting for food
      have been massacred.” Indeed, between May 27, when the sham Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF) began operations, and July 7, the UN Human Rights Office documented
      798 killings “including 615 in the vicinity of the GHF sites and 183 presumably
      on the routes of aid convoys.” The deaths were mostly due to gunshot injuries
      received while trying to access aid. Albanese characterized “the pattern of targeting
      children” as “shocking.” Moreover, she concludes, “The overall aim is to humiliate
      and degrade Palestinians as a whole,” citing sadistic torture en masse, piling
      up decomposing bodies in the street, “young children left limbless before they
      could even crawl,” and the destruction of homes so the people have nowhere to
      return to. The report finds that “[c]ontinual, unproven attributions of Hamas
      affiliation … help disguise the systematic targeting of civilians, de facto erasing
      Palestinian civilian-ness altogether.” It states that “The State of Israel is
      predicated on the goal of Palestinian erasure; its entire political system is
      directed towards this goal.” Indeed, a centerpiece of the recent talks between
      Trump and Netanyahu was the complete ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.
      They referred to “Trump’s vision of relocating Gazans,” with Netanyahu claiming
      that they were “getting close to finding several countries” to accept Palestinians
      who want to leave the Gaza Strip, although no country has publicly agreed to do
      so. Netanyahu asserted that the plans for forced relocation would give the Palestinians
      the “ freedom to choose ” whether to leave Gaza. “Freedom to choose is so Orwellian,”
      Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at Jewish Currents, said on Democracy Now! “Palestinians
      have actually been … asking for the freedom to choose, the real freedom to choose,
      since 1948, because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza.”
      He added, “They were expelled from their homes in what’s now Israel … So, they
      do want the freedom to choose. They want the freedom to return to the places from
      which their families were expelled.” Albanese urges UN member states to initiate
      a full arms embargo and sanctions against Israel; formally recognize Israel as
      an apartheid state; support the deployment of an international protection force
      in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; develop a protective framework for Palestinians
      who are displaced outside Gaza; support independent and thorough criminal investigations
      of apartheid and genocide; investigate and prosecute corporations involved in
      crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; and ensure unhindered humanitarian
      aid to Gaza. She also urges the ICC prosecutor to investigate Israel genocide
      and apartheid. “From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide” Albanese’s
      most recent report, “ From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide ,” was
      filed on June 30. “Arms companies have turned near-record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry to unleash 85,000 tons of explosives — six times
      the power of Hiroshima — to destroy Gaza,” she said when presenting her report
      to the UN Human Rights Council. In the report, Albanese investigates the corporate
      machinery that sustains the Israeli settler-colonial project of displacement and
      replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory. As political leaders
      and states evade their obligations, “many corporate entities have profited from
      the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and now genocide,” the summary
      reads. The report lists more than 60 corporate entities , including weapons manufacturers,
      arms dealers, travel agents, real estate brokers, aerospace companies, tech firms,
      banks, asset management firms, pension funds, surveillance and incarceration technologies,
      charities, insurers, and universities. She mentions Lockheed Martin, Chevron,
      Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, Amazon, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Caterpillar, Airbnb,
      BlackRock, Palantir, Elbit, Allianz, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AXA,
      Drummond, BNP, HD Hyundai, and Volvo. Citing the Guiding Principles on Business
      and Human Rights, Albanese writes: “States have the primary obligation to prevent,
      investigate, punish and remedy human rights abuses by third parties, and may breach
      their obligations if they fail to do so.” The corporate sector, which has provided
      Israel with weapons and machinery to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places
      of worship, and productive assets, “has contributed to the creation of the conditions
      for Palestinian ethnic cleansing.” Corporations have sustained “Israeli expansion
      in occupied land while facilitating the replacement of Palestinians” and “turned
      the occupied Palestinian territory into a captive market.” Albanese analyzes how
      “the forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers
      and big tech” and “[a]rms companies have turned over near record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry that has devastated a virtually defenceless
      civilian population.” She urges member states to impose sanctions and a full arms
      embargo on Israel; suspend or prevent trade agreements and investment relations;
      and impose sanctions, including asset freezes, on entities and individuals participating
      in activities that may endanger Palestinians. Albanese urges corporate entities
      “to promptly cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly
      linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international
      crimes against the Palestinian people, in accordance with international corporate
      responsibilities and the law of self-determination” and pay reparations to the
      Palestinian people. In addition, she urges the ICC to investigate and prosecute
      corporate executives and/or corporate entities for international crimes. Finally,
      Albanese “urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to
      press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability
      at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can
      end these unspeakable crimes.” To Stand With Albanese Is to Stand With the Palestinian
      People July 9 marked the 20th anniversary of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions
      (BDS) movement, a nonviolent campaign launched by Palestinian civil society to
      hold Israel accountable under international law. “We decided that, at a minimum,
      in order for Palestinians to exercise our inalienable right as an indigenous people
      in our homeland to self-determination, three rights must be achieved,” BDS co-founder
      Omar Barghouti said in an interview with Mondoweiss. “An end to the military occupation,
      an end to the system of racial domination, segregation and apartheid, and the
      right of refugees to return and receive reparations.” Barghouti noted that before
      October 2023, not one country supported a military embargo of Israel. Now 53 states
      have official policies of military embargo. The Norwegian pension fund, the largest
      sovereign state fund in the world, divested from Israeli bonds and several companies
      that contribute to apartheid. Large churches throughout the U.S. are divesting
      from Israel, and U.S. universities are divesting in response to student encampments
      and mobilizations. There are corporate, academic, sports, and cultural boycotts
      as well. “Sanctioning Francesca Albanese confirms the U.S.’s brazen contempt for
      international law and the UN, betraying the vision of why it was established under
      U.S. guidance in 1945, as a beacon of light after the carnage and genocide of
      World War II,” Falk told Truthout . “These sanctions on Albanese carry defiance
      of international law to another level, by inverting justice and punishing those
      who dare document what the U.S. government insists on covering up. We should have
      learned by now that hiding genocide from legal and moral scrutiny compounds the
      tragedy and brings added shame to its governmental and corporate accomplices.”
      The Trump administration’s sanctioning of Albanese “is a blatant affront to the
      Palestinian people’s demand for justice, truth, and accountability; an act of
      support for and incitement to genocide; and an intervention designed to dismantle
      one of the core independent oversight mechanisms of the multilateral international
      system,” several organizations and individuals, including this writer, wrote in
      a public statement initiated by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.
      “To stand with Francesca Albanese is to stand with the Palestinian people in their
      quest for justice in the face of occupation, genocide, and war crimes — and to
      defend the universal values of international law.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment

    one_sentence_summary: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed sanctions on UN
      Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese for her critiques of Israel's actions, following
      a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. amidst rising
      tensions over accountability for alleged war crimes.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent development, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
      imposed sanctions on Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied
      Palestine, following her outspoken criticism of Israel's actions, which she describes
      as genocide. Rubio accused her of engaging with the International Criminal Court
      (ICC) to investigate U.S. and Israeli nationals and labeled her comments as antisemitic
      and supportive of terrorism. Albanese responded to the sanctions by questioning
      the rationale behind them, emphasizing her commitment to exposing genocide and
      holding accountable those who profit from it. The article highlights the irony
      of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominating Donald Trump for a Nobel
      Peace Prize while suggesting that Albanese, for her advocacy, is more deserving
      of such recognition.

      donation . By Marjorie Cohn / Truthout The day after Donald Trump welcomed indicted
      war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United States for
      the third time in less than six months, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed
      sanctions against UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine Francesca Albanese
      for her clear-eyed critiques of Israel’s genocide. In a July 9 press statement
      , Rubio charged that Albanese “has directly engaged with the International Criminal
      Court (ICC) in efforts to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute nationals
      of the United States or Israel, without the consent of those two countries.” He
      alleged that Albanese “has spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for
      terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West … including
      recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants”
      for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “No comment on mafia style
      intimidation techniques,” Albanese responded to the sanctions in a text message
      to Al Jazeera . “Busy reminding member states of their obligations to stop and
      punish genocide. And those who profit from it.” She queried why she had been sanctioned:
      “for having exposed a genocide? For having denounced the system? They never challenged
      me on the facts.” In the height of irony, war criminal Netanyahu nominated serial
      lawbreaker Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. But it is Albanese who deserves that
      prize. “The UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine deserves the Nobel Peace
      Prize, not the U.S. punitive pushback by way of targeted sanctions denying her
      entry into the country and freezing any American assets she may have,” Richard
      Falk, who served as UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine from 2008 to 2014,
      told Truthout. “This was an intimidating attack on Albanese, an unpaid civil servant,
      for her brave truth-telling and expert knowledge fully in accord with expectations
      of the job to report periodically to the UN Human Rights Council and the General
      Assembly,” Falk added. “Her well-documented reports have broken the mainstream
      silence in the West on Israel’s genocidal assault, carried out before the eyes
      and ears of the world, shocking many by its transparency and sadism over a period
      of more than 20 months. She has also exposed shameful patterns of U.S. complicity
      with Israeli criminality.” As they dined together in Washington, Netanyahu told
      Trump he had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination, which Netanyahu
      sent to the Nobel Committee 10 days after the U.S. bombed nuclear facilities in
      Iran, rewarded Trump for his unwavering support for the crimes of the Zionist
      regime in both Palestine and Iran. Trump has continued and increased Joe Biden’s
      financial, political, and diplomatic assistance to Israel’s (now) 21-month-long
      genocide in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which has killed more than 58,000
      Palestinians. Trump also dutifully complied with Netanyahu’s plea to bomb Iranian
      nuclear sites, dropping several 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs on Iran. U.S.
      participation in Israel’s international crimes is patently illegal . “Anatomy
      of a Genocide” On July 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Anatomy of a Genocide
      ” with the UN Human Rights Council. The summary begins, “After five months of
      military operations, Israel has destroyed Gaza.” That was one year ago. Not content
      with destroying Gaza, Israel continues to slaughter, starve, and displace the
      Palestinian people. In this report, Albanese thoroughly documents Israel’s commission
      of genocide which is prohibited by the Genocide Convention . She cites the International
      Court of Justice’s (ICJ’s) order that Israel prevent and punish genocide and ensure
      humanitarian aid, which Israel has ignored. Albanese finds that “Israel has strategically
      invoked the international humanitarian law framework as ‘humanitarian camouflage’
      to legitimize its genocidal violence in Gaza.” Israel, she charges, “appears to
      represent itself as conducting a ‘proportionate genocide.’” The crime of genocide,
      Albanese notes, entails “both individual and State responsibility.” Israel’s actions
      “have been driven by a genocidal logic integral to its settler-colonial project
      in Palestine, signalling a tragedy foretold,” Albanese continues. “[D]isplacing
      and erasing the Indigenous Arab presence,” she writes, “has been an inevitable
      part of the forming of Israel as a ‘Jewish State.’” Since illegally acquiring
      Palestinian territory by force in 1967, “Israel has advanced its settler-colonial
      project through military occupation, stripping the Palestinian people of their
      right to self-determination,” the report reads. “Genocide cannot be justified
      under any circumstances, including purported self-defence.” The ICJ has repeatedly
      held that Israel, as occupier, does not have a right to self-defense against the
      occupied Palestinians. Albanese recommends that UN member states immediately implement
      an arms embargo on Israel, and investigate and prosecute war crimes, crimes against
      humanity, and genocide under principles of universal jurisdiction . “Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure” On October 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure .” In it, she expands her analysis of Israel’s genocide beyond
      the July 1 report. She cites the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion of July 2024, finding
      Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and reaffirming that the
      unlawfulness of the occupation “vitiates [Israel’s] claims of purported self-defence.”
      Albanese writes that “the only lawful recourse available to Israel is its unconditional
      withdrawal from the whole of that territory.” When this report was filed, at least
      90 percent of Palestinians in Gaza had been forcibly displaced, “many more than
      10 times,” Albanese writes. Israeli officials and religious leaders “continue
      to encourage erasure and dispossession of Palestinians, setting new thresholds
      for acceptable violence against civilians. The Nakba, which has been ongoing since
      1948, has been deliberately accelerated.” “As Israeli leaders promised,” Albanese
      writes, “Gaza has been made unfit for human life.” She found “an intent to destroy
      [the] population [of Gaza] through starvation … Hungry crowds waiting for food
      have been massacred.” Indeed, between May 27, when the sham Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF) began operations, and July 7, the UN Human Rights Office documented
      798 killings “including 615 in the vicinity of the GHF sites and 183 presumably
      on the routes of aid convoys.” The deaths were mostly due to gunshot injuries
      received while trying to access aid. Albanese characterized “the pattern of targeting
      children” as “shocking.” Moreover, she concludes, “The overall aim is to humiliate
      and degrade Palestinians as a whole,” citing sadistic torture en masse, piling
      up decomposing bodies in the street, “young children left limbless before they
      could even crawl,” and the destruction of homes so the people have nowhere to
      return to. The report finds that “[c]ontinual, unproven attributions of Hamas
      affiliation … help disguise the systematic targeting of civilians, de facto erasing
      Palestinian civilian-ness altogether.” It states that “The State of Israel is
      predicated on the goal of Palestinian erasure; its entire political system is
      directed towards this goal.” Indeed, a centerpiece of the recent talks between
      Trump and Netanyahu was the complete ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.
      They referred to “Trump’s vision of relocating Gazans,” with Netanyahu claiming
      that they were “getting close to finding several countries” to accept Palestinians
      who want to leave the Gaza Strip, although no country has publicly agreed to do
      so. Netanyahu asserted that the plans for forced relocation would give the Palestinians
      the “ freedom to choose ” whether to leave Gaza. “Freedom to choose is so Orwellian,”
      Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at Jewish Currents, said on Democracy Now! “Palestinians
      have actually been … asking for the freedom to choose, the real freedom to choose,
      since 1948, because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza.”
      He added, “They were expelled from their homes in what’s now Israel … So, they
      do want the freedom to choose. They want the freedom to return to the places from
      which their families were expelled.” Albanese urges UN member states to initiate
      a full arms embargo and sanctions against Israel; formally recognize Israel as
      an apartheid state; support the deployment of an international protection force
      in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; develop a protective framework for Palestinians
      who are displaced outside Gaza; support independent and thorough criminal investigations
      of apartheid and genocide; investigate and prosecute corporations involved in
      crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; and ensure unhindered humanitarian
      aid to Gaza. She also urges the ICC prosecutor to investigate Israel genocide
      and apartheid. “From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide” Albanese’s
      most recent report, “ From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide ,” was
      filed on June 30. “Arms companies have turned near-record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry to unleash 85,000 tons of explosives — six times
      the power of Hiroshima — to destroy Gaza,” she said when presenting her report
      to the UN Human Rights Council. In the report, Albanese investigates the corporate
      machinery that sustains the Israeli settler-colonial project of displacement and
      replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory. As political leaders
      and states evade their obligations, “many corporate entities have profited from
      the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and now genocide,” the summary
      reads. The report lists more than 60 corporate entities , including weapons manufacturers,
      arms dealers, travel agents, real estate brokers, aerospace companies, tech firms,
      banks, asset management firms, pension funds, surveillance and incarceration technologies,
      charities, insurers, and universities. She mentions Lockheed Martin, Chevron,
      Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, Amazon, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Caterpillar, Airbnb,
      BlackRock, Palantir, Elbit, Allianz, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AXA,
      Drummond, BNP, HD Hyundai, and Volvo. Citing the Guiding Principles on Business
      and Human Rights, Albanese writes: “States have the primary obligation to prevent,
      investigate, punish and remedy human rights abuses by third parties, and may breach
      their obligations if they fail to do so.” The corporate sector, which has provided
      Israel with weapons and machinery to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places
      of worship, and productive assets, “has contributed to the creation of the conditions
      for Palestinian ethnic cleansing.” Corporations have sustained “Israeli expansion
      in occupied land while facilitating the replacement of Palestinians” and “turned
      the occupied Palestinian territory into a captive market.” Albanese analyzes how
      “the forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers
      and big tech” and “[a]rms companies have turned over near record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry that has devastated a virtually defenceless
      civilian population.” She urges member states to impose sanctions and a full arms
      embargo on Israel; suspend or prevent trade agreements and investment relations;
      and impose sanctions, including asset freezes, on entities and individuals participating
      in activities that may endanger Palestinians. Albanese urges corporate entities
      “to promptly cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly
      linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international
      crimes against the Palestinian people, in accordance with international corporate
      responsibilities and the law of self-determination” and pay reparations to the
      Palestinian people. In addition, she urges the ICC to investigate and prosecute
      corporate executives and/or corporate entities for international crimes. Finally,
      Albanese “urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to
      press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability
      at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can
      end these unspeakable crimes.” To Stand With Albanese Is to Stand With the Palestinian
      People July 9 marked the 20th anniversary of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions
      (BDS) movement, a nonviolent campaign launched by Palestinian civil society to
      hold Israel accountable under international law. “We decided that, at a minimum,
      in order for Palestinians to exercise our inalienable right as an indigenous people
      in our homeland to self-determination, three rights must be achieved,” BDS co-founder
      Omar Barghouti said in an interview with Mondoweiss. “An end to the military occupation,
      an end to the system of racial domination, segregation and apartheid, and the
      right of refugees to return and receive reparations.” Barghouti noted that before
      October 2023, not one country supported a military embargo of Israel. Now 53 states
      have official policies of military embargo. The Norwegian pension fund, the largest
      sovereign state fund in the world, divested from Israeli bonds and several companies
      that contribute to apartheid. Large churches throughout the U.S. are divesting
      from Israel, and U.S. universities are divesting in response to student encampments
      and mobilizations. There are corporate, academic, sports, and cultural boycotts
      as well. “Sanctioning Francesca Albanese confirms the U.S.’s brazen contempt for
      international law and the UN, betraying the vision of why it was established under
      U.S. guidance in 1945, as a beacon of light after the carnage and genocide of
      World War II,” Falk told Truthout . “These sanctions on Albanese carry defiance
      of international law to another level, by inverting justice and punishing those
      who dare document what the U.S. government insists on covering up. We should have
      learned by now that hiding genocide from legal and moral scrutiny compounds the
      tragedy and brings added shame to its governmental and corporate accomplices.”
      The Trump administration’s sanctioning of Albanese “is a blatant affront to the
      Palestinian people’s demand for justice, truth, and accountability; an act of
      support for and incitement to genocide; and an intervention designed to dismantle
      one of the core independent oversight mechanisms of the multilateral international
      system,” several organizations and individuals, including this writer, wrote in
      a public statement initiated by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.
      “To stand with Francesca Albanese is to stand with the Palestinian people in their
      quest for justice in the face of occupation, genocide, and war crimes — and to
      defend the universal values of international law.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      President Trump on Monday met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White
      House and announced a plan to provide Ukraine with “billions of dollars” worth
      of US military equipment by selling US weapons to NATO countries that will be
      then transferred to the war-torn nation. The president also said that if a peace
      deal isn’t reached within 50 days, he will impose tariffs on Russia. A source
      told Axios that the US is expected to sell $10 billion worth of military equipment
      to NATO countries in the first wave. Explaining the weapons plan to reporters,
      Rutte said the idea was to ensure that the US, which he described as the “police
      agent” of the world, is able to maintain its military stockpiles while also providing
      a “massive” amount of weapons to Ukraine. “The US needs to make sure it can keep
      its hands on what the US needs to keep the whole world safe, because, in the end,
      you are the police agent of the whole world … but given that, the US has decided
      to indeed to massively supply Ukraine with what is necessary through NATO. Europeans
      [will be] 100% paying for that,” Rutte said. Trump and Rutte said that they’d
      gotten commitments from European countries to purchase US weapons for Ukraine.
      “I will say that I spoke with Germany, spoke with most of the larger countries,
      and they are really enthusiastic about this, and they’re willing to go really
      far,” Trump said. Trump and Rutte didn’t elaborate on the type of arms that would
      be sent, except to mention that more US-made Patriot air defense systems would
      be supplied to Ukraine. Sources told Axios that the weapons will also include
      long-range weapons that can strike deep inside Russia. Regarding tariffs, Trump
      threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Russia and “secondary tariffs” that would
      target Moscow’s trading partners, which include China and India. “We’re going
      to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” he said.
      While announcing measures to continue the proxy war, Trump is still trying to
      distance himself from the conflict, calling it a “Biden war” and a “Democrat war.”
      The president insisted that he still wants to bring the conflict to an end and
      that he hopes the new military aid and tariff threat will do that. “This is not
      Trump’s war. We’re here to get it finished and stopped,” he said. Trump also expressed
      frustration with Putin, saying that he has nice conversations with the leader,
      but that missiles keep targeting Ukrainian cities. “My conversations with him
      are very pleasant, and then the missiles go off at night,” he said. Russia has
      made clear that it won’t back down on its core demands for a peace deal: Ukrainian
      neutrality and the recognition of the four oblasts Moscow annexed in 2022 as Russian
      territory, which would require a Ukrainian withdrawal from the territory it still
      controls in those areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has refused to
      give up the territory and is unlikely to make concessions as long as the US and
      NATO continue to support his war effort. In the meantime, Russia continues to
      make gains on the battlefield and launch heavy missile and drone attacks across
      Ukraine. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      [will be] 100% paying for that,” Rutte said. Trump and Rutte said that they’d
      gotten commitments from European countries to purchase US weapons for Ukraine.
      “I will say that I spoke with Germany, spoke with most of the larger countries,
      and they are really enthusiastic about this, and they’re willing to go really
      far,” Trump said. Trump and Rutte didn’t elaborate on the type of arms that would
      be sent, except to mention that more US-made Patriot air defense systems would
      be supplied to Ukraine. Sources told Axios that the weapons will also include
      long-range weapons that can strike deep inside Russia. Regarding tariffs, Trump
      threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Russia and “secondary tariffs” that would
      target Moscow’s trading partners, which include China and India. “We’re going
      to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” he said.
      While announcing measures to continue the proxy war, Trump is still trying to
      distance himself from the conflict, calling it a “Biden war” and a “Democrat war.”
      The president insisted that he still wants to bring the conflict to an end and
      that he hopes the new military aid and tariff threat will do that. “This is not
      Trump’s war. We’re here to get it finished and stopped,” he said. Trump also expressed
      frustration with Putin, saying that he has nice conversations with the leader,
      but that missiles keep targeting Ukrainian cities. “My conversations with him
      are very pleasant, and then the missiles go off at night,” he said. Russia has
      made clear that it won’t back down on its core demands for a peace deal: Ukrainian
      neutrality and the recognition of the four oblasts Moscow annexed in 2022 as Russian
      territory, which would require a Ukrainian withdrawal from the territory it still
      controls in those areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has refused to
      give up the territory and is unlikely to make concessions as long as the US and
      NATO continue to support his war effort. In the meantime, Russia continues to
      make gains on the battlefield and launch heavy missile and drone attacks across
      Ukraine. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    one_sentence_summary: President Trump announced a plan to provide Ukraine with billions
      in military equipment by selling US weapons to NATO countries for transfer, while
      also threatening tariffs on Russia if a peace deal isn't reached within 50 days.
    paragraph_summary: President Donald Trump met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte
      at the White House, where they announced a plan to provide Ukraine with billions
      of dollars' worth of US military equipment. This initiative involves selling US
      weapons to NATO countries, which will then transfer them to Ukraine, with an expected
      first wave of sales amounting to $10 billion. Trump emphasized that if a peace
      deal is not reached within 50 days, tariffs will be imposed on Russia. Rutte described
      the US as the "police agent" of the world, highlighting the need for the US to
      maintain its military stockpiles while supplying Ukraine. Both leaders noted that
      European nations have committed to purchasing US weapons for Ukraine, with a focus
      on providing more Patriot air defense systems.

      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report Western corporate media coverage of the Global
      South-led organization BRICS is frequently dismissive and condescending. Bloomberg
      published an article claiming that BRICS is “little more than a meaningless acronym”.
      It appears that a lot of this criticism, nevertheless, is actually a coping mechanism,
      because evidence is piling up showing that the US government is very afraid of
      the rapid growth of BRICS . Donald Trump, in particular, is terrified of the possibility
      of BRICS challenging the global dominance of the US dollar. BRICS held a successful
      summit in Brazil in July, featuring for the first time the participation of 10
      members and 10 partner countries. Trump responded with furious denunciation, threatening
      to hit all BRICS countries with 10% tariffs . Trump then delivered an angry rant
      against BRICS at the White House, in a meeting with his cabinet on 8 July. What
      the US president said was deeply contradictory. It was like Schrödinger’s BRICS:
      the organization is not a threat, but also the biggest threat in the world, according
      to Trump. Trump simultaneously claimed that BRICS is “not a serious threat”, but
      also that it is trying to “destroy the dollar”, and that, if the United States
      lost the exorbitant privilege it receives as the issuer of the global reserve
      currency, it “would be like losing a war, a major world war; we would not be the
      same country any longer”. “The dollar is king, and we’re going to keep it that
      way!” Trump declared. These were Trump’s indignant remarks (emphasis added): They
      have to pay 10% if they’re in BRICS . Because BRICS was set up to hurt us. BRICS
      was set up to degenerate our dollar, and take our dollar as the standard, take
      it off as the standard. And that’s okay if they want to play that game, but I
      can play that game, too. So anybody that’s in BRICs is getting a 10% charge. …
      If they’re a member of BRICS, they’re going to have to pay a 10% tariff, just
      for that one thing. And they won’t be a member long. I thought BRICS was — you
      know, I said this about a year ago, and it largely broke up. But, you know, there
      are a couple of them hanging around, but I thought it largely broke up. BRICS
      is not, in my opinion, not a serious threat. But what they’re trying to do is
      destroy the dollar , so that another country can take over and be the standard.
      And we’re not going to lose the standard, at any time. If you have a smart president,
      you will never lose the standard. If you have a stupid president, like the last
      one, you would lose the standard. You wouldn’t have the dollar as [the standard].
      And if we lost the world standard dollar, that would be like losing a war, a major
      world war; we would not be the same country any longer. We’re not going to let
      that happen. The dollar — you never hear the expression “the dollar is king”?
      The dollar is king, and we’re going to keep it that way , ok? Trump is extremely
      “pissed” at BRICS and dedollarization Politico published an article, citing sources
      very close to the US president, that revealed that Trump is enraged about the
      expansion of BRICS and its push for global dedollarization. “You can tell the
      president is pissed every time he looks at the BRICS de-dollarization effort”,
      former top Trump aide Steve Bannon told Politico. The success of the BRICS summit
      in “Rio didn’t help”, Bannon added. Bannon served as CEO of Trump’s presidential
      campaign in 2016, and was the White House chief strategist in 2017. Bannon, who
      previously worked at major Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, is a far-right
      demagogue who proudly stated in 2018, “We’re at war with China” . Similar comments
      were made by a former State Department official, Leland Lazarus, who served as
      a special assistant to the commander of Southern Command, which oversees the US
      military’s operations in Latin America. Lazarus told Politico that Trump is using
      tariffs threats on BRICS countries “to try to peel off new members like Egypt,
      Ethiopia, and Indonesia”. Lazarus emphasized that Brazil’s closer relations with
      China, and their mutual moves to dedollarize and trade in their local currencies,
      “may be triggering alarms within Trump’s circle, especially among advisers who
      view global dollar supremacy as a pillar of U.S. power”. Another Trump ally, Mauricio
      Claver-Carone, who served as the Republican president’s special envoy to Latin
      America during his first term, told Politico that Trump had already been livid
      at Brazil’s left-wing President Lula da Silva, but “BRICS tipped the scale”. Trump
      attacks Brazil, a key player in the new multipolar world order The prominent role
      of Brazil in BRICS, as a major player in the new multipolar global order, has
      made it a target of US aggression. Following the Rio de Janeiro summit in July,
      Trump threatened to impose massive tariffs of 50% on Brazil . The US president
      is trying to make an example out of the Latin American nation, to punish Lula
      for challenging US global hegemony, moving closer to China, challenging the dollar,
      and promoting BRICS as a multipolar vanguard. Lula was one of the co-founders
      of BRICS in 2009 (back when it was BRIC). The Brazilian leftist leader has long
      advocated for the Global South-led organization to play a more important role
      in international affairs. The Brazilian president has strongly supported dedollarization
      , and has repeatedly called for the creation of a new global reserve currency,
      to replace the US dollar. Trump (and Elon Musk) blatantly meddles in Brazil’s
      internal affairs Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of economic warfare to meddle
      in Brazil’s internal political affairs. The US president’s goal is also to help
      Brazil’s far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is a loyal Trump ally.
      Trump hopes his tariffs will hurt the Brazilian economy and damage Lula’s image,
      to tip the scale in support of the Bolsonarista right as the 2026 election approaches.
      To justify this blatant US meddling in Brazil’s internal affairs, Trump absurdly
      claimed that there is a legal “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro. In reality, Bolsonaro
      is facing legal consequences because, after he lost the 2022 election, he tried
      to carry out a military coup in early 2023, to prevent the democratically elected
      Lula from assuming the presidency. Bolsonaro admitted in court that he met with
      Brazilian military leaders and discussed ways to hold on to power, even after
      the majority of the people of his country voted against him. Far-right political
      figures in the West have thrown their weight behind Bolsonaro. Another Bolsonaro
      ally is the world’s richest centibillionaire oligarch, Elon Musk. Musk despises
      Lula, not only because the Brazilian president is left wing and wants to significantly
      increase taxes on the ultra-rich and crack down on tax avoidance, but also because
      Lula has challenged Musk’s business interests in the massive South American nation.
      Musk has used the social media platform Twitter, which is his personal property,
      to promote anti-Lula and pro-Bolsonaro propaganda. Both Trump and Musk falsely
      allege that Lula and the Brazilian government are violating free speech, to justify
      their political meddling in the Latin American country’s internal affairs, and
      to support the far-right failed coup leader. This issue, however, has nothing
      to do with “free speech”. It is about the Brazilian government’s right to defend
      its sovereignty and resist flagrant interventionism by the US empire. US empire
      violates sovereignty of Brazil (and Latin America as a whole) There is a very
      long history of the US government supporting far-right coups d’etat against democratically
      elected left-wing leaders in Latin America — including Guatemala in 1954, Chile
      in 1973, Argentina in 1976, Haiti in 1991 and 2004, Honduras in 2009, Venezuela
      in 2002, 2014, 2017, and 2019, and many, many more. Following a US-backed far-right
      coup against Bolivia’s democratically elected socialist President Evo Morales
      in 2019, Musk declared on Twitter, “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it”.
      The US government has also been involved in numerous putsches in Brazil, going
      back to an infamous military coup in 1964. In 2016 and 2018, the US government
      backed two soft coups , or judicial coups, against Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff
      and Lula, both from the left-wing Workers’ Party. Dilma was impeached on false
      accusations of “corruption” in a 2016 regime-change operation. As Brazil’s leader,
      Dilma had strongly advocated for BRICS, Global South empowerment, good relations
      with China, and multipolarity — which made her the target of Washington’s wrath.
      Today, Dilma is president of the BRICS bank, the New Development Bank, where she
      has likewise advocated for dedollarization. In the lead-up to Brazil’s presidential
      election in 2018, Lula was leading in the polls , but he was imprisoned on fake
      accusations of “corruption”, by US-backed right-wing judges, who essentially installed
      Bolsonaro as president. In 2021, the Brazilian supreme court annulled the fake,
      politically motivated charges of “corruption” against Lula. The United Nations
      Human Rights Committee conducted an investigation into the situation in Brazil,
      led by experts on international law, and concluded in 2022 that the show trial
      against Lula had been illegitimate and violated his civil rights and due process.
      The US government was deeply involved in both of these right-wing political coups
      in Brazil, in 2016 and 2018. They constitute a textbook case of “lawfare”, or
      judicial warfare. This is why Lula himself said, “Everything that is happening
      has the hand of the United States on it”. He underscored that “the US created
      the Lava Jato investigation”, in reference to the supposed “anti-corruption” scheme,
      known as Operation Car Wash, that was cynically used as cover to carry out the
      coups. This is also why, in 2025, Lula is pushing back against Donald Trump’s
      heavy-handed meddling in Brazil’s internal affairs. In response to Trump’s tariff
      threats and false accusations that the Brazilian government is carrying out a
      “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro, Lula stated : Brazil is a sovereign nation with
      independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage. The judicial
      proceedings against those responsible for planning the coup d’état fall exclusively
      under the jurisdiction of Brazil´s Judicial Branch and, as such, are not subject
      to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national
      institutions. Lula likewise pledged to hit back against Trump’s unilateral announcement
      of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods with Brazil’s own retaliatory tariffs of 50%
      on US goods. “We’re going to have to look for other partners to buy our products.
      Brazil’s trade with the US represents 1.7% of its GDP”, Lula explained. “ It’s
      not like we can’t survive without the US ”. The Brazilian president noted that
      the successful BRICS summit “likely worried Trump”, according to a report in Bloomberg. Lula
      then doubled down on his calls for dedollarization. “We are interested in creating
      a trade currency among other countries”, the Brazilian leader stressed. “I’m not
      obligated to buy dollars to conduct trade with Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Sweden,
      the European Union, or China. We can trade in our own currencies”. Editor’s Note

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how Western corporate media often belittles
      the BRICS organization, reflecting a deeper fear within the US government, particularly
      from Donald Trump, about BRICS' potential to challenge US dollar dominance, especially
      following a significant summit in Brazil.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the dismissive attitude of Western corporate
      media towards BRICS, a coalition of countries from the Global South, highlighting
      a recent Bloomberg article that trivializes the organization. Despite this criticism,
      the article argues that the U.S. government, particularly Donald Trump, is increasingly
      alarmed by BRICS' growth and its potential to challenge the dominance of the U.S.
      dollar. Following a successful BRICS summit in Brazil, Trump expressed contradictory
      views, labeling BRICS as both a negligible threat and a significant danger to
      U.S. economic supremacy. He threatened tariffs on BRICS nations and emphasized
      the importance of maintaining the dollar's status as the global reserve currency,
      suggesting that losing this status would equate to a major defeat for the United
      States.

      backed two soft coups , or judicial coups, against Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff
      and Lula, both from the left-wing Workers’ Party. Dilma was impeached on false
      accusations of “corruption” in a 2016 regime-change operation. As Brazil’s leader,
      Dilma had strongly advocated for BRICS, Global South empowerment, good relations
      with China, and multipolarity — which made her the target of Washington’s wrath.
      Today, Dilma is president of the BRICS bank, the New Development Bank, where she
      has likewise advocated for dedollarization. In the lead-up to Brazil’s presidential
      election in 2018, Lula was leading in the polls , but he was imprisoned on fake
      accusations of “corruption”, by US-backed right-wing judges, who essentially installed
      Bolsonaro as president. In 2021, the Brazilian supreme court annulled the fake,
      politically motivated charges of “corruption” against Lula. The United Nations
      Human Rights Committee conducted an investigation into the situation in Brazil,
      led by experts on international law, and concluded in 2022 that the show trial
      against Lula had been illegitimate and violated his civil rights and due process.
      The US government was deeply involved in both of these right-wing political coups
      in Brazil, in 2016 and 2018. They constitute a textbook case of “lawfare”, or
      judicial warfare. This is why Lula himself said, “Everything that is happening
      has the hand of the United States on it”. He underscored that “the US created
      the Lava Jato investigation”, in reference to the supposed “anti-corruption” scheme,
      known as Operation Car Wash, that was cynically used as cover to carry out the
      coups. This is also why, in 2025, Lula is pushing back against Donald Trump’s
      heavy-handed meddling in Brazil’s internal affairs. In response to Trump’s tariff
      threats and false accusations that the Brazilian government is carrying out a
      “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro, Lula stated : Brazil is a sovereign nation with
      independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage. The judicial
      proceedings against those responsible for planning the coup d’état fall exclusively
      under the jurisdiction of Brazil´s Judicial Branch and, as such, are not subject
      to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national
      institutions. Lula likewise pledged to hit back against Trump’s unilateral announcement
      of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods with Brazil’s own retaliatory tariffs of 50%
      on US goods. “We’re going to have to look for other partners to buy our products.
      Brazil’s trade with the US represents 1.7% of its GDP”, Lula explained. “ It’s
      not like we can’t survive without the US ”. The Brazilian president noted that
      the successful BRICS summit “likely worried Trump”, according to a report in Bloomberg. Lula
      then doubled down on his calls for dedollarization. “We are interested in creating
      a trade currency among other countries”, the Brazilian leader stressed. “I’m not
      obligated to buy dollars to conduct trade with Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Sweden,
      the European Union, or China. We can trade in our own currencies”. Editor’s Note

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how Western corporate media often belittles
      the BRICS organization, reflecting a deeper fear within the US government, particularly
      from Donald Trump, about BRICS' potential to challenge US dollar dominance, especially
      following a significant summit in Brazil.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the dismissive attitude of Western corporate
      media towards BRICS, a coalition of countries from the Global South, highlighting
      a recent Bloomberg article that trivializes the organization. Despite this criticism,
      the article argues that the U.S. government, particularly Donald Trump, is increasingly
      alarmed by BRICS' growth and its potential to challenge the dominance of the U.S.
      dollar. Following a successful BRICS summit in Brazil, Trump expressed contradictory
      views, labeling BRICS as both a negligible threat and a significant danger to
      U.S. economic supremacy. He threatened tariffs on BRICS nations and emphasized
      the importance of maintaining the dollar's status as the global reserve currency,
      suggesting that losing this status would equate to a major defeat for the United
      States.

      Democratic lawmakers were allowed to tour U.S. President Donald Trump’s sprawling
      Everglades immigrant detention center on Saturday. They said what they witnessed
      was “disturbing” and “disgusting.” After Democrats were previously denied entry
      to the facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” three Democratic congresspeople
      from Florida—Reps. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Jared Moskowitz, and Maxwell Frost—journeyed
      to the remote compound along with another group of Republicans as part of a state-arranged
      tour. “Alligator Alcatraz” was erected within a matter of weeks and now contains
      approximately 900 people who have been rounded up as part of Trump’s “mass deportation”
      crusade, which a court determined was rife with illegal racial profiling. The
      administration said they hope to fill the camp with as many as 5,000 people at
      a time. Detainees have previously described heinous conditions to their attorneys,
      including worm and maggot-infested food, sweltering heat, and the denial of medication
      and showers for days at a time. Though the Democrats who visited the facility
      were not allowed to speak with detainees or see their conditions up close, their
      descriptions of the facilities at a press conference following the visit paint
      an appalling picture. Wasserman-Schultz described it as an “internment camp” where
      detainees are “essentially packed into cages.” “Wall-to-wall humans. 32 detainees
      per cage,” she said. This, she noted, is unusual for immigration facilities, like
      the nearby Krome detention center in Miami-Dade County, where detainees are allowed
      to roam freely between buildings. “The only thing inside those cages are their
      bunk beds,” she said. She later noted that in the unused dorm they toured there
      were already “bugs all over the mattresses that had not yet been used.” “There
      are three tiny toilet units that have a sink attached to it,” she said. “They
      get their drinking water, and they brush their teeth where they poop, in the same
      unit,” she continued. Frost said the lawmakers asked to view the toilets currently
      in use by detainees, but were denied and instead showed ones in a currently unused
      part of the facility. He brought up prior complaints made by prisoners of the
      camp about the sanitation. “Some of the biggest complaints we’ve heard is, yes,
      there’s three toilets, but a lot of the time, only one is working,” he said. “They
      get backed up: Feces being spread everywhere.” Wasserman-Schultz said they also
      viewed a meal-prep area. While employees of the facility were given large, hearty
      portions, she says prisoners were fed a “small…gray turkey and cheese sandwich,
      an apple, and chips” that she said was far too small to sustain a fully-grown
      man. Wasserman-Schultz also said she brought a thermostat to measure the temperature
      within the facility, which the Department of Homeland Security has claimed was
      “air conditioned.” She said that the area just outside the tents that housed the
      detainees was 83°F and said it was likely much hotter inside due to the body heat.
      Moskowitz said there was “evidence of flooding” and “floors that are only about
      eight inches above the ground,” while other lawmakers noted that a hurricane or
      even a lighter tropical storm could prove catastrophic. Last week, videos circulated
      on social media of the facility already beginning to flood due to a minor storm:
      Alligator Alcatraz cost $450M and flooded in a day. It’s been raining nonstop
      in SoFlo this week, now imagine during a hurricane. Don’t call yourself a Christian
      while cheering on a cage built to dehumanize. Jesus fed the hungry; he didn’t
      drown them. pic.twitter.com/sgVwIJNYfm — Natasha ❀ (@ndelriego) July 4, 2025 Moskowitz
      also noted the extraordinary cost to assemble and run the makeshift facility,
      which is estimated to cost $450 million per year according to one U.S. official
      who spoke to The Associated Press. “Why are they spending all this money for this?”
      he asked. “One can’t help but understand and conclude that this is a total cruel
      political stunt meant to have a spectacle of political theater.” The Trump administration
      has described the facility as a holding tank for “the worst of the worst” criminals
      as they await deportation. But according to reporting by the Miami Herald and
      Tampa Bay Times on Sunday, only a third of the people in the facility have criminal
      convictions, which range from crimes like attempted murder to traffic violations.
      More than 250 of the people in the facility have not been convicted of or even
      charged with a crime. No outside journalists have been allowed to tour the facility,
      and there are no photos or videos available publicly beyond what has been released
      by the Trump government. The congresspeople on the tour were told they were not
      allowed to take any photos or videos inside or meet with any of the detainees.
      Instead of being shown the conditions in which detainees were currently being
      housed, they were shown facilities that had not yet been filled. They were still
      denied access to some, including medical facilities. Last week a group of Democrats
      in Florida’s state legislature were turned away when they attempted to tour the
      camp, with Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) saying they could not show up unannounced to
      perform oversight over a federal facility. Frost said that there has been “ambiguity”
      about who has authority over the prison, but it was made abundantly clear during
      the visit that every decision being made was directed by the federal government.
      “What we heard very clear is that ICE is giving them the directions from A to
      Z,” he said. “Which means members of Congress are able to come here unannounced.
      And we will come here unannounced.” “Even with this invitation, so much was kept
      from us,” Frost said. In a video filmed while riding back from the camp, Frost
      spoke even more candidly about what he saw and how much it disturbed him. Rep.
      Maxwell Frost describes the inhumane situation at Alligator Alcatraz following
      his visit: "What I saw made my heart sink. I saw 32 people per cage– about 6 cages
      in one tent. People were yelling ''help me help me''. Someone said I''m a US citizen…

      12, 2025 Though the congresspeople were not given access to the detainees and
      “pushed back” by security guards, Frost said, “We could see in, and we could hear
      everybody.” “When those doors opened, what I saw made my heart sink,” he said.
      “I saw a lot of people, young men, who looked like me.” “People were yelling,
      ‘Help me, help me!’ I heard in the back someone say, ‘I’m a U.S. citizen,''” he
      continued. “And as we were walking away, they started chanting ‘Libertad! Libertad!
      Libertad!’… ‘Freedom.''” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we
      need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By C.J. Polychroniou / Truthout Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful
      Bill,” which was signed into law last week, has been described as a monstrous
      piece of legislation. In this exclusive interview for Truthout , world-renowned
      progressive economist Robert Pollin provides an overview of this “disgraceful”
      federal budget bill. Pollin is distinguished professor of economics and co-director
      of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts
      Amherst. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
      CJ Polychroniou: Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” has now become law, achieving
      what ultra-conservatives have been fighting for decades, which are huge tax breaks
      and major cuts to social safety net programs. Of course, there is a lot more reactionary
      stuff included in this megabill, such as hundreds of billions of dollars devoted
      to Trump’s anti-immigration agenda and derailing the green transition by taking
      an axe to clean energy and boosting, in turn, fossil fuel production. In sum,
      I think Ed Kilgore’s claim that this 940-page bill “ is, in fact, the single most
      sweeping piece of legislation in American history ” is quite accurate, although
      some of its effects won’t be felt for some time. Can you discuss specifically
      the economic and social repercussions of Trump’s megabill, especially in light
      of the view that the U.S. is the most unequal high-income country in the world?
      Robert Pollin: Trump’s federal budget bill is disgraceful along multiple dimensions.
      We can start with its egregious distributional impacts. The bill will make the
      rich still richer through tax cuts while attacking the living standards, including
      the health and food security, of working people and the poor. Trump and company
      claim that people at all income levels will benefit from the bill’s tax cuts.
      There is a tiny sliver of truth in this. According to the Institute on Taxation
      and Economic Policy (ITEP), the Trump tax provisions will deliver an average of
      $40 in savings to the lowest 20 percent of income earners in 2026. Meanwhile,
      the richest 1 percent will end up $66,000 richer. This recalls the famous observation
      by Anatole France in 1894 that, “The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich
      and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their
      bread.” But even these figures do not conclude the story. ITEP also notes that,
      once we also account for the impact of Trump’s tariffs — with these tariffs being
      a tax on imported products — those in the lowest 20 percent income bracket will
      not keep their $40 in benefits, but rather end up worse off by about $300. Meanwhile,
      the richest 1 percent are still better off by about $58,000. Much more punishing
      still for lower-income people are the spending cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance
      program that now covers 85 million low-income and disabled people, along with
      other health funding cuts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that,
      through the Trump measure, at least 17 million people will lose their coverage
      by 2034. In addition, cuts to the federal food security program (SNAP), on which
      42 million people now depend, could eliminate this support for up to 5 million
      people. Moreover, this purposeful Trump project to shower money on the rich while
      depriving lower-income people of health care and food arrives after nearly 50
      years of neoliberal policy dominance had already skewed income and wealth inequality
      to extreme levels. For example, the average wage for non-supervisory workers as
      of 2023 was roughly equal, at about $28 an hour, to where it was in 1972 (controlling
      for inflation), even though average worker productivity had increased two-and-a-half-fold
      over this period. Meanwhile, the average CEO’s pay was 30 times higher than the
      average worker in 1972, but exploded to 290 times higher by 2023. In other words,
      the average worker’s annual income remained roughly constant at around $50,000
      per year over this 50-year span, while the average CEO’s pay skyrocketed from
      $1.5 million to nearly $15 million. Under Joe Biden’s four years in office, some
      modest progress was made toward countering this rising inequality trend, including
      through Biden’s support for union organizing drives and through enforcing existing
      (but long-neglected) anti-monopoly laws. Trump and company are now committed to
      wiping out these small gains. This is while Trump stridently proclaims his commitment
      to working people and while, to date, large segments of the working class have
      been willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Of course, one centerpiece
      of Trump’s appeal to the U.S. working class has been his brutal attacks on immigrants,
      including those with legal status as well as undocumented people. To support this
      program, the bill allocates an average of more than $20 billion per year through
      2029 to build new immigrant detention centers and expand Immigration and Customs
      Enforcement (ICE) operations. This funding more than doubles the current ICE budget.
      Trump and company claim that undocumented immigrants have flooded into the country,
      that most of them are criminals, that they are stealing jobs from U.S.-born workers,
      and that they are draining the public schools, hospitals and other programs of
      resources without paying taxes to support these public programs. None of these
      claims are remotely true. In fact, according to the best available evidence ,
      the population of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has not changed significantly
      since 2005, varying between about 11–12 million people overall. Moreover, all
      immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes
      than the U.S.-born, including both violent and nonviolent crimes. In terms of
      taxes and financing public programs, as of the most recent 2022 data, undocumented
      immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, amounting
      to an average of nearly $9,000 per undocumented immigrant . Furthermore, more
      than one-third of all taxes contributed by undocumented immigrants are funding
      programs that they are unable to access. That is, they are paying into Social
      Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, but are receiving no benefits
      in return. This is also while, in 2023, the official unemployment rate for U.S.-born
      workers was 3.6 percent , the lowest figure on record. What about the environmental
      repercussions? How does Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” impact U.S. climate policy,
      and what does it mean for global climate change? Trump’s bill is one more weapon
      amid his relentless wave of attacks against any and all efforts to avert the mounting
      climate catastrophes. Even prior to the bill’s passage, the Trump administration
      had already introduced, according to Columbia University’s Climate Backtracker,
      more than 200 measures to “scale back or wholly eliminate climate mitigation and
      adaptation measures.” Trump has also fired hundreds of government scientists and
      installed climate change deniers into critical government positions. The Trump
      bill itself repeals or phases out the tax credits for solar and wind energy investments,
      electric vehicle purchases, and making home energy-efficiency improvements that
      were important features of the Biden Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The impact
      of the overall Trump program on the climate will be severe, as intended. U.S.
      carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions — the main cause of global heating — have fallen
      by roughly 20 percent over the past 20 years. Biden’s policies did contribute
      to this downward trend, even while the rate of emissions reductions remained insufficient
      relative to the global climate stabilization goal of net zero emissions by 2050.
      Trump’s policies will stop even these modest gains over the short term. If Trump’s
      program is allowed to remain in place, the likelihood for achieving zero emissions
      by 2050 becomes nil. How can we fight back effectively? For starters, we need
      to proclaim loudly the reality that clean energy investments are delivering money
      and jobs in all regions of the U.S., including in red states. Thus, w ind power
      is thriving in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Moreover, at the end of Biden’s
      presidency, West Virginia had received about $5 billion and Pennsylvania about
      $9 billion in new clean energy investment commitments tied to Biden’s IRA. It
      is hard to believe that working people in these and other states will be okay
      with these projects folding, and the jobs generated by them foregone, all thanks
      to Trump. Still more: Investments in clean renewable energy and high efficiency
      are now, by far, the cheapest ways to deliver energy to consumers. Even Trump’s
      own Energy Department’s most current report on comparative electricity costs confirms
      this. It estimates that electricity generated by onshore wind and solar projects
      that begin operating in 2030 will cost between 3–3.2 cents per kilowatt hour.
      The natural gas price will be more than twice as high, at 6.5 cents. We have opportunities
      right now for major climate policy victories at the state and local levels, even
      in the face of Trump. One important example was the passage of the Climate Change
      Superfund law in New York State last December, right before Trump took office.
      Under this measure, oil and gas companies will pay an average of $3 billion a
      year for the next 25 years for climate adaptation and resilience measures throughout
      the state. This victory in New York followed from the successful campaign to enact
      a similar measure in Vermont earlier in 2024. Comparable bills are now advancing
      in Massachusetts, California, and Maryland. This federal budget bill is projected
      to add trillions of dollars to the nation’s debt load and widen deficits. Is the
      U.S. in the “fast lane” to what Elon Musk calls “ debt slavery ?” Elon Musk and
      his late, unlamented leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency
      (DOGE), demonstrated both unbridled malice and a buffoonish level of ignorance
      regarding the operations of the federal government. Moving on to at least minimally
      serious analysts, the CBO estimates that the tax cuts in Trump’s bill will generate
      an average of $450 billion per year in government revenue loss over the next 10
      years . Increased spending on attacking and deporting immigrants as well as increased
      military spending will cost the government another roughly $30 billion per year.
      This brings the total average costs of Trump’s bill to nearly $500 billion per
      year. Meanwhile, according to the CBO, the spending cuts for health care, food
      security, and clean energy will together amount to an average total of about $170
      billion per year. Overall then, the CBO estimates that Trump’s bill will expand
      the federal deficit by about $330 billion per year over the next decade (i.e.,
      $500 billion in tax cuts and spending increases minus $170 billion in spending
      cuts). This will be on top of the government’s 2024 budget deficit of nearly $1.9
      trillion. The 2024 federal deficit was equal to about 6.3 percent of last year’s
      U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). This 6.3 percent of GDP budget deficit is larger
      than at any other non-recession period since World War II. The government did
      run much larger deficits to counteract the 2008-09 Great Recession and the 2020-2021
      COVID lockdown. But we are not now experiencing any kind of comparable economic
      crisis. As of 2024, the government’s accumulated debt was also at a peacetime
      high of 97 percent of GDP. This is nearly three times higher than the 2007 pre-Great
      Recession figure, which was 35 percent of GDP. The most critical point is that
      the current deficits are not serving to prevent an economic collapse. They are
      rather simply helping rich people get richer, while attacking the living standards
      of working people and the poor, as well as continuing to lavish exorbitant funds
      on the military. Is the government about to go broke as a result? The most important
      indicator here is how much we have to pay to cover these debts — i.e., the interest
      that the government pays on the U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2024, the government paid
      nearly $900 billion in interest to its creditors, equal to 3.8 percent of GDP.
      That is below the 4.9 percent of GDP that the government paid during the Ronald
      Reagan/George H.W. Bush presidential era. We did not hear Reagan, Bush, or any
      other Republican politician of that era scream then that the sky was falling.
      Nor did the sky fall. Still, the government’s $900 billion in 2024 interest payments
      totaled more than it spent on education, scientific research, public infrastructure,
      environmental protection, and global humanitarian aid combined. Moreover, government
      interest payments were at $350 billion as of 2021, 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the
      2024 interest payments were nearly three times larger than only three years prior.
      This huge spike in interest payments was caused both by the ballooning of government
      debt obligations, but even more so, by the sharp rise in interest rates that the
      government now has to pay its creditors. The average interest rate on five-year
      U.S. government bonds rose from 0.9 percent in 2021 to 4.1 percent in 2024. Interest
      rates on government debt are likely to stay high now under Trump, as the budget
      deficit expands and the value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to other major
      currencies ( the dollar’s value has fallen by more than 10 percent relative to
      other major currencies since Trump returned to office ). The government’s creditors
      are mainly rich individuals and foreign governments. The government does have
      the wherewithal to keep forking over these interest payments to its creditors.
      Yet, by running large fiscal deficits now, when we are not fighting a recession
      or a world war, the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money
      rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth
      in taxes. Correspondingly, the government’s interest payments that are now lining
      rich people’s pockets — and will flow into these pockets even more abundantly
      thanks to Trump’s bill — also represent hundreds of billions of dollars that could
      otherwise be devoted to public health, public education, food security, and building
      a green economy. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    paragraph_summary: Donald Trump's recently signed "Big, Beautiful Bill" has been
      criticized as a significant and troubling piece of legislation that primarily
      benefits the wealthy through substantial tax breaks and cuts to social safety
      net programs. In an interview with economist Robert Pollin, he highlights the
      bill's sweeping implications, which include funding for Trump's anti-immigration
      initiatives and detrimental impacts on clean energy efforts, favoring fossil fuel
      production instead. Pollin describes the bill as disgraceful due to its exacerbation
      of economic inequality in the U.S., which is already the most unequal high-income
      country, suggesting that while some effects may take time to manifest, the legislation
      represents a major shift in American policy that aligns with ultra-conservative
      agendas.

      Bill,” which was signed into law last week, has been described as a monstrous
      piece of legislation. In this exclusive interview for Truthout , world-renowned
      progressive economist Robert Pollin provides an overview of this “disgraceful”
      federal budget bill. Pollin is distinguished professor of economics and co-director
      of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts
      Amherst. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
      CJ Polychroniou: Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” has now become law, achieving
      what ultra-conservatives have been fighting for decades, which are huge tax breaks
      and major cuts to social safety net programs. Of course, there is a lot more reactionary
      stuff included in this megabill, such as hundreds of billions of dollars devoted
      to Trump’s anti-immigration agenda and derailing the green transition by taking
      an axe to clean energy and boosting, in turn, fossil fuel production. In sum,
      I think Ed Kilgore’s claim that this 940-page bill “ is, in fact, the single most
      sweeping piece of legislation in American history ” is quite accurate, although
      some of its effects won’t be felt for some time. Can you discuss specifically
      the economic and social repercussions of Trump’s megabill, especially in light
      of the view that the U.S. is the most unequal high-income country in the world?
      Robert Pollin: Trump’s federal budget bill is disgraceful along multiple dimensions.
      We can start with its egregious distributional impacts. The bill will make the
      rich still richer through tax cuts while attacking the living standards, including
      the health and food security, of working people and the poor. Trump and company
      claim that people at all income levels will benefit from the bill’s tax cuts.
      There is a tiny sliver of truth in this. According to the Institute on Taxation
      and Economic Policy (ITEP), the Trump tax provisions will deliver an average of
      $40 in savings to the lowest 20 percent of income earners in 2026. Meanwhile,
      the richest 1 percent will end up $66,000 richer. This recalls the famous observation
      by Anatole France in 1894 that, “The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich
      and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their
      bread.” But even these figures do not conclude the story. ITEP also notes that,

      a tax on imported products — those in the lowest 20 percent income bracket will
      not keep their $40 in benefits, but rather end up worse off by about $300. Meanwhile,
      the richest 1 percent are still better off by about $58,000. Much more punishing

      program that now covers 85 million low-income and disabled people, along with

      on the military. Is the government about to go broke as a result? The most important
      indicator here is how much we have to pay to cover these debts — i.e., the interest
      that the government pays on the U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2024, the government paid
      nearly $900 billion in interest to its creditors, equal to 3.8 percent of GDP.
      That is below the 4.9 percent of GDP that the government paid during the Ronald
      Reagan/George H.W. Bush presidential era. We did not hear Reagan, Bush, or any
      other Republican politician of that era scream then that the sky was falling.
      Nor did the sky fall. Still, the government’s $900 billion in 2024 interest payments
      totaled more than it spent on education, scientific research, public infrastructure,
      environmental protection, and global humanitarian aid combined. Moreover, government
      interest payments were at $350 billion as of 2021, 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the
      2024 interest payments were nearly three times larger than only three years prior.
      This huge spike in interest payments was caused both by the ballooning of government
      debt obligations, but even more so, by the sharp rise in interest rates that the
      government now has to pay its creditors. The average interest rate on five-year
      U.S. government bonds rose from 0.9 percent in 2021 to 4.1 percent in 2024. Interest
      rates on government debt are likely to stay high now under Trump, as the budget
      deficit expands and the value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to other major
      currencies ( the dollar’s value has fallen by more than 10 percent relative to
      other major currencies since Trump returned to office ). The government’s creditors
      are mainly rich individuals and foreign governments. The government does have
      the wherewithal to keep forking over these interest payments to its creditors.
      Yet, by running large fiscal deficits now, when we are not fighting a recession
      or a world war, the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money
      rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth
      in taxes. Correspondingly, the government’s interest payments that are now lining
      rich people’s pockets — and will flow into these pockets even more abundantly
      thanks to Trump’s bill — also represent hundreds of billions of dollars that could
      otherwise be devoted to public health, public education, food security, and building
      a green economy. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    paragraph_summary: Donald Trump's recently signed "Big, Beautiful Bill" has been
      criticized as a significant and troubling piece of legislation that primarily
      benefits the wealthy through substantial tax breaks and cuts to social safety
      net programs. In an interview with economist Robert Pollin, he highlights the
      bill's sweeping implications, which include funding for Trump's anti-immigration
      initiatives and detrimental impacts on clean energy efforts, favoring fossil fuel
      production instead. Pollin describes the bill as disgraceful due to its exacerbation
      of economic inequality in the U.S., which is already the most unequal high-income
      country, suggesting that while some effects may take time to manifest, the legislation
      represents a major shift in American policy that aligns with ultra-conservative
      agendas.

      a terrorist organization by the British government last month after it splashed
      red paint on a British war plane in protest of it assisting Israel’s genocide
      in Gaza. The non-violent group is in court challenging its designation by a violent
      government. The author, a former British diplomat, has been in the courthouse
      and filed this report. This is the first installment of his two-part article.
      By Craig Murray / Consortium News I headed to the Royal Courts of Justice in London
      on July 4 for the hearing brought by Huda Ammori, a co-founder of Palestine Action,
      on an application for relief from the government’s proscription order against
      the group as a terrorist organisation. Huda had applied for judicial review of
      the legality of this order. There is to be a hearing on whether a judicial review
      will be granted in the week beginning July 21. What the July 4 hearing was about,
      was whether the proscription should be suspended until that hearing on whether
      permission will be given for judicial review. This is called interim relief. The
      legal precedents on interim relief are that this question should depend on three
      points: — The first is the probability that a full judicial review might ultimately
      succeed, in other words a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case. —
      The second is whether irremediable damage will be done to anyone in the meantime
      if the order is not suspended, should the result of the process eventually be
      a successful judicial review. — If those two hurdles are passed, the third is
      whether on a “balance of convenience” the irremediable harm that might be done
      if the order is not suspended but ultimately is set aside on review, is worse
      than the irremediable harm that the public might suffer from losing the benefit
      the government intends by the order in the interim, should the judicial review
      be denied or eventually confirm the legality of the order. At this stage I presume
      you are deciding whether to bother to read that six times until it makes some
      sort of sense, or whether this is going to be an impenetrably dull article full
      of arcane legal nonsense and you would rather browse something else. I do sympathise.
      I had spent the train journey down from Edinburgh trying to get my head round
      all this; at one stage I had a lovely tourist couple from Hungary, who had the
      bad luck to share the train table with me, each kindly holding sheaves of documents
      and using their thumbs as placeholders. I rose at 6 a.m. on the day of the hearing
      to ensure I would get into the courtroom. I was anticipating that, as with the
      Julian Assange hearings or the International Court of Justice hearings on genocide,
      there may be a long queue waiting to enter. In fact there was nobody at all at
      7 a.m. except a great many policemen and me. I had a coffee opposite the court
      building, and a constant stream of policemen came into the coffee shop to buy
      coffee and doughnuts. By 07.45 there was not a doughnut left within a mile of
      the Strand. Anthropologists should study this. British policemen have no history
      with doughnuts. They never occupied any place in Metropolitan Police culture.
      However a continual barrage of American films and television programmes portray
      policemen as doughnut-eating; so presumably British police think this makes them
      cool. In fact it makes them fat. I shall not be paranoid about the fact the police
      kept photographing me as I hung round waiting for something to happen. They had
      nobody else to photograph. I tried to think of things I might do that look suspicious,
      to make their morning more interesting, but I don’t think my imagination had managed
      enough sleep. I am not going to sugar coat this. I kept going to the cafe loo
      to vomit. In fact I kept having to go and order coffees in various establishments
      to have somewhere to vomit. I had been up most of the night being sick. I hadn’t
      eaten anything suspect, and I assume it was a virus. This continued into the afternoon,
      and once court proceedings started I would race away at less charged moments to
      be sick. Fleet of Police Vans At 8.30 a.m. I went down the Strand to Boots to
      buy some medicine. On my return 10 minutes later, I saw an entire fleet of police
      vans arrive and park up around Arundel Street, about 150 metres from the court
      but out of sight. I counted 16 vans and 11 cars. The vans appeared to have 12-to-15
      policemen in each. That was only around one side of the court. It was a stern
      reminder of the issues at stake, and that proscription as a terrorist group gives
      colossal police-state powers. There are penalties of 14 years in prison should
      you merely “appear to” support a proscribed group, or be “reckless” as to whether
      you say something that may cause someone else to support it. This is the Terrorism
      Act 2000 as originally passed, by the horrible combination of Jack Straw and Tony
      Blair. It has since been amended to be even worse and make plain that no intent
      is required — if you “appear” to support, “recklessly” a proscribed organisation,
      you can be liable for 14 years imprisonment. For some reason the amended version
      is not available on the official government website. At 9 a.m. I entered the the
      Royal Courts of Justice. I have spent many more days here than I would wish, and
      have described the place before : “The architecture of the Royal Courts of Justice
      was the great last gasp of the Gothic revival; having exhausted the exuberance
      that gave us the beauty of St Pancras Station and the Palace of Westminster, the
      movement played out its dreary last efforts at whimsy in shades of grey and brown,
      valuing scale over proportion and mistaking massive for medieval. As intended,
      the buildings are a manifestation of the power of the state; as not intended,
      they are also an indication of the stupidity of large scale power.” Well, here
      I was again. Previously I had only been in the more prestigious courtrooms, off
      the main hall, courts 1 to 15. This case was to be heard in court 73. It was in
      the East Wing. This required an extremely complex feat of navigation through endless
      corridors where your footsteps echoed from the vaulted stone ceilings, through
      uncountable pointed arches, passing open courtyards and cloisters, up stairs and
      then down. With every stage the arches got lower, the architraves shallower, the
      corridors narrower, as you receded from the show of pomp to the mundane exercise
      of power. By the time you were in the cramped L-shaped corridor outside court
      73, you might have mistaken it for a 1950s unemployment benefit office in Solihull.
      I was first there but other people started to arrive for the hearing and the corridor
      became crowded and uncomfortably hot — it was one of the hottest days of the summer.
      At one point I felt about to faint, and Deepa Driver came to my rescue with a
      bottle of water. We were told the court would open at 10.15 am. In the ensuing
      hour I twice lost my place in the queue as I had to leave to go vomit. This did
      enable me to have a quick chat on the stairway with [the attorney] Gareth Peirce
      about the prospects for the case. I managed to get back towards the front of the
      queue each time, either because of immense personal charm or because people got
      out of the way as I smelt faintly of sick, you decide. But in the end it availed
      nothing as only accredited media were allowed into the courtroom. I am famously
      not a journalist in the U.K., as ruled by Lady Dorrian in the High Court of Scotland
      — it’s a long story — so I was not admitted. I was sent instead to an overflow
      room in court 76 on the floor above, where proceedings could be watched on live
      screens. So for this section of proceedings I was not in court. While sound and
      picture quality were excellent, this was not the same as being in the court itself
      in terms of picking up the atmosphere and all the little things which the camera
      does not show. It has never happened to me before in all my reporting. Martin
      Chamberlain The hearing was before Justice Martin Chamberlain. He has a liberal
      reputation. In a case earlier this year, he stated that he had no confidence in
      statements by MI5 [Britain’s domestic intelligence service.] In cases involving
      secret intelligence, British “justice” has an extraordinary procedure whereby
      the defendant is not allowed to know the evidence against him, but can be defended
      on that point in a closed court, without the defendant, by a court-appointed barrister
      known as a “special advocate.” Martin Chamberlain was such an advocate for 10
      years, and it is impossible for anybody with a slightest modicum of honesty to
      view a large quantity of intelligence reports without understanding that a high
      proportion of it is simply inaccurate. I speak as someone who read an average
      of perhaps 12 secret intelligence reports every day over a 22-year career. This
      is hopeful because the secretary of state had indicated that in the substantive
      hearing, there will be intelligence reports on which the government will rely
      in its evidence against Palestine Action. It has been widely leaked to the press
      that this includes intelligence reports that Palestine Action receives funding
      and backing from foreign states – which really is nonsense. Justice Chamberlain
      also ruled against the legality of certain British arms exports to Saudi Arabia
      if they would be used against the civilian population in Yemen. He has argued
      for the strengthening of the freedom of speech provisions of the European Convention
      of Human Rights (ECHR). It was therefore not a shock that he was prepared to annoy
      the legal Establishment by agreeing at least to hear the case as to whether there
      should be a judicial review of the proscription. He might be the only High Court
      judge who would have agreed. Proscribing Palestine Action had been an extremely
      high profile action by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper
      in facing down mounting public anger at the Gaza genocide, and seeking to restore
      the Zionist narrative that Palestinians and supporters of Palestine are terrorist.
      For the court to prevent the proscription from taking effect subject to legal
      proceedings, would be massive news and a further blow to Starmer’s authority.
      So the stakes were very high. Chamberlain gave no indication of this. He appeared
      enthusiastic to engage intellectually with the subject. He was eager and inclined
      to muse aloud in his discussions with the lawyers, interrupting sometimes almost
      out of excitement. He was like a slightly less annoying version of Robert Peston
      . Raza Husain Raza Husain KC opened the case for the claimant, Huda Ammori, in
      the standard form by introducing both teams of bewigged barristers. This took
      some time as the teams were large – six barristers on each side, while Huda had
      in addition two firms of solicitors. It was one of the few immediate indicators
      of the gravity and import of what was happening. But another was the demeanour
      of Raza Husain. Normally the smoothest of operators, he rather stuttered into
      his opening. This struck me throughout the case: Huda’s lawyers sounded slightly
      detached, not because they did not believe what they were saying, but because
      they could not believe that we were in a situation that required them to stand
      there and say it. Husain opened by stating that civil disobedience has a long
      and honourable history in the U.K. Very often people who had broken the law had
      been vindicated by history, such as the suffragettes. This was the first time
      in that long history that a civil disobedience group not advocating violence had
      ever been branded in law as terrorist. Five U.N. special rapporteurs had written
      to oppose the proscription of Palestine Action, including Professor Ben Saul,
      the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human
      rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, who had asked to intervene
      in the case. I am honoured to be appointed by the member countries of the United
      Nations to work with them, civil society, and victims of terrorism and excessive
      counter-terrorism to ensure human rights are fully protected in all counter-terrorism
      efforts https://t.co/WvWEUtJJrF — Prof Ben Saul – UN SR Human Rights & Counterterror
      (@profbensaul) October 13, 2023 The special rapporteurs identified three fundamental
      flaws in the U.K. legislation. There was an overbroad definition of terrorism,
      an overbroad definition of a terrorist organisation and an overbroad definition
      of what constituted support for a terrorist organisation. The overall effect of
      deprivation of liberty was characteristic of an authoritarian state. Husain referred
      to the evidence of Andrew Feinstein. He had experience of the liberation struggle
      in Southern Africa and had become an ANC MP. Feinstein testified that Nelson Mandela
      himself had been designated a terrorist by the British state for decades, and
      that the anti-apartheid movement used all of the direct action methods used by
      Palestine Action. Husain then turned to the evidence of Huda Ammori, who stated
      that in founding Palestine Action she had been directly inspired by the long history
      of civil disobedience movements in Britain and the many instances where courts
      had found such methods, including direct action against the arms industry, to
      be lawful. Palestine Action had never included or targeted any violence or injury
      to persons. Their actions were focused on Elbit, an Israeli state-owned enterprise
      which was fundamental to the Israeli military system. Elbit themselves referred
      to their staff as “civilian soldiers.” Husain continued that the proscription
      of Palestine Action was ill-considered, discriminatory, authoritarian law. It
      was contrary to both the common law and the Human Rights Act. For 20 months the
      Israeli military had been committing acts which most genocide scholars and experts
      consider to be genocide. The population was now being starved, and the very distribution
      of humanitarian aid had been turned into a killing field, according to the U.N.
      Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). To say that Palestine Action were committing
      terrorism was the precise opposite of what they were doing. They were rather seeking
      to prevent terror and genocide. At this stage Judge Chamberlain interposed what
      appeared something of a non sequitur. He asserted that he would have the power
      to create an order suspending the operation of the proscription to a later date,
      and that this was accepted by the secretary of state. Chamberlain continued that
      this could be done one of two ways. He could issue a statutory injunction, or
      the secretary of state could submit a fresh order to Parliament. The proscription
      order also proscribed two other organisations, including the Maniac Murder Cult,
      so the suspension would need to be crafted to benefit only Palestine Action. Judge
      Chamberlain stated that the need was to do justice or to cause the least injustice
      to persons affected in the interim should the case be decided the other way. The
      secretary of state had not evidenced a national security reason for the proscription
      to be introduced immediately. After this apparently heartening judicial intervention,
      Husain continued that the definition of Terrorism in the Act referred to serious
      damage to property. “Serious” in this case must be read, as argued by Professor
      Saul, in relation to international law standards. That was not a measure of financial
      loss, but damage that threatened further consequences such as to nuclear facilities
      or civilian aircraft. The powers of the secretary of state must be exercised proportionately
      within the ECHR rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Therefore
      it could be that even if an organisation fell within the overbroad definitions
      of the act, it still could not be proscribed. Judge Chamberlain countered this
      by citing a Supreme Court ruling in another case (Gould) that overbreadth in legislation
      can be mitigated by prosecutorial discretion. (To translate this into plain English,
      this means that because a law gives the state far too broad a power, it does not
      mean that the state will choose to exercise that power in all cases. Which gives
      of course power to the state selectively to prosecute only its chosen “enemies”
      using overbroad legislation.) Husain countered that when the legislation was passed
      through parliament, the then secretary of state had given a categorical assurance
      that the power of proscription would never be used against domestic direct action
      groups. Yet here we are. Judge Chamberlain responded that to reverse the proscription
      on the grounds Husain proposed, he would have to demonstrate that it led to an
      absurdity, citing another case (Hunt). Husain replied, “It is absurd. It is absurd
      to pronounce a non-violent group terrorist.” Judge Chamberlain said that what
      counted was whether if fitted the statutory definition of terrorism, not “some
      colloquial definition of terrorism”. Husain said the statute specified that terrorism
      was designed to induce a climate of fear, influence the government or intimidate
      the public. None of these applied to Palestine Action. Judge Chamberlain asked
      what was the purpose of the attack on RAF Brize Norton if not to influence the
      government? Palestine Action’s own submissions claim that Brize Norton supplies
      RAF Akrotiri which is supporting the Genocide. Husain said that one isolated or
      sporadic incident did not define the purpose of the organisation, which was to
      disrupt Elbit and the arms industry. Palestine Action has a non-hierarchical nature.
      Ascribing responsibility for individual actions was complex. Judge Chamberlain
      stated that in December 2024 the U.K. government had suspended arms licenses to
      Israel. Could it not be inferred that Palestine Action was attempting to attain
      this end? Hussain replied that was not the design of the organisation. It is designed
      to disrupt the arms supply chain. He then attempted to make further ground with
      his next point: documents showed that the government had engaged both the Israeli
      government and Elbit Systems in the decision making process to proscribe Palestine
      Action. Judge Chamberlain noted that some of these documents were heavily redacted.
      It was not plain what some of them meant. Raza Husain referred to a document which
      involved the phrase “act of vandalism” and reference to “a certain person” intervening.
      It appeared this process had taken place in March. The decision had therefore
      been taken before the Brize Norton incident. Judge Chamberlain asked why it would
      be unlawful to take into account the views of the state of Israel? At this point
      Raza Husain dropped his papers and stared at Judge Chamberlain in incredulity.
      “Israel to interfere? In our criminal law? In our domestic process?” Chamberlain
      responded that the government took a range of views into account. Why should it
      be unlawful to listen to Israel? Husain replied that interference by another state
      in domestic criminal matters was unconstitutional. Chamberlain stated that there
      was nothing in the legislation that precludes taking Israel’s views into account.
      Husain again asked incredulously, “To decide if it is terrorism?” Chamberlain
      responded, “They are the victims. They suffered criminal damage.” Husain said
      that does not go to the definition of terrorism. Chamberlain countered they could
      evidence the seriousness of the damage. Husain said he returned to the international
      definition underlined by Ben Saul. The damage to property had to go to the level
      of endangering nuclear installations or civil aviation. We were not in that territory.
      Husain continued that while both Israel and Elbit were consulted on the decision
      to proscribe, no pro-Palestinian group had been consulted. Judge Chamberlain replied
      that the statutory basis may preclude any common-law right to due process. The
      secretary of state had stated that pro-Palestinian groups could not be consulted,
      because in effect that would give Palestine Action 21 days’ notice of proscription,
      in which period it might take pre-emptive action. Husain responded that may be
      a claimed reason, but how does it apply the law? Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh Chamberlain
      had rather destroyed the flow of Raza Husain’s argument. He now handed over to
      his colleague Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh KC. Readers of my blog last encountered Blinne
      when she held spellbound the International Court of Justice in the Hague, speaking
      for South Africa in the Genocide case against Israel. There the world stopped
      and held its breath, and the dramatic architecture of the great hall of the Palace
      of Justice matched the occasion. Here Blinne stood in the much more modest circumstances
      of court 73. A plain, three-tier dais of utilitarian wood occupied one long side
      for the judge and clerks. It is the kind of unnatural wood finish that you get
      on steel-legged stacking tables, a peculiarly dark reddish brown with unbroken
      black lines of grain running straight across. The bench seats for the lawyers
      were in the well of the court, four rows of those, and then there was a small
      platform at the back for the public gallery, containing fourteen seats — occupied
      by the press, as was the jury box. Everything was the same kind of wood or veneer.
      Fitted bookshelves covered the walls around the court, and a very few contained
      cloth-bound tomes of law, but it appears that someone had forgotten to buy any
      books for most of them. Judge Chamberlain was perched on the top dais of the bench,
      in a rather austere black gown with a neat pressed linen collar known as “court
      bands” around his neck, which featured two long tabs of about six inches hanging
      down in parallel at the front. He rather resembled a Danish Lutheran preacher.
      I was in court 76 watching the large screens, as though in the world’s dullest
      sports bar. The construction was identical to court 73, of the same wood, only
      the entire thing was three times the size. We observers occupied the well of the
      court. There was a public gallery of 48 seats which was almost entirely empty.
      Had the hearing been held in court 76, everybody could have been in the actual
      courtroom itself. Why the large courtroom was the overspill court and the proceedings
      were in the tiny courtroom is an interesting question in itself. The result was
      that no members of the public were in the actual court, despite their right in
      law to attend. I raced out to be sick again before Blinne started, so for her
      first three minutes I am grateful to the whispered advice of my neighbours. Blinne
      was addressing the irreparable harm that would be caused in the next two weeks
      were the proscription not to be set aside pending the next hearing. She said that
      the context of the situation in Gaza was that the Palestinian people there faced
      annihilation and genocide. The U.N. secretary general himself had described what
      was happening as “A stain on our common humanity”. The explosive force that had
      been landed on the tiny area of Gaza was the equivalent of six Hiroshimas. There
      was firm evidence that Israel was now conducting daily massacres of those Palestinians
      attempting to obtain food for their families. Judge Chamberlain interposed that,
      since December 2024, it is not permissible for the U.K. to provide any arms to
      Israel save for F-35 parts. Blinne replied: “That’s a big ‘save’ when people are
      being massacred.” There was much evidence of continuing arms supply and other
      forms of military support. This massacre is what Palestine Action have been attempting
      to disrupt and prevent. If the proscription goes through, how will you differentiate
      between Palestine Action supporters and other people who hold similar views and
      take similar actions? Irreparable harm will be done to protestors. Some will carefully
      follow the law. Some will attempt to walk the invisible tightrope on what expressions
      of support for Palestine are permitted and what expressions are not, and will
      fall off. Some will openly defy the proscription as an act of civil disobedience
      — and some, such as Sally Rooney , [the Irish novelist] live in other jurisdictions.
      This was all the unprecedented impact of the unique proscription of a grassroots
      protest group. Three key offences would be created immediately upon the order
      coming into effect. It would be an offence to belong, or profess to belong, to
      Palestine Action. It would be an offence to invite, or to recklessly encourage,
      support for Palestine Action. It would be an offence to arrange a meeting to support
      Palestine Action or to hear from a member of Palestine Action. All of these carry
      a sentence of up to 14 years in prison. Wearing clothing or a badge associated
      with the organisation were offences of strict liability, bringing a six-month
      prison sentence. Any person convicted would be branded a “terrorist”. A policeman
      could arrest at any time on suspicion of these offences. They could stop and search.
      They could enter and search people’s homes and remove property. All of these without
      a warrant from a court. Any refugee convicted of any of these offences is deemed
      a danger to the community, justifying expulsion from the U.K. All of this will
      chill free speech. Those who have supported Palestine Action in the past will
      fall under suspicion for actions which were perfectly lawful at the time. Judge
      Chamberlain interrupted to say that this would not happen; the general principle
      of non-retrospectivity would apply. Blinne said that Palestine Action was a non-formalised
      body. How did you become a member, and how do you stop being a member? How can
      you prevent being suspected of being a member if you take direct action on behalf
      of Palestine without any connection to Palestine Action? Direct action and civil
      disobedience were not necessarily against U.K. law. A great many of those charged
      for direct action by Palestine Action had in fact been acquitted by the courts,
      and therefore their actions had been perfectly legal. There had been few actual
      convictions. The basic activity was not illegal. Any organisation, for example
      one called “Yvette Cooper”, could be “suspected” by the police of being Palestine
      Action. (A new pro-Palestine direct action group has been announced named ironically
      after the secretary of state.) How would the police decide what symbols showed
      support for Palestine Action? Were red boiler suits now banned? Judge Chamberlain
      attempted to pooh-pooh these questions, and Blinne retorted that people had already
      been arrested for carrying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs. There had
      been an actual trial for carrying a banner showing a palm tree and two coconuts.
      What about republishing? What of those who had Facebook photos wearing a Palestine
      Action T-shirt that might still be seen? How could you argue for de-proscription
      of the organisation if any mention were likely to bring you under “reasonable
      suspicion” of support? Judge Chamberlain replied that in due course he would like
      to hear the government KC, Mr. Ben Watson, address the question of the legality
      of arguing for deproscription. Blinne said that the harm caused during proscription
      would be irreparable. Palestinians will continue to be killed while the efforts
      to disrupt the arms supply to kill them would be banned. The chilling effect on
      free speech would be extreme. There were hundreds of thousands of supporters of
      Palestine Action on Twitter and other platforms. There would be mass mobilisation.
      Over 40 organisations opposed the proscription, including Liberty and Amnesty
      International (both had representatives in court). This was a fundamental attack
      on free speech. Judge Chamberlain responded that they would be able lawfully to
      advocate for deproscription. Blinne replied that they would not, because this
      would give rise to the offence of appearing to give support. Judge Chamberlain
      asked her to specify which offence was that? Blinne replied that under Section
      12, giving intellectual support to the organisation and appearing to support the
      organisation were both covered. Judge Chamberlain persisted, asking how arguing
      for deproscription can be confused with this? Blinne responded that the answer
      is that nobody knows how it will be applied, and therefore it will chill free
      speech. The definition of support for terrorism is really widely drawn. It is
      therefore certainly capable of being interpreted in that way. What would be the
      consequences of simply saying, “I think Palestine Action did the right thing in
      protesting the Genocide?” The consequences of straying the wrong side of the invisible
      line were potentially extreme. Furthermore what would be the position of lawyers
      acting for Palestine Action in future? Would they be permitted to take instruction?
      How could they be paid? In addition to violating Article X of the ECHR on freedom
      of speech, there was a clear violation of Article XIV on non-discrimination due
      to the discrimination in selecting a pro-Palestinian direct action group for proscription,
      when similar direct action groups concerned with other subjects of protest, such
      as climate change, had not been proscribed. According to the Human Rights Act
      it was unlawful in domestic law to violate the c. Articles X, XI and XIV were
      all engaged. (Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Assembly; Non-Discrimination.) There
      was clear Strasbourg case law that neither violence nor financial loss can abnegate
      Article X and XI rights. Judge Chamberlain replied that the secretary of state
      stated that there was “significant damage to key national infrastructure” affecting
      “components that supply U.K. and allied forces” and “damage that amounts to hundreds
      of millions of pounds.” We broke for lunch, and I reacquainted myself with the
      bathroom. The sound of my dry retching reverberated around the vast, unflinching
      stone vaults and halls of the Royal Courts. I trust it was not taken as an expression
      of support for Palestine Action. I emerged into the sunlight, and for the first
      time I saw the large demonstration outside. I did a number of interviews for media
      all around the world. Was at Pal Action protest at the Royal Courts of Justice,
      and surprise surprise who comes out? @craigmurray pic.twitter.com/j4gcAvO8o9 —
      Matt Ó Branáin #PardonAssange (@MattOBranain) July 5, 2025 I had intended to give
      a quick speech to the crowd explaining what was happening inside, but the protest
      was extremely lively and involved bare-chested young men rapping and a great deal
      of dancing, so I figured nobody would want to hear from a fat old man in a suit.
      There was a massive police presence, and I witnessed two instances of young men
      being dragged from the fringes of the crowd by the police and searched – for no
      reason I could discern, other than an attempt by the police to provoke a violent
      reaction that would discredit the protest. This is the first of a two-part article.

    one_sentence_summary: Palestine Action, designated a terrorist organization by the
      British government for its protests against military support for Israel, is challenging
      this designation in court, as reported by former diplomat Craig Murray.
    paragraph_summary: Palestine Action, an activist group recently designated as a
      terrorist organization by the British government for its protests against military
      support for Israel, is challenging this designation in court. The group, co-founded
      by Huda Ammori, is seeking judicial review of the government's proscription order,
      with a hearing scheduled for July 21 to determine if the order should be suspended
      until the review takes place. The initial hearing on July 4 focused on whether
      interim relief should be granted, which hinges on the likelihood of success in
      the judicial review, the potential for irremediable harm if the order is not suspended,
      and the balance of convenience regarding the situation. The author, a former British
      diplomat, reports from the Royal Courts of Justice on this significant legal battle.

      a terrorist organization by the British government last month after it splashed
      red paint on a British war plane in protest of it assisting Israel’s genocide
      in Gaza. The non-violent group is in court challenging its designation by a violent
      government. The author, a former British diplomat, has been in the courthouse
      and filed this report. This is the first installment of his two-part article.
      By Craig Murray / Consortium News I headed to the Royal Courts of Justice in London
      on July 4 for the hearing brought by Huda Ammori, a co-founder of Palestine Action,
      on an application for relief from the government’s proscription order against
      the group as a terrorist organisation. Huda had applied for judicial review of
      the legality of this order. There is to be a hearing on whether a judicial review
      will be granted in the week beginning July 21. What the July 4 hearing was about,
      was whether the proscription should be suspended until that hearing on whether
      permission will be given for judicial review. This is called interim relief. The
      legal precedents on interim relief are that this question should depend on three
      points: — The first is the probability that a full judicial review might ultimately
      succeed, in other words a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case. —
      The second is whether irremediable damage will be done to anyone in the meantime
      if the order is not suspended, should the result of the process eventually be
      a successful judicial review. — If those two hurdles are passed, the third is
      whether on a “balance of convenience” the irremediable harm that might be done
      if the order is not suspended but ultimately is set aside on review, is worse
      than the irremediable harm that the public might suffer from losing the benefit
      the government intends by the order in the interim, should the judicial review
      be denied or eventually confirm the legality of the order. At this stage I presume
      you are deciding whether to bother to read that six times until it makes some
      sort of sense, or whether this is going to be an impenetrably dull article full
      of arcane legal nonsense and you would rather browse something else. I do sympathise.
      I had spent the train journey down from Edinburgh trying to get my head round
      all this; at one stage I had a lovely tourist couple from Hungary, who had the
      bad luck to share the train table with me, each kindly holding sheaves of documents
      and using their thumbs as placeholders. I rose at 6 a.m. on the day of the hearing
      to ensure I would get into the courtroom. I was anticipating that, as with the
      Julian Assange hearings or the International Court of Justice hearings on genocide,
      there may be a long queue waiting to enter. In fact there was nobody at all at
      7 a.m. except a great many policemen and me. I had a coffee opposite the court
      building, and a constant stream of policemen came into the coffee shop to buy
      coffee and doughnuts. By 07.45 there was not a doughnut left within a mile of
      the Strand. Anthropologists should study this. British policemen have no history
      with doughnuts. They never occupied any place in Metropolitan Police culture.
      However a continual barrage of American films and television programmes portray
      policemen as doughnut-eating; so presumably British police think this makes them
      cool. In fact it makes them fat. I shall not be paranoid about the fact the police
      kept photographing me as I hung round waiting for something to happen. They had
      nobody else to photograph. I tried to think of things I might do that look suspicious,
      to make their morning more interesting, but I don’t think my imagination had managed
      enough sleep. I am not going to sugar coat this. I kept going to the cafe loo
      to vomit. In fact I kept having to go and order coffees in various establishments
      to have somewhere to vomit. I had been up most of the night being sick. I hadn’t
      eaten anything suspect, and I assume it was a virus. This continued into the afternoon,
      and once court proceedings started I would race away at less charged moments to
      be sick. Fleet of Police Vans At 8.30 a.m. I went down the Strand to Boots to
      buy some medicine. On my return 10 minutes later, I saw an entire fleet of police
      vans arrive and park up around Arundel Street, about 150 metres from the court
      but out of sight. I counted 16 vans and 11 cars. The vans appeared to have 12-to-15
      policemen in each. That was only around one side of the court. It was a stern
      reminder of the issues at stake, and that proscription as a terrorist group gives
      colossal police-state powers. There are penalties of 14 years in prison should
      you merely “appear to” support a proscribed group, or be “reckless” as to whether
      you say something that may cause someone else to support it. This is the Terrorism
      Act 2000 as originally passed, by the horrible combination of Jack Straw and Tony
      Blair. It has since been amended to be even worse and make plain that no intent
      is required — if you “appear” to support, “recklessly” a proscribed organisation,
      you can be liable for 14 years imprisonment. For some reason the amended version
      is not available on the official government website. At 9 a.m. I entered the the
      Royal Courts of Justice. I have spent many more days here than I would wish, and
      have described the place before : “The architecture of the Royal Courts of Justice
      was the great last gasp of the Gothic revival; having exhausted the exuberance
      that gave us the beauty of St Pancras Station and the Palace of Westminster, the
      movement played out its dreary last efforts at whimsy in shades of grey and brown,
      valuing scale over proportion and mistaking massive for medieval. As intended,
      the buildings are a manifestation of the power of the state; as not intended,
      they are also an indication of the stupidity of large scale power.” Well, here
      I was again. Previously I had only been in the more prestigious courtrooms, off
      the main hall, courts 1 to 15. This case was to be heard in court 73. It was in
      the East Wing. This required an extremely complex feat of navigation through endless
      corridors where your footsteps echoed from the vaulted stone ceilings, through
      uncountable pointed arches, passing open courtyards and cloisters, up stairs and
      then down. With every stage the arches got lower, the architraves shallower, the
      corridors narrower, as you receded from the show of pomp to the mundane exercise
      of power. By the time you were in the cramped L-shaped corridor outside court
      73, you might have mistaken it for a 1950s unemployment benefit office in Solihull.
      I was first there but other people started to arrive for the hearing and the corridor
      became crowded and uncomfortably hot — it was one of the hottest days of the summer.
      At one point I felt about to faint, and Deepa Driver came to my rescue with a
      bottle of water. We were told the court would open at 10.15 am. In the ensuing
      hour I twice lost my place in the queue as I had to leave to go vomit. This did
      enable me to have a quick chat on the stairway with [the attorney] Gareth Peirce
      about the prospects for the case. I managed to get back towards the front of the
      queue each time, either because of immense personal charm or because people got
      out of the way as I smelt faintly of sick, you decide. But in the end it availed
      nothing as only accredited media were allowed into the courtroom. I am famously
      not a journalist in the U.K., as ruled by Lady Dorrian in the High Court of Scotland
      — it’s a long story — so I was not admitted. I was sent instead to an overflow
      room in court 76 on the floor above, where proceedings could be watched on live
      screens. So for this section of proceedings I was not in court. While sound and
      picture quality were excellent, this was not the same as being in the court itself
      in terms of picking up the atmosphere and all the little things which the camera
      does not show. It has never happened to me before in all my reporting. Martin
      Chamberlain The hearing was before Justice Martin Chamberlain. He has a liberal
      reputation. In a case earlier this year, he stated that he had no confidence in
      statements by MI5 [Britain’s domestic intelligence service.] In cases involving
      secret intelligence, British “justice” has an extraordinary procedure whereby
      the defendant is not allowed to know the evidence against him, but can be defended
      on that point in a closed court, without the defendant, by a court-appointed barrister
      known as a “special advocate.” Martin Chamberlain was such an advocate for 10
      years, and it is impossible for anybody with a slightest modicum of honesty to
      view a large quantity of intelligence reports without understanding that a high
      proportion of it is simply inaccurate. I speak as someone who read an average
      of perhaps 12 secret intelligence reports every day over a 22-year career. This
      is hopeful because the secretary of state had indicated that in the substantive
      hearing, there will be intelligence reports on which the government will rely
      in its evidence against Palestine Action. It has been widely leaked to the press
      that this includes intelligence reports that Palestine Action receives funding
      and backing from foreign states – which really is nonsense. Justice Chamberlain
      also ruled against the legality of certain British arms exports to Saudi Arabia
      if they would be used against the civilian population in Yemen. He has argued
      for the strengthening of the freedom of speech provisions of the European Convention
      of Human Rights (ECHR). It was therefore not a shock that he was prepared to annoy
      the legal Establishment by agreeing at least to hear the case as to whether there
      should be a judicial review of the proscription. He might be the only High Court
      judge who would have agreed. Proscribing Palestine Action had been an extremely
      high profile action by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper
      in facing down mounting public anger at the Gaza genocide, and seeking to restore
      the Zionist narrative that Palestinians and supporters of Palestine are terrorist.
      For the court to prevent the proscription from taking effect subject to legal
      proceedings, would be massive news and a further blow to Starmer’s authority.
      So the stakes were very high. Chamberlain gave no indication of this. He appeared
      enthusiastic to engage intellectually with the subject. He was eager and inclined
      to muse aloud in his discussions with the lawyers, interrupting sometimes almost
      out of excitement. He was like a slightly less annoying version of Robert Peston
      . Raza Husain Raza Husain KC opened the case for the claimant, Huda Ammori, in
      the standard form by introducing both teams of bewigged barristers. This took
      some time as the teams were large – six barristers on each side, while Huda had
      in addition two firms of solicitors. It was one of the few immediate indicators
      of the gravity and import of what was happening. But another was the demeanour
      of Raza Husain. Normally the smoothest of operators, he rather stuttered into
      his opening. This struck me throughout the case: Huda’s lawyers sounded slightly
      detached, not because they did not believe what they were saying, but because
      they could not believe that we were in a situation that required them to stand
      there and say it. Husain opened by stating that civil disobedience has a long
      and honourable history in the U.K. Very often people who had broken the law had
      been vindicated by history, such as the suffragettes. This was the first time
      in that long history that a civil disobedience group not advocating violence had
      ever been branded in law as terrorist. Five U.N. special rapporteurs had written
      to oppose the proscription of Palestine Action, including Professor Ben Saul,
      the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human
      rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, who had asked to intervene
      in the case. I am honoured to be appointed by the member countries of the United
      Nations to work with them, civil society, and victims of terrorism and excessive
      counter-terrorism to ensure human rights are fully protected in all counter-terrorism
      efforts https://t.co/WvWEUtJJrF — Prof Ben Saul – UN SR Human Rights & Counterterror
      (@profbensaul) October 13, 2023 The special rapporteurs identified three fundamental
      flaws in the U.K. legislation. There was an overbroad definition of terrorism,
      an overbroad definition of a terrorist organisation and an overbroad definition
      of what constituted support for a terrorist organisation. The overall effect of
      deprivation of liberty was characteristic of an authoritarian state. Husain referred
      to the evidence of Andrew Feinstein. He had experience of the liberation struggle
      in Southern Africa and had become an ANC MP. Feinstein testified that Nelson Mandela
      himself had been designated a terrorist by the British state for decades, and
      that the anti-apartheid movement used all of the direct action methods used by
      Palestine Action. Husain then turned to the evidence of Huda Ammori, who stated
      that in founding Palestine Action she had been directly inspired by the long history
      of civil disobedience movements in Britain and the many instances where courts
      had found such methods, including direct action against the arms industry, to
      be lawful. Palestine Action had never included or targeted any violence or injury
      to persons. Their actions were focused on Elbit, an Israeli state-owned enterprise
      which was fundamental to the Israeli military system. Elbit themselves referred
      to their staff as “civilian soldiers.” Husain continued that the proscription
      of Palestine Action was ill-considered, discriminatory, authoritarian law. It
      was contrary to both the common law and the Human Rights Act. For 20 months the
      Israeli military had been committing acts which most genocide scholars and experts
      consider to be genocide. The population was now being starved, and the very distribution
      of humanitarian aid had been turned into a killing field, according to the U.N.
      Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). To say that Palestine Action were committing
      terrorism was the precise opposite of what they were doing. They were rather seeking
      to prevent terror and genocide. At this stage Judge Chamberlain interposed what
      appeared something of a non sequitur. He asserted that he would have the power
      to create an order suspending the operation of the proscription to a later date,
      and that this was accepted by the secretary of state. Chamberlain continued that
      this could be done one of two ways. He could issue a statutory injunction, or
      the secretary of state could submit a fresh order to Parliament. The proscription
      order also proscribed two other organisations, including the Maniac Murder Cult,
      so the suspension would need to be crafted to benefit only Palestine Action. Judge
      Chamberlain stated that the need was to do justice or to cause the least injustice
      to persons affected in the interim should the case be decided the other way. The
      secretary of state had not evidenced a national security reason for the proscription
      to be introduced immediately. After this apparently heartening judicial intervention,
      Husain continued that the definition of Terrorism in the Act referred to serious
      damage to property. “Serious” in this case must be read, as argued by Professor
      Saul, in relation to international law standards. That was not a measure of financial
      loss, but damage that threatened further consequences such as to nuclear facilities
      or civilian aircraft. The powers of the secretary of state must be exercised proportionately
      within the ECHR rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Therefore
      it could be that even if an organisation fell within the overbroad definitions
      of the act, it still could not be proscribed. Judge Chamberlain countered this
      by citing a Supreme Court ruling in another case (Gould) that overbreadth in legislation
      can be mitigated by prosecutorial discretion. (To translate this into plain English,
      this means that because a law gives the state far too broad a power, it does not
      mean that the state will choose to exercise that power in all cases. Which gives
      of course power to the state selectively to prosecute only its chosen “enemies”
      using overbroad legislation.) Husain countered that when the legislation was passed
      through parliament, the then secretary of state had given a categorical assurance
      that the power of proscription would never be used against domestic direct action
      groups. Yet here we are. Judge Chamberlain responded that to reverse the proscription
      on the grounds Husain proposed, he would have to demonstrate that it led to an
      absurdity, citing another case (Hunt). Husain replied, “It is absurd. It is absurd
      to pronounce a non-violent group terrorist.” Judge Chamberlain said that what
      counted was whether if fitted the statutory definition of terrorism, not “some
      colloquial definition of terrorism”. Husain said the statute specified that terrorism
      was designed to induce a climate of fear, influence the government or intimidate
      the public. None of these applied to Palestine Action. Judge Chamberlain asked
      what was the purpose of the attack on RAF Brize Norton if not to influence the
      government? Palestine Action’s own submissions claim that Brize Norton supplies
      RAF Akrotiri which is supporting the Genocide. Husain said that one isolated or
      sporadic incident did not define the purpose of the organisation, which was to
      disrupt Elbit and the arms industry. Palestine Action has a non-hierarchical nature.
      Ascribing responsibility for individual actions was complex. Judge Chamberlain
      stated that in December 2024 the U.K. government had suspended arms licenses to
      Israel. Could it not be inferred that Palestine Action was attempting to attain
      this end? Hussain replied that was not the design of the organisation. It is designed
      to disrupt the arms supply chain. He then attempted to make further ground with
      his next point: documents showed that the government had engaged both the Israeli
      government and Elbit Systems in the decision making process to proscribe Palestine
      Action. Judge Chamberlain noted that some of these documents were heavily redacted.
      It was not plain what some of them meant. Raza Husain referred to a document which
      involved the phrase “act of vandalism” and reference to “a certain person” intervening.
      It appeared this process had taken place in March. The decision had therefore
      been taken before the Brize Norton incident. Judge Chamberlain asked why it would
      be unlawful to take into account the views of the state of Israel? At this point
      Raza Husain dropped his papers and stared at Judge Chamberlain in incredulity.
      “Israel to interfere? In our criminal law? In our domestic process?” Chamberlain
      responded that the government took a range of views into account. Why should it
      be unlawful to listen to Israel? Husain replied that interference by another state
      in domestic criminal matters was unconstitutional. Chamberlain stated that there
      was nothing in the legislation that precludes taking Israel’s views into account.
      Husain again asked incredulously, “To decide if it is terrorism?” Chamberlain
      responded, “They are the victims. They suffered criminal damage.” Husain said
      that does not go to the definition of terrorism. Chamberlain countered they could
      evidence the seriousness of the damage. Husain said he returned to the international
      definition underlined by Ben Saul. The damage to property had to go to the level
      of endangering nuclear installations or civil aviation. We were not in that territory.
      Husain continued that while both Israel and Elbit were consulted on the decision
      to proscribe, no pro-Palestinian group had been consulted. Judge Chamberlain replied
      that the statutory basis may preclude any common-law right to due process. The
      secretary of state had stated that pro-Palestinian groups could not be consulted,
      because in effect that would give Palestine Action 21 days’ notice of proscription,
      in which period it might take pre-emptive action. Husain responded that may be
      a claimed reason, but how does it apply the law? Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh Chamberlain
      had rather destroyed the flow of Raza Husain’s argument. He now handed over to
      his colleague Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh KC. Readers of my blog last encountered Blinne
      when she held spellbound the International Court of Justice in the Hague, speaking
      for South Africa in the Genocide case against Israel. There the world stopped
      and held its breath, and the dramatic architecture of the great hall of the Palace
      of Justice matched the occasion. Here Blinne stood in the much more modest circumstances
      of court 73. A plain, three-tier dais of utilitarian wood occupied one long side
      for the judge and clerks. It is the kind of unnatural wood finish that you get
      on steel-legged stacking tables, a peculiarly dark reddish brown with unbroken
      black lines of grain running straight across. The bench seats for the lawyers
      were in the well of the court, four rows of those, and then there was a small
      platform at the back for the public gallery, containing fourteen seats — occupied
      by the press, as was the jury box. Everything was the same kind of wood or veneer.
      Fitted bookshelves covered the walls around the court, and a very few contained
      cloth-bound tomes of law, but it appears that someone had forgotten to buy any
      books for most of them. Judge Chamberlain was perched on the top dais of the bench,
      in a rather austere black gown with a neat pressed linen collar known as “court
      bands” around his neck, which featured two long tabs of about six inches hanging
      down in parallel at the front. He rather resembled a Danish Lutheran preacher.
      I was in court 76 watching the large screens, as though in the world’s dullest
      sports bar. The construction was identical to court 73, of the same wood, only
      the entire thing was three times the size. We observers occupied the well of the
      court. There was a public gallery of 48 seats which was almost entirely empty.
      Had the hearing been held in court 76, everybody could have been in the actual
      courtroom itself. Why the large courtroom was the overspill court and the proceedings
      were in the tiny courtroom is an interesting question in itself. The result was
      that no members of the public were in the actual court, despite their right in
      law to attend. I raced out to be sick again before Blinne started, so for her
      first three minutes I am grateful to the whispered advice of my neighbours. Blinne
      was addressing the irreparable harm that would be caused in the next two weeks
      were the proscription not to be set aside pending the next hearing. She said that
      the context of the situation in Gaza was that the Palestinian people there faced
      annihilation and genocide. The U.N. secretary general himself had described what
      was happening as “A stain on our common humanity”. The explosive force that had
      been landed on the tiny area of Gaza was the equivalent of six Hiroshimas. There
      was firm evidence that Israel was now conducting daily massacres of those Palestinians
      attempting to obtain food for their families. Judge Chamberlain interposed that,
      since December 2024, it is not permissible for the U.K. to provide any arms to
      Israel save for F-35 parts. Blinne replied: “That’s a big ‘save’ when people are
      being massacred.” There was much evidence of continuing arms supply and other
      forms of military support. This massacre is what Palestine Action have been attempting
      to disrupt and prevent. If the proscription goes through, how will you differentiate
      between Palestine Action supporters and other people who hold similar views and
      take similar actions? Irreparable harm will be done to protestors. Some will carefully
      follow the law. Some will attempt to walk the invisible tightrope on what expressions
      of support for Palestine are permitted and what expressions are not, and will
      fall off. Some will openly defy the proscription as an act of civil disobedience
      — and some, such as Sally Rooney , [the Irish novelist] live in other jurisdictions.
      This was all the unprecedented impact of the unique proscription of a grassroots
      protest group. Three key offences would be created immediately upon the order
      coming into effect. It would be an offence to belong, or profess to belong, to
      Palestine Action. It would be an offence to invite, or to recklessly encourage,
      support for Palestine Action. It would be an offence to arrange a meeting to support
      Palestine Action or to hear from a member of Palestine Action. All of these carry
      a sentence of up to 14 years in prison. Wearing clothing or a badge associated
      with the organisation were offences of strict liability, bringing a six-month
      prison sentence. Any person convicted would be branded a “terrorist”. A policeman
      could arrest at any time on suspicion of these offences. They could stop and search.
      They could enter and search people’s homes and remove property. All of these without
      a warrant from a court. Any refugee convicted of any of these offences is deemed
      a danger to the community, justifying expulsion from the U.K. All of this will
      chill free speech. Those who have supported Palestine Action in the past will
      fall under suspicion for actions which were perfectly lawful at the time. Judge
      Chamberlain interrupted to say that this would not happen; the general principle
      of non-retrospectivity would apply. Blinne said that Palestine Action was a non-formalised
      body. How did you become a member, and how do you stop being a member? How can
      you prevent being suspected of being a member if you take direct action on behalf
      of Palestine without any connection to Palestine Action? Direct action and civil
      disobedience were not necessarily against U.K. law. A great many of those charged
      for direct action by Palestine Action had in fact been acquitted by the courts,
      and therefore their actions had been perfectly legal. There had been few actual
      convictions. The basic activity was not illegal. Any organisation, for example
      one called “Yvette Cooper”, could be “suspected” by the police of being Palestine
      Action. (A new pro-Palestine direct action group has been announced named ironically
      after the secretary of state.) How would the police decide what symbols showed
      support for Palestine Action? Were red boiler suits now banned? Judge Chamberlain
      attempted to pooh-pooh these questions, and Blinne retorted that people had already
      been arrested for carrying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs. There had
      been an actual trial for carrying a banner showing a palm tree and two coconuts.
      What about republishing? What of those who had Facebook photos wearing a Palestine
      Action T-shirt that might still be seen? How could you argue for de-proscription
      of the organisation if any mention were likely to bring you under “reasonable
      suspicion” of support? Judge Chamberlain replied that in due course he would like
      to hear the government KC, Mr. Ben Watson, address the question of the legality
      of arguing for deproscription. Blinne said that the harm caused during proscription
      would be irreparable. Palestinians will continue to be killed while the efforts
      to disrupt the arms supply to kill them would be banned. The chilling effect on
      free speech would be extreme. There were hundreds of thousands of supporters of
      Palestine Action on Twitter and other platforms. There would be mass mobilisation.
      Over 40 organisations opposed the proscription, including Liberty and Amnesty
      International (both had representatives in court). This was a fundamental attack
      on free speech. Judge Chamberlain responded that they would be able lawfully to
      advocate for deproscription. Blinne replied that they would not, because this
      would give rise to the offence of appearing to give support. Judge Chamberlain
      asked her to specify which offence was that? Blinne replied that under Section
      12, giving intellectual support to the organisation and appearing to support the
      organisation were both covered. Judge Chamberlain persisted, asking how arguing
      for deproscription can be confused with this? Blinne responded that the answer
      is that nobody knows how it will be applied, and therefore it will chill free
      speech. The definition of support for terrorism is really widely drawn. It is
      therefore certainly capable of being interpreted in that way. What would be the
      consequences of simply saying, “I think Palestine Action did the right thing in
      protesting the Genocide?” The consequences of straying the wrong side of the invisible
      line were potentially extreme. Furthermore what would be the position of lawyers
      acting for Palestine Action in future? Would they be permitted to take instruction?
      How could they be paid? In addition to violating Article X of the ECHR on freedom
      of speech, there was a clear violation of Article XIV on non-discrimination due
      to the discrimination in selecting a pro-Palestinian direct action group for proscription,
      when similar direct action groups concerned with other subjects of protest, such
      as climate change, had not been proscribed. According to the Human Rights Act
      it was unlawful in domestic law to violate the c. Articles X, XI and XIV were
      all engaged. (Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Assembly; Non-Discrimination.) There
      was clear Strasbourg case law that neither violence nor financial loss can abnegate
      Article X and XI rights. Judge Chamberlain replied that the secretary of state
      stated that there was “significant damage to key national infrastructure” affecting
      “components that supply U.K. and allied forces” and “damage that amounts to hundreds
      of millions of pounds.” We broke for lunch, and I reacquainted myself with the
      bathroom. The sound of my dry retching reverberated around the vast, unflinching
      stone vaults and halls of the Royal Courts. I trust it was not taken as an expression
      of support for Palestine Action. I emerged into the sunlight, and for the first
      time I saw the large demonstration outside. I did a number of interviews for media
      all around the world. Was at Pal Action protest at the Royal Courts of Justice,
      and surprise surprise who comes out? @craigmurray pic.twitter.com/j4gcAvO8o9 —
      Matt Ó Branáin #PardonAssange (@MattOBranain) July 5, 2025 I had intended to give
      a quick speech to the crowd explaining what was happening inside, but the protest
      was extremely lively and involved bare-chested young men rapping and a great deal
      of dancing, so I figured nobody would want to hear from a fat old man in a suit.
      There was a massive police presence, and I witnessed two instances of young men
      being dragged from the fringes of the crowd by the police and searched – for no
      reason I could discern, other than an attempt by the police to provoke a violent
      reaction that would discredit the protest. This is the first of a two-part article.

    one_sentence_summary: Palestine Action, designated a terrorist organization by the
      British government for its protests against military support for Israel, is challenging
      this designation in court, as reported by former diplomat Craig Murray.
    paragraph_summary: Palestine Action, an activist group recently designated as a
      terrorist organization by the British government for its protests against military
      support for Israel, is challenging this designation in court. The group, co-founded
      by Huda Ammori, is seeking judicial review of the government's proscription order,
      with a hearing scheduled for July 21 to determine if the order should be suspended
      until the review takes place. The initial hearing on July 4 focused on whether
      interim relief should be granted, which hinges on the likelihood of success in
      the judicial review, the potential for irremediable harm if the order is not suspended,
      and the balance of convenience regarding the situation. The author, a former British
      diplomat, reports from the Royal Courts of Justice on this significant legal battle.

      that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider
      a tax-deductible donation . By Kit Klarenberg / Substack On July 5th , Bloomberg
      reported that a BlackRock-administered multibillion-dollar fund for Kiev’s reconstruction,
      due to be unveiled at a dedicated Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome July 10th/11th,
      had been placed on hold at the start of 2025 “due to a lack of interest” among
      institutional, private, and state financiers. The summit is over, lack of investor
      enthusiasm persists, and “the project’s future is now uncertain.” It’s just the
      latest confirmation the West’s long-running mission to carve up Ukraine for profit
      verges on total disintegration. BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund has been
      in the works since May 2023 . It was originally envisaged as one of the most ambitious
      public-private finance collaborations in history, which would rival Washington’s
      Marshall Plan that rebuilt – and heavily indebted – Western Europe in World War
      II’s wake. With vast returns promised, initially investors w ere reportedly “ready
      to plow funds” into the endeavour, due to widespread optimism Kiev’s much-hyped
      “counteroffensive” later that year “might end the war quickly.” In the event,
      the counteroffensive was an unmitigated disaster . Ukraine suffered up to 100,000
      casualties, with much of its arsenal of Western-supplied armour, vehicles and
      weapons obliterated, in return for recapturing just 0.25% of the territory occupied
      by Russia in the proxy war’s initial phases. As BlackRock vice chair Philipp Hildebrand
      explained , the results killed off investor exuberance, as they required “the
      cessation of hostilities, or at the very least a perspective for peace.” Concerns
      about Ukraine’s ever-reducing skilled workforce were also widespread. Fast forward
      to today, and there is no indication of any peace deal on the horizon, Russia
      is rapidly advancing across multiple fronts, and the Ukrainian government estimates
      the country has lost around 40% of its working-age population due to the proxy
      war. No wonder BlackRock’s Development Fund has failed to attract a single dollar.
      Quite what will remain of Ukraine when the conflict is over, and whether any financial
      returns can be gleaned from its ruins, are open, grave questions. The collapse
      of BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund is not only a microcosm of the impending,
      inevitable defeat of Kiev and its overseas puppetmasters in Donbass. It also reflects
      the death of the dream of breaking apart Ukraine’s industries and resources to
      untrammelled rape and pillage, long-held by Western corporations, oligarchs, and
      governments. Planning for this eventuality dates back to the country’s 1991 independence,
      producing concrete results following the 2014 Western-orchestrated Maidan coup,
      and becoming turbocharged once all-out proxy war erupted in February 2022. ‘Investment
      Climate’ From the start of 2013, Western corporations began moving en masse to
      buy up Ukraine wholesale. It was widely expected Kiev would that year enter into
      an “association agreement” with the EU, facilitating privatisation, and tearing
      up of longstanding laws restricting foreign purchase and ownership of the country’s
      untold agricultural riches. The former “breadbasket of the Soviet Union” is home
      to the equivalent of one third of the EU’s total arable land, and projected profits
      were voluminous. That January , Anglo-Dutch MI6-linked energy giant Shell signed
      a 50-year deal with the Ukrainian government to explore and drill for natural
      gas via fracking in areas of Donetsk and Kharkov “believed to hold substantial
      natural gas.” Then, in May, notorious , now-defunct chemical giant Monsanto announced
      plans to invest $140 million in constructing a corn seed plant in the country’s
      agricultural heartlands. The company was a founding member of the US-Ukraine Business
      Council, established in October 1995 to “improve” Kiev’s “investment climate.”
      USUBC’s treasurer was and remains David Kramer , who during Maidan also served
      as president of Freedom House, a National Endowment for Democracy division. NED
      was avowedly founded by the CIA to do publicly what the Agency historically did
      publicly. The Endowment and Freedom House were responsible for Ukraine’s 2004
      “Orange Revolution”, which brought pro-Western puppet Viktor Yushchenko to power.
      He immediately implemented deeply unpopular neoliberal economic reforms, including
      slashing regulations and social spending. Yushchenko was voted out in 2010, securing
      just 5% of the vote. Following Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s rejection
      of the EU association agreement in favour of a more advantageous deal offered
      by Russia in November 2013 , the mass Maidan protests in Kiev were ignited by
      NED-affiliated actors, and fascist agitators . They raged until late February
      2014, when Yanukovych fled the country. In the intervening time, Ukraine was plunged
      into total chaos – yet, firms associated with USUBC weren’t deterred. Many, including
      major companies with representatives on the organisation’s executive committee,
      continued making sizeable investments in Ukraine throughout. Their undimmed enthusiasm
      may be explained by David Kramer being an alumni of Project for the New American
      Century, a neoconservative think tank widely credited with masterminding the Bush
      administration’s “War on Terror”. The organisation’s cofounder Robert Kagan is
      married to Victoria Nuland, at this time the State Department’s point person on
      Ukraine. She visited Kiev repeatedly during the Maidan “revolution”, and hand-picked
      Yanukovych’s replacement interim government. Nuland was thus well-placed to know
      USUBC member investments in Ukraine would be safe long-term. ‘Trade Opportunities’
      Nuland’s fascist interim government was replaced in June 2014 by an administration
      led by far-right Petro Poroshenko, who stood on an explicit platform of privatising
      state industries. The President passed legislation enabling this in March 2016
      . Two years later, his government adopted sweeping laws to further facilitate
      the auctioning off of Kiev’s public assets and industry to foreign actors. However,
      a moratorium on private sale of arable land, imposed in 2001, remained in place.
      No matter – in August 2018 , the European Court of Human Rights ruled this was
      illegal. There was still one problem, though. Opinion polls consistently showed
      Ukrainian citizens overwhelmingly rejected privatisation, and the sale of their
      country’s agricultural land to overseas buyers. As luck would have it, the proxy
      war’s eruption, and imposition of martial law, allowed for industrial scale trampling
      by Volodomyr Zelensky’s government over public opinion, and political opposition.
      Throughout 2022 , a series of controversial laws intended to “make privatization
      as easy as possible for foreign investors” were passed without hindrance. In the
      process, close to 1,000 nationalised enterprises were offered up for overseas
      sale, and auctions for purchase of these entities “under simplified terms” convened.
      The next year, these efforts intensified , with further legislation enacted enabling
      “large-scale privatisation of state assets and state companies.” This was reportedly
      motivated by “the attractiveness” of Ukraine’s “large state assets to institutional
      investors.” They included an Odessa-based ammonia factory, major mining and chemical
      firms, one of the country’s leading power generators, and a producer of high-quality
      titanium products. Encouraged by the West’s reception to these moves, in July
      2024 Kiev announced a dedicated “Large-Scale Privatisation” plan, with yet more
      prize assets under the hammer. Little wonder two months later, a British Foreign
      Office briefing document openly acknowledged it viewed “the invasion not only
      as a crisis, but also as an opportunity.” London’s primary economic aid project
      in Ukraine is explicitly concerned with ensuring the country “adopts and implements
      economic reforms that create a more inclusive economy, enhancing trade opportunities
      with the UK.” The objectives of Britain’s “Good Governance Fund” in Ukraine The
      previous January , the World Economic Forum’s annual congress was convened in
      Davos, Switzerland. The proxy war, and Kiev’s economic future, loomed large on
      the event’s agenda. Its centrepiece was a breakout breakfast attended by political
      leaders and business bigwigs, where Zelensky appeared via videolink. The President
      thanked “giants of the international financial and investment world,” including
      BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan, for buying up his country’s assets during
      wartime. He boldly promised, “everyone can become a big business by working with
      Ukraine.” Subsequently , BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pledged to coordinate billions
      of dollars in reconstruction financing for Kiev, forecasting the country would
      become a “beacon of capitalism” resultantly. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs chief David
      Solomon spoke with intense optimism about Kiev’s post-war future, and the gains
      his firm and other major Western financial institutions would reap. “There is
      no question that as you rebuild, there will be good economic incentives for real
      return and real investment,” he crowed. Zelensky spoke at multiple events held
      in Davos over the five-day-long conference’s course, where pro-Kiev sentiment
      was reportedly “overwhelming”. The President spoke of recapturing Crimea, and
      demanded attendees “give us your weapons.” His audiences were invariably highly
      receptive. On one panel, Boris Johnson, who personally sabotaged fruitful peace
      talks between Kiev and Moscow in April 2022, urged Zelensky be provided “the tools
      he needs to finish the job.” The disgraced former British Prime Minister boomed
      , “Give them the tanks! There’s absolutely nothing to be lost!” In years to come,
      the January 2023 Davos summit may be viewed both as the high point of Ukraine’s
      proxy war effort, and roughly when everything began to spectacularly unravel.
      The desired weapons arrived in huge quantities, to no effect. Kiev’s three biggest
      military efforts since, all British-planned – that year’s counteroffensive , the
      Krynky incursion , and Kursk “counterinvasion” – were deeply costly cataclysms,
      leaving Ukraine undermanned and ill-equipped to fend off Russian advances. Countries
      that supplied munitions borderline disarmed themselves in the process. The Ukraine
      Recovery Conference passed without much media interest , despite a literal red
      carpet being rolled out for Zelensky, and multiple senior EU officials – including
      Ursula von der Leyen – and European state leaders attending. It ended with vague
      commitments to drum up €10 billion in private sector investments for Ukraine.
      Evidently, Western ambitions of making a mint out of Kiev haven’t been fully jettisoned
      – even if the World Bank calculates the total cost of rebuilding the country to
      be $524 billion. In a speech, von der Leyen pledged to support Ukraine “militarily,
      financially, and politically” for “as long as it takes.” Meanwhile, there is little
      indication that Britain has given up on making Kiev safe for neoliberalism and
      its own profit, despite London’s covert commitment to “keeping Ukraine fighting
      at all costs.” Of course, the longer the lost proxy war grinds on, the less Ukraine
      there will be to rebuild, and reap returns from. But apparently, this unambiguous
      reality is lost on the proxy war’s sponsors. God help us all. Editor’s Note :

      a tax-deductible donation . By Kit Klarenberg / Substack On July 5th , Bloomberg
      reported that a BlackRock-administered multibillion-dollar fund for Kiev’s reconstruction,
      due to be unveiled at a dedicated Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome July 10th/11th,
      had been placed on hold at the start of 2025 “due to a lack of interest” among
      institutional, private, and state financiers. The summit is over, lack of investor
      enthusiasm persists, and “the project’s future is now uncertain.” It’s just the
      latest confirmation the West’s long-running mission to carve up Ukraine for profit
      verges on total disintegration. BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund has been
      in the works since May 2023 . It was originally envisaged as one of the most ambitious
      public-private finance collaborations in history, which would rival Washington’s
      Marshall Plan that rebuilt – and heavily indebted – Western Europe in World War
      II’s wake. With vast returns promised, initially investors w ere reportedly “ready
      to plow funds” into the endeavour, due to widespread optimism Kiev’s much-hyped
      “counteroffensive” later that year “might end the war quickly.” In the event,
      the counteroffensive was an unmitigated disaster . Ukraine suffered up to 100,000
      casualties, with much of its arsenal of Western-supplied armour, vehicles and
      weapons obliterated, in return for recapturing just 0.25% of the territory occupied
      by Russia in the proxy war’s initial phases. As BlackRock vice chair Philipp Hildebrand
      explained , the results killed off investor exuberance, as they required “the
      cessation of hostilities, or at the very least a perspective for peace.” Concerns
      about Ukraine’s ever-reducing skilled workforce were also widespread. Fast forward
      to today, and there is no indication of any peace deal on the horizon, Russia
      is rapidly advancing across multiple fronts, and the Ukrainian government estimates
      the country has lost around 40% of its working-age population due to the proxy
      war. No wonder BlackRock’s Development Fund has failed to attract a single dollar.
      Quite what will remain of Ukraine when the conflict is over, and whether any financial
      returns can be gleaned from its ruins, are open, grave questions. The collapse
      of BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund is not only a microcosm of the impending,
      inevitable defeat of Kiev and its overseas puppetmasters in Donbass. It also reflects
      the death of the dream of breaking apart Ukraine’s industries and resources to
      untrammelled rape and pillage, long-held by Western corporations, oligarchs, and
      governments. Planning for this eventuality dates back to the country’s 1991 independence,
      producing concrete results following the 2014 Western-orchestrated Maidan coup,
      and becoming turbocharged once all-out proxy war erupted in February 2022. ‘Investment
      Climate’ From the start of 2013, Western corporations began moving en masse to
      buy up Ukraine wholesale. It was widely expected Kiev would that year enter into
      an “association agreement” with the EU, facilitating privatisation, and tearing
      up of longstanding laws restricting foreign purchase and ownership of the country’s
      untold agricultural riches. The former “breadbasket of the Soviet Union” is home
      to the equivalent of one third of the EU’s total arable land, and projected profits
      were voluminous. That January , Anglo-Dutch MI6-linked energy giant Shell signed
      a 50-year deal with the Ukrainian government to explore and drill for natural
      gas via fracking in areas of Donetsk and Kharkov “believed to hold substantial
      natural gas.” Then, in May, notorious , now-defunct chemical giant Monsanto announced
      plans to invest $140 million in constructing a corn seed plant in the country’s
      agricultural heartlands. The company was a founding member of the US-Ukraine Business
      Council, established in October 1995 to “improve” Kiev’s “investment climate.”
      USUBC’s treasurer was and remains David Kramer , who during Maidan also served
      as president of Freedom House, a National Endowment for Democracy division. NED
      was avowedly founded by the CIA to do publicly what the Agency historically did
      publicly. The Endowment and Freedom House were responsible for Ukraine’s 2004
      “Orange Revolution”, which brought pro-Western puppet Viktor Yushchenko to power.
      He immediately implemented deeply unpopular neoliberal economic reforms, including
      slashing regulations and social spending. Yushchenko was voted out in 2010, securing
      just 5% of the vote. Following Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s rejection
      of the EU association agreement in favour of a more advantageous deal offered
      by Russia in November 2013 , the mass Maidan protests in Kiev were ignited by
      NED-affiliated actors, and fascist agitators . They raged until late February
      2014, when Yanukovych fled the country. In the intervening time, Ukraine was plunged
      into total chaos – yet, firms associated with USUBC weren’t deterred. Many, including
      major companies with representatives on the organisation’s executive committee,
      continued making sizeable investments in Ukraine throughout. Their undimmed enthusiasm
      may be explained by David Kramer being an alumni of Project for the New American
      Century, a neoconservative think tank widely credited with masterminding the Bush
      administration’s “War on Terror”. The organisation’s cofounder Robert Kagan is
      married to Victoria Nuland, at this time the State Department’s point person on
      Ukraine. She visited Kiev repeatedly during the Maidan “revolution”, and hand-picked
      Yanukovych’s replacement interim government. Nuland was thus well-placed to know
      USUBC member investments in Ukraine would be safe long-term. ‘Trade Opportunities’
      Nuland’s fascist interim government was replaced in June 2014 by an administration
      led by far-right Petro Poroshenko, who stood on an explicit platform of privatising
      state industries. The President passed legislation enabling this in March 2016
      . Two years later, his government adopted sweeping laws to further facilitate
      the auctioning off of Kiev’s public assets and industry to foreign actors. However,
      a moratorium on private sale of arable land, imposed in 2001, remained in place.
      No matter – in August 2018 , the European Court of Human Rights ruled this was
      illegal. There was still one problem, though. Opinion polls consistently showed
      Ukrainian citizens overwhelmingly rejected privatisation, and the sale of their
      country’s agricultural land to overseas buyers. As luck would have it, the proxy
      war’s eruption, and imposition of martial law, allowed for industrial scale trampling
      by Volodomyr Zelensky’s government over public opinion, and political opposition.
      Throughout 2022 , a series of controversial laws intended to “make privatization
      as easy as possible for foreign investors” were passed without hindrance. In the
      process, close to 1,000 nationalised enterprises were offered up for overseas
      sale, and auctions for purchase of these entities “under simplified terms” convened.
      The next year, these efforts intensified , with further legislation enacted enabling
      “large-scale privatisation of state assets and state companies.” This was reportedly
      motivated by “the attractiveness” of Ukraine’s “large state assets to institutional
      investors.” They included an Odessa-based ammonia factory, major mining and chemical
      firms, one of the country’s leading power generators, and a producer of high-quality
      titanium products. Encouraged by the West’s reception to these moves, in July
      2024 Kiev announced a dedicated “Large-Scale Privatisation” plan, with yet more
      prize assets under the hammer. Little wonder two months later, a British Foreign
      Office briefing document openly acknowledged it viewed “the invasion not only
      as a crisis, but also as an opportunity.” London’s primary economic aid project
      in Ukraine is explicitly concerned with ensuring the country “adopts and implements
      economic reforms that create a more inclusive economy, enhancing trade opportunities
      with the UK.” The objectives of Britain’s “Good Governance Fund” in Ukraine The
      previous January , the World Economic Forum’s annual congress was convened in
      Davos, Switzerland. The proxy war, and Kiev’s economic future, loomed large on
      the event’s agenda. Its centrepiece was a breakout breakfast attended by political
      leaders and business bigwigs, where Zelensky appeared via videolink. The President
      thanked “giants of the international financial and investment world,” including
      BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan, for buying up his country’s assets during
      wartime. He boldly promised, “everyone can become a big business by working with
      Ukraine.” Subsequently , BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pledged to coordinate billions
      of dollars in reconstruction financing for Kiev, forecasting the country would
      become a “beacon of capitalism” resultantly. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs chief David
      Solomon spoke with intense optimism about Kiev’s post-war future, and the gains
      his firm and other major Western financial institutions would reap. “There is
      no question that as you rebuild, there will be good economic incentives for real
      return and real investment,” he crowed. Zelensky spoke at multiple events held
      in Davos over the five-day-long conference’s course, where pro-Kiev sentiment
      was reportedly “overwhelming”. The President spoke of recapturing Crimea, and
      demanded attendees “give us your weapons.” His audiences were invariably highly
      receptive. On one panel, Boris Johnson, who personally sabotaged fruitful peace
      talks between Kiev and Moscow in April 2022, urged Zelensky be provided “the tools
      he needs to finish the job.” The disgraced former British Prime Minister boomed
      , “Give them the tanks! There’s absolutely nothing to be lost!” In years to come,
      the January 2023 Davos summit may be viewed both as the high point of Ukraine’s
      proxy war effort, and roughly when everything began to spectacularly unravel.
      The desired weapons arrived in huge quantities, to no effect. Kiev’s three biggest
      military efforts since, all British-planned – that year’s counteroffensive , the
      Krynky incursion , and Kursk “counterinvasion” – were deeply costly cataclysms,
      leaving Ukraine undermanned and ill-equipped to fend off Russian advances. Countries
      that supplied munitions borderline disarmed themselves in the process. The Ukraine
      Recovery Conference passed without much media interest , despite a literal red
      carpet being rolled out for Zelensky, and multiple senior EU officials – including
      Ursula von der Leyen – and European state leaders attending. It ended with vague
      commitments to drum up €10 billion in private sector investments for Ukraine.
      Evidently, Western ambitions of making a mint out of Kiev haven’t been fully jettisoned
      – even if the World Bank calculates the total cost of rebuilding the country to
      be $524 billion. In a speech, von der Leyen pledged to support Ukraine “militarily,
      financially, and politically” for “as long as it takes.” Meanwhile, there is little
      indication that Britain has given up on making Kiev safe for neoliberalism and
      its own profit, despite London’s covert commitment to “keeping Ukraine fighting
      at all costs.” Of course, the longer the lost proxy war grinds on, the less Ukraine
      there will be to rebuild, and reap returns from. But apparently, this unambiguous
      reality is lost on the proxy war’s sponsors. God help us all. Editor’s Note :

      interview with Israel’s Channel 14, Minister of Energy Eli Cohen said that “Gaza
      must remain in ruins for decades to come” and that Israel will not help rebuild
      its civilian infrastructure. The Israeli army has damaged or destroyed some 90%
      of the Gaza Strip’s housing stock, as well as destroying most hospitals and all
      schools and universities, as well as water purification plants and other essential
      infrastructure, leaving over 2 million people to try to live in rubble. Note that
      Cohen is a member of the ruling right wing Likud Party headed by Prime Minister
      Benjamin Netanyahu rather than being from the extremist Religious Zionism bloc
      that is in coalition with the Likud. A former accountant and teacher of business
      at Tel Aviv University, Cohen has been listed among the top 100 most influential
      Israelis. Keeping millions of Palestinians in Gaza, half of them children, living
      in ruins for decades is not the sort of goal announced by sane, civilized, ordinary
      European politicians. At least, not since the 1930s. If a Likud Party stalwart
      like Cohen openly speaks like this, imagine what the Religious Zionism and Jewish
      Power cabinet members and members of parliament sound like. Also on Sunday, the
      Associated Press reports from an eyewitness, Ramadan Nassar, that some 14 adults
      brought 20 children to collect water from a distribution point in Nuseirat in
      central Gaza. As though out of nowhere, an Israeli missile struck them, killing
      six children and four adults. AP says that the Israeli military alleged that the
      strike was a technical error. There seem to be a lot of those, since over half
      of the 58,000 Palestinians Israel has killed since October 2023 have been women
      and children, and many of the rest were noncombatant men. Most water in Gaza is
      not potable, since Israel has deliberately destroyed water purification plants,
      and ground water is full of bacteria. Watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration
      and even death, is common in the Palestinian population of Gaza, including among
      vulnerable infants and children. Just as civilized politicians don’t talk about
      making millions of people live in rubble for decades, civilized militaries don’t
      have rules of engagement that allow for 20, or 50, or even 100 civilian deaths
      for every militant targeted. NATO is refusing to do joint military operations
      with Israel because of these unacceptable rules of engagement, which would get
      any NATO officer court-martialed who tried to implement them. In addition, Palestinian
      media sources reported that Israeli airstrikes and attacks left 95 people dead
      on Sunday, 52 of them in Gaza City. On Monday, UNICEF announced that it recorded
      5,800 cases of malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip during the month
      of June, as IMEMC reports : “The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) announced
      Sunday that more than 5,800 children in the Gaza Strip were diagnosed with malnutrition
      during the month of June, amid the ongoing genocide in Gaza and an 18-year blockade.
      UNICEF reported that over 1,000 of these children are suffering from severe acute
      malnutrition, warning that this marks the fourth consecutive month of rising cases.
      UNICEF stressed that the catastrophic conditions in Gaza demand urgent and large-scale
      humanitarian aid, cautioning that children are facing escalating threats to their
      survival due to a widespread famine that has already claimed numerous lives, particularly
      among children, because of what it described as a campaign of extermination involving

      military attributed to a technical error. The situation highlights the dire conditions
      in Gaza and the stark rhetoric from Israeli officials regarding its future.

      both Israel and Syria are liable to just carve up the area as Bilad al-Sham, or
      Greater Syria. “ If Lebanon doesn’t hurry up and get in line, everyone around

      everyone, though last week Lebanon responded after Hezbollah made it clear they
      would not disarm simply because of US demands. While Barrack presented himself
      as “ unbelievably satisfied ” at the time, which was less than a week ago, his
      current comments suggest he is anything but, and rejecting the US demands seem
      to have escalated into full-scale threats to wipe Lebanon off the map by way of
      US allies. Last weekend, it was further being reported that Israel and Syria were
      in talks regarding their own ongoing tensions, which center on Israeli occupations
      of parts of southwest Syria. The talks were said to include proposals to give
      Syria substantial parts of northern Lebanon, including the major city of Tripoli,
      in return for letting Israel nominally retain the Golan Heights. It has also been
      reported Syria’s Islamist government has issued an ultimatum to Lebanon , threatening
      them over Syrian prisoners being held in Lebanese prisons. Syria denied this was
      the case, however, saying they have no intention to take “ escalatory measures
      ” against Lebanon over the prisoners. That may not be that reassuring, however,
      with the caveat of it not being about the prisoners. With Syria eagerly cozying
      up the US of late, Barrack’s comments suggest the Syrian government may be being
      incentivized to take over part of Lebanon to impose the monopoly over arms that
      was the center of US demands. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted

      and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) A FAIR study found that CNN ’s primetime coverage
      of the Los Angeles anti-ICE protests in early June rarely included the voices
      of the protesters themselves. Instead, the network’s sources were overwhelmingly
      current and former government and law enforcement officials. The resulting coverage
      rarely took issue with Trump’s desire to silence the people who were defending
      their undocumented neighbors—but mainly debated his decision to deploy the California
      National Guard to do so. FAIR recorded the sources that appeared in the 5–10 pm
      timeslot during two key days, June 9 and 10, of CNN ’s television coverage of
      the Los Angeles protests; the shows included were the Lead with Jake Tapper ,
      Erin Burnett OutFront , Anderson Cooper 360 and the Source With Kaitlan Collins
      . The sources were categorized by current or former occupation, and on whether
      they were a featured guest—who typically field multiple interview-style questions
      from an anchor—or simply a soundbite. Sources that made multiple appearances were
      counted once for each segment they appeared in. ( CNN ’s in-house “analysts” or
      “commentators” were counted as featured guests to reflect their significant impact
      on the perspectives shared on the shows.) Out of 85 total sources across the eight
      broadcasts, only five were protesters, appearing on just three shows. None of
      the 47 featured guests were protesters or community or immigrant advocates. By
      far the most frequent sources were current or former US government officials,
      with 55 appearances—a whopping 65% of total sources. Thirteen additional sources
      were law enforcement, and five were current or former military. Together, these
      official sources accounted for 86% of all appearances. (There were also three
      journalists, two lawyers and two partisan strategists.) Of featured guest and
      analyst interviews, current or former government officials dominated at 49% (23
      out of 47). These sources were given the most time to present their perspectives,
      shaping the narrative around the protests and the government responses. Another
      11 featured guests were law enforcement and two were military, so official sources
      accounted for 77% of all such interviews. The three journalists, two lawyers and
      two partisan strategists made up the remaining featured guests. ‘Verbally at least
      hostile’ CNN ’s made-for-TV, on-the-ground style of protest coverage in the days
      following the Ambiance Apparel and Home Depot ICE raids felt little different
      from when Anderson Cooper stands around in a raincoat during a hurricane. Only
      this time, CNN reporters were braving an uncontrollable storm of Angelenos. Much
      like Cooper’s coat, CNN senior investigative correspondent Kyung Lah ( Erin Burnett
      OutFront , 6/9/25 ) donned protective goggles—useful should she have encountered
      tear gas, but also undoubtedly a dramatic flourish perfect for one of CNN ’s 30-second
      TV spots. That CNN was primarily interested in drama rather than helping viewers
      understand the protests became abundantly clear as—even with her protective goggles—Lah
      made no apparent effort to interview any protesters as she and CNN anchor Erin
      Burnett stood in front of LA’s federal detention center, where federal agents,
      LAPD and the California National Guard were in a standoff with demonstrators.
      Instead, they kept a close eye on every thrown water bottle, expressing concern
      about the crowd’s increasingly “young” demographic as the day went on. “This is
      a much younger crowd, certainly, verbally at least, Erin, hostile,” Lah reported.
      The only protest voices that CNN ’s audience heard from throughout both days of
      primetime coverage came in the form of two brief soundbites captured by correspondent
      Jason Carroll ( Lead , 6/9/25 ) at a protest for the release of arrested SEIU
      leader David Huerta the morning of June 9. Araceli Martinez, the only protester
      identified by name, offered a call to action for all Americans, arguing that the
      Trump administration’s immigration raids are a threat to “the rights of all people,
      not just the immigrants, but all of us.” That soundbite reaired on Erin Burnett
      Outfront and Anderson Cooper 360 , both on June 9. Another protester at the demonstration
      demanding Huerta’s release had this to say, with the soundbite reairing on Anderson
      Cooper 360 , also on June 9: We are part of that immigrant community that has
      made L.A. great, that has made the state of California the fourth largest economy
      in the world today. So, we have a message for President Donald Trump. Get the
      National Guardsmen out of here. Multiple times during the first day studied, Lah
      held up that union-led protest as a standard of message discipline and nonviolent
      tactics that those outside the federal building, later in the day, weren’t measuring
      up to. The folks at the earlier protest were “a very different slice of Los Angeles
      than what I am seeing” at the federal building, Lah said. The key word there is
      “seeing,” as she did not interview a single protester on camera. ‘We do very good
      here with unrest’ Meanwhile, CNN brought on multiple featured guests who framed
      protesters as violent and law enforcement as the ones pushing for accountability—despite
      the fact that reported injuries of civilians by law enforcement far outnumbered
      those of law enforcement by protesters ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ). LA District Attorney
      Nathan Hochman ( OutFront , 6/10/25 ), for example, stated that he would work
      to “punish” all protesters who engage in “illegal conduct.” Similarly, California
      Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis ( Source , 6/10/25 ) warned “anyone who goes out and
      is protesting in a way that is not peaceful…state and local and regional law enforcement
      will hold people accountable.” Rep. Adam Smith told Jake Tapper ( Lead , 6/10/25
      ): “I don’t disagree that you should meet any sort of violent protest with law
      enforcement, but there’s no evidence in this case that the LAPD wasn’t doing that.”
      Once you parse the double negatives, it’s clear that Smith, like the rest of CNN
      ‘s official sources, accepted the characterization of protesters as violent and
      argued that the response of California law enforcement was perfectly appropriate.
      Most of these state and local government sources were responding to questions
      about Trump calling in the National Guard and Marines; they were defending the
      local law enforcement response and challenging Trump’s decision. One of Burnett’s
      featured guests, for instance, was LA County Sheriff Robert Luna ( OutFront ,
      6/9/25)—the leader of a police force that community activists say routinely collaborates
      with federal immigration raids ( Democracy Now! , 6/9/25 ), and had just sparred
      with demonstrators in the Home Depot parking lot in Compton following the failed
      ICE raid there ( New York Times , 6/14/25 ). The primary focus of Burnett’s line
      of questioning was geared at exposing the political nature of Trump’s calling
      in the national guard: Just a very simple question. Do you need the Marines? Do
      you need the National Guard right now? Or if you were looking at this situation
      and assessing it as sheriff of LA County, would you say you do not need them?
      That’s certainly a critical line of questioning to get at the issue of federal
      overreach. But Burnett failed to similarly question (or even acknowledge) the
      violence by local law enforcement—which, by the time of Burnett’s broadcast, included
      24 attacks on journalists with weapons like pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear
      gas canisters, according to Reporters Without Borders ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ).
      Instead, she left unchallenged Luna’s claims that “if they’re peacefully protesting,
      they’ll be allowed to do that,” that his utmost priority was “keeping our community
      safe,” and that his police force does “very good here with unrest.” In doing so,
      Burnett framed the story as a question of whether putting down protests against
      sweeping raids of undocumented workers was the responsibility of federal troops
      or local law enforcement—rather than questioning why such protests were being
      met with force, and why local officials weren’t doing more to protect their immigrant
      communities. Redefining safety Meanwhile, the protesters that received such little
      consideration from Burnett and CNN could have contributed to a very different
      definition of safety for CNN ’s viewers. Ron Gochez, a community organizer and
      social studies teacher, who was one of the protesters at the ICE raid on Ambiance
      Apparel, described on Democracy Now! ( 6/9/25 ) how the protests have managed
      to protect people despite the efforts of local and federal officials: When we
      have these protests, they have been peaceful. But when the repression comes from
      the state, whether it’s the sheriffs, the LAPD or, on Saturday, for example, in
      Paramount, California, it was the Border Patrol, it was brutal violence…. But
      what they didn’t think was going to happen was that the people would resist and
      would fight back. And that’s exactly what happened in Paramount and in Compton,
      California, where for eight-and-a-half hours, the people combatted in the streets
      against the Border Patrol…. They had to retreat because of the fierce resistance
      of the community. And the hundreds of workers that were in the factories around
      them were able to escape. They were able to go to their cars and go home. That
      was only thanks to the resistance that allowed them to go home that night. The
      Trump administration is intent on testing just how far it can go to crush political
      dissent, and it’s clear most Democratic politicians and local law enforcement
      are not going to bat for the most vulnerable communities in its crosshairs. Angelenos
      know they are fighting for the rights of all of us who reside in the US. But CNN
      ’s refusal to have them on air to discuss their struggle and explain their tactics
      makes it all the more difficult to raise public awareness. Pretending to challenge
      the deployment of federal troops, CNN normalizes police violence and silences
      those truly protecting their communities. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

      in the world today. So, we have a message for President Donald Trump. Get the
      National Guardsmen out of here. Multiple times during the first day studied, Lah
      held up that union-led protest as a standard of message discipline and nonviolent
      tactics that those outside the federal building, later in the day, weren’t measuring
      up to. The folks at the earlier protest were “a very different slice of Los Angeles
      than what I am seeing” at the federal building, Lah said. The key word there is
      “seeing,” as she did not interview a single protester on camera. ‘We do very good
      here with unrest’ Meanwhile, CNN brought on multiple featured guests who framed
      protesters as violent and law enforcement as the ones pushing for accountability—despite
      the fact that reported injuries of civilians by law enforcement far outnumbered
      those of law enforcement by protesters ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ). LA District Attorney
      Nathan Hochman ( OutFront , 6/10/25 ), for example, stated that he would work
      to “punish” all protesters who engage in “illegal conduct.” Similarly, California
      Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis ( Source , 6/10/25 ) warned “anyone who goes out and
      is protesting in a way that is not peaceful…state and local and regional law enforcement
      will hold people accountable.” Rep. Adam Smith told Jake Tapper ( Lead , 6/10/25
      ): “I don’t disagree that you should meet any sort of violent protest with law
      enforcement, but there’s no evidence in this case that the LAPD wasn’t doing that.”
      Once you parse the double negatives, it’s clear that Smith, like the rest of CNN
      ‘s official sources, accepted the characterization of protesters as violent and
      argued that the response of California law enforcement was perfectly appropriate.
      Most of these state and local government sources were responding to questions
      about Trump calling in the National Guard and Marines; they were defending the
      local law enforcement response and challenging Trump’s decision. One of Burnett’s
      featured guests, for instance, was LA County Sheriff Robert Luna ( OutFront ,
      6/9/25)—the leader of a police force that community activists say routinely collaborates
      with federal immigration raids ( Democracy Now! , 6/9/25 ), and had just sparred
      with demonstrators in the Home Depot parking lot in Compton following the failed
      ICE raid there ( New York Times , 6/14/25 ). The primary focus of Burnett’s line
      of questioning was geared at exposing the political nature of Trump’s calling
      in the national guard: Just a very simple question. Do you need the Marines? Do
      you need the National Guard right now? Or if you were looking at this situation
      and assessing it as sheriff of LA County, would you say you do not need them?
      That’s certainly a critical line of questioning to get at the issue of federal
      overreach. But Burnett failed to similarly question (or even acknowledge) the
      violence by local law enforcement—which, by the time of Burnett’s broadcast, included
      24 attacks on journalists with weapons like pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear
      gas canisters, according to Reporters Without Borders ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ).
      Instead, she left unchallenged Luna’s claims that “if they’re peacefully protesting,
      they’ll be allowed to do that,” that his utmost priority was “keeping our community
      safe,” and that his police force does “very good here with unrest.” In doing so,
      Burnett framed the story as a question of whether putting down protests against
      sweeping raids of undocumented workers was the responsibility of federal troops
      or local law enforcement—rather than questioning why such protests were being
      met with force, and why local officials weren’t doing more to protect their immigrant
      communities. Redefining safety Meanwhile, the protesters that received such little
      consideration from Burnett and CNN could have contributed to a very different
      definition of safety for CNN ’s viewers. Ron Gochez, a community organizer and
      social studies teacher, who was one of the protesters at the ICE raid on Ambiance
      Apparel, described on Democracy Now! ( 6/9/25 ) how the protests have managed
      to protect people despite the efforts of local and federal officials: When we
      have these protests, they have been peaceful. But when the repression comes from
      the state, whether it’s the sheriffs, the LAPD or, on Saturday, for example, in
      Paramount, California, it was the Border Patrol, it was brutal violence…. But
      what they didn’t think was going to happen was that the people would resist and
      would fight back. And that’s exactly what happened in Paramount and in Compton,
      California, where for eight-and-a-half hours, the people combatted in the streets
      against the Border Patrol…. They had to retreat because of the fierce resistance
      of the community. And the hundreds of workers that were in the factories around
      them were able to escape. They were able to go to their cars and go home. That
      was only thanks to the resistance that allowed them to go home that night. The
      Trump administration is intent on testing just how far it can go to crush political
      dissent, and it’s clear most Democratic politicians and local law enforcement
      are not going to bat for the most vulnerable communities in its crosshairs. Angelenos
      know they are fighting for the rights of all of us who reside in the US. But CNN
      ’s refusal to have them on air to discuss their struggle and explain their tactics
      makes it all the more difficult to raise public awareness. Pretending to challenge
      the deployment of federal troops, CNN normalizes police violence and silences
      those truly protecting their communities. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

    paragraph_summary: A study by Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) revealed
      that CNN's primetime coverage of the anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles in early
      June 2025 largely excluded the voices of the protesters, focusing instead on government
      and law enforcement officials. During two key days of coverage, only five out
      of 85 sources were protesters, and none of the featured guests included community
      or immigrant advocates. The analysis highlighted that the majority of the commentary
      came from current or former U.S. government officials, with the network primarily
      debating the Trump administration's actions rather than amplifying the perspectives
      of those defending undocumented individuals.

    text: 'American Satyricon – by Mr. Fish In one of the scariest moments in modern
      history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal
      it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost The refusal by the Trump administration
      to release the files and videos amassed during investigations into the activities
      of the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, should put to rest the absurd idea, embraced
      by Trump supporters and gullible liberals, that Trump will dismantle the Deep
      State. Trump is part of , and has long been part of, the repugnant cabal of politicians
      – Democrat and Republican – billionaires and celebrities who look at us, and often
      underage girls and boys, as commodities to exploit for profit or pleasure. The
      list of those who were in Epstein’s orbit is a who’s who of the rich and famous.
      They include not only Trump , but Bill Clinton , who allegedly took a trip to
      Thailand with Epstein, Prince Andrew , Bill Gates , hedge fund billionaire Glenn
      Dubin , former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , former Secretary of the Treasury
      and former president of Harvard University Larry Summers , cognitive psychologist
      and author Stephen Pinker , Alan Dershowitz , billionaire and Victoria’s Secret
      CEO Leslie Wexner , the former Barclays banker Jes Staley , former Israeli prime
      minister Ehud Barak , the magician David Copperfield , actor Kevin Spacey , former
      CIA director Bill Burns , real estate mogul Mort Zuckerman , former Maine senator
      George Mitchell and disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , who reveled
      in Epstein’s perpetual Bacchanalia . They also include law firms and high-priced
      attorneys, federal and state prosecutors, private investigators, personal assistants,
      publicists, servants and drivers. They include the numerous procurers and pimps,
      including Epstein’s girlfriend and daughter of Robert Maxwell , Ghislaine Maxwell.
      They include the media and politicians who ruthlessly discredited and silenced
      the victims, and strong armed anyone, including a handful of intrepid reporters,
      seeking to expose Epstein’s crimes and circle of accomplices. There is a lot that
      remains hidden. But there are some things we know. Epstein installed hidden cameras
      in his opulent residences and on his private Caribbean island, Little St. James,
      to capture his high-powered friends engaging in sexual romps and abuse of teenage
      and underage girls and boys. The recordings were blackmail gold. Were they part
      of an intelligence operation on behalf of the Israeli Mossad ? Or were they used
      to ensure that Epstein had a steady source of investors who funneled him millions
      of dollars to avoid being outed? Or were they used for both? He shuttled underage
      girls between New York and Palm Beach on his private jet the Lolita Express ,
      which was allegedly outfitted with a bed for group sex. His coterie of famous
      friends, including Clinton and Trump , are recorded as traveling on the jet numerous
      times on released flight logs, although many other flight logs have disappeared.
      Epstein’s videos are in the vaults of the FBI, along with detailed evidence that
      would rip back the veil on the sexual proclivities and callousness of the powerful.
      I doubt there is a client list, as Attorney General Pam Bondi claims. There is
      also no single Epstein file. The investigative material amassed on Epstein fills
      many, many boxes, which would bury Bondi’s desk and probably, if collected in
      one room, dominate most of the space in her office. Did Epstein commit suicide,
      as the official autopsy report claims, by hanging himself in his jail cell on
      August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City? Or was
      he murdered? Since the cameras recording activity in his cell the night were not
      functional, we do not know. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein’s
      brother, who served as the chief medical examiner for New York City and who was
      present at the autopsy, said he believes Epstein’s autopsy suggests homicide .
      The Epstein case is important because it implodes the fiction of deep divisions
      between Democrats, who had no more interest in releasing the Epstein files than
      Trump, and the Republicans. They belong to the same club. It exposes how the courts
      and law enforcement agencies collude to shield powerful figures who engage in
      crimes. It lays bare the depravity of our exhibitionist ruling class, accountable
      to no one, free to violate, plunder, loot and prey on the weak and the vulnerable.
      It is the tawdry record of our oligarchic masters, those who lack the capacity
      for shame or guilt, whether dressed up as Donald Trump or Joe Biden. This class
      of ruling parasites was parodied in the first-century satirical novel “ Satyricon
      ” by Gaius Petronius Arbiter , written during the reigns of Caligula, Claudius,
      and Nero. As in Satyricon, Epstein’s circle was dominated by pseudointellectuals,
      pretentious buffoons, grifters, con artists, petty criminals, the insatiable rich
      and the sexually depraved. Epstein and his inner circle routinely engaged in sexual
      perversions of Petronian proportions, as The Miami Herald investigative reporter
      Julie Brown, whose dogged reporting was largely responsible for reopening the
      federal investigation in Epstein and Maxwell, documents in her book “ Perversion
      of Justice: The Jeffrey Epstein Story .” As Brown writes, in 2016 an anonymous
      woman, using the pseudonym “Kate Johnson,” filed a civil complaint in a federal
      court in California alleging she was raped by Trump and Epstein when she was thirteen,
      over a four-month period, from June to September 1994. “I loudly pleaded with
      Trump to stop,” she said in the lawsuit about being raped. “Trump responded to
      my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming
      that he could do whatever he wanted.” Brown continues: Johnson said that Epstein
      invited her to a series of ‘underage sex parties’ at his New York mansion where
      she met Trump. Enticed by promises of money and modeling opportunities, Johnson
      said she was forced to have sex with Trump several times, including once with
      another girl, twelve years old, whom she labeled ‘Marie Doe.’ Trump demanded oral
      sex, the lawsuit said, and afterward he “pushed both minors away while angrily
      berating them for the ‘poor’ quality of the sexual performance,” according to
      the lawsuit, filed April 26 in U.S. District Court in Central California. Afterward,
      when Epstein learned that Trump had taken Johnson’s virginity, Epstein allegedly
      ‘attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists,’ angry he had not
      been the one to take her virginity. Johnson claimed that both men threatened to
      harm her, and her family if she ever revealed what had happened. The lawsuit states
      that Trump did not take part in Epstein’s orgies but liked to watch, often while
      the thirteen-year-old “Kate Johnson” gave him a hand job. It appears Trump was
      able to quash the lawsuit by buying her silence. She has since disappeared. In
      2008, Alex Acosta, who at the time was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
      of Florida, negotiated a plea deal for Epstein. The deal granted immunity from
      all federal criminal charges to Epstein, four named co-conspirators and any unnamed
      “potential co-conspirators.” The agreement shut down the FBI probe into whether
      there were more victims and other powerful figures who took part in Epstein’s
      sex crimes. It halted the investigation and sealed the indictment. Trump, in what
      many consider an act of gratitude, appointed Acosta as Secretary of Labor in his
      first term. Trump contemplated pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell after she was arrested
      in July 2020, fearing she would reveal details of his decades-long friendship
      with Epstein, according to Trump biographer Michael Wolff. In July 2022, Maxwell
      was sentenced to 20 years in prison. “Jeffrey Epstein’s closest relationship in
      life was with Donald Trump…these were two guys joined at the hip for a good 15
      years. They did everything together,” Wolff told host Joanna Coles on The Daily
      Beast Podcast. “And this is from sharing, pursuing women, hunting women, sharing
      at least one girlfriend for at least a year in this kind of rich-guy relationship
      with each other’s planes, to Epstein advising Trump on how to cheat on his taxes.”
      The legal anomalies, including the disappearance of massive amounts of evidence
      incriminating Epstein, saw Epstein avoid federal sex-trafficking charges in 2007,
      when his attorneys negotiated the secret plea deal with Acosta. He was able to
      plead guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. The
      prominent men accused of engaging in Epstein’s carnival of pedophilia, including
      Epstein’s attorney Dershowitz, viciously threaten anyone who seeks to expose them.
      Dershowitz, for example, claims that an investigation which he has refused to
      make public, by the former FBI director Louis Freeh, proves he had never had sex
      with Epstein’s victim Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked at 17 to Prince Andrew.
      Giuffre, one of the few victims to publicly take on her abusers, said she was
      “passed around like a platter of fruit” among Epstein and Maxwell’s friends, until
      at the age of 19 when she escaped. She “ committed suicide ” in April 2025. Dershowitz
      has sent repeated threats to Brown and her editors at The Miami Herald. Brown
      continues: [Dershowitz] kept referring to information that was contained in sealed
      documents. He accused the newspaper of not reporting “facts” that he said were
      in those sealed documents. The truth is, I tried to explain, newspapers just can’t
      write about things because Alan Dershowitz says they exist. We need to see them.
      We need to verify them. Then, because I said “show me the material,” he publicly
      accused me of committing a criminal act by asking him to produce documents that
      were under court seal. This is the way Dershowitz operates. What disturbs me the
      most about Dershowitz is the way that the media, with few exceptions, fails to
      critically challenge him. Journalists fact-checked Donald Trump and others in
      his administration almost every day, yet, for the most part, the media seems to
      give Dershowitz a pass on the Epstein story. In 2015, when Giuffre’s allegations
      first became public, Dershowitz went on every television program imaginable swearing,
      among other things, that Epstein’s plane logs would exonerate him. “How do you
      know that?” he was asked. He replied that he was never on Epstein’s plane during
      the time that Virginia was involved with Epstein. But if the media had checked,
      they could have learned that he was indeed a passenger on the plane during that
      time period, according to the logs. Then he testified, in a sworn deposition,
      that he never went on any plane trips without his wife. But he was listed on those
      passage manifests as traveling multiple times without his wife. During at least
      one trip, he was on the plane with a model named Tatiana. Epstein donated money
      to Harvard and was made a visiting fellow in Harvard’s Department of Psychology,
      although he had no academic qualifications in the field. He was given a key card
      and pass code, as well as an office in the building that housed Harvard’s Program
      for Evolutionary Dynamics. He referred to himself in his press releases as “Science
      Philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Education activist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Evolutionary
      Jeffrey Epstein,” “Science patron Jeffrey Epstein” and “Maverick hedge funder
      Jeffrey Epstein.” Epstein, replicating the pretensions and vacuity of the characters
      who were parodied in the “Dinner with Trimalchio” chapter of Satyricon, organized
      elaborate dinner gatherings for his billionaire friends, including Elon Musk,
      Salar Kamangar and Jeff Bezos. He dreamed up bizarre schemes of social engineering,
      including a plan to seed the human species with his own DNA by creating a baby
      compound at his sprawling ranch in New Mexico. “Epstein was also obsessed with
      cryonics, the transhumanist philosophy whose followers believe that people can
      be replicated or brought back to life after they are frozen,” Brown writes. “Epstein
      apparently told some of the members of his scientific circle that he wanted to
      inseminate women with his sperm for them to give birth to his babies, and that
      he wanted his head and his penis frozen .” The Epstein story is a window into
      the moral bankruptcy, hedonism and greed of the ruling class. This crosses political
      lines. It is the common denominator between Democratic politicians, such as Bill
      Clinton, philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, the billionaire class, and Trump.
      They are one class of predators and grifters. It is not only girls and women they
      exploit, but all of us. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is

    one_sentence_summary: Chris Hedges argues that the Trump administration's refusal
      to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein reveals Trump's complicity in a corrupt
      elite network that exploits vulnerable individuals, challenging the notion that
      he would dismantle the so-called Deep State.
    paragraph_summary: In his article "American Satyricon," Chris Hedges critiques the
      Trump administration's refusal to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein's activities,
      arguing that this refusal undermines the notion that Trump is an adversary of
      the so-called Deep State. Hedges contends that Trump is intertwined with a network
      of powerful figures—including politicians, billionaires, and celebrities—who exploit
      vulnerable individuals, particularly minors, for their own gain. He highlights
      the extensive connections of Epstein, listing numerous prominent individuals from
      various sectors, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and celebrities like Kevin
      Spacey, who have been linked to Epstein's illicit activities. Hedges calls attention
      to the pervasive culture of exploitation and complicity among the elite, suggesting
      that the systemic issues surrounding Epstein's case reflect a broader moral decay
      in society.

      I doubt there is a client list, as Attorney General Pam Bondi claims. There is
      also no single Epstein file. The investigative material amassed on Epstein fills
      many, many boxes, which would bury Bondi’s desk and probably, if collected in
      one room, dominate most of the space in her office. Did Epstein commit suicide,
      as the official autopsy report claims, by hanging himself in his jail cell on
      August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City? Or was
      he murdered? Since the cameras recording activity in his cell the night were not
      functional, we do not know. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein’s
      brother, who served as the chief medical examiner for New York City and who was
      present at the autopsy, said he believes Epstein’s autopsy suggests homicide .
      The Epstein case is important because it implodes the fiction of deep divisions
      between Democrats, who had no more interest in releasing the Epstein files than
      Trump, and the Republicans. They belong to the same club. It exposes how the courts
      and law enforcement agencies collude to shield powerful figures who engage in
      crimes. It lays bare the depravity of our exhibitionist ruling class, accountable
      to no one, free to violate, plunder, loot and prey on the weak and the vulnerable.
      It is the tawdry record of our oligarchic masters, those who lack the capacity
      for shame or guilt, whether dressed up as Donald Trump or Joe Biden. This class
      of ruling parasites was parodied in the first-century satirical novel “ Satyricon
      ” by Gaius Petronius Arbiter , written during the reigns of Caligula, Claudius,
      and Nero. As in Satyricon, Epstein’s circle was dominated by pseudointellectuals,
      pretentious buffoons, grifters, con artists, petty criminals, the insatiable rich
      and the sexually depraved. Epstein and his inner circle routinely engaged in sexual
      perversions of Petronian proportions, as The Miami Herald investigative reporter
      Julie Brown, whose dogged reporting was largely responsible for reopening the
      federal investigation in Epstein and Maxwell, documents in her book “ Perversion
      of Justice: The Jeffrey Epstein Story .” As Brown writes, in 2016 an anonymous
      woman, using the pseudonym “Kate Johnson,” filed a civil complaint in a federal
      court in California alleging she was raped by Trump and Epstein when she was thirteen,
      over a four-month period, from June to September 1994. “I loudly pleaded with
      Trump to stop,” she said in the lawsuit about being raped. “Trump responded to
      my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming
      that he could do whatever he wanted.” Brown continues: Johnson said that Epstein
      invited her to a series of ‘underage sex parties’ at his New York mansion where
      she met Trump. Enticed by promises of money and modeling opportunities, Johnson
      said she was forced to have sex with Trump several times, including once with
      another girl, twelve years old, whom she labeled ‘Marie Doe.’ Trump demanded oral
      sex, the lawsuit said, and afterward he “pushed both minors away while angrily
      berating them for the ‘poor’ quality of the sexual performance,” according to
      the lawsuit, filed April 26 in U.S. District Court in Central California. Afterward,
      when Epstein learned that Trump had taken Johnson’s virginity, Epstein allegedly
      ‘attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists,’ angry he had not
      been the one to take her virginity. Johnson claimed that both men threatened to
      harm her, and her family if she ever revealed what had happened. The lawsuit states
      that Trump did not take part in Epstein’s orgies but liked to watch, often while
      the thirteen-year-old “Kate Johnson” gave him a hand job. It appears Trump was
      able to quash the lawsuit by buying her silence. She has since disappeared. In
      2008, Alex Acosta, who at the time was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
      of Florida, negotiated a plea deal for Epstein. The deal granted immunity from
      all federal criminal charges to Epstein, four named co-conspirators and any unnamed
      “potential co-conspirators.” The agreement shut down the FBI probe into whether
      there were more victims and other powerful figures who took part in Epstein’s
      sex crimes. It halted the investigation and sealed the indictment. Trump, in what
      many consider an act of gratitude, appointed Acosta as Secretary of Labor in his
      first term. Trump contemplated pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell after she was arrested
      in July 2020, fearing she would reveal details of his decades-long friendship
      with Epstein, according to Trump biographer Michael Wolff. In July 2022, Maxwell
      was sentenced to 20 years in prison. “Jeffrey Epstein’s closest relationship in
      life was with Donald Trump…these were two guys joined at the hip for a good 15
      years. They did everything together,” Wolff told host Joanna Coles on The Daily
      Beast Podcast. “And this is from sharing, pursuing women, hunting women, sharing
      at least one girlfriend for at least a year in this kind of rich-guy relationship
      with each other’s planes, to Epstein advising Trump on how to cheat on his taxes.”
      The legal anomalies, including the disappearance of massive amounts of evidence
      incriminating Epstein, saw Epstein avoid federal sex-trafficking charges in 2007,
      when his attorneys negotiated the secret plea deal with Acosta. He was able to
      plead guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. The
      prominent men accused of engaging in Epstein’s carnival of pedophilia, including
      Epstein’s attorney Dershowitz, viciously threaten anyone who seeks to expose them.
      Dershowitz, for example, claims that an investigation which he has refused to
      make public, by the former FBI director Louis Freeh, proves he had never had sex
      with Epstein’s victim Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked at 17 to Prince Andrew.
      Giuffre, one of the few victims to publicly take on her abusers, said she was
      “passed around like a platter of fruit” among Epstein and Maxwell’s friends, until
      at the age of 19 when she escaped. She “ committed suicide ” in April 2025. Dershowitz
      has sent repeated threats to Brown and her editors at The Miami Herald. Brown
      continues: [Dershowitz] kept referring to information that was contained in sealed
      documents. He accused the newspaper of not reporting “facts” that he said were
      in those sealed documents. The truth is, I tried to explain, newspapers just can’t
      write about things because Alan Dershowitz says they exist. We need to see them.
      We need to verify them. Then, because I said “show me the material,” he publicly
      accused me of committing a criminal act by asking him to produce documents that
      were under court seal. This is the way Dershowitz operates. What disturbs me the
      most about Dershowitz is the way that the media, with few exceptions, fails to
      critically challenge him. Journalists fact-checked Donald Trump and others in
      his administration almost every day, yet, for the most part, the media seems to
      give Dershowitz a pass on the Epstein story. In 2015, when Giuffre’s allegations
      first became public, Dershowitz went on every television program imaginable swearing,
      among other things, that Epstein’s plane logs would exonerate him. “How do you
      know that?” he was asked. He replied that he was never on Epstein’s plane during
      the time that Virginia was involved with Epstein. But if the media had checked,
      they could have learned that he was indeed a passenger on the plane during that
      time period, according to the logs. Then he testified, in a sworn deposition,
      that he never went on any plane trips without his wife. But he was listed on those
      passage manifests as traveling multiple times without his wife. During at least
      one trip, he was on the plane with a model named Tatiana. Epstein donated money
      to Harvard and was made a visiting fellow in Harvard’s Department of Psychology,
      although he had no academic qualifications in the field. He was given a key card
      and pass code, as well as an office in the building that housed Harvard’s Program
      for Evolutionary Dynamics. He referred to himself in his press releases as “Science
      Philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Education activist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Evolutionary
      Jeffrey Epstein,” “Science patron Jeffrey Epstein” and “Maverick hedge funder
      Jeffrey Epstein.” Epstein, replicating the pretensions and vacuity of the characters
      who were parodied in the “Dinner with Trimalchio” chapter of Satyricon, organized
      elaborate dinner gatherings for his billionaire friends, including Elon Musk,
      Salar Kamangar and Jeff Bezos. He dreamed up bizarre schemes of social engineering,
      including a plan to seed the human species with his own DNA by creating a baby
      compound at his sprawling ranch in New Mexico. “Epstein was also obsessed with
      cryonics, the transhumanist philosophy whose followers believe that people can
      be replicated or brought back to life after they are frozen,” Brown writes. “Epstein
      apparently told some of the members of his scientific circle that he wanted to
      inseminate women with his sperm for them to give birth to his babies, and that
      he wanted his head and his penis frozen .” The Epstein story is a window into
      the moral bankruptcy, hedonism and greed of the ruling class. This crosses political
      lines. It is the common denominator between Democratic politicians, such as Bill
      Clinton, philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, the billionaire class, and Trump.
      They are one class of predators and grifters. It is not only girls and women they
      exploit, but all of us. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is

    one_sentence_summary: Chris Hedges argues that the Trump administration's refusal
      to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein reveals Trump's complicity in a corrupt
      elite network that exploits vulnerable individuals, challenging the notion that
      he would dismantle the so-called Deep State.
    paragraph_summary: In his article "American Satyricon," Chris Hedges critiques the
      Trump administration's refusal to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein's activities,
      arguing that this refusal undermines the notion that Trump is an adversary of
      the so-called Deep State. Hedges contends that Trump is intertwined with a network
      of powerful figures—including politicians, billionaires, and celebrities—who exploit
      vulnerable individuals, particularly minors, for their own gain. He highlights
      the extensive connections of Epstein, listing numerous prominent individuals from
      various sectors, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and celebrities like Kevin
      Spacey, who have been linked to Epstein's illicit activities. Hedges calls attention
      to the pervasive culture of exploitation and complicity among the elite, suggesting
      that the systemic issues surrounding Epstein's case reflect a broader moral decay
      in society.

      Dreams Outrage continues to grow against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi
      Noem over her response to the deadly floods that ravaged Texas last week. According
      to a Friday report from The New York Times , more than two-thirds of phone calls
      to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from flood victims went unanswered
      after Noem allowed hundreds of contractors to be laid off on July 5, just a day
      after the nightmare storm. According to The Times , this dramatically hampered
      the ability of the agency to respond to calls from survivors in the following
      days: On July 5, as floodwaters were starting to recede, FEMA received 3,027 calls
      from disaster survivors and answered 3,018, or roughly 99.7 percent, the documents
      show. Contractors with four call center companies answered the vast majority of
      the calls. That evening, however, Noem did not renew the contracts with the four
      companies, and hundreds of contractors were fired, according to the documents
      and the person briefed on the matter. The next day, July 6, FEMA received 2,363
      calls and answered 846, or roughly 35.8 percent, according to the documents. And
      on Monday, July 7, the agency fielded 16,419 calls and answered 2,613, or around
      15.9 percent, the documents show. Calling is one of the primary ways that flood
      victims apply for aid from the disaster relief agency. But Noem would wait until
      July 10—five days later—to renew the contracts of the people who took those phone
      calls. “Responding to less than half of the inquiries is pretty horrific,” Jeffrey
      Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia
      University, told The Times . “Put yourself in the shoes of a survivor: You’ve
      lost everything, you’re trying to find out what’s insured and what’s not, and
      you’re navigating multiple aid programs,” he added. “One of the most important
      services in disaster recovery is being able to call someone and walk through these
      processes and paperwork.” The lapse is a direct result of a policy introduced
      by Noem last month, which required any payments made by FEMA above $100,000 to
      be directly approved by her before taking effect. Noem, who has said she wants
      to eliminate FEMA entirely, described it as a way of limiting “waste, fraud, and
      abuse.” Under this policy, Noem allowed other critical parts of the flood response
      to wait for days as well. Earlier this week, multiple officials within FEMA told
      CNN that she waited more than 72 hours to authorize the deployment of search and
      rescue teams and aerial imaging. Following The Times’ piece, DHS put out a statement
      claiming that “NO ONE was left without assistance, and every call was responded
      to urgently.” “When a natural disaster strikes, phone calls surge, and wait times
      can subsequently increase,” DHS said. “Despite this expected influx, FEMA’s disaster
      call center responded to every caller swiftly and efficiently, ensuring no one
      was left without assistance. No call center operators were laid off or fired.”
      This is undercut, however, by internal emails also obtained by The Times, which
      showed FEMA officials becoming frustrated and blaming the DHS Secretary for the
      lack of contracts. One official wrote in a July 8 email to colleagues: “We still
      do not have a decision, waiver, or signature from the DHS Secretary.” Democratic
      lawmakers were already calling for investigations into Noem’s response to the
      floods before Friday. They also sought to look into how the Trump administration’s
      mass firings of FEMA employees, as well as employees of the National Weather Service
      (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) may have
      hampered the response. Following The Times’ revelations, outrage has reached a
      greater fever pitch. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called it “unforgivable
      and unforgettable” and an “inexcusable lapse in top leadership.” “Sec. Noem shows
      that dismantling FEMA impacts real people in real time,” he said. “It hurts countless
      survivors & increases recovery costs.” In response to the news, Sen. Elizabeth
      Warren (D-Mass.) simply wrote that “Kristi Noem must resign now.” Kristi Noem

      was deliberate. “She broke it on purpose,” said Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.)
      in an interview on MSNBC. “So that when it fails this summer, she can say, ‘Oh,
      see, we told you—FEMA doesn’t work.''” Moskowitz: "Kristi Noem doesn''t know what
      she is doing. She has no idea what she is doing when it comes to FEMA … what she

    paragraph_summary: Outrage is mounting against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security
      Kristi Noem following her handling of the aftermath of deadly floods in Texas,
      where a significant number of calls from flood victims to FEMA went unanswered.
      A report from The New York Times revealed that after Noem allowed the layoffs
      of hundreds of contractors on July 5, the agency's ability to respond to disaster
      survivors was severely compromised. While FEMA had answered nearly all calls from
      victims on July 5, the situation deteriorated drastically in the following days,
      with only 35.8% and 15.9% of calls answered on July 6 and July 7, respectively.
      It wasn't until July 10 that Noem renewed the contracts for the call center staff,
      leading to criticism over the delayed response during a critical time for those
      seeking aid.

      By Abdul Rahman / Peoples Dispatch The Donald Trump administration has reportedly
      been pressuring South Korea to join its policy of blocking Chinese growth in the
      international shipbuilding industry by offering South Korea relief from higher
      tariffs under the “reciprocal tariff” regime of the US. South Korea’s trade policy
      director, Chang Sung-gil, said on Friday that “the US feels a sense of crisis
      that China’s market share in the shipbuilding sector is growing and is tapping
      Korea as a strategic partner” against it. Chang also confirmed that cooperation
      against China’s shipbuilding is one of the pre-conditions set by the US for finalizing
      the trade deal with South Korea to avoid high reciprocal tariffs. Earlier this
      week, the Trump administration extended the deadline for the implementation of
      its reciprocal tariff regime. It was to take effect July 9, as per the announcement
      made in April. However, Trump has given countries until August 1 to finalize their
      trade deals to avoid high tariffs. If the talks fail, South Korea will face a
      25% tariff on its exports to the US, according to a Monday letter from Trump to
      the country’s newly elected leadership. South Korea is not the only country that
      the US is coercing to join its China economic containment plan. Various nations,
      both in Asia and elsewhere, have been pressured to cut back their trade ties with
      China. Trump has reportedly demanded, both directly and indirectly, that countries
      should reduce the volume of their trade with China and block certain essential
      exports to it. This is a continuation of the policy adopted by Trump’s predecessor
      Joe Biden, who had asked South Korea to block the supply of high end logic and
      memory chips to China as a way to slow down its progress in high end technology.
      The Trump administration has set similar demands vis-a-vis China for a large number
      of Asian countries as one of the preconditions for getting relief from higher
      tariffs. Violation of international norms China has repeatedly objected to the
      US government’s approach of using its so-called reciprocal tariffs to coerce countries
      to modify their trade policies with a third country. Responding to the news of
      the Trump administration using coercion against South Korea to act against China,
      Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that no
      bilateral trade “agreement or negotiation should come at the expense of third
      parties’ interests”. The Trump administration has also threatened members of the
      BRICS with higher tariffs if they choose to continue aligning with it, calling
      it an anti-American grouping. On Tuesday, Trump reiterated his threat which provoked
      a strong response from Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who just
      hosted the BRICS summit. Trump also announced a 50% tariff on Brazil on Wednesday
      accusing it of “persecuting” former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial
      for spreading misinformation to foreign diplomats about Brazil’s electronic voting
      system and attempting a coup against Lula. Answering a question about Trump’s
      tariff threat against Brazil for its domestic policy decision, Ning called it
      a violation of the basic principles of international politics and an attempt to
      coerce other countries and interfere in their domestic affairs. “Sovereign equality
      and non-interference in internal affairs are important principles of the UN Charter
      and basic norms governing international relations,” Ning said. China is one of
      the founding BRICS members and its push for a multipolar, democratic world order
      is at the heart of its policies. China has rejected Trump’s allegations that BRICS
      is aligned against any particular country. China has also reiterated that there
      are no winners in a tariff or trade war. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

      By Kit Klarenberg / Substack Leaked files expose how now-defunct intelligence
      cutout USAID secretly employed the services of shady “counter-disinformation”
      firm Valent Projects , to censor and suppress online criticism of an illegitimate
      puppet government Washington installed in Sudan in August 2019. The purpose was
      to shore up its brutal, corrupt rule in the face of widespread public opposition.
      The documents suggest this was not the only country where Valent has been used
      as a cutout to support Western destabilisation and intervention, both covert and
      overt. A since-deleted USAID web entry declared the April 2019 ouster of Sudan’s
      longtime leader Omar al-Bashir represented a “historic” opportunity “to further
      US interests in Sudan and the region.” The Agency’s Office of Transition Services
      (OTI), which provided “fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political
      transition” – in other words, regime change – engaged in “close cooperation” with
      “key ministries” within the interim Sudanese government established four months
      later. This included creating and managing multiple state “media offices” for
      disseminating propaganda, and countering “mis- and disinformation”. The leaks
      show Valent reaped over $1 million from OTI for “counter disinformation and communications
      support” in Sudan. Suspiciously, this staggering sum is not reflected in the company’s
      official accounts . Nonetheless, some detail on its OTI work is provided by a
      June 2021 Meta report on “coordinated inauthentic behavior”. It states a malign
      network of 53 Facebook accounts, 51 pages, three groups, and 18 Instagram users
      in Sudan were removed “after reviewing information about some of its activity
      shared by researchers at Valent Projects.” In October 2021, Valent chief Amil
      Khan told Reuters the “inauthentic” Sudanese “network” his company identified
      was in fact “three times larger” than the nexus removed by Facebook in June that
      year, “attracting more than 6 million followers and continuing to grow.” He accused
      Meta of failing to act appropriately. By contrast, administrators of pages fingered
      by Valent as “inauthentic” emphatically denied the charge, telling Reuters the
      accusations stemmed from their criticism of the interim government’s “oppressive
      policies and poor economic and political management.” Sudan’s deeply unpopular
      OTI-run government collapsed the same month. During its two years of operation,
      it gained a woeful reputation for industrial scale corruption, savage attacks
      on dissidents, banning opposition news outlets, jailing dissidents without charge
      or trial, and other egregious abuses of power. Evidently, Valent was seeking to
      systematically defenestrate any and all online detractors of Washington’s faithful
      client administration on USAID’s dime, in a country where social media is highly
      influential on public perceptions and actions. ‘Measurable Effects’ Publicly,
      Valent Projects presents a friendly, democratic face, its in-house ‘experts’ frequently
      quoted in the mainstream on topics ranging from carbon emission “disinformation”
      to whether popular rapper Kendrick Lamar has been promoted by online bot networks.
      Yet, Khan cut his teeth running propaganda and influence operations for murderous
      CIA and MI6-backed extremist groups during the Syrian dirty war. The USAID leaks
      make abundantly clear he remains up to his old tricks, under Valent’s benign banner.
      Khan’s reprehensible professional background moreover made him an ideal candidate
      for managing “information operations” in support of the Ukraine proxy war, from
      the perspective of Project Alchemy . A British Ministry of Defence-created cell
      of military and intelligence veterans, it is charged with keeping Kiev “fighting
      at all costs”, plotting oft-suicidal missions for Ukrainian forces to carry out.
      Questions thus abound as to whether Khan’s secret plot with celebrity ‘journalist’
      Paul Mason to destroy The Grayzone , exposed in June 2022, arose from his clandestine
      mission for Alchemy. Dubbing him a “ninja” in the field of psychological warfare,
      Alchemy chiefs approached Khan in April 2022, inviting him to lead their “information”
      effort in the proxy war. He responded that Valent was already collaborating with
      Chemonics International, which manages the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine.
      Set up by Western governments to funnel support of all kinds to Kiev, PFRU is
      now run by the British Foreign Office, in direct “collaboration” with Volodymyr
      Zelensky’s administration. Khan explained this project was concerned with “tracking
      pro-Russian disinfo targeting key audiences in key countries…with the aim of influencing
      policy in a pro-Russian direction,” and countering attempts “to turn key audiences
      against the idea of support for Ukraine.” He bragged how Valent had “past performance
      in identifying, monitoring and closing such activity.” Khan enquired of Alchemy,
      “would something like that be of interest?” Not long after this email exchange,
      Valent submitted a pitch to PFRU. The firm proposed to “map audiences critical
      to the Kremlin’s efforts, and identify opportunities to impact their narratives,”
      thus supporting Kiev’s “strategic communications efforts.” If successful, Ukrainian
      officials would be provided with “a stream of ‘narrative opportunities’” to “influence”
      and “engage” audiences not only in Russia, but “other key states” including India
      and Turkey, via news outlets, social media, and other information sources. “One
      strand” of the project would “focus on mapping Russian internal audiences critical
      to the Kremlin’s plans with the aim of identifying opportunities to influence.”
      This would, it was projected, increase Kiev’s ability “to affect measurable attitudinal
      and behavioural change amongst key Russian audiences.” Meanwhile, “Russia’s ability
      to politically absorb negative conflict-related impacts,” such as “manpower losses”
      and “economic damage”, would be “degraded.” Valent’s pitch to PFRU The operation’s
      “second strand” would identify and monitor “social media networks delivering Russian
      information operations” overseas. Analysing the “content” and “engagement patterns”
      of these purported “networks” would “produce streams of highly specific, time
      sensitive information designed to present [Ukrainian] stakeholders opportunities
      to achieve influence.” The document bragged that “the approach and specific methodologies
      outlined” therein were “based on work [Valent Projects] has already conducted
      for multiple donors with measurable effects.” While no examples are cited in the
      leaked file, an obvious candidate would be Project Aurelius. This was an information
      warfare effort waged while Khan was based in Amman, Jordan, secret headquarters
      of a variety of British intelligence cutouts , with which he was employed during
      the Syrian dirty war. It sought to undermine Russia’s military support of Damascus,
      and Vladimir Putin’s rule, by “exposing Russians to the complicated reality their
      government” faced in the country. The Project’s leaked outline claimed “Russia’s
      position in Syria is more costly and less successful than the Kremlin is admitting,”
      and Putin’s position domestically and internationally was “fragile”. The objective
      therefore was to present Russia’s Syria intervention “as depicted” in British
      intelligence-created and run Syrian opposition media outlets “to key Russian audiences,
      including mainstream news consumers.” This “mechanism” could easily be constructed
      by “[tasking] Syrian opposition media activists” – in other words, British assets
      – “to capture raw material that undermines Russian claims.” Project_Aurelius Download
      The Project reportedly already had “potential points of entry into Russian mainstream
      media,” a team of “Russian activists based in Ukraine with access to foreign journalists
      and opinion influencers with media profiles,” and “activists able to establish
      and run Russian social media pages,” including “Russian opposition social media
      networks.” Funding would appear to come from a “Syrian-run media activist group”,
      ostensibly financed by “donations from wealthy Syrians”, which would send funds
      to a “a Russian-run similar entity…registered in Ukraine.” ‘Particularly Problematic’
      Another leaked Valent file shows the firm was employed by Thomson Reuters Foundation,
      the world-famous news agency’s “charitable” wing, “to gauge audience trust levels
      towards independent media in Ukraine.” The firm conducted extensive analysis of
      188 separate news outlets in Kiev, operating “across a variety of platforms, from
      websites to Facebook pages and Telegram channels.” It identified four separate
      audiences; “nationalist grannies”; “tech-savvy professionals”; “Russia First fans”;
      and “Ukrainian ‘Proud Boys’”, referencing the far-right US militia. The findings
      were delivered in March 2021. Excerpt from leaked Valent file Valent found “the
      most trusted information sources” in Ukraine “tend to be individuals who could
      best be described as ‘celebrity bloggers’,” as “larger media outlets…are assumed
      to be promoting an oligarch’s interests.” Those “celebrity bloggers” who could
      “communicate a certain comfort level with Russian culture and language while maintaining
      a dispassionate but critical tone on Kremlin policy” were concluded to be “the
      most likely actors in the Ukrainian information space to attract the widest cross
      section of audiences.” Such was the depth of Valent’s research, the firm was “confident”
      in making a number of “recommendations to news outlets operating in the Ukrainian
      information environment.” This included developing outlets “around real-world
      personalities,” avoiding “the appearance of narrow tribalism,” and “[showing]
      respect to Russian culture and history” when “criticising Russian policy.” Meanwhile,
      “long-form content” should focus on “newsworthy interviews”, with outlets posting
      “appropriate content” across platforms “in an integrated manner around a central
      narrative…[tailored] to audience profiles.” It is uncertain why Thomson Reuters
      Foundation commissioned Valent to identify the most popular independent media
      outlets and personalities, and effective propaganda strategies, in Ukraine. Nonetheless,
      The Grayzone has previously revealed the Foundation groomed a secret army of pro-Western
      Russian journalists under a covert Foreign Office operation, to “weaken the Russian
      state’s influence”. More gravely, this journalist has also exposed how Reuters
      and TRF created a British intelligence-funded astroturf opposition media outlet
      in Egypt, Aswat Masriya , which was central to Cairo’s brutal 2013 military coup.
      Thomson Reuters Foundation proposes secretly creating ‘independent’ media outlet
      for Ukraine’s 2019 elections Strikingly, leaked TRF files related to Aswat Masriya
      proposed repeating the exercise in Kiev, “timed for the run up to the 2019 elections.”
      That vote saw Zelensky elected by landslide, on a peace platform. This project
      was ostensibly inspired by “a lack of in-depth, independent news coverage” in
      Ukraine, which the Foundation considered “particularly problematic at key political
      junctures such as elections, especially when vested interests seek to influence
      particular outcomes.” In this context, the timing of Valent’s research effort
      for TRF is rendered rather suspect. In March 2021, Zelensky issued a decree ,
      outlining a “strategy for the de-occupation and reintegration” of “temporarily
      occupied territory” in Crimea and Donbass. It sketched a blueprint for the military
      to recapture both territories. Immediately, Kiev’s forces began massing in the
      south and east of Ukraine, a key precursor to the proxy conflict that erupted
      in February 2022. Perhaps Zelensky’s British intelligence backers wished to ensure
      in advance local “independent” media figures and outlets were supportive of the
      President’s “strategy” to ignite war with Russia? Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      By Kit Klarenberg / Substack Leaked files expose how now-defunct intelligence
      cutout USAID secretly employed the services of shady “counter-disinformation”
      firm Valent Projects , to censor and suppress online criticism of an illegitimate
      puppet government Washington installed in Sudan in August 2019. The purpose was
      to shore up its brutal, corrupt rule in the face of widespread public opposition.
      The documents suggest this was not the only country where Valent has been used
      as a cutout to support Western destabilisation and intervention, both covert and
      overt. A since-deleted USAID web entry declared the April 2019 ouster of Sudan’s
      longtime leader Omar al-Bashir represented a “historic” opportunity “to further
      US interests in Sudan and the region.” The Agency’s Office of Transition Services
      (OTI), which provided “fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political
      transition” – in other words, regime change – engaged in “close cooperation” with
      “key ministries” within the interim Sudanese government established four months
      later. This included creating and managing multiple state “media offices” for
      disseminating propaganda, and countering “mis- and disinformation”. The leaks
      show Valent reaped over $1 million from OTI for “counter disinformation and communications
      support” in Sudan. Suspiciously, this staggering sum is not reflected in the company’s
      official accounts . Nonetheless, some detail on its OTI work is provided by a
      June 2021 Meta report on “coordinated inauthentic behavior”. It states a malign
      network of 53 Facebook accounts, 51 pages, three groups, and 18 Instagram users
      in Sudan were removed “after reviewing information about some of its activity
      shared by researchers at Valent Projects.” In October 2021, Valent chief Amil
      Khan told Reuters the “inauthentic” Sudanese “network” his company identified
      was in fact “three times larger” than the nexus removed by Facebook in June that
      year, “attracting more than 6 million followers and continuing to grow.” He accused
      Meta of failing to act appropriately. By contrast, administrators of pages fingered
      by Valent as “inauthentic” emphatically denied the charge, telling Reuters the
      accusations stemmed from their criticism of the interim government’s “oppressive
      policies and poor economic and political management.” Sudan’s deeply unpopular
      OTI-run government collapsed the same month. During its two years of operation,
      it gained a woeful reputation for industrial scale corruption, savage attacks
      on dissidents, banning opposition news outlets, jailing dissidents without charge
      or trial, and other egregious abuses of power. Evidently, Valent was seeking to
      systematically defenestrate any and all online detractors of Washington’s faithful
      client administration on USAID’s dime, in a country where social media is highly
      influential on public perceptions and actions. ‘Measurable Effects’ Publicly,
      Valent Projects presents a friendly, democratic face, its in-house ‘experts’ frequently
      quoted in the mainstream on topics ranging from carbon emission “disinformation”
      to whether popular rapper Kendrick Lamar has been promoted by online bot networks.
      Yet, Khan cut his teeth running propaganda and influence operations for murderous
      CIA and MI6-backed extremist groups during the Syrian dirty war. The USAID leaks
      make abundantly clear he remains up to his old tricks, under Valent’s benign banner.
      Khan’s reprehensible professional background moreover made him an ideal candidate
      for managing “information operations” in support of the Ukraine proxy war, from
      the perspective of Project Alchemy . A British Ministry of Defence-created cell
      of military and intelligence veterans, it is charged with keeping Kiev “fighting
      at all costs”, plotting oft-suicidal missions for Ukrainian forces to carry out.
      Questions thus abound as to whether Khan’s secret plot with celebrity ‘journalist’
      Paul Mason to destroy The Grayzone , exposed in June 2022, arose from his clandestine
      mission for Alchemy. Dubbing him a “ninja” in the field of psychological warfare,
      Alchemy chiefs approached Khan in April 2022, inviting him to lead their “information”
      effort in the proxy war. He responded that Valent was already collaborating with
      Chemonics International, which manages the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine.
      Set up by Western governments to funnel support of all kinds to Kiev, PFRU is
      now run by the British Foreign Office, in direct “collaboration” with Volodymyr
      Zelensky’s administration. Khan explained this project was concerned with “tracking
      pro-Russian disinfo targeting key audiences in key countries…with the aim of influencing
      policy in a pro-Russian direction,” and countering attempts “to turn key audiences
      against the idea of support for Ukraine.” He bragged how Valent had “past performance
      in identifying, monitoring and closing such activity.” Khan enquired of Alchemy,
      “would something like that be of interest?” Not long after this email exchange,
      Valent submitted a pitch to PFRU. The firm proposed to “map audiences critical
      to the Kremlin’s efforts, and identify opportunities to impact their narratives,”
      thus supporting Kiev’s “strategic communications efforts.” If successful, Ukrainian
      officials would be provided with “a stream of ‘narrative opportunities’” to “influence”
      and “engage” audiences not only in Russia, but “other key states” including India
      and Turkey, via news outlets, social media, and other information sources. “One
      strand” of the project would “focus on mapping Russian internal audiences critical
      to the Kremlin’s plans with the aim of identifying opportunities to influence.”
      This would, it was projected, increase Kiev’s ability “to affect measurable attitudinal
      and behavioural change amongst key Russian audiences.” Meanwhile, “Russia’s ability
      to politically absorb negative conflict-related impacts,” such as “manpower losses”
      and “economic damage”, would be “degraded.” Valent’s pitch to PFRU The operation’s
      “second strand” would identify and monitor “social media networks delivering Russian
      information operations” overseas. Analysing the “content” and “engagement patterns”
      of these purported “networks” would “produce streams of highly specific, time
      sensitive information designed to present [Ukrainian] stakeholders opportunities
      to achieve influence.” The document bragged that “the approach and specific methodologies
      outlined” therein were “based on work [Valent Projects] has already conducted
      for multiple donors with measurable effects.” While no examples are cited in the
      leaked file, an obvious candidate would be Project Aurelius. This was an information
      warfare effort waged while Khan was based in Amman, Jordan, secret headquarters
      of a variety of British intelligence cutouts , with which he was employed during
      the Syrian dirty war. It sought to undermine Russia’s military support of Damascus,
      and Vladimir Putin’s rule, by “exposing Russians to the complicated reality their
      government” faced in the country. The Project’s leaked outline claimed “Russia’s
      position in Syria is more costly and less successful than the Kremlin is admitting,”
      and Putin’s position domestically and internationally was “fragile”. The objective
      therefore was to present Russia’s Syria intervention “as depicted” in British
      intelligence-created and run Syrian opposition media outlets “to key Russian audiences,
      including mainstream news consumers.” This “mechanism” could easily be constructed
      by “[tasking] Syrian opposition media activists” – in other words, British assets
      – “to capture raw material that undermines Russian claims.” Project_Aurelius Download
      The Project reportedly already had “potential points of entry into Russian mainstream
      media,” a team of “Russian activists based in Ukraine with access to foreign journalists
      and opinion influencers with media profiles,” and “activists able to establish
      and run Russian social media pages,” including “Russian opposition social media
      networks.” Funding would appear to come from a “Syrian-run media activist group”,
      ostensibly financed by “donations from wealthy Syrians”, which would send funds
      to a “a Russian-run similar entity…registered in Ukraine.” ‘Particularly Problematic’
      Another leaked Valent file shows the firm was employed by Thomson Reuters Foundation,
      the world-famous news agency’s “charitable” wing, “to gauge audience trust levels
      towards independent media in Ukraine.” The firm conducted extensive analysis of
      188 separate news outlets in Kiev, operating “across a variety of platforms, from
      websites to Facebook pages and Telegram channels.” It identified four separate
      audiences; “nationalist grannies”; “tech-savvy professionals”; “Russia First fans”;
      and “Ukrainian ‘Proud Boys’”, referencing the far-right US militia. The findings
      were delivered in March 2021. Excerpt from leaked Valent file Valent found “the
      most trusted information sources” in Ukraine “tend to be individuals who could
      best be described as ‘celebrity bloggers’,” as “larger media outlets…are assumed
      to be promoting an oligarch’s interests.” Those “celebrity bloggers” who could
      “communicate a certain comfort level with Russian culture and language while maintaining
      a dispassionate but critical tone on Kremlin policy” were concluded to be “the
      most likely actors in the Ukrainian information space to attract the widest cross
      section of audiences.” Such was the depth of Valent’s research, the firm was “confident”
      in making a number of “recommendations to news outlets operating in the Ukrainian
      information environment.” This included developing outlets “around real-world
      personalities,” avoiding “the appearance of narrow tribalism,” and “[showing]
      respect to Russian culture and history” when “criticising Russian policy.” Meanwhile,
      “long-form content” should focus on “newsworthy interviews”, with outlets posting
      “appropriate content” across platforms “in an integrated manner around a central
      narrative…[tailored] to audience profiles.” It is uncertain why Thomson Reuters
      Foundation commissioned Valent to identify the most popular independent media
      outlets and personalities, and effective propaganda strategies, in Ukraine. Nonetheless,
      The Grayzone has previously revealed the Foundation groomed a secret army of pro-Western
      Russian journalists under a covert Foreign Office operation, to “weaken the Russian
      state’s influence”. More gravely, this journalist has also exposed how Reuters
      and TRF created a British intelligence-funded astroturf opposition media outlet
      in Egypt, Aswat Masriya , which was central to Cairo’s brutal 2013 military coup.
      Thomson Reuters Foundation proposes secretly creating ‘independent’ media outlet
      for Ukraine’s 2019 elections Strikingly, leaked TRF files related to Aswat Masriya
      proposed repeating the exercise in Kiev, “timed for the run up to the 2019 elections.”
      That vote saw Zelensky elected by landslide, on a peace platform. This project
      was ostensibly inspired by “a lack of in-depth, independent news coverage” in
      Ukraine, which the Foundation considered “particularly problematic at key political
      junctures such as elections, especially when vested interests seek to influence
      particular outcomes.” In this context, the timing of Valent’s research effort
      for TRF is rendered rather suspect. In March 2021, Zelensky issued a decree ,
      outlining a “strategy for the de-occupation and reintegration” of “temporarily
      occupied territory” in Crimea and Donbass. It sketched a blueprint for the military
      to recapture both territories. Immediately, Kiev’s forces began massing in the
      south and east of Ukraine, a key precursor to the proxy conflict that erupted
      in February 2022. Perhaps Zelensky’s British intelligence backers wished to ensure
      in advance local “independent” media figures and outlets were supportive of the
      President’s “strategy” to ignite war with Russia? Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      By Vijay Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research In 1957, Mao
      Zedong oversaw the publication of Socialist Upsurge in China’s Countryside , a
      three-volume collection of articles compiled by the Communist Party of China for
      the political education of the peasantry. The following year, selections from
      these volumes were republished in abridged and regional editions. One such edition
      included a report from the Anyang Regional Communist Party Committee’s Office
      for the Co-operative Movement with an introduction by Mao. The text, called ‘Who
      Says a Chicken Feather Can’t Fly up to Heaven?’, provides the title for this newsletter.
      The chicken feather’s task is the task of socialism: to do what is considered
      by many to be impossible. The peasants of Anyang, Mao wrote, faced a choice between
      capitalism and socialism – although any socialist construction would inevitably
      bear traces of the capitalist system, as it must emerge out of existing forms
      of social production. ‘The poor want to remake their lives’, Mao wrote. ‘The old
      system is dying. A new system is being born. Chicken feathers really are flying
      up to heaven’. But Mao remained cautious. In the preface to another article, ‘They
      Insist on Taking the Road to Co-Operation’ (20 September 1955), he wrote: Socialism
      is something new. A severe struggle must be waged against the old ways before
      socialism can be brought about. At a given time, a section of society is very
      stubborn and refuses to abandon its old ways. At another time, these same people
      may change their attitude and approve the new. Ever since socialist forces have
      endeavoured to build a society free from the wretched outcomes of capitalism,
      they have had to contend with the challenge of transcending pre-existing social
      relations. The mechanisms to allocate resources under the capitalist system –
      such as the ‘profit incentive’ – create the conditions for private control over
      social processes, which in turn generate enormous waste and inequality. When socialists
      have tried to imagine a society without the commodification of labour – one of
      the defining features of capitalism – they have found themselves replicating the
      wage system through experiments such as labour vouchers based on time worked.
      The transition away from commodified labour was not going to be abrupt or simple,
      but rather a protracted process of struggle to de-commodify key areas of social
      life (such as healthcare, education, and transportation) and to create mechanisms
      for people to acquire goods for personal use through non-wage means. When socialist
      forces took state power – as in the USSR after 1917 and China after 1949 – they
      struggled to construct elementary forms of socialism while navigating the following
      conundrums: Limited systems for managing information. Socialisteconomies were
      vast and complex yet lacked adequate mechanisms to gather and process all the
      data required for the effective planning of a dynamic economy – a challenge that
      persists even today, despite powerful computing technologies. Fundamental uncertainty
      in decision-making. Planning authorities had to make budgetary and investment
      decisions under conditions of uncertainty, particularly as rapid advances in science
      and technology risked rendering major investments obsolete. Tension between long-term
      planning and short-term demand. Central plans often clashed with shifting consumer
      tastes, making it difficult to align long-term planned investment with the short-term
      tastes and whims of consumers. Conflicting political objectives. Economic goals
      were not always politically unified, and competing visions embedded in various
      plans often led to acute forms of bureaucratisation. There is no formula for overcoming
      these and other problems faced by socialist projects once in state power. They
      must be solved experimentally – or, as the Chinese saying goes, by ‘crossing the
      river by feeling the stones’ (摸着石头过河). It is fitting, then, that the June 2025
      edition of Wenhua Zongheng , published by Tricontinental: Institute for Social
      Research and focused on ‘ Chinese Experiments in Socialist Modernisation ’, opens
      with an essay by the Chinese writer Li Tuo titled ‘On the Experimental Nature
      of Socialism and the Complexity of China’s Reform and Opening Up’. One of the
      key insights of Li Tuo’s fascinating essay – which journeys from the Paris Commune
      to China’s reform and opening up – is that socialist revolutions, particularly
      in formerly colonised or economically underdeveloped countries, cannot transition
      directly to ‘complete socialism’ but must go through – quoting Lenin – ‘a series
      of varied, imperfect, and concrete attempts to create this or that socialist state’.
      I like the emphasis on ‘this or that socialist state’. There is no blueprint,
      but there are examples that need to be studied and histories that need to be properly
      digested. This is precisely what Li Tuo does in his essay, which he ends by marvelling
      at the creation of the high-speed rail system in China. The next essay, written
      by Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin and titled ‘Industrial Policy with Chinese Characteristics:
      The Political Economy of China’s Intermediary Institutions’, examines China’s
      socialist modernisation with the diligence it demands – not just with awe but
      through close study. Every time I hear Meng Jie lecture or read his work on China’s
      market economy, I am deeply impressed by his insistence on building theory from
      active research in the very factories that produce the goods for modern China.
      Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin’s essay is no different, drawing on field research conducted
      in various factories along the high-speed rail supply chain. What the authors
      find is that China’s high-speed rail production system was built within the state-owned
      sector but conceptualised within a ‘constructive market’ framework where ‘intra-governmental
      competition’ served as the engine of innovation. In other words, the Chinese state
      constructed a market that involved not just a profit-seeking private sector but
      also a product-oriented public sector with institutions competing to achieve national
      development goals. Finance for this entire system came from state-owned financial
      institutions that steered capital accumulation towards social use rather than
      merely a high rate of return. As Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin write, ‘The primary
      goal of state-owned capital is to implement the objectives of socialist production
      and fulfil the tasks set by the national development plans and strategies’. This
      essay is part of a broader effort by Meng Jie and his collaborators to try to
      understand the system of production relations and innovation that China has developed
      – a crucial area of enquiry as the country enters the era of ‘new quality productive
      forces’, a key concept in contemporary Chinese development policy. One of the
      key elements of this latest issue of Wenhua Zongheng is to show that class struggle
      continues during the period of socialist construction. What this means is that
      various experiments are needed along the way to see what works and what doesn’t
      – both to develop the productive forces and to put in place more equitable social
      relations. In this process there has been a continued ideological struggle inside
      China as the capitalists seek ways to reproduce themselves. However, under China’s
      socialist system, capitalists are not permitted to organise themselves into a
      class with political power through ownership of media, financial systems, political
      parties, or other institutions. They cannot freely take their profits overseas
      or invest them wherever they like. There are several strategic dams in place –
      including capital controls – that regulate the flow of capital and prevent the
      Chinese capitalists from becoming oligarchic and refusing to invest in their country
      (a problem faced by so many governments in both the Global North and South, where
      oligarchs can take their capital wherever they want and even go on ‘strike’ by
      refusing to invest in infrastructure or industry). China’s capital remains within
      the country and in reach of a state-owned banking system that puts that capital
      to work within the parameters of the national development plan. Capitalists can
      operate in the country, but they cannot dominate the system and allow their profit-seeking
      behaviour to become paramount. In this way, the class struggle is tilted in favour
      of the people. This is what separates the socialist system in China from the capitalist
      systems in other countries. In The German Ideology (1846), Marx and Engels wrote
      of the ‘muck of ages’ that needed to be set aside for a new world to be born.
      This act of setting aside is going to take a very long time. The chicken feather
      certainly has not yet reached heaven, but it is not in hell either. Editor’s Note

      of social production. ‘The poor want to remake their lives’, Mao wrote. ‘The old
      system is dying. A new system is being born. Chicken feathers really are flying
      up to heaven’. But Mao remained cautious. In the preface to another article, ‘They
      Insist on Taking the Road to Co-Operation’ (20 September 1955), he wrote: Socialism
      is something new. A severe struggle must be waged against the old ways before
      socialism can be brought about. At a given time, a section of society is very
      stubborn and refuses to abandon its old ways. At another time, these same people
      may change their attitude and approve the new. Ever since socialist forces have
      endeavoured to build a society free from the wretched outcomes of capitalism,
      they have had to contend with the challenge of transcending pre-existing social
      relations. The mechanisms to allocate resources under the capitalist system –
      such as the ‘profit incentive’ – create the conditions for private control over
      social processes, which in turn generate enormous waste and inequality. When socialists
      have tried to imagine a society without the commodification of labour – one of
      the defining features of capitalism – they have found themselves replicating the
      wage system through experiments such as labour vouchers based on time worked.
      The transition away from commodified labour was not going to be abrupt or simple,
      but rather a protracted process of struggle to de-commodify key areas of social
      life (such as healthcare, education, and transportation) and to create mechanisms
      for people to acquire goods for personal use through non-wage means. When socialist
      forces took state power – as in the USSR after 1917 and China after 1949 – they
      struggled to construct elementary forms of socialism while navigating the following
      conundrums: Limited systems for managing information. Socialisteconomies were
      vast and complex yet lacked adequate mechanisms to gather and process all the
      data required for the effective planning of a dynamic economy – a challenge that
      persists even today, despite powerful computing technologies. Fundamental uncertainty
      in decision-making. Planning authorities had to make budgetary and investment
      decisions under conditions of uncertainty, particularly as rapid advances in science
      and technology risked rendering major investments obsolete. Tension between long-term
      planning and short-term demand. Central plans often clashed with shifting consumer
      tastes, making it difficult to align long-term planned investment with the short-term
      tastes and whims of consumers. Conflicting political objectives. Economic goals
      were not always politically unified, and competing visions embedded in various
      plans often led to acute forms of bureaucratisation. There is no formula for overcoming
      these and other problems faced by socialist projects once in state power. They
      must be solved experimentally – or, as the Chinese saying goes, by ‘crossing the
      river by feeling the stones’ (摸着石头过河). It is fitting, then, that the June 2025
      edition of Wenhua Zongheng , published by Tricontinental: Institute for Social
      Research and focused on ‘ Chinese Experiments in Socialist Modernisation ’, opens
      with an essay by the Chinese writer Li Tuo titled ‘On the Experimental Nature
      of Socialism and the Complexity of China’s Reform and Opening Up’. One of the
      key insights of Li Tuo’s fascinating essay – which journeys from the Paris Commune
      to China’s reform and opening up – is that socialist revolutions, particularly
      in formerly colonised or economically underdeveloped countries, cannot transition
      directly to ‘complete socialism’ but must go through – quoting Lenin – ‘a series
      of varied, imperfect, and concrete attempts to create this or that socialist state’.
      I like the emphasis on ‘this or that socialist state’. There is no blueprint,
      but there are examples that need to be studied and histories that need to be properly
      digested. This is precisely what Li Tuo does in his essay, which he ends by marvelling
      at the creation of the high-speed rail system in China. The next essay, written
      by Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin and titled ‘Industrial Policy with Chinese Characteristics:
      The Political Economy of China’s Intermediary Institutions’, examines China’s
      socialist modernisation with the diligence it demands – not just with awe but
      through close study. Every time I hear Meng Jie lecture or read his work on China’s
      market economy, I am deeply impressed by his insistence on building theory from
      active research in the very factories that produce the goods for modern China.
      Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin’s essay is no different, drawing on field research conducted
      in various factories along the high-speed rail supply chain. What the authors
      find is that China’s high-speed rail production system was built within the state-owned
      sector but conceptualised within a ‘constructive market’ framework where ‘intra-governmental
      competition’ served as the engine of innovation. In other words, the Chinese state
      constructed a market that involved not just a profit-seeking private sector but
      also a product-oriented public sector with institutions competing to achieve national
      development goals. Finance for this entire system came from state-owned financial
      institutions that steered capital accumulation towards social use rather than
      merely a high rate of return. As Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin write, ‘The primary
      goal of state-owned capital is to implement the objectives of socialist production
      and fulfil the tasks set by the national development plans and strategies’. This
      essay is part of a broader effort by Meng Jie and his collaborators to try to
      understand the system of production relations and innovation that China has developed
      – a crucial area of enquiry as the country enters the era of ‘new quality productive
      forces’, a key concept in contemporary Chinese development policy. One of the
      key elements of this latest issue of Wenhua Zongheng is to show that class struggle
      continues during the period of socialist construction. What this means is that
      various experiments are needed along the way to see what works and what doesn’t
      – both to develop the productive forces and to put in place more equitable social
      relations. In this process there has been a continued ideological struggle inside
      China as the capitalists seek ways to reproduce themselves. However, under China’s
      socialist system, capitalists are not permitted to organise themselves into a
      class with political power through ownership of media, financial systems, political
      parties, or other institutions. They cannot freely take their profits overseas
      or invest them wherever they like. There are several strategic dams in place –
      including capital controls – that regulate the flow of capital and prevent the
      Chinese capitalists from becoming oligarchic and refusing to invest in their country
      (a problem faced by so many governments in both the Global North and South, where
      oligarchs can take their capital wherever they want and even go on ‘strike’ by
      refusing to invest in infrastructure or industry). China’s capital remains within
      the country and in reach of a state-owned banking system that puts that capital
      to work within the parameters of the national development plan. Capitalists can
      operate in the country, but they cannot dominate the system and allow their profit-seeking
      behaviour to become paramount. In this way, the class struggle is tilted in favour
      of the people. This is what separates the socialist system in China from the capitalist
      systems in other countries. In The German Ideology (1846), Marx and Engels wrote
      of the ‘muck of ages’ that needed to be set aside for a new world to be born.
      This act of setting aside is going to take a very long time. The chicken feather
      certainly has not yet reached heaven, but it is not in hell either. Editor’s Note

      Dreams Federal immigration agents were met with a strong show of resistance Thursday
      when they raided two farms in Southern California—with hundreds of community members
      protesting the arrests of migrants at the facilities growing cannabis and vegetables.
      Los Angeles-based independent journalist Mel Buer reported that hundreds of community
      members gathered to protest the raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
      at Glass House Farms’ facility in Camarillo, Ventura County, and supporters dropped
      “hundreds of pounds of water, food, and masks.” Local news outlet KTLA reported
      that “dozens of farmworkers were detained” in the raids at Glass House Farms’
      properties in Camarillo and Carpinteria. Federal law enforcement first arrived
      in Camarillo at about 11:00 am, and the situation escalated as a crowd of community
      members gathered. The federal agents first deployed tear gas into the crowd early
      Thursday afternoon. Ventura County District 5 Supervisor Vianey Lopez told KTLA
      that as the federal agents used force on the protesters, she saw two government
      vans, each carrying about 15 people, leaving the farm. “It is an ongoing situation
      that is very concerning for the safety of those showing up with anger and disappointment
      at what is happening to hardworking people in our community,” Lopez said. The
      immigration enforcement agents were joined by National Guard troops in military
      vehicles later that afternoon in Camarillo, according to The Guardian , as other
      federal agents carried out a simultaneous raid in Carpinteria, about 50 miles
      northwest in Santa Barbara County. Carpinteria City Council members Julia Mayer
      and Mónica Solórzano were among a large crowd of community members who gathered
      to protest the raid, and they told the Santa Barbara Independent that federal
      officers “pushed us as a group into the ground” and threw at least one smoke grenade,
      causing Solórzano to injure her arm. View this post on Instagram A post shared
      by Santa Barbara Independent (@sbindependent) U.S. Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.),
      who represents Santa Barbara County and part of Ventura County, released a statement
      condemning the ICE raid and saying he had been “denied entry and not allowed to
      pass” when he attempted to “conduct oversight” over the raid targeting his constituents
      in Carpinteria. “ICE was conducting a raid using disproportionate displays of
      force against local farmworkers and our agricultural community,” said Carbajal.
      “There’s been a troubling lack of transparency from ICE since the Trump administration
      started, and I won’t stop asking questions on behalf of my constituents.” Carbajal
      is now one of several Democratic elected officials who have been denied the ability
      to oversee ICE operations. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) pleaded not guilty last
      month to forcibly interfering with federal officers—charges that stemmed from
      her attempt to conduct congressional oversight at an ICE detention center in Newark,
      New Jersey. “These militarized ICE raids are not how you keep our communities
      safe. This kind of chaos only traumatizes families and tears communities apart.
      They are also a gross misuse of limited resources and a betrayal of the values
      that define us as Americans,” said Carbajal, who noted that the identities of
      those detained in the raids had not been made clear. In Camarillo, a resident
      named Judith Ramos told The Guardian that she had learned from her father, who
      worked in Glass House Farms’ tomato fields, that “immigration was outside his
      job” on Thursday morning. Ramos, a 22-year-old certified nurse assistant with
      two younger siblings, said her father told her “to take care of everything” if
      he was detained by ICE. She was sprayed with a chemical substance when she arrived
      at the farm and joined the crowd of protesters, and told The Guardian that she
      did not know where her father was. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has clashed
      with President Donald Trump and filed a lawsuit against the administration last
      month over its federalization of the California National Guard to respond to protests
      against immigration raids in Los Angeles, posted a video showing children running
      from the federal agents. Kids running from tear gas, crying on the phone because

      on 10 July that Beijing and Moscow should strengthen strategic coordination to
      promote peace in West Asia. According to a statement by China’s Foreign Ministry,
      Yi said the two countries should push for a diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear
      issue during a meeting with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Kuala Lumpur.
      “Peace cannot be achieved through force, and applying pressure won’t solve problems.”
      Dialogue and negotiations were the solution to the conflict, Yi added. The two
      foreign ministers also discussed China–Russia coordination with the countries
      comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “Russia and China
      stand united in opposing actions and plans to militarize the region, including
      attempts to deploy NATO-standard military infrastructure,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry
      stated after the meeting. During the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro on 7 July,
      Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow was ready to aid in
      mediating negotiations between the US and Iran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear
      program. Lavrov offered Russia’s technical assistance to help Iran replenish its
      depleted uranium stocks by removing uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels
      and replacing it with uranium suitable for power generation. “We have technological
      capacities and we are ready to offer them, taking the excess of overly enriched
      uranium and returning the power-generation-grade uranium to the Islamic Republic
      and its nuclear facilities.” The US and Israel have insisted that Iran end all
      uranium enrichment on its own soil. Tehran insists that enriching uranium within
      its borders is its right under international law and according to the Nuclear
      Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran is seeking relief from US sanctions in exchange
      for limitations on its nuclear program, which it insists is for producing energy,
      not a nuclear weapon. On 8 July, Iran denied US President Donald Trump’s claim
      that it had requested to resume talks with the US over its nuclear program. “No
      request for a meeting has been made on our side to the American side,” Iranian
      Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Tuesday. The US and Iran were
      engaged in nuclear talks in June when Israel launched a surprise war on Tehran
      on 13 June. During the 12-day war, Israeli bombing killed 1,060 people, while
      Iran’s retaliatory drone and missile attacks on Israel resulted in at least 28
      deaths. The US joined the attack on 22 June by bombing three of Iran’s major nuclear
      sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump reportedly used the nuclear negotiations
      to deceive Iranian leaders into thinking that no Israeli attack was imminent.
      “Israel and the US carried out a multi-faceted misinformation campaign in recent
      days to convince Iran that a strike on its nuclear facilities was not imminent,”
      the Times of Israel reported. A US official told the Israeli news site that US
      President Donald Trump was an “active participant in the ruse,” and knew about

      on 10 July that Beijing and Moscow should strengthen strategic coordination to
      promote peace in West Asia. According to a statement by China’s Foreign Ministry,
      Yi said the two countries should push for a diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear
      issue during a meeting with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Kuala Lumpur.
      “Peace cannot be achieved through force, and applying pressure won’t solve problems.”
      Dialogue and negotiations were the solution to the conflict, Yi added. The two
      foreign ministers also discussed China–Russia coordination with the countries
      comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “Russia and China
      stand united in opposing actions and plans to militarize the region, including
      attempts to deploy NATO-standard military infrastructure,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry
      stated after the meeting. During the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro on 7 July,
      Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow was ready to aid in
      mediating negotiations between the US and Iran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear
      program. Lavrov offered Russia’s technical assistance to help Iran replenish its
      depleted uranium stocks by removing uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels
      and replacing it with uranium suitable for power generation. “We have technological
      capacities and we are ready to offer them, taking the excess of overly enriched
      uranium and returning the power-generation-grade uranium to the Islamic Republic
      and its nuclear facilities.” The US and Israel have insisted that Iran end all
      uranium enrichment on its own soil. Tehran insists that enriching uranium within
      its borders is its right under international law and according to the Nuclear
      Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran is seeking relief from US sanctions in exchange
      for limitations on its nuclear program, which it insists is for producing energy,
      not a nuclear weapon. On 8 July, Iran denied US President Donald Trump’s claim
      that it had requested to resume talks with the US over its nuclear program. “No
      request for a meeting has been made on our side to the American side,” Iranian
      Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Tuesday. The US and Iran were
      engaged in nuclear talks in June when Israel launched a surprise war on Tehran
      on 13 June. During the 12-day war, Israeli bombing killed 1,060 people, while
      Iran’s retaliatory drone and missile attacks on Israel resulted in at least 28
      deaths. The US joined the attack on 22 June by bombing three of Iran’s major nuclear
      sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump reportedly used the nuclear negotiations
      to deceive Iranian leaders into thinking that no Israeli attack was imminent.
      “Israel and the US carried out a multi-faceted misinformation campaign in recent
      days to convince Iran that a strike on its nuclear facilities was not imminent,”
      the Times of Israel reported. A US official told the Israeli news site that US
      President Donald Trump was an “active participant in the ruse,” and knew about
      the military operation in advance. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

      donation . By Mike Ludwig / Truthout Alocal sanitation workers strike that began
      on July 1 in Boston, Massachusetts, and left trash unpicked across the city is
      now spreading nationwide in a series of labor actions coordinated by the Teamsters
      union as frustrated workers demand better pay and benefits from Republic Services,
      a major waste disposal company. The Teamsters said on July 9 that 2,000 sanitation
      workers were on strike in multiple cities while others refused to cross picket
      lines in solidarity with striking workers at local Republic Services sites in
      Massachusetts, Illinois , Washington State , and California . For example, workers
      in the Bay Area launched a temporary trash pickup stoppage this week in solidarity
      with fellow workers striking over negotiations with Republic Services for better
      pay at a regional landfill near Stockton. “Republic Services has been threatening
      a war with American workers for years — and now, they’ve got one,” said Teamsters
      General President Sean M. O’Brien in a statement on Wednesday. While trash collection
      has resumed in some Boston residential neighborhoods, trash bags continued to
      pile up this week outside businesses and in dumpsters as sanitation workers demand
      higher wages, better benefits, and paid time off, according to local reports.
      The Boston City Council voted unanimously on July 9 to support the workers in
      their strike, which council members said was both a labor issue and a public health
      issue. In a statement to local media this week, Teamsters Local 25 in Boston told
      Republic Services on July 3 that it was prepared to extend the picket line to
      other cities if the company failed to begin contract negotiations with the union
      by July 7, but the company did not meet the deadline. Republic Services is a private
      contractor in charge of waste pickup and disposal in cities across the country,
      and work stoppages spread coast to coast this week after Local 25 extended the
      picket line to job sites beyond Boston. Republic Services did not respond to a
      request for comment from Truthout by the time this story was published. In a statement
      to local media in Boston, the company said it stands ready to meet with the Teamsters
      Local 25 “when they are ready to re-engage.” “We will continue to focus on providing
      service and doing right by our employees,” Republic Services said. “We call on
      Teamsters’ leadership to immediately stop the instigation, intimidation, and criminal
      acts, and resolve this situation.” The right to join a union and go on strike
      is protected by federal labor law, so it’s unclear what “criminal acts” Republic
      Services could be referring to in its response to Local 25 in Boston. Raising
      the specter of criminal prosecution may itself be an intimidation tactic. O’Brien
      said the Teamsters are not backing down because Republic Services “abuses and
      underpays” sanitation workers serving communities across the country. “They burn
      massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives,” O’Brien
      said. “The Teamsters have had it with Republic. We will flood the streets and
      shut down garbage collection in state after state. Workers are uniting nationwide,
      and we will get the wages and benefits we’ve earned, come hell or high water.”
      In a statement, the Teamsters union says Republic Services has refused to bargain
      in good faith and settle fair labor contracts with sanitation workers despite
      months of negotiations in cities around the country. Instead, the company has
      resorted to “union-busting tactics” and “illegal threats” in order to provoke
      a nationwide strike. Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said
      Republic Services is one of the most “depraved employers we’ve ever come across.”
      “Republic has lied, stalled, and broken the law to try to squeeze every last dime
      out of workers. But these corporate thieves have underestimated our members,”
      Zuckerman said in a statement on July 9. The war of words comes as work stoppages
      spread, potentially delaying trash pickup for millions of people. However, Zuckerman
      said the Teamsters will not give up until they receive a fair contract from Republic
      Services. “To the millions of Americans seeing their trash pile up because of
      Republic’s strike, remember one thing: this corporation has hauled in $77 billion,”
      said Victor Mineros, director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division,
      in a statement. “Republic can easily afford a fair and competitive contract that
      meets the needs of everyday hardworking Americans.” While Truthout was unable
      to verify that Republic Services has brought in $77 billion in revenue, an earnings
      statement released to investors shows the company had a net income of $2 billion
      in 2024. Republic Services reported revenue growth at 5.6 percent over the three
      months ending in December 2024, and the company returned nearly $1.2 billion to
      shareholders last year. Adan Alvarez, a waste management worker in southern California,
      said his local Teamsters union is not technically on strike against Republic Services.
      Instead, their union contract allows workers to refuse crossing a picket line,
      and workers in southern California announced a work stoppage after Local 25 in
      Boston extended its picket line this week. Alvarez and fellow workers are responsible
      for safely transporting hazardous materials, and their contract with Republic
      Services expires next year. “The reason we support one another is there is strength
      in numbers,” Alvarez told Truthout in an interview. Mineros said sanitation and
      waste management workers perform “dangerous, high-stakes jobs” that protect local
      communities and the environment from pollution and hazardous waste. “They deserve
      a contract that respects their contributions — not lowball proposals and corporate
      stonewalling. The company must bargain in good faith,” Mineros said. Meanwhile,
      after more than a week of work stoppage, an unrelated trash pickup and city services
      strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to an end after eight days in the early
      hours of Wednesday morning after members of the local American Federation of State,
      Council and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union reached a tentative finalized a
      contract with city officials. However, rank- and- file workers still need to approve
      the contract, and some union leaders left the final negotiations in frustration.
      The deal includes a one-time $1,500 bonus and a 3 percent annual wage increase
      for three years, for a total of 9 percent by 2028, according to reports . Union
      leaders pushed for a 5 percent annual wage increase after originally proposing
      an 8 percent annual increase. The average salary for a sanitation worker is $46,000
      a year in Philadelphia, which the union argues is not a living wage. Greg Boulware,
      president of the AFSCME local representing public workers in Philadelphia, told
      the Philadelphia Inquirer that the strike is over and “nobody’s happy” as he left
      negotiations with the city on Wednesday. If the rank and file reject the deal,
      Boulware said the strike could potentially resume . “We felt our clock was running
      out,” Boulware said. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      negative views of immigration had increased markedly, reaching a high point in

      strategy, which has seen mass unrest across the country in the last few months,
      the shift in perception comes mainly from Republicans and independents. According

      donation . By Elham Azad / Truthout In early June 2025, The Guardian revealed
      that the University of Michigan paid over $800,000 to Amerishield, parent company
      to a private security company called City Shield. It was part of a broader $3
      million public‑security budget, which included surveillance of pro‑Palestinian
      student activists. The university hired plainclothes agents who trailed students
      into cafés, harassed them, and even staged confrontations, including faking a
      disability to falsely accuse them of theft. City Shield , a private security agency
      based out of Detroit, used the supposed evidence collected by their agents against
      these students to prosecute them and send them to jail. Massive Blue, a company
      based in New York, has created a surveillance tool called Overwatch that uses
      AI to monitor online spaces. Although this tool is sold and marketed as a public
      safety tool, the technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate
      online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence, particularly
      targeting college protesters and activists labeled as “radicalized.” These bots
      are created to imitate human behavior, making them very hard to detect. The tech
      stack these agencies deploy is formidable: geofencing tools, license plate readers,
      real-time social media surveillance, predictive analytics. Even Radian6, a Salesforce
      product, has been linked to student protest monitoring . These tools don’t just
      observe behavior, they anticipate it, allowing administrators and police to intervene
      before a rally even begins. This surveillance is not merely bureaucratic overreach.
      It is an act of intimidation, one that reflects an ideological alignment with
      systems of repression abroad. In Gaza, for example, humanitarian aid is increasingly
      distributed only through biometric registration , leaving starving Palestinians
      with no choice but to submit to facial and fingerprint scans to access food. Although
      aid agencies and occupying forces justify this as a form of “efficiency,” it can
      only be seen as coercive surveillance, stripping Palestinians of dignity and autonomy
      under the guise of relief. Within the United States, university officials have
      increasingly turned to firms like ShadowDragon, Skydio, and Stellar Technologies,
      whose tools are capable of profiling, analyzing, and geolocating social media
      posts , drone-mapping encampments , and even identifying masked protestors through
      AI-enhanced facial recognition . These companies aren’t developing tools for student
      safety. They’re developing battlefield tech and students are the new targets.
      In April 2024, when students at Columbia University set up a peaceful encampment
      to protest the genocide in Gaza, few expected the administration to respond with
      mass arrests. Fewer still understood the extent to which military-grade surveillance
      technologies were already in place to track them. In the same month, Jewish Currents
      reported on Yale University’s use of drones, surveillance cameras, and plainclothes
      officers to monitor pro-Palestine student activists. Surveillance footage was
      used to identify students who had not violated any laws but had simply been present.
      Meanwhile, in May 2025, it was revealed that LAPD used Dataminr to track the social
      media activity of students organizing pro-Palestine events . Surveillance reports
      included screenshots of Instagram stories, private group chats, and Twitter threads.
      Some of this data was sourced using tools built by Dataminr and Social Sentinel,
      both of which specialize in identifying “emerging threats” by combing through
      vast amounts of social media data tools originally developed for use by law enforcement
      and intelligence agencies. In addition, in March 2024, it was revealed that Elon
      Musk’s X was also selling user data to Dataminr . The logic is chillingly consistent:
      Dissent is pathologized, monitored, and neutralized while capitalists keep making
      money. And universities have become willing partners in this process. In my Ph.D.
      research, I studied surveillance infrastructures, particularly in contexts where
      settler colonial regimes seek to erase dissent. What we’re seeing on U.S. campuses
      today mirrors repression models from places like East Turkestan (Xinjiang), where
      everyday resistance is quelled through predictive monitoring and data extraction
      . What this tells us is that surveillance isn’t about protection, it’s about power.
      And American universities are rapidly becoming test beds for the kind of repressive
      technology we associate with authoritarian states abroad. The money behind these
      technologies flows through a familiar nexus of venture capital firms , defense
      contractors, and government agencies. ShadowDragon, for example, has been celebrated
      by the World Economic Forum and boasts contracts with U.S. law enforcement and
      military branches. Cobwebs Technologies, Xtend, and Oosto are Israeli surveillance
      companies whose products are now being deployed against student activists in the
      U.S . These firms have marketed their tools based on effectiveness in tracking
      Palestinians and other “high-risk” populations. Now, they are used on American
      campuses to monitor solidarity. There is a historical precedent to this kind of
      repression. During the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s and 70s,
      FBI programs like COINTELPRO targeted student activist groups like the Student
      Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society
      (SDS), and organizations like the Black Panther Party, with infiltration, wiretaps,
      and blackmail. The FBI’s targeting of student and civil rights activists through
      COINTELPRO is well-documented, as explored in this Yale News interview with historian
      Beverly Gage, who says J. Edgar Hoover’s tactics were both coercive and widely
      normalized. Hoover was the first director of the FBI, serving from 1924 until
      his death in 1972. However, the difference today is scale and automation. Rather
      than needing a human informant in every room, university administrators can now
      rely on machine learning algorithms to scan student emails, monitor group chats,
      and alert authorities to so-called “escalation indicators.” Recently, billionaire
      investor Kevin O’Leary called for permanently destroying the digital lives of
      student protesters using AI-based doxxing campaigns . While O’Leary was widely
      condemned, his dystopian vision isn’t far from the reality already taking root.
      Companies like Babel Street and Stellar Technologies offer tools with the explicit
      promise of identifying individuals based on minimal data inputs like a partial
      image or a Twitter handle. Tools like NesherAI claim to identify masked individuals
      in a crowd using behavioral and gait analysis. Corsight AI advertises facial recognition
      that works through masks, hoods, and sunglasses. These are not theoretical tools.
      They’re being piloted now, often in secret, and often in tandem with increasing
      police presence on campuses. These developments must be viewed in the broader
      context of the militarization of civilian life. The pipeline between Gaza and
      Georgia Tech is not rhetorical. Technologies field-tested in war zones are refined
      and normalized on American campuses, where students are reduced to data points
      in behavioral prediction models. Israeli firms developed surveillance for use
      in Gaza and the West Bank are now contracted domestically. Surveillance technologies
      once reserved for military and foreign operations are now being deployed on U.S.
      university campuses, targeting student protestors, particularly those demonstrating
      for Palestine. These tools are not isolated innovations. Many were tested on Palestinians
      and Uyghurs before being repurposed for U.S. settings. This is not a breakdown
      of democratic norms but their systematic redirection using universities as testbeds
      for next-generation policing. University administrators often claim that surveillance
      is about safety. But whose safety? Lately, surveillance tools have mostly targeted
      the most vulnerable in our communities: Muslims, Indigenous people, undocumented
      immigrants, Black people, and anyone who supports Palestinian liberation and an
      end to the U.S.-sponsored genocide in Gaza. They claim that these tools are here
      to protect us, but in truth, they only serve to erase us, discipline us, and punish
      us. It doesn’t have to be this way. Campuses have historically been sites of inquiry,
      dissent, and transformation, not laboratories for digital repression, and we must
      fight to keep them that way. We must reject the narrative that surveillance is
      inevitable. It is not. It is a political choice, made behind closed doors, mostly
      without consent or oversight of those who are affected the most. Surveillance
      Watch is one intervention in this landscape, an attempt to shift the power back
      to those being watched. It is a community‑driven project that deploys interactive
      maps and databases to reveal the web of surveillance companies, their funders,
      subsidiaries, affiliations, and global operations in an effort to make opaque
      surveillance networks transparent. However, we need more. We need more public
      and legal accountability, more student organizing, more media scrutiny, and way
      more institutional courage. We need to say, unequivocally, that resistance is
      not a threat. It is a right. We are not subjects. We are watching back. Editor’s

      context of the militarization of civilian life. The pipeline between Gaza and
      Georgia Tech is not rhetorical. Technologies field-tested in war zones are refined
      and normalized on American campuses, where students are reduced to data points
      in behavioral prediction models. Israeli firms developed surveillance for use
      in Gaza and the West Bank are now contracted domestically. Surveillance technologies
      once reserved for military and foreign operations are now being deployed on U.S.
      university campuses, targeting student protestors, particularly those demonstrating
      for Palestine. These tools are not isolated innovations. Many were tested on Palestinians
      and Uyghurs before being repurposed for U.S. settings. This is not a breakdown
      of democratic norms but their systematic redirection using universities as testbeds
      for next-generation policing. University administrators often claim that surveillance
      is about safety. But whose safety? Lately, surveillance tools have mostly targeted
      the most vulnerable in our communities: Muslims, Indigenous people, undocumented
      immigrants, Black people, and anyone who supports Palestinian liberation and an
      end to the U.S.-sponsored genocide in Gaza. They claim that these tools are here
      to protect us, but in truth, they only serve to erase us, discipline us, and punish
      us. It doesn’t have to be this way. Campuses have historically been sites of inquiry,
      dissent, and transformation, not laboratories for digital repression, and we must
      fight to keep them that way. We must reject the narrative that surveillance is
      inevitable. It is not. It is a political choice, made behind closed doors, mostly
      without consent or oversight of those who are affected the most. Surveillance
      Watch is one intervention in this landscape, an attempt to shift the power back
      to those being watched. It is a community‑driven project that deploys interactive
      maps and databases to reveal the web of surveillance companies, their funders,
      subsidiaries, affiliations, and global operations in an effort to make opaque
      surveillance networks transparent. However, we need more. We need more public
      and legal accountability, more student organizing, more media scrutiny, and way
      more institutional courage. We need to say, unequivocally, that resistance is
      not a threat. It is a right. We are not subjects. We are watching back. Editor’s

    one_sentence_summary: The University of Michigan reportedly spent over $800,000
      on a private security firm to surveil and harass pro-Palestinian student activists,
      including employing undercover agents to stage confrontations and falsely accuse
      them of theft.
    paragraph_summary: In June 2025, The Guardian reported that the University of Michigan
      allocated over $800,000 to Amerishield, the parent company of City Shield, for
      a public security budget exceeding $3 million, which included the surveillance
      of pro-Palestinian student activists. The university employed plainclothes agents
      to follow and harass students, staging confrontations and using fabricated evidence
      to prosecute them. Additionally, Massive Blue's AI surveillance tool, Overwatch,
      infiltrates online activist groups with virtual characters to collect intelligence
      on those labeled as "radicalized." This extensive surveillance infrastructure,
      which includes geofencing, license plate readers, and predictive analytics, enables
      authorities to monitor and anticipate student protests, raising significant concerns
      about civil liberties and the targeting of dissent.

      Corps of Engineers is constructing new military infrastructure for Israel across
      several bases, including airfields, hangars, and ammunition depots, according
      to public records reported by Haaretz on 8 July. The current projects total more
      than $250 million, with future ones expected to exceed $1 billion, based on a
      call for interested contractors originally scheduled for June but postponed due
      to Israel’s war against Iran. The Israeli news site Haaretz reported on the public
      documents on Monday. The US Army Corps of Engineers is using contractors to build
      ammunition depots, refuelling stations, and concrete structures for Israeli military
      bases. The documents also show that the US is seeking contractors for building
      maintenance and repairs, including work on airfields. One project for hangars,
      maintenance rooms, and storage facilities for new Boeing KC-46 tankers that Israel
      is expected to receive in the coming years is projected to cost over $100 million.
      Another facility to house CH-53K helicopters is expected to cost up to $250 million.
      The US is also soliciting bids for ammunition storage buildings, estimated at
      up to $100 million. A separate seven-year tender, capped at $900 million, covers
      maintenance, repairs, construction, demolition, and infrastructure upgrades at
      unspecified sites for the Israeli Ministry of Defence. These projects are funded
      through foreign military financing. Israel receives $3.8 billion annually in military
      aid, under a system that allows the US and Israel to determine how to spend the
      funds, which are routed to US defense contractors. Since the Hamas-led 7 October
      2023 Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Washington has also provided supplemental military
      aid totalling around $18 billion. The US has previously used military aid for
      Israeli infrastructure. In 2012, public tender documents showed large-scale US-funded
      works at Nevatim air base. At the time, the Washington Post reported that the
      US had constructed a secret facility there, known as site “911.” The construction
      projects detailed on Monday were planned before the June 2025 Israeli attack on
      Iran. On 2 July, Reuters cited an Israeli official confirming that Iranian ballistic
      missiles struck several Israeli military sites during the 12-day exchange. Earlier
      in June, Washington approved a $510 million arms deal for Israel, adding over
      7,000 JDAM kits and support services to the growing list of weapons transfers
      in 2025. That package formed part of a broader escalation in US military support,
      which by mid-year had surpassed $9 billion. Tel Aviv reported receiving more than
      90,000 tons of US weapons in 600 days – deliveries Netanyahu credited to Trump
      as “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.” Around the
      same time, the Pentagon halted multiple arms shipments to Ukraine, despite internal
      reviews showing no critical shortage. The decision followed concerns over stockpile
      depletion after the US assisted Israel in intercepting Iranian missiles. Senior
      officials have since pushed for a shift in US military focus toward the Pacific.

      leader Mahmoud Khalil on Thursday began the process of suing U.S. President Donald
      Trump’s administration for $20 million in damages for the harm he suffered as
      a result of the government’s “politically motivated plan to unlawfully arrest,
      detain, and deport” him. “This is the first step towards accountability,” Khalil
      said in a statement. “Nothing can restore the 104 days stolen from me. The trauma,
      the separation from my wife, the birth of my first child that I was forced to
      miss . But let’s be clear, the same government that targeted me for speaking out
      is using taxpayer dollars to fund Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza .” “There
      must be accountability for political retaliation and abuse of power,” he asserted.
      “And I won’t stop here. I will continue to pursue justice against everyone who
      contributed to my unlawful detention or spread lies in an attempt to destroy my
      reputation, including those affiliated with Columbia University. I’m holding the
      U.S. government accountable not just for myself, but for everyone they try to
      silence through fear, exile, or detention.” In March, federal agents who were
      in plain clothes and lacked a warrant accosted Khalil, a lawful permanent resident
      who recently finished a graduate program at Columbia, and his wife—Noor Abdalla,
      a U.S. citizen who was then pregnant with their son—outside their New York City
      home. Following Khalil’s arrest , several other student activists critical of
      the U.S.-backed Israeli assault on Gaza were also targeted for deportation. The
      claim that 30-year-old Khalil filed Thursday against the U.S. Homeland Security
      and State departments, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is
      a precursor to a lawsuit that will cite the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, according
      to the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), part of his legal team. The filing
      accuses the Trump administration of carrying out a plan to deport Khalil “in a
      manner calculated to terrorize him and his family,” and says the mistreatment
      caused “severe emotional distress, economic hardship, damage to his reputation,
      and significant impairment of his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.”
      Mahmoud Khalil has filed a claim against the Trump administration, seeking either
      $20 million or an official apology and change in the administration’s policy after
      he was held in detention for over 100 days. NBC News’ Maya Eaglin spoke to Khalil

      5:01 PM Khalil, an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent who was finally freed
      from an ICE facility in Louisiana last month, is seeking $20 million to help others
      similarly targeted by the government and Columbia, but “he would accept, in lieu
      of payment, an official apology and abandonment of the administration’s unconstitutional
      policy,” CCR explained. The Associated Press reported that “a White House spokesperson
      deferred comment to the State Department, which said its actions were fully supported
      by the law. In an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the
      Department of Homeland Security, called Khalil’s claim ‘absurd,’ accusing him
      of ‘hateful behavior and rhetoric’ that threatened Jewish students.” While the
      departments’ comments signal that the Trump administration won’t be making any
      apologies, Khalil’s team is determined to move forward with his case. “The Trump
      administration’s unconstitutional targeting of Mr. Khalil led to severe harms
      that he continues to navigate, including financial loss, reputational damage,
      and emotional distress,” said Samah Sisay, staff attorney at CCR. “Mr. Khalil
      will never get back the three months stolen from him while in immigration detention,
      including his child’s birth and first months of life. The government must take
      accountability for their unlawful actions and compensate Mr. Khalil for his suffering.”
      Khalil’s claim was filed a day after an ICE official testified under oath that
      a task force formed in March used lists from Canary Mission, an operation linked
      to Israeli intelligence agencies, and the pro-Israel group Betar Worldwide to
      compile reports on international students targeted for their protest activities.

      dissent regarding U.S. support for Israel's actions in Gaza. He emphasizes the
      need for accountability for political retaliation and abuse of power, not only
      for himself but for others who face similar threats. Khalil's arrest, which occurred
      in March when federal agents approached him and his pregnant wife without a warrant,
      has raised concerns about the targeting of activists critical of U.S. foreign
      policy.

      the Trump administration for $20 million, claiming unlawful arrest and detention
      caused him significant personal harm, including missing the birth of his first

    paragraph_summary: Pro-Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil has initiated
      a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking $20 million in damages for
      his unlawful arrest, detention, and deportation, which he claims were politically
      motivated. Khalil, who was detained for 104 days and missed the birth of his first
      child, argues that his targeting was part of a broader government effort to suppress
      dissent regarding U.S. support for Israel's actions in Gaza. He emphasizes the
      need for accountability for political retaliation and abuse of power, not only
      for himself but for others who face similar threats. Khalil's arrest, which occurred
      in March when federal agents approached him and his pregnant wife without a warrant,
      has raised concerns about the targeting of activists critical of U.S. foreign
      policy.

      donation . By Tareq S. Hajjaj / Mondoweiss The Israel-backed and U.S.-run Gaza
      Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has been weathering one public relations disaster
      after another as new information continues to expose the organization’s complicity
      in Israel’s plans to “ concentrate ” Gaza’s population in camps ahead of their
      forcible displacement — in keeping with Israel’s stated military goals of conquering
      the Strip and expelling its people. In service of these goals, the GHF has replaced
      the UN’s aid distribution system with what Gazans describe as “ death traps ,”
      leading Palestinians to accuse the organization of fulfilling Israeli military
      objectives under the guise of humanitarianism. In order to bolster this facade,
      the GHF has been actively attempting to pressure international humanitarian organizations
      into cooperating with the GHF and participating in its operations. The GHF has
      also actively attempted to form a local network of distributors run by companies
      known to have collaborated with the Israeli army in the past. Speaking with several
      individuals and organizations approached by the GHF, Mondoweiss investigations
      reveal that Israel and the GHF are attempting to coerce local and international
      actors into cooperating with the U.S.-Israeli aid scheme. In some cases, the GHF
      has tasked local companies to engage in outreach to the population to advertise
      its centers and handle distribution and logistics. According to sources inside
      Gaza, the Israeli army is also pursuing a broader strategy of pressuring humanitarian
      organizations to either operate under the GHF framework or cease their activities
      altogether. The Israeli military has reportedly forced several international organizations
      to distribute their aid through GHF centers, overriding previous agreements that
      allowed them to operate independently. In many cases, aid shipments that entered
      through Israeli-controlled crossings were redirected — without the knowledge or
      consent of the aid organizations — to the U.S. company’s centers. An official
      security source in the Gaza civil government told Mondoweiss in mid-June that
      Hamas possesses “reliable intelligence” confirming that the GHF has been pressuring
      local institutions to participate in its operations. These attempts were meant
      to force organizations to cooperate in a strategy of “engineering starvation and
      managing chaos,” the official said, which he said was part of “a politically motivated
      and security-driven project disguised in humanitarian garb.” “However, these institutions,
      guided by their national consciousness and ethical commitment, refused to become
      tools for a party responsible for our people’s suffering,” he added. But there
      are some organizations that have cooperated. The GHF and the Israeli army have
      essentially pursued two paths in dominating the humanitarian landscape in Gaza:
      forcing international organizations to either work with the GHF or to halt operations,
      and using local gangs and businesses as part of its “native” network, giving a
      Palestinian face to an Israeli-U.S. operation with military and political objectives.
      Here is how it has attempted to achieve the objective of building this network
      of “aid collaborators.” The case of the al-Khozandar Company On the night of June
      11, 12 employees working for a local trading company were killed after being publicly
      detained by groups affiliated with Hamas’s security forces. Locals said they were
      from the Arrow Force , the Hamas unit tasked with hunting down looters and Israeli-backed
      gangs in Gaza. After being reportedly beaten and shot in the foot, the security
      members publicly accused the individuals of working for a company allegedly collaborating
      with the Israeli military. Eyewitnesses told Mondoweiss that the employees were
      then lynched by a crowd of people who were allegedly incited by the security members,
      who reportedly told the crowds that the employees were responsible for the deaths
      of their loved ones at GHF sites. It later became clear that the individuals were
      employees of the al-Khozandar Company, a commercial firm owned by a Palestinian
      residing in Cairo. The killing of the employees sparked controversy and outrage,
      with the victims’ families issuing a statement on June 17 demanding accountability.
      The statement also denied allegations that their sons were working with the Israeli-backed
      gang led by Yasser Abu Shabab that loots aid across Gaza, calling the accusations
      “false and baseless.” The events surrounding the incident, however, reveal a more
      complex picture. Before the families had issued their statement, the GHF condemned
      the “murder of 12 of our aid workers.” In contrast, the families stated that their
      sons were on their first day of work for al-Khozandar, suggesting that the company
      was working closely with the GHF. The security source in the Gaza government who
      spoke to Mondoweiss in June identified the Mohsen al-Khozandar Trading and Transport
      corporation, headed by a man named Muhammad al-Khozandar, as a “morally and nationally
      compromised” company that “coordinates directly with suspicious foreign actors
      at the expense of our people’s interests.” This company, the source added, “contributes,
      whether knowingly or not, to the systematic killing and starvation of Palestinians.”
      He asserted that “certain measures” have already been taken against the company,
      and that “more will follow,” including classifying the company as a “complicit
      entity.” The Khozandar company has been operating in Gaza for years. Also known
      as “Three Brothers,” the company specialized in bringing goods into Gaza in coordination
      with Israel before the war, which led Hamas to classify the company as “collaborating
      with the occupation,” according to the security source. The source added that,
      during the war, the company’s activities expanded noticeably beyond trade, raising
      suspicions of collaboration with the Israeli army’s military plans. According
      to the Geneva Council for Rights and Liberties , Palestinian workers employed
      by Three Brothers have been “forced to work under conditions resembling modern
      slavery,” and have been forced to sort and load aid boxes under direct Israeli
      supervision and to “serve American mercenaries.” The workers were subject to degrading
      searches by Israeli soldiers, and were not paid any wages, only receiving a few
      cigarettes and a single daily meal as compensation, according to the Geneva Council,
      based on testimony it says it has verified. Al-Khozandar began implementing the
      U.S.-Israeli aid distribution scheme in Rafah after it contracted with Safe Reach
      Solution (SRS), a military contractor that is also the parent company of the GHF
      and has reportedly conducted military-intelligence operations in Gaza using Israeli
      data. According to a Financial Times investigation, the arrangement was for SRS
      to provide security at the GHF centers, while the Khozandar company would run
      distribution, specifically at the Tal Sultan center in Rafah. According to local
      reports, al-Khozandar’s role in the aid scheme is to engage local individuals
      and civil society organizations to cooperate with the GHF, while the FT investigation
      quoted a source that said Three Brothers would be “the first interface with the
      population” at the distribution sites, and that the Khozandar team “was well known
      to the Israeli security establishment and had a long history of working with them.”
      The FT reported that SRS had approached several other prominent businessmen in
      Gaza to staff the centers, but that they refused to participate in the U.S.-Israeli
      scheme, “arguing it amounted to forced displacement of people in the enclave.”
      Meanwhile, the al-Khozandar family in Gaza issued a statement in May disavowing
      the Mohsen Khozandar Company and condemning any activities carried out by Muhammad
      al-Khozandar and his brothers, who manage the firm. The statement was supported
      by the Contractors Union and business owners in Gaza, who described any cooperation
      with this scheme as a “betrayal of national unity” and demanded strict accountability
      for all those involved. Local testimonies also indicate that the company’s managers
      from the al-Khozandar family phoned several prominent influencers and content
      creators in Gaza, urging them to promote the company’s aid centers and claiming
      they were safe and free from inspections or any violations of people’s dignity.
      Yahya Hilles, a digital creator , told Mondoweiss that a person going by the name
      of Noor al-Khozandar contacted him and spoke with him for over an hour, trying
      to convince him to encourage people to go to the GHF centers. Hilles explained
      that he consulted his family elders, who firmly opposed any involvement in promoting
      this project. “Noor al-Khozandar kept insisting, urging me to go, film, and promote
      the centers, but I repeatedly asked him why he came to me specifically,” Hilles
      said. “He gave no clear answer. He knew that people trust me and believe what
      I share on social media, so he wants to drag me into this. He told me there would
      be no soldiers or Americans, and that I would just carry aid and return home.”
      “I knew that, even if things might go smoothly the first or second time, it might
      later turn into a disaster,” Hilles added. “In that case, I would be responsible
      before my people, so I categorically refused. I told him clearly: this issue is
      bigger than one person, with serious security and political implications. It cannot
      be handled through a simple call from one person to another.” Israeli army attempts
      to strong-arm international organizations Rahma Worldwide is among the most active
      humanitarian organizations in Gaza since the war began, although it has been operating
      in the territory since 2017. During the war, it became notably involved in facilitating
      the entry of medical delegations and volunteers to Gaza hospitals, where they
      provided services for a limited time before leaving the territory. The organization
      has an extensive history in humanitarian relief. Recently, however, the Israeli
      military attempted to coerce Rahma Worldwide into operating under the umbrella
      of the GHF. In late May, the organization’s director, Dr. Shadi Zaza, told Mondoweiss
      that Rahma Worldwide rejected the collaboration. Zaza stated that the organization
      operates in Gaza as part of a group that includes several humanitarian institutions,
      including some affiliated with the UN. He said that the Israeli army had informed
      them of the addition of a new institution — the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation —
      to this group, and later announced changes to the aid distribution plan, including
      designating new distribution points where each organization would be required
      to send its staff. “We are always on standby,” Zaza said. “We’re ready anytime
      we’re permitted to bring in aid. Our goods are prepared and waiting at the crossings.”
      He noted that Rahma Worldwide had received permission the previous month to deliver
      four trucks carrying 4,000 food parcels, only to be surprised by an Israeli army
      order to transfer the aid to distribution points managed by the GHF, along with
      a demand that Rahma staff help with distribution there. “We categorically refused
      this request,” Zaza stated. “Our agreement with the army was clear — we would
      distribute our parcels at locations designated for our organization, not those
      belonging to any other.” Despite Rahma Worldwide’s request that the parcels be
      redirected to their own sites, the army insisted on sending them to the GHF-run
      facilities. The army also declared that GHF was now the sole authority responsible
      for aid distribution in Gaza. Accordingly, the 4,000 parcels were transferred
      to Rafah, and the army contacted Rahma’s team, urging them to assist with distribution.
      But the team reached out to the organization’s U.S. headquarters, which unequivocally
      rejected involvement with Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. “We will not be part of
      this mechanism. We reject it entirely,” said Al-Zaza, highlighting that the army
      continues to pressure aid groups, especially those importing goods from Egypt,
      Jordan, or even the West Bank, insisting that all items be sourced from within
      Israel. As a final request, Rahma Worldwide asked for its logos to be removed
      from the food boxes that were to be distributed at the GHF’s sites to avoid appearing
      as a participant or collaborator in the distribution scheme. This reflects the
      organization’s firm opposition to the scheme, Zaza said. According to the organization,
      some of the logos were removed, but boxes bearing the Rahma logo were nonetheless
      distributed at locations affiliated with the GHF at least on one occasion, which
      the organization said was beyond its control. Rahma identified these Israeli efforts
      early on as attempts to forcibly integrate it into the GHF’s network. Upon the
      organization’s refusal, the army imposed even more stringent conditions for aid
      entry. “We have over 20,000 food parcels ready in our warehouses,” Zaza added.
      “But we refuse to deliver them through the American organization’s mechanism.
      That organization was originally just one of many working here—we had no issue
      with that. But now that it’s trying to monopolize aid and impose its control,
      that is completely unacceptable.” This stance of refusal reflects a broader trend
      among humanitarian organizations in Gaza, many of which oppose the GHF for its
      role in facilitating Israeli military objectives. Continued pressure for these
      organizations to work with the GHF or leave, some warn, could lead to the withdrawal
      of many aid organizations from Gaza entirely, creating a severe gap in humanitarian
      assistance. “If Israel continues imposing this style of control and management,
      we simply won’t bring in aid,” Zaza said. “Other organizations may follow our
      lead. This policy — though unofficial — may well be Israel’s way of clearing the
      field of independent organizations and turning humanitarian work into a fully
      controlled instrument.” Some international humanitarian organizations have begun
      cutting ties with the Boston Consulting Group, the company that helped conceive
      and launch the GHF and had even modelled the costs of “relocating” Palestinians
      outside of Gaza. Save the Children recently ended a two-decade partnership with
      the BCG over its role in the GHF, calling the aid organization’s plan to forcibly
      displace Gaza’s population “utterly unacceptable.” BCG’s chief executive admitted
      that its involvement in the GHF was “reputationally damaging” and the result of
      “deliberate individual misconduct” and “missed warning signs.” The GHF has continued
      to push organizations to work with it as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues
      to worsen. On July 6, the GHF announced that it had met with the Country Director
      of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) to propose a plan to help it “feed the
      north of Gaza.” “Right now, nearly all their trucks are being looted,” the GHF
      said. “We hope they will put politics aside and accept our proposal soon so we
      can achieve our shared mission: getting more aid to the people of Gaza.” The GHF
      was responding to a WFP statement that the need for food in Gaza was desperate.
      “WFP stand ready to assist the entire population,” the WFP said. “We have the
      food, the capacity and the systems.” The WFP could not be reached for comment.
      In an abrupt development on Monday, July 7, the GHF announced the closure of its
      center in central Gaza near the Netzarim Corridor until further notice. This was
      followed by another announcement Wednesday, July 9, declaring the closure of its
      distribution point in Khan Younis. At present, only the GHF’s distribution center
      in Rafah remains operational. These announcements come amid ongoing ceasefire
      negotiations between Israel and Hamas. One of Hamas’s conditions for the prospective
      60-day ceasefire period is that aid distributions be handled exclusively by the
      United Nations and its agencies operating in Gaza, completely excluding the GHF.
      This condition was reportedly accepted in the ceasefire talks. This has led local
      reporters to speculate that the closure of the GHF’s distribution centers indicates
      that agreement regarding the ceasefire’s terms are near, with the GHF complying
      with Hamas’s demand by halting its operations in the Strip. Local sources say
      it is expected that the Rafah distribution center may also be closed in the coming
      days, signaling that the ceasefire might soon go into effect. Muhammad Eslayeh

      in Israel's strategy to concentrate Gaza's population in camps for forced displacement,

      that the GHF is pressuring both local and international humanitarian organizations
      to cooperate with its operations and has enlisted local companies with ties to
      the Israeli army to manage aid distribution. Additionally, the Israeli military
      is reportedly coercing humanitarian groups to either work under the GHF framework
      or cease their operations entirely, further consolidating control over aid in
      Gaza.

      al-Khozandar and his brothers, who manage the firm. The statement was supported
      by the Contractors Union and business owners in Gaza, who described any cooperation
      with this scheme as a “betrayal of national unity” and demanded strict accountability
      for all those involved. Local testimonies also indicate that the company’s managers
      from the al-Khozandar family phoned several prominent influencers and content
      creators in Gaza, urging them to promote the company’s aid centers and claiming
      they were safe and free from inspections or any violations of people’s dignity.
      Yahya Hilles, a digital creator , told Mondoweiss that a person going by the name
      of Noor al-Khozandar contacted him and spoke with him for over an hour, trying
      to convince him to encourage people to go to the GHF centers. Hilles explained
      that he consulted his family elders, who firmly opposed any involvement in promoting
      this project. “Noor al-Khozandar kept insisting, urging me to go, film, and promote
      the centers, but I repeatedly asked him why he came to me specifically,” Hilles
      said. “He gave no clear answer. He knew that people trust me and believe what
      I share on social media, so he wants to drag me into this. He told me there would
      be no soldiers or Americans, and that I would just carry aid and return home.”
      “I knew that, even if things might go smoothly the first or second time, it might
      later turn into a disaster,” Hilles added. “In that case, I would be responsible
      before my people, so I categorically refused. I told him clearly: this issue is
      bigger than one person, with serious security and political implications. It cannot
      be handled through a simple call from one person to another.” Israeli army attempts
      to strong-arm international organizations Rahma Worldwide is among the most active
      humanitarian organizations in Gaza since the war began, although it has been operating
      in the territory since 2017. During the war, it became notably involved in facilitating
      the entry of medical delegations and volunteers to Gaza hospitals, where they
      provided services for a limited time before leaving the territory. The organization
      has an extensive history in humanitarian relief. Recently, however, the Israeli
      military attempted to coerce Rahma Worldwide into operating under the umbrella
      of the GHF. In late May, the organization’s director, Dr. Shadi Zaza, told Mondoweiss
      that Rahma Worldwide rejected the collaboration. Zaza stated that the organization
      operates in Gaza as part of a group that includes several humanitarian institutions,
      including some affiliated with the UN. He said that the Israeli army had informed
      them of the addition of a new institution — the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation —
      to this group, and later announced changes to the aid distribution plan, including
      designating new distribution points where each organization would be required
      to send its staff. “We are always on standby,” Zaza said. “We’re ready anytime
      we’re permitted to bring in aid. Our goods are prepared and waiting at the crossings.”
      He noted that Rahma Worldwide had received permission the previous month to deliver
      four trucks carrying 4,000 food parcels, only to be surprised by an Israeli army
      order to transfer the aid to distribution points managed by the GHF, along with
      a demand that Rahma staff help with distribution there. “We categorically refused
      this request,” Zaza stated. “Our agreement with the army was clear — we would
      distribute our parcels at locations designated for our organization, not those
      belonging to any other.” Despite Rahma Worldwide’s request that the parcels be
      redirected to their own sites, the army insisted on sending them to the GHF-run
      facilities. The army also declared that GHF was now the sole authority responsible
      for aid distribution in Gaza. Accordingly, the 4,000 parcels were transferred
      to Rafah, and the army contacted Rahma’s team, urging them to assist with distribution.
      But the team reached out to the organization’s U.S. headquarters, which unequivocally
      rejected involvement with Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. “We will not be part of
      this mechanism. We reject it entirely,” said Al-Zaza, highlighting that the army
      continues to pressure aid groups, especially those importing goods from Egypt,
      Jordan, or even the West Bank, insisting that all items be sourced from within
      Israel. As a final request, Rahma Worldwide asked for its logos to be removed
      from the food boxes that were to be distributed at the GHF’s sites to avoid appearing
      as a participant or collaborator in the distribution scheme. This reflects the
      organization’s firm opposition to the scheme, Zaza said. According to the organization,
      some of the logos were removed, but boxes bearing the Rahma logo were nonetheless
      distributed at locations affiliated with the GHF at least on one occasion, which
      the organization said was beyond its control. Rahma identified these Israeli efforts
      early on as attempts to forcibly integrate it into the GHF’s network. Upon the
      organization’s refusal, the army imposed even more stringent conditions for aid
      entry. “We have over 20,000 food parcels ready in our warehouses,” Zaza added.
      “But we refuse to deliver them through the American organization’s mechanism.
      That organization was originally just one of many working here—we had no issue
      with that. But now that it’s trying to monopolize aid and impose its control,
      that is completely unacceptable.” This stance of refusal reflects a broader trend
      among humanitarian organizations in Gaza, many of which oppose the GHF for its
      role in facilitating Israeli military objectives. Continued pressure for these
      organizations to work with the GHF or leave, some warn, could lead to the withdrawal
      of many aid organizations from Gaza entirely, creating a severe gap in humanitarian
      assistance. “If Israel continues imposing this style of control and management,
      we simply won’t bring in aid,” Zaza said. “Other organizations may follow our
      lead. This policy — though unofficial — may well be Israel’s way of clearing the
      field of independent organizations and turning humanitarian work into a fully
      controlled instrument.” Some international humanitarian organizations have begun
      cutting ties with the Boston Consulting Group, the company that helped conceive
      and launch the GHF and had even modelled the costs of “relocating” Palestinians
      outside of Gaza. Save the Children recently ended a two-decade partnership with
      the BCG over its role in the GHF, calling the aid organization’s plan to forcibly
      displace Gaza’s population “utterly unacceptable.” BCG’s chief executive admitted
      that its involvement in the GHF was “reputationally damaging” and the result of
      “deliberate individual misconduct” and “missed warning signs.” The GHF has continued
      to push organizations to work with it as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues
      to worsen. On July 6, the GHF announced that it had met with the Country Director
      of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) to propose a plan to help it “feed the
      north of Gaza.” “Right now, nearly all their trucks are being looted,” the GHF
      said. “We hope they will put politics aside and accept our proposal soon so we
      can achieve our shared mission: getting more aid to the people of Gaza.” The GHF
      was responding to a WFP statement that the need for food in Gaza was desperate.
      “WFP stand ready to assist the entire population,” the WFP said. “We have the
      food, the capacity and the systems.” The WFP could not be reached for comment.
      In an abrupt development on Monday, July 7, the GHF announced the closure of its
      center in central Gaza near the Netzarim Corridor until further notice. This was
      followed by another announcement Wednesday, July 9, declaring the closure of its
      distribution point in Khan Younis. At present, only the GHF’s distribution center
      in Rafah remains operational. These announcements come amid ongoing ceasefire
      negotiations between Israel and Hamas. One of Hamas’s conditions for the prospective
      60-day ceasefire period is that aid distributions be handled exclusively by the
      United Nations and its agencies operating in Gaza, completely excluding the GHF.
      This condition was reportedly accepted in the ceasefire talks. This has led local
      reporters to speculate that the closure of the GHF’s distribution centers indicates
      that agreement regarding the ceasefire’s terms are near, with the GHF complying
      with Hamas’s demand by halting its operations in the Strip. Local sources say
      it is expected that the Rafah distribution center may also be closed in the coming
      days, signaling that the ceasefire might soon go into effect. Muhammad Eslayeh

    paragraph_summary: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by Israel and
      the U.S., is facing significant backlash as it becomes increasingly implicated
      in Israel's strategy to concentrate Gaza's population in camps for forced displacement,
      aligning with military objectives to conquer the region. Reports indicate that
      the GHF has replaced the UN's aid distribution system with what locals describe
      as "death traps," leading to accusations of the organization masquerading as a
      humanitarian entity while serving Israeli military interests. Investigations reveal
      that the GHF is pressuring both local and international humanitarian organizations
      to cooperate with its operations and has enlisted local companies with ties to
      the Israeli army to manage aid distribution. Additionally, the Israeli military
      is reportedly coercing humanitarian groups to either work under the GHF framework
      or cease their operations entirely, further consolidating control over aid in
      Gaza.

      ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to
      pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Ben
      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report The Global South-led organization BRICS has
      been growing in size and influence, and this has frightened some Western politicians.
      Donald Trump is particularly rattled. After he returned to the White House for
      his second term as US president, Trump threatened very high tariffs on BRICS,
      and falsely said he had destroyed the organization. “BRICS is dead”, Trump claimed
      in a press conference on 13 February. The US president stated: BRICS was put there
      for a bad purpose, and most of those people don’t want — they don’t even want
      to talk about it now; they’re afraid to talk about it. Because I told them, if
      they want to play games with the dollar, then they’re going to be hit with a 100%
      tariff, the day they mention that they want to do it. And they will come back
      and say, “We beg you, we beg you not to do this”. BRICS is dead, since I mentioned
      that. BRICS died the minute I mentioned that. And I know, I remember when Obama
      and Biden in particular, I guess he said that, “Oh, they have us over a barrel”.
      They don’t have us over a barrel; we have them over a barrel. If BRICS wants to
      play games, those countries won’t trade with us; we won’t trade with them. And
      if any trading gets through, it’ll be a 100% tariff, at least. Trump’s claim that
      “BRICS is dead” could not be further from the truth. The exact opposite is happening:
      BRICS is continuously expanding. 2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro, Brazil In
      July, representatives of BRICS countries gathered in Brazil for an annual summit.
      This was the first meeting that featured the 10 partner countries that were added
      to BRICS in 2025, in addition to the new members that were admitted in 2024. BRICS
      now consists of 20 countries. The 10 BRICS members are the founding five — Brazil,
      Russia, India, China, and South Africa — plus Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran,
      and the United Arab Emirates. The 10 BRICS partners are Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba,
      Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The
      2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro was historic, because it included for the
      first time the participation of Vietnam , which had been admitted to the group
      in June. Geopolitical Economy Report previously detailed how the US government
      has tried to divide China and Vietnam , in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit
      Hanoi for Washington’s Cold War Two against Beijing. Vietnam’s decision to join
      BRICS was a clear sign that its foreign policy remains independent and non-aligned.
      Moreover, on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil, Reuters reported that
      Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China’s Premier Li Qiang held a friendly
      meeting, and “ agreed to boost trade and investment ties”. The 2025 BRICS summit
      also featured the participation of Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel. This was
      symbolic, given that Cuba has suffered under illegal US sanctions and a devastating
      blockade for more than 60 years, despite the fact that, every year the United
      Nations General Assembly, nearly every country on Earth votes to demand an end
      to the criminal US embargo. The vision that BRICS has for a more multipolar world,
      where the Global South is equal and the colonialist nations of the Global North
      no longer have an unfair “exorbitant privilege”, is very attractive to most countries
      on Earth. Even the United States’ top trading partner and southern neighbor, Mexico,
      participated in the BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro. Mexico’s progressive President
      Claudia Sheinbaum sent Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente to Brazil to
      participate, even though Mexico is not officially a member or partner of BRICS.
      The Mexican government announced that it had been invited to serve as an “observer”
      by Brazil, which holds the annual rotating BRICS presidency for 2025. Trump threatens
      more tariffs on BRICS countries The US president clearly was unsettled by the
      BRICS summit held in Brazil on 6 July, because on that day he took to his website
      Truth Social to threaten the organization. “Any Country aligning themselves with
      the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff”,
      Trump wrote. “There will be no exceptions to this policy”, he added. This 10%
      tariff threat was a significant reduction of the 100% duty that Trump had originally
      vowed to impose on BRICS countries. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva shot back
      at Trump’s threats, implying that the US president was trying to become a global
      “emperor”. “The world has changed. We don’t want an emperor”, Lula said . “This
      is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from
      the economic perspective”, Lula added. “I think that’s why the BRICS are making
      people uncomfortable”. Trump falsely claimed that Spain is part of BRICS Nevertheless,
      it should be underscored that Trump doesn’t really understand what BRICS is. In
      a White House press conference in January, Trump again threatened BRICS, and he
      falsely claimed that Spain is part of the Global South-led organization. The European
      nation is not involved, and never has been. Trump said: They’re a BRICS nation,
      Spain. You know what a BRICS nation is? You’ll figure it out. But — and if the
      BRICS nations want to do that, that’s okay, but we’re going to put at least a
      100% tariff on the business they do with the United States. You know what the
      BRICS is, right? You guys know, you know what I’m saying, you know what I’m saying.
      BRICS: 44% of global GDP (PPP), 56% of world population The US government’s fear
      of BRICS is rooted in the Global South-led organization’s increasing power. The
      20 BRICS members and partners already represent more than two-fifths of the global
      economy: 43.93% of world GDP , when measured at purchasing power parity (PPP).
      The BRICS 20 also have a combined population of 4.45 billion, meaning they represent
      55.61% of the global population — the majority of the world. BRICS discusses dedollarization
      One of the key issues discussed at the 2025 BRICS summit was dedollarization —
      the attempt to create alternatives to the US dollar as the global reserve currency.
      Brazil’s left-wing President Lula da Silva has long been an advocate of dedollarization
      . “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don’t have to pass through
      the dollar”, Lula said at the BRICS summit . “Obviously, we have to be responsible
      about doing that carefully. Our central banks have to discuss it with central
      banks from other countries”, the Brazilian leader explained, according to Reuters.
      He added, “That’s something that happens gradually until it’s consolidated”. Lula
      qualified that dedollarization is “complicated” and will be a slow, gradual process,
      but he maintained that it is necessary. At the 2025 BRICS summit, the Brazilian
      president even reiterated his call for the creation of a new global currency to
      challenge the US dollar. “That’s why your debate about the need for a new trade
      currency is so important . Is it complicated? I know. There are political challenges.
      But if we don’t find a new formula, we’ll end the 21st century the same way we
      started the 20th. And that won’t benefit humanity”, Lula said. BRICS initiatives
      to advance dedollarization At the summit on 6 July, 2025, the 20 BRICS members
      and partners signed a lengthy joint statement. The Rio de Janeiro Declaration
      was 31 pages long, and consisted of 126 points, encompassing a wide variety of
      subjects. The joint declaration made many references to BRICS initiatives to encourage
      dedollarization. It called to strengthen the BRICS bank, the New Development Bank
      (NDB), to “support its growing role as a robust and strategic agent of development
      and modernization in the Global South”. In particular, the document emphasized
      the need for the NDB to “expand local currency financing”. The BRICS declaration
      similarly urged further development of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA),
      which could serve as an alternative to the US-dominated International Monetary
      Fund (IMF), by providing short-term liquidity to countries facing balance-of-payments
      crises. Another initiative discussed in the document was the New Investment Platform
      (NIP), which seeks to facilitate investments in local currencies, instead of US
      dollars, British pounds, or euro. The declaration addressed the BRICS Interbank
      Cooperation Mechanism (ICM), which is working on “finding acceptable mechanisms
      of financing in local currencies”. The joint statement also highlighted the work
      of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative and BRICS Payment Task Force (BPTF),
      which it noted are identifying “the potential for greater interoperability of
      BRICS payment systems”, as part of “efforts to facilitate fast, low-cost, more
      accessible, efficient, transparent, and safe cross-border payments among BRICS
      countries and other nations and which can support greater trade and investment
      flows”. BRICS New Development Bank expands The current chief of the BRICS bank
      is Dilma Rousseff, the former president of Brazil, from Lula’s left-wing Workers’
      Party. She announced that two more countries had joined the New Development Bank:
      Colombia and Uzbekistan. Colombia’s accession was especially symbolic, given that
      the South American nation has historically been one of the closest allies of the
      United States. Under its first ever left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, Colombia
      has adopted a more non-aligned foreign policy, and has expressed support for BRICS.
      Just a few days before the BRICS summit, leaked audio recordings exposed the US
      government’s links to a coup attempt against Colombia’s democratically elected
      left-wing leader. With the addition of Colombia and Uzbekistan, the New Development
      Bank now has 11 members, including the founding five of Brazil, Russia, India,
      China, and South Africa, plus the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Egypt, and
      Algeria. BRICS promotes trade, investment, and lending in local currencies In
      her remarks at the BRICS summit, Dilma emphasized that the New Development Bank
      is promoting financing in local currencies. “Any business or government that borrows
      in foreign currency becomes subject to decisions made by the Federal Reserve or
      other central banks in developed nations”, she said, warning of exchange-rate
      risk and currency volatility. As a positive example of an alternative, the BRICS
      website noted that Dilma “pointed to a project in Brasil funded directly in renminbi,
      without the need for dollar conversion”. The official BRICS readout of Dilma’s
      speech emphasized that “local-currency operations will remain an absolute priority
      as a means of building a more diverse, balanced international financial system”.
      Dedollarization will be slow and steady, the NDB president stressed. The role
      of the US dollar as the global reserve currency will not end overnight, “But the
      rise of initiatives to expand trade in local currencies is undeniable, and I see
      that as a positive development”, Dilma explained. BRICS follows in footsteps of
      Non-Aligned Movement and Bandung Conference In speeches they delivered at the
      2025 summit, several Global South leaders emphasized that they see BRICS as following
      in the footsteps of the Non-Aligned Movement and the anti-colonial Bandung Conference
      of 1955. Brazil’s President Lula declared that “BRICS is an indispensable actor
      in the struggle for a multipolar, less asymmetrical, and more peaceful world”.
      He lamented that the US-dominated international financial system benefits the
      rich colonial countries at the expense of the poor, formerly colonized ones. Lula
      stated (emphasis added): The frameworks of the World Bank and the IMF currently
      support a “ reverse Marshall Plan ,” where emerging and developing economies essentially
      finance the more developed world. International aid flows have decreased, and
      debt costs for the poorest countries have soared. The neoliberal model only deepens
      inequalities. For instance, 3000 billionaires have collectively earned USD 6.5
      trillion since 2015. Tax justice and the fight against tax evasion are essential
      to truly consolidate inclusive and sustainable growth strategies fit for the 21st
      century. In another speech at the BRICS summit, the Brazilian president said the
      following (emphasis added): The United Nations recently marked its 80 th anniversary
      on June 26 of this year, and we are witnessing an unprecedented collapse of multilateralism.
      The advent of the UN marked the defeat of Nazi-Fascism and the birth of a sense
      of collective hope. The vast majority of countries that currently comprise the
      BRICS were among its founders. Ten years later, the Bandung Conference refuted
      the division of the world into zones of influence and advanced the fight for a
      multipolar international order. BRICS is an heir of the Non-Aligned Movement.
      With multilateralism under attack, our autonomy is once again in check. … International
      law has become a dead letter , as has the pacific resolution of controversies.
      We are before an unprecedented number of conflicts since World War II. NATO’s
      recent decision feeds the arms race. It is easier to designate 5% of the GDP to
      military spending than to allocate the 0.7% that has been promised for Official
      Development Assistance. Lula condemned the “genocidal practices by Israel in Gaza,
      the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians, and the use of starvation as
      a weapon of war”. The Brazilian government demanded an “end of the Israeli occupation
      and the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State”. Lula also “denounced
      the violations of Iran’s territorial integrity” by the United States and Israel.
      Lamenting the “loss of credibility and paralysis” in the UN Security Council,
      due to Washington’s abuse of its veto power, Brazil reiterated its call for “deep
      transformations in the Security Council”, with the inclusion of “new permanent
      members from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean”. Malaysia’s Prime
      Minister Anwar Ibrahim also delivered a powerful speech likening BRICS to the
      Non-Aligned Movement and Bandung Conference. Anwar stated (emphasis added): It
      is a historic moment for those of you who have been following the antecedents
      of history, who realize the attempt to save the voice of newly emerging economies
      and countries post colonialism was by Sukarno of Indonesia, Zhou Enlai of China,
      Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Kwame Nkrumah of Africa. It was a bold attempt to ensure
      that the voice of conscience, those struggling for freedom and justice is heard.
      Not much success. It was a bold attempt. Then we have a Non-aligned Movement ,
      proceeding that. Then we have G77 , still not achieving the desired results. Now,
      I salute you, President Lula, for having the courage to proceed with a clear vision,
      a clear commitment to voice the concerns, aspirations of the people, particularly
      of the Global South. … We have enormous potential to increase because only with
      that strength can we safely, fairly, justly negotiate with all other partners
      multilaterally. We must demand a change. Democratic, just international and multilateral
      organization from the United Nations to WTO to IMF in the World Bank … We have
      attempted in ASEAN other than enhancing international trade is even using financial
      settlement systems. We use our local currency. Of course, we’re not talking about
      de-dollarization because there’s a long way to go, but at least we try, Malaysia
      with Indonesia, Malaysia with Thailand, and together with China, trying to use
      our own local currency, even beginning with 10 or 20%, it makes a difference,
      because we cannot continue complaining but not executing our own plan among in
      our countries and our friendly neighbors. … But I come back to the major and central
      issue: BRICS today of 2025 is not the first attempt. The Bandung Conference of
      1955 — at that time we were struggling, No industry, no new technology, no competence
      except for a united nation, the country, and political leadership. Now we have

      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report The Global South-led organization BRICS has
      been growing in size and influence, and this has frightened some Western politicians.
      Donald Trump is particularly rattled. After he returned to the White House for
      his second term as US president, Trump threatened very high tariffs on BRICS,
      and falsely said he had destroyed the organization. “BRICS is dead”, Trump claimed
      in a press conference on 13 February. The US president stated: BRICS was put there
      for a bad purpose, and most of those people don’t want — they don’t even want
      to talk about it now; they’re afraid to talk about it. Because I told them, if
      they want to play games with the dollar, then they’re going to be hit with a 100%
      tariff, the day they mention that they want to do it. And they will come back
      and say, “We beg you, we beg you not to do this”. BRICS is dead, since I mentioned
      that. BRICS died the minute I mentioned that. And I know, I remember when Obama
      and Biden in particular, I guess he said that, “Oh, they have us over a barrel”.
      They don’t have us over a barrel; we have them over a barrel. If BRICS wants to
      play games, those countries won’t trade with us; we won’t trade with them. And
      if any trading gets through, it’ll be a 100% tariff, at least. Trump’s claim that
      “BRICS is dead” could not be further from the truth. The exact opposite is happening:
      BRICS is continuously expanding. 2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro, Brazil In
      July, representatives of BRICS countries gathered in Brazil for an annual summit.
      This was the first meeting that featured the 10 partner countries that were added
      to BRICS in 2025, in addition to the new members that were admitted in 2024. BRICS
      now consists of 20 countries. The 10 BRICS members are the founding five — Brazil,
      Russia, India, China, and South Africa — plus Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran,
      and the United Arab Emirates. The 10 BRICS partners are Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba,
      Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The
      2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro was historic, because it included for the
      first time the participation of Vietnam , which had been admitted to the group
      in June. Geopolitical Economy Report previously detailed how the US government
      has tried to divide China and Vietnam , in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit
      Hanoi for Washington’s Cold War Two against Beijing. Vietnam’s decision to join
      BRICS was a clear sign that its foreign policy remains independent and non-aligned.
      Moreover, on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil, Reuters reported that
      Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China’s Premier Li Qiang held a friendly
      meeting, and “ agreed to boost trade and investment ties”. The 2025 BRICS summit
      also featured the participation of Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel. This was
      symbolic, given that Cuba has suffered under illegal US sanctions and a devastating
      blockade for more than 60 years, despite the fact that, every year the United
      Nations General Assembly, nearly every country on Earth votes to demand an end
      to the criminal US embargo. The vision that BRICS has for a more multipolar world,
      where the Global South is equal and the colonialist nations of the Global North
      no longer have an unfair “exorbitant privilege”, is very attractive to most countries
      on Earth. Even the United States’ top trading partner and southern neighbor, Mexico,
      participated in the BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro. Mexico’s progressive President
      Claudia Sheinbaum sent Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente to Brazil to
      participate, even though Mexico is not officially a member or partner of BRICS.
      The Mexican government announced that it had been invited to serve as an “observer”
      by Brazil, which holds the annual rotating BRICS presidency for 2025. Trump threatens
      more tariffs on BRICS countries The US president clearly was unsettled by the
      BRICS summit held in Brazil on 6 July, because on that day he took to his website
      Truth Social to threaten the organization. “Any Country aligning themselves with
      the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff”,
      Trump wrote. “There will be no exceptions to this policy”, he added. This 10%
      tariff threat was a significant reduction of the 100% duty that Trump had originally
      vowed to impose on BRICS countries. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva shot back
      at Trump’s threats, implying that the US president was trying to become a global
      “emperor”. “The world has changed. We don’t want an emperor”, Lula said . “This
      is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from
      the economic perspective”, Lula added. “I think that’s why the BRICS are making
      people uncomfortable”. Trump falsely claimed that Spain is part of BRICS Nevertheless,
      it should be underscored that Trump doesn’t really understand what BRICS is. In
      a White House press conference in January, Trump again threatened BRICS, and he
      falsely claimed that Spain is part of the Global South-led organization. The European
      nation is not involved, and never has been. Trump said: They’re a BRICS nation,
      Spain. You know what a BRICS nation is? You’ll figure it out. But — and if the
      BRICS nations want to do that, that’s okay, but we’re going to put at least a
      100% tariff on the business they do with the United States. You know what the
      BRICS is, right? You guys know, you know what I’m saying, you know what I’m saying.
      BRICS: 44% of global GDP (PPP), 56% of world population The US government’s fear
      of BRICS is rooted in the Global South-led organization’s increasing power. The
      20 BRICS members and partners already represent more than two-fifths of the global
      economy: 43.93% of world GDP , when measured at purchasing power parity (PPP).
      The BRICS 20 also have a combined population of 4.45 billion, meaning they represent
      55.61% of the global population — the majority of the world. BRICS discusses dedollarization
      One of the key issues discussed at the 2025 BRICS summit was dedollarization —
      the attempt to create alternatives to the US dollar as the global reserve currency.
      Brazil’s left-wing President Lula da Silva has long been an advocate of dedollarization
      . “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don’t have to pass through
      the dollar”, Lula said at the BRICS summit . “Obviously, we have to be responsible
      about doing that carefully. Our central banks have to discuss it with central
      banks from other countries”, the Brazilian leader explained, according to Reuters.
      He added, “That’s something that happens gradually until it’s consolidated”. Lula
      qualified that dedollarization is “complicated” and will be a slow, gradual process,
      but he maintained that it is necessary. At the 2025 BRICS summit, the Brazilian
      president even reiterated his call for the creation of a new global currency to
      challenge the US dollar. “That’s why your debate about the need for a new trade
      currency is so important . Is it complicated? I know. There are political challenges.
      But if we don’t find a new formula, we’ll end the 21st century the same way we
      started the 20th. And that won’t benefit humanity”, Lula said. BRICS initiatives
      to advance dedollarization At the summit on 6 July, 2025, the 20 BRICS members
      and partners signed a lengthy joint statement. The Rio de Janeiro Declaration
      was 31 pages long, and consisted of 126 points, encompassing a wide variety of
      subjects. The joint declaration made many references to BRICS initiatives to encourage
      dedollarization. It called to strengthen the BRICS bank, the New Development Bank
      (NDB), to “support its growing role as a robust and strategic agent of development
      and modernization in the Global South”. In particular, the document emphasized
      the need for the NDB to “expand local currency financing”. The BRICS declaration
      similarly urged further development of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA),
      which could serve as an alternative to the US-dominated International Monetary
      Fund (IMF), by providing short-term liquidity to countries facing balance-of-payments
      crises. Another initiative discussed in the document was the New Investment Platform
      (NIP), which seeks to facilitate investments in local currencies, instead of US
      dollars, British pounds, or euro. The declaration addressed the BRICS Interbank
      Cooperation Mechanism (ICM), which is working on “finding acceptable mechanisms
      of financing in local currencies”. The joint statement also highlighted the work
      of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative and BRICS Payment Task Force (BPTF),
      which it noted are identifying “the potential for greater interoperability of
      BRICS payment systems”, as part of “efforts to facilitate fast, low-cost, more
      accessible, efficient, transparent, and safe cross-border payments among BRICS
      countries and other nations and which can support greater trade and investment
      flows”. BRICS New Development Bank expands The current chief of the BRICS bank
      is Dilma Rousseff, the former president of Brazil, from Lula’s left-wing Workers’
      Party. She announced that two more countries had joined the New Development Bank:
      Colombia and Uzbekistan. Colombia’s accession was especially symbolic, given that
      the South American nation has historically been one of the closest allies of the
      United States. Under its first ever left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, Colombia
      has adopted a more non-aligned foreign policy, and has expressed support for BRICS.
      Just a few days before the BRICS summit, leaked audio recordings exposed the US
      government’s links to a coup attempt against Colombia’s democratically elected
      left-wing leader. With the addition of Colombia and Uzbekistan, the New Development
      Bank now has 11 members, including the founding five of Brazil, Russia, India,
      China, and South Africa, plus the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Egypt, and
      Algeria. BRICS promotes trade, investment, and lending in local currencies In
      her remarks at the BRICS summit, Dilma emphasized that the New Development Bank
      is promoting financing in local currencies. “Any business or government that borrows
      in foreign currency becomes subject to decisions made by the Federal Reserve or
      other central banks in developed nations”, she said, warning of exchange-rate
      risk and currency volatility. As a positive example of an alternative, the BRICS
      website noted that Dilma “pointed to a project in Brasil funded directly in renminbi,
      without the need for dollar conversion”. The official BRICS readout of Dilma’s
      speech emphasized that “local-currency operations will remain an absolute priority
      as a means of building a more diverse, balanced international financial system”.
      Dedollarization will be slow and steady, the NDB president stressed. The role
      of the US dollar as the global reserve currency will not end overnight, “But the
      rise of initiatives to expand trade in local currencies is undeniable, and I see
      that as a positive development”, Dilma explained. BRICS follows in footsteps of
      Non-Aligned Movement and Bandung Conference In speeches they delivered at the
      2025 summit, several Global South leaders emphasized that they see BRICS as following
      in the footsteps of the Non-Aligned Movement and the anti-colonial Bandung Conference
      of 1955. Brazil’s President Lula declared that “BRICS is an indispensable actor
      in the struggle for a multipolar, less asymmetrical, and more peaceful world”.
      He lamented that the US-dominated international financial system benefits the
      rich colonial countries at the expense of the poor, formerly colonized ones. Lula
      stated (emphasis added): The frameworks of the World Bank and the IMF currently
      support a “ reverse Marshall Plan ,” where emerging and developing economies essentially
      finance the more developed world. International aid flows have decreased, and
      debt costs for the poorest countries have soared. The neoliberal model only deepens
      inequalities. For instance, 3000 billionaires have collectively earned USD 6.5
      trillion since 2015. Tax justice and the fight against tax evasion are essential
      to truly consolidate inclusive and sustainable growth strategies fit for the 21st
      century. In another speech at the BRICS summit, the Brazilian president said the
      following (emphasis added): The United Nations recently marked its 80 th anniversary
      on June 26 of this year, and we are witnessing an unprecedented collapse of multilateralism.
      The advent of the UN marked the defeat of Nazi-Fascism and the birth of a sense
      of collective hope. The vast majority of countries that currently comprise the
      BRICS were among its founders. Ten years later, the Bandung Conference refuted
      the division of the world into zones of influence and advanced the fight for a
      multipolar international order. BRICS is an heir of the Non-Aligned Movement.
      With multilateralism under attack, our autonomy is once again in check. … International
      law has become a dead letter , as has the pacific resolution of controversies.
      We are before an unprecedented number of conflicts since World War II. NATO’s
      recent decision feeds the arms race. It is easier to designate 5% of the GDP to
      military spending than to allocate the 0.7% that has been promised for Official
      Development Assistance. Lula condemned the “genocidal practices by Israel in Gaza,
      the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians, and the use of starvation as
      a weapon of war”. The Brazilian government demanded an “end of the Israeli occupation
      and the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State”. Lula also “denounced
      the violations of Iran’s territorial integrity” by the United States and Israel.
      Lamenting the “loss of credibility and paralysis” in the UN Security Council,
      due to Washington’s abuse of its veto power, Brazil reiterated its call for “deep
      transformations in the Security Council”, with the inclusion of “new permanent
      members from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean”. Malaysia’s Prime
      Minister Anwar Ibrahim also delivered a powerful speech likening BRICS to the
      Non-Aligned Movement and Bandung Conference. Anwar stated (emphasis added): It
      is a historic moment for those of you who have been following the antecedents
      of history, who realize the attempt to save the voice of newly emerging economies
      and countries post colonialism was by Sukarno of Indonesia, Zhou Enlai of China,
      Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Kwame Nkrumah of Africa. It was a bold attempt to ensure
      that the voice of conscience, those struggling for freedom and justice is heard.
      Not much success. It was a bold attempt. Then we have a Non-aligned Movement ,
      proceeding that. Then we have G77 , still not achieving the desired results. Now,
      I salute you, President Lula, for having the courage to proceed with a clear vision,
      a clear commitment to voice the concerns, aspirations of the people, particularly
      of the Global South. … We have enormous potential to increase because only with
      that strength can we safely, fairly, justly negotiate with all other partners
      multilaterally. We must demand a change. Democratic, just international and multilateral
      organization from the United Nations to WTO to IMF in the World Bank … We have
      attempted in ASEAN other than enhancing international trade is even using financial
      settlement systems. We use our local currency. Of course, we’re not talking about
      de-dollarization because there’s a long way to go, but at least we try, Malaysia
      with Indonesia, Malaysia with Thailand, and together with China, trying to use
      our own local currency, even beginning with 10 or 20%, it makes a difference,
      because we cannot continue complaining but not executing our own plan among in
      our countries and our friendly neighbors. … But I come back to the major and central
      issue: BRICS today of 2025 is not the first attempt. The Bandung Conference of
      1955 — at that time we were struggling, No industry, no new technology, no competence
      except for a united nation, the country, and political leadership. Now we have
      political leadership with that vision and we have strong business community. Editor’s

    text: 'By Chris Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report This interview is also available
      on podcast platforms and Rumble . Following attacks on Iran by Israel and the
      United States, the world held its breath as the prospect of World War III loomed
      on the horizon. After 12 days of conflict, a ceasefire has brought about new uncertainty
      for the future. Former British diplomat Alastair Crooke joins host Chris Hedges
      on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to make sense of the current situation
      in the Middle East and what can be expected in the coming weeks or months. Crooke
      details the lead up to the Israeli attacks, including the use of technology and
      neighbouring countries that allowed for the element of surprise. Cyber attacks,
      drones flown in from Azerbaijan and American military software served as crucial
      elements for the Israeli attacks on Iran. As for the American strikes weeks later,
      Crooke explains Donald Trump’s alleged anxiety in not engaging in a prolonged
      conflict and theorizes about what the damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities actually
      looks like and what it could mean going forward. Hedges and Crooke lay out what
      could come next, indicating that this conflict is far from over and the future
      of the Middle East, along with the rest of the world’s economy, hinges on what
      comes next from Israel, Iran or the United States. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS

      Max Jones Intro: Diego Ramos Crew: Diego Ramos, Sofia Menemenlis and Thomas Hedges
      Transcript: Diego Ramos Transcript Chris Hedges The 12-day conflict between Israel,
      the United States and Iran is not over. It is the first phase of what could become
      an endless war, much like Israel’s decades-long sporadic war against Lebanon.
      The attacks on Iran, as with the invasion and occupation of Iraq, was based on
      a lie. Neither U.S. intelligence nor the U.N. concurred with Netanyahu and Trump’s
      claim that Iran was weaponizing its enriched uranium. Israel was able to inflict
      significant damage on Iran, including what it says were the targeted assassinations
      of 30 senior security officials and 11 senior nuclear scientists. But Israel and
      the United States do not appear to have, as Donald Trump insisted, obliterated
      Iran’s nuclear weapons program. At best, it probably set back any enrichment program
      by only a few weeks or months should Iran decide to build a bomb. Iran’s surface-to-surface
      missiles probably caused more damage and casualties than Israel expected, but
      because the Israeli Air Force had virtual control over the skies of Iran it was
      able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficacy. By shredding the
      nuclear agreement with Iran in Trump’s first administration, which the Iranians
      were abiding by, and then allowing Israel to carry out an attack while negotiations
      were ongoing with Iran, the United States and Israel have effectively shut the
      door on any diplomatic resolution to the conflict. The failure of European governments
      to condemn the bombing, a flagrant violation of Iran’s sovereignty, has only widened
      the divide between Iran and the West. Rather than weaken the Iranian regime, these
      attacks have enraged Iranians, especially young Iranians, who poured into the
      streets in the millions for the funerals of the victims of Israel’s attacks. It
      has hardened the resolve of the Iranians rulers who have suspended cooperation
      with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and rejected calls by the Trump
      administration to resume negotiations. Joining me to discuss the fallout from
      this 12-day war and what comes next is Alastair Crooke, a former British diplomat
      who served for many years in the Middle East working as a security advisor to
      the EU special envoy to the Middle East, as well as helping lead efforts to set
      up negotiations and truces between Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian
      resistant groups with Israel. He is also the author of Resistance: The Essence
      of the Islamist Revolution , which analyzes the ascendancy of Islamic movements
      in the Middle East. You can find his work at ConflictsForum.Substack.com . Let’s
      begin with a question that has puzzled me since these attacks began, and that
      is why it was so easy for Israel to take out Iran’s air defenses, which were a
      mixture of Iranian-produced air defenses, of course, but also Russian air defenses.
      Alastair Crooke Well, there’s a certain deception about what happened there. I
      know that it is advertised by Israel and by many in the United States that there
      was open skies and that Israel could actually come across and destroy the air
      defenses. That actually is not true. In fact, if you look, you’ll find there is
      not a single video. Many people were taking shots from their smartphones and things,
      not a single video of an Israeli aircraft over Tehran or Iran as a whole. What
      happened? It’s really very interesting because it has a very important impact.
      What happened was that well before the 13th of June surprise attack that Israel
      mounted on Iran, Israel Mossad and its special forces were pre-positioning anti-tank
      weapons from Kurdistan area, from Erbil and the Kurdistan area of Iraq across
      the border into Iran. Quite close, as close as they could get to the air defense
      systems that were present. And then special forces, Israelis have admitted they
      had special forces in Iran at that time, and the special forces then were coming
      and using ballistic missiles guided by American software, the Battlescape software
      system onto the targets that they wanted. Now, there were no aircraft crossing
      into Iranian airspace except that some aircraft from Israel flew right along the
      north of Iran, which is very mountainous and really deserted, into Azerbaijan,
      the airspace. And from Azerbaijan, Israel launched drones, attack drones. They
      didn’t have such a big warhead. But they also then flew down the Caspian till
      they were opposite Tehran. And from there, the Israeli planes fired these latest
      ballistic cruise missiles. Those are the ones that hit Tehran and made a big impact
      on it. So it was a very complicated setup that had taken months, if not years
      for Mossad to put all of those into position to infiltrate people, pre-position
      them. What took out the Iranian air defences in the first day was actually a cyber
      attack, a really major cyber attack on their air defences, and they managed to
      undo that and to correct it with eight hours after which their air defences were
      working again and you can see there’s evidence, we can see quite clear evidence
      of that happening. Why was Iran in such a vulnerable position? Well, that’s quite
      interesting too, because actually on that day, the 13th of June, scheduled, long
      scheduled, and with the Iranians expecting to go to talks on the Sunday with [United
      States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve] Witkoff in Oman and the Americans
      to talk about the nuclear program, the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]
      had a big program, a big exercise prepared with naval and other forces engaged
      with us and some of the missile launches were actually exposed and put out because
      of this big exercise. I think it involved the Chinese too as well. So they were
      all in this headquarters in a single room in the headquarters when Israel decapitated
      the line commanders of the IRGC and the military staff who were all preparing
      for this big exercise. They were taken by surprise and the decapitation happened.
      What happened with the civilian scientists, they were killed by spike missiles
      fired directly and small ballistic missiles fired by probably the special forces,
      I’m not quite sure, into their homes. Precise strikes into the homes killing them
      and their families too. I think it’s 10 or 11 scientists were killed. So that
      was really what happened. Now, the most important, there are two important things
      that flow from this. The first is this setup is not repeatable. You can’t, I mean,
      it was a very sophisticated, long-prepared positioning people in the site, both
      from the north, from Azerbaijan, and across the border from Kurdistan, the MEK
      [People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran] coming across Kurdistan, setting all
      these up. The cyber attack was set up and prepared and everything was ready for
      this. But now it’s exposed. You can’t go back to it. And also that now, I mean,
      the Iranian air defenses are fully operational. They’re getting more air defenses
      from the Chinese. So it won’t be the same. You can’t just repeat that operation.
      And the talk about open skies was very deceptive. It was really a lie. It wasn’t
      open skies. It was actually something rather different that happened. So that’s
      very important that it’s not something that can be repeated. Israel can’t do this
      next week or the week after. It would take months if possible. But in the meantime,
      Iran is, of course, operating around Erbil and Kurdistan. You’ve probably seen
      there have been many explosions and attacks there. In the north, removing Baluchis
      and refugees from across the border from that area. And there is a tough conversation
      taking place between Russia and [Ilham] Aliyev, the head of the Azeri state and
      also from Iran. So there is a great deal of tension there from Azerbaijan and
      Russia about different things. But it used to have good relations, but now it’s
      very tense indeed there. The Russians suspect that not only those tactics of infiltration,
      of saboteurs were done, if you like, during that attack on Russia’s strategic
      bomber force out of Kazakhstan, but they think that some of them were done by
      part of the illegal and criminal gangs who are Azeris as well as Russian citizens.
      And behind this, Russia sees the hand of Turkey and NATO for both the attack in
      Iran and also the attack that took place, I think it was called the Spider’s Web
      attack [Operation Spiderweb] on those strategic bombers that were out in the open
      on, again, the day before peace talks were taking place. Chris Hedges Let’s talk
      about the American strike. Correct me if I’m wrong, it was my understanding that
      the Israelis did take out air defenses to open a corridor for American bombers,
      but maybe that’s incorrect. And secondly, let’s talk about the, what is it, 408
      kilograms of enriched uranium. I think they’re supposedly at 60%. But let’s talk
      about the American strike. Alastair Crooke Well, the Americans warned these Iranians
      beforehand, either I think probably through the Swiss embassy in Tehran or through,
      perhaps equally likely through Oman, warned them in advance and also told them
      it was once and done, i.e. would be one strike, finish, end of the process. So
      they passed that information to the Iranians and I believe, I can’t budge for
      it perfectly, but my understanding is that the Russians said to them, look, just
      let it happen. It’s much better, just let it happen. You probably won’t, it won’t
      be as damaging as it may be advertised, just let it happen. And it’s true because
      in that time it’s fairly clear. There was no evidence you can see of any great,
      if you like, air defences being used or mounted or explosions. Iranians tell me,
      I was in Iran just before this happened, the Iranians tell me it was very quiet
      that night, there was nothing happening. So they just came in, they did what they
      wanted to do and then they left. What success they had, well, nobody can really
      say. At this stage, anyone who tells you or says they know, I don’t think is telling
      the truth because the only way you know… there are about five entrances to Fordow,
      five different entrances. Two of them were blocked up with soil by the Iranians
      before the strike, two days before. And the whole basis of this depends on a very
      controversial piece of, if you like, mechanics. Most of those entrances to the
      Fordow base have got blast bends in them. In other words, if there’s an explosion,
      it can’t go any further. It can’t reach the centrifuge hole. Centrifuge hole,
      don’t forget, is at 800 meters depth in this mountain. And then there is a vent.
      And this is a source of controversy in America as anywhere else is according to
      the Americans and who brief Trump, the vent had no, if you like, bend in it. It
      was vertical, straight from the surface down to the centrifuge hole. And many
      experts, professors from MIT and others, are very adamant and saying it’s unbelievable
      that the Iranians would have put blast vents in all of the entrances but have
      forget to do it in the vent. Well, I don’t know the answer to that. You’ll have
      to go and ask the professor about that. But, yes, four days beforehand there were
      trucks at Fordow and the Iranians and I think there’s some reasonably reliable
      reporting that the highly enriched uranium was removed and probably deposited
      in this other site called the Pickaxe Mountain, which is also quite close to Qom
      and I would think it’s probably hidden there somewhere. It’s even deeper than
      Fordow by the way, but it’s never mentioned because it seems to be off the radar.
      Anyway, I think that is probably where it is, but until the Iranians clear one
      of these entrances, which they deliberately blocked up to stop pressure rising
      and go into the hall, we won’t know how much damage is done. But I think the Isfahan
      one also is very deep and it’s quite likely that centrifuges were not destroyed
      at Isfahan. Natanz is different. Natanz is very old. It’s there from the Shah’s
      time. It’s mostly on the surface. I remember passing it and you could, you know,
      it’s there and you see it. But they put the centrifuges down I think between 60
      and 80 meters. So I mean, maybe they’re badly damaged, who knows. But they don’t
      need many centrifuges. One of the things that this professor from MIT, Postol,
      Ted Postol says that, you know, once you get to a certain point in the enrichment
      process, then it becomes exponential. You just have to do a tiny bit more and
      that you’re up at 90%. So I mean, you know, they don’t need many centrifuges to
      have survived. Chris Hedges The pilots talked about seeing explosions, but what
      I heard, that was in fact not a good sign. Alastair Crooke Yes, that’s right.
      That is a sign that there was a blast bend on the vent. And so the blast was coming
      up. And that’s why it had a spectacular view of explosion, because it hadn’t gone
      down to the centrifuge floor. It had come up and was at the surface. So it isn’t
      necessarily a good indicator of that. So that was really the gist of it, that
      I think it was clear that Trump wanted it. And we know quite a lot about that
      day because someone, and I wrote about it, it extends to you and I’m sure you
      probably know Michael Wolff, who’s written four books on Trump, and he was talking
      and calling. He works by calling interlocutors that the Trump has just spoken
      to on the phone. And he says it’s a really reliable way of finding out what Trump
      is thinking because he says the same question to each interlocutor. And it’s not
      really a question. So on the 12th, it seemed that… on the 22nd rather, the day
      of the American strike, Trump was quite anxious, according to Michael Wolff. And
      he kept asking people, I mean, is it going to work? Is it going to be a win? Is
      it going to be, I mean, a game changer? I’m hoping for a game change, we want
      something that is perfect and this will be a big headline and a big win and I
      want the headline, “We won.” So he says there was an element of sort of lack of
      confidence, almost, in Trump, I mean he went on saying the same thing you know,
      “this is what it’s got to be: in, boom, out. In, boom out, ceasefire.” And so
      that’s how it was presented. And actually, you know, this suits the Iranians quite
      well, because he says and insists, obliterated. Everything has been obliterated.
      There’s nothing left. It’s all over. No nuclear program. Well, this is fine from
      the Iranian point of view because they say, well then, to sort of [French President
      Emmanuel] Macron and others who saying, well, well, the IAEA have to go back and
      sort of inspect and find out what’s going on. And they say, but it’s you who say
      it’s all over. There isn’t a program. So why do we need the IAEA in there at all?
      In fact, the IAEA are already out and their return, I mean, I’m not exaggerating
      this, they need huge bodyguards if they ever went back to Iran. They are hated
      with a huge intensity by the ordinary population because they believe that particularly
      the assassination of the scientists and the identification of them came from the
      IAEA artificial intelligence program MOSAIC, which is one of the, if you like,
      Palantir stable of targeting systems, which relies on imputing motives to people,
      not on evidence. This is where you get the great disparity with Tulsi Gabbard,
      for example, because what the IAEA were using was this data gathering process
      examining 400 million pieces of data, social, what you read on your social platforms,
      where you move, who your children play with, all of this thing, just like Palantir
      uses the same system in Israel and in Gaza to impute to Israel, to Iran the idea
      that they are not being honest in moving the enriched uranium, that they’re not
      declaring things. And so that’s what happened on the 12th. The day before the
      Israeli attack on Iran, the board of the IAEA on the basis of this evidence said,
      Iran is accelerating towards enrichment and therefore to a bomb. And this is in
      breach of the protocols of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]. This
      is really the pretext for the attack on Iran that took place on Friday the 13th
      of June. That resolution that was prepared and stage managed effectively by the
      IAEA to give, if you like, a peg for the Israeli tact to take place, which is
      why the Iranians and the Russians too are so distrustful of the IAEA and I don’t
      think it’s going back into Iran. Chris Hedges Well, the UN inspection teams in
      Iraq were riddled with foreign intelligence operatives, including Israeli. One
      has to assume that’s also true with the IAEA. Alastair Crooke It’s completely,
      I mean it’s verified. I mean, we know that they were providing intelligence to
      the Mossad and to Israel about, and of course IAEA insisted on meeting the scientists
      involved in the nuclear program and therefore being able to identify them. Whether
      this was directly passed on, I can’t say. But the Iranians have intelligence which
      suggests that it was passed on. I haven’t seen the intelligence. Chris Hedges
      Let’s talk about the strikes on Israel. Of course, because of military censorship
      in Israel, we don’t know the full picture. We know that refineries were hit in
      Haifa. We know the Weizmann Institute was hit. Reading it from a distance, it
      does appear that Israel was probably a little surprised at the extent of the damage
      that the Iranians were able to inflict. Alastair Crooke I think they were very
      shocked by it. They were attacked as they’d never been attacked before. I mean,
      they might have been used to a few Katyusha rockets from Gaza, but this was a
      completely different order. As you say, there’s been a complete news blackout,
      but subsequently, from satellite images, it’s clear that at least five military
      sites were destroyed by the Iranians apart from, if you like, the main ones, which
      was the HaKirya, which was the equivalent of the Pentagon, the Mossad headquarters
      in Herzliya, and various other sites as well, as well as other damages. And those
      other ones are very important because this is key in their economic sense, that
      first of all, there was the attack on Haifa and the destruction of the refinery
      at Haifa. And the Israelis say it will not be able to operate for at least a month.
      And then there was the attack on the Ashdod Port which destroyed the electric
      power system. There’s a generator, the power generator there which led to the
      blackout in about a third of the country. It’s been restored. Israel has three
      ports, Eilat, which has been closed for months, Haifa and Ashdod. Both of those
      were heavily attacked and the economy was really at a halt and this is why Israel
      called to the Omanis and said we need a ceasefire and said the same to America,
      we need it. And the other reason was because they were running out of missiles,
      of intercept missiles. The Israelis themselves say 93 THAAD [Terminal High Altitude
      Area Defense] missiles were fired by the Americans and the Israelis in that period
      of the 12 days. 93, which is equivalent to $1.2 billion worth of missiles, which
      is about two to three years total production capacity of THAAD missile interceptors
      during that period. So again, not only can that operation that they did on the
      13th not be easily resurrected, but at the moment, Israel is going to have to
      wait to re-equip itself with air defenses in a major way before they could think
      of attacking. Iran is also doing the same. The Iranians believe and think that
      there will be a further attack from Israel because it’s not, they believe, in
      Israel’s interest to accept the Trump assertion that the program is over, that
      Israel wants to say that the program is there because that provides them with
      the cue to say, yes, within the ceasefire we have the right to attack when and
      as we want onto Iran, if we suspect that they’re enriching or moving uranium,
      we can attack at our initiative. This is what the basis of the ceasefire in Lebanon
      is, that there is to be a ceasefire, but Israel has the right to attack anywhere
      in Lebanon as it chooses and when it chooses. So they’ve been trying to impose
      the same terms, if you like, on Iran. And I think that is ultimately intended
      to try and pull in America to another round of attacks because the Israeli position
      is still, and this is very important really, that the Israeli position is that
      simply the enrichment program cannot be defeated by military systems alone. The
      only way ultimately to defeat it is by a regime change and the imposition of a
      Western style puppet government into Tehran because they believe that they cannot
      kill the technical knowledge or the will to move ahead with enrichment. I think
      there are two triggers that we should watch. If the West really pushes the Iranians
      to allow some sort of oversight or monitoring of the program with a reformed perhaps
      IAEA or whatever, by the way, Russia won’t push them very hard on that because
      the IAEA, Russia has its own quarrels with the IAEA. But if the West pushes, Trump
      pushes very hard on that, then I think, and it is required under the NPT, the
      Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, monitoring and accountability is part of the treaty.
      If that is pushed, then I think there will be an answer, which is we’re leaving
      the NPT. And if then, which is also likely, the Euro 3 and the JCPOA push for
      a snapback of sanctions on Iran. And they’ve already said publicly that they intend
      to push for snapback sanctions. Part of the whole process of putting more pressure
      on Iran and then the hope that Trump keeps saying that they will then come and
      offer an unconditional surrender, which will never happen. But that’s the plan
      anyway. But those two things were likely to push Iran off the NPT. What happens
      then? We have to wait and see. But there is a very strong patriotic mood, as you
      referred to in the introduction. And what is so striking is it’s the young, the
      people that people thought were not necessarily, you know, supporters of it. And
      they are totally, totally supporting the Supreme Leader. He’s like a sort of celebrity
      figure now for everyone, for the young and for all. So I don’t know whether they
      will decide to move towards a weapon or leave it in sort of strategic ambiguity.
      That’s a possibility too. Chris Hedges Well, these kinds of attacks always generate
      that kind of blowback. I was in Buenos Aires right before the British attacked
      the Falklands and the regime was about to fall, the junta. And then as soon as
      the attack began, these people became national galtiere and all these criminals
      became national heroes. I want to talk about that process because the Supreme
      Leader has, I think it was 2003, had written that it was against Sharia Islamic
      law to build a nuclear weapon. Alastair Crooke That’s perfectly true, but there
      is some important element. Under Sharia jurisprudence there’s a thing called Ijtihad,
      which is that you can change law through reasoning, through a process of reasoning.
      And that reasoning can be changed on the basis of time and circumstances. So that
      if it’s no longer appropriate because the world has moved on and life is different
      or because of a changed circumstances then a jurist, it has to be a jurist, it’s
      not a political decision but a qualified jurist, Hujjat al-Islam or [inaudible]
      can actually change the law and a new fatwa can be issued very easily. It doesn’t
      need parliamentary or a pew but there is a majority in Iran now of people who
      argued that it was a mistake never to go down this route and that this is going
      to be something that is going to be really much more, and this is something the
      Russians have alluded to, which I think is quite significant. They’re saying actually
      this whole proliferation process that the West had is actually back to front because
      actually it’s pushing people ultimately towards a weapon, not preventing them
      because this process of going around and just threatening states we’re going to
      bomb you to the stone age if you don’t do what we tell you actually has ended
      and that’s what happened of course with North Korea. I mean they’d agreed a process
      of giving it up but then more requirements and more requirements were imposed.
      I mean it was all agreed and there was going to be money put in and a new process
      and then the extra demands that Washington imposed on top of the original agreement
      prompted the North Koreans to say, hang it, it’s not worth it, I mean it’s much
      better that we should go for a bomb. So I mean the Russians and others are saying
      well this whole nonproliferation, actually the real proliferators at this moment
      is the West because they keep pushing people towards thinking the only thing that
      they need. And look what’s happened. They bombed Iran and now Saudi Arabia is
      talking about a weapon. Now India is expressing concerns about it and what the
      consequence will be. Other states will be pursuing it. So actually rather than
      stopping proliferation, acting to stop proliferation as the West says it’s doing,
      it is actually encouraging proliferation. That’s the Russian view. [Dmitry] Medvedev
      said that, the Vice President said that quite recently. Chris Hedges We also have
      the example of [Muammar] Gaddafi, who gave up his program. Alastair Crooke Exactly,
      It wasn’t too difficult to take away, I remember, because it was still in its
      packing cases. He hadn’t even unpacked it and it was removed. Anyway, that was,
      yes, there isn’t a good history [inaudible]. Chris Hedges Let’s talk about the
      increased drone activity that apparently is occurring over Iran and what that
      means. Alastair Crooke The Israeli drone activity over Iran at the moment is not
      attack drones. It is mostly surveillance drones. They’re sort of trying to scope
      out radar and the sort of the time it takes for radar to lock onto them and where
      the radar is. And that is being fed into the American, only the Americans have
      this sort of satellite-based battlescape map that sort of tracks all radar and
      air defenses so that you can, if you like, construct your missiles to sort of
      do a slalom between all the impediments to reach your target. So that’s what’s
      happening at the moment. Plus, and I heard this from Tehran just yesterday, they’re
      under huge cyber attack from all NATO, they say. I mean, there’s a big cyber attack
      going. So I think, you know, both parties expect there will be another round and
      Iran’s certainly and Israel is preparing for the next stage. So I think, you know,
      although Trump, and I don’t think he wanted this, I mean, from everything that
      Michael Wolff said about those calls which were, you know, I just want this to
      be perfect. I want this, you know, I want this to be in boom, out, finished, ceasefire,
      done, let’s close it, finish this talk. I think that what Trump is trying to do
      there is he does not, and Michael Wolff says, and I think this is absolutely right,
      he doesn’t think he has the attention span to do a long, drawn-out slugfest fight
      with Iran. What he’s trying to do is shut it down to give him enough space to
      get back to what he really wants, which is, if you like, this new Middle East
      business world, this new structure whereby Lebanon and Syria and others will be
      brought into some form. We will have the Abraham Accords 2.0. And this will open
      a universe of business and trading possibilities through and you know that he
      hopes that Iran can just sort of stand on the sidelines and not do anything about
      it till he can find some other agreement with Iran. The main thing is the headline.
      Let’s have a big headline. We’ve done it. There’s a new Middle East. Everyone’s
      in this new sort of matrix of money, investments, resources, and of course the
      resources of Iran, which are so vital to China. And also the fact that the Gulf
      states and that if he can take that whole, if you like, corridor of the Middle
      East, he can take it into southern Central Asia and disrupt the BRICS and their
      connectivity plans in those stung areas — Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, all those areas.
      He can disrupt it and start moving the economic sphere into this. At the same
      time, that he’s doing, if you like, an attempt to cage China literally by tariffs
      structures. And also weakening Russia by reigniting the tensions in the Caucasus
      again. And so Russia and Putin are taking this very seriously. And so is China.
      And they are very angry about this. They’re angry about the deceit because Putin
      thinks he was deceived by those attacks on the strategic bombers just the day
      before the Istanbul talks just as Iran is. And China believes also that Xi was
      cheated by Trump in the discussions that they had. So there’s a real sort of sense
      of preparing for a new and wider Cold War that is being pushed. I mean, Kazakhstan
      in the north that is, I was in Russia around about the time of the Crocus Hall,
      the concert hall that was burnt down. And they were Tajiks that had come down
      who were found to be responsible. And there was a big structure in Kazakhstan
      for recruiting people, Afghans and Tajiks and others and for infiltrating them
      into Russia or to Iran or whatever. And now we see that Azerbaijan is engaged
      in the same idea. Now the reports, I can’t verify them, but recently Russia arrested
      a number of Azeris-Russian citizens and that produced a dramatic response from
      Aliyev who arrested all the Sputnik journalists and many others in Azerbaijan
      and they roughed them up and they’ve charged them with espionage and other charges.
      Now there’s always been sort of criminal groups in Russia from Azerbaijan. They’re
      known as sort of a mafia there. But this is more serious, I believe, because it’s
      thinking the Russians may be suspected that these groups were also facilitating
      the infiltration of some of those pre-positioned units that were ready for the
      attack on the strategic bomber system in Russia, the Spider’s Web. And that also
      Azerbaijan was facilitating the attack on Iran. So Azerbaijan and Armenia too
      and the question of Turkey’s role. The United States is trying to woo [Recep Tayyip]
      Erdoğan with promises of F-35s, if only he’ll mothball the S-400s that he has
      and I think that the aim is, the Israeli aim is the key to their, if you like,
      their new corridor, the new, if you like, Abraham Accord 2.0, a business plan
      right through to Asia, is that Turkey should persuade both Syria and Lebanon that
      they have no choice and incentivize them both to join into this new sort of greater
      Israel project. So this is why there’s a lot of tensions that all these proposals
      that are coming out of America at the moment, the intent to sort of cut off China
      from trade by putting differential tariffs on China if they trans ship goods through
      Vietnam or another country. The prospect of new sanctions on Russia. The attack
      on Iran is a pivot, a key pivot for Russia and China of the whole BRICS structure.
      All of these things are producing a really strong response from Russia. I mean,
      it’s given very tough response to Trump and this and says, we know exactly what
      you’re doing in the Caucasus. We know what you are doing in Azerbaijan and we
      won’t put up with it. And so Russia responded to this by destroying the two refineries
      in Ukraine that were fueled from Baku, from Azerbaijan. There was Azerbaijan input
      that was fueling these two refineries. This was a warning to Azerbaijan, you know,
      stop playing around with this. So Iran will be saying something rather similar,
      I suspect, to the Azeris. Now, I think some people in the United States think,
      even dream, of the idea that Azerbaijan could invade at the right moment in coordination
      with Israel into Iran as the Baluch perhaps come from another side or the Kurds
      from the other. But I think that is very far-fetched because 85% of the areas
      are Shiʿi. There is, if you like, the leadership is Turkic more than Iranian Shiʿi
      but they’re Turkic, either Sunni or Shiʿi converted. Anyway, it’s very secular.
      And the Iranians, all the Azeris in Iran are very, very loyal to Iran. And people
      talk about, well, the Azeri’s glass ceiling. And I slightly laugh at that. And
      I say, well, there’s one person you probably have heard of who’s really well-known
      poet and he writes in the Azeri language and he’s fluent in the Azeri language
      and he is Azeri and that’s the Supreme Leader. So it’s not that the Azeris are
      completely sort of outliers in Iran. Chris Hedges Didn’t Israel launch drones
      from there? Isn’t that a launch point for… Alastair Crooke Yeah, exactly. They
      launched drones and also, as I say, the airspace of Azerbaijan was used for standoff
      firing of drones that had these new cruise missiles, multiple cruise missiles.
      They could launch them once they were in Iranian territory. Chris Hedges I have
      two last questions, but just on Gaza, because in the meeting in the White House,
      when reporters were allowed in, Trump and Netanyahu were talking about depopulating
      Gaza. Netanyahu very cynically said it’s not a prison. People who want to leave,
      of course, there’s enforced starvation since March 2nd, should have the right
      to leave. Just your thoughts on what’s happening in Gaza. Alastair Crooke What’s
      happening in Gaza is that Netanyahu and the right are intent on first of all pushing
      all the Palestinians into what amounts to a concentration camp in one small part.
      They will be put in but they will not be allowed out of it. And it is a stage
      towards, it’s politely called voluntary expatriation but it is of course mandatory,
      if you like, removal of the population from Gaza. And the same is going on in
      the West Bank. Huge process. [Bezalel] Smotrich is in charge of this aspect. And
      there is a real effort being made because they think they believe they can persuade
      Trump to annex most of the West Bank. But settlers have moved into large areas.
      New settlements are announced all the time. The annexation is afoot in the West
      Bank as in Gaza. I think I remember Smotrich was always very, very clear about
      this. I remember listening to him about six years ago or so and he said, listen,
      this is our plan, to remove all the Palestinians from the area. And he said, but
      you know, as it is with the legal system, it’s difficult. What we need is a big
      crisis or a big war. And when that happens, we will complete the project. That’s
      what we’re looking for. And that’s why they’re always sort of playing around with
      the Temple Mount, Al-Aqsa. Looking to use that perhaps as the pretext to sort
      of trigger a commotion in the whole Muslim world. Al-Aqsa is a neuralgic point
      in the Muslim world, that they could use this as the ability to sort of create
      the crisis that they could then, under the pretext of an emergency, really move,
      finish off the depopulation of Gaza and also much of the West Bank, drive the
      West Bank to Jordan. Chris Hedges Does that mean they would drive the Palestinians
      and try to drive them into Jordan and they would drive the Palestinians in Gaza
      into Egypt? The Egyptians and the Jordanians have been adamant that’s not going
      to happen. Alastair Crooke Yes, but I mean they are pushing them closer and closer
      to the Rafah Gate. And, you know, what’s going to happen if they open those gates
      and just push them out, tou know, a million or so Palestinians? It’s very, very
      sensitive in Egypt. The Egyptians are really, ordinary Egyptians, the Egyptian
      army is very angry with [Abdel Fattah El-]Sisi about his ineffectual response
      to what’s happening in Gaza. It could explode. The whole Egyptian element could
      explode in this process. Of course there will be some sort of public relations
      exercise of sending a few Palestinians to, I don’t know where, but somewhere to
      say, no they went voluntarily. But of course that’s not what’s planned. What’s
      planned is another Nakba from Gaza. And it’s unfolding, sadly, unfortunately.
      You know, Hamas demands are not met by this proposal. This is why I don’t, I think
      what we will get is probably some sort of ceasefire. But it’s a ceasefire designed
      to allow the Israelis to resume the attrition of Gaza either because they’ll claim
      it will break down or because they’ll claim the 60 days are over. And the Hamas
      position remains unchanged — we want an end to the war. We want the removal of
      all of the Israeli troops from Gaza and a reconstruction of the strip. And of
      course, the Witkoff proposal does none of those things. It doesn’t provide for
      an end of the war. There will still be Israeli forces inside Gaza during the ceasefire
      and after. And the proposals for reconstructing it is quite different to be done
      by pliant Arab states. Chris Hedges And we should just draw that parallel between
      decapitating Hamas. I knew Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, one of the co-founders of Hamas,
      assassinated with his son in 2004, a long litany of Hamas leaders who were killed.
      And of course, it disrupts the organization without question. But just because
      Israel has decapitated Iranian leadership, ultimately, I mean I’ll get your feed
      on this, it ultimately doesn’t disrupt the system. Alastair Crooke I think that’s
      exactly what we saw in Iran. I mean, that actually, as so often has happened,
      Israel decapitates the moderates and the younger generation that come in are much
      more hardline than, you know, their other elderly. I mean, some of the IRGC are
      veterans from the Iran-Iraq War and, you know, the younger are much more vigorous
      and much more determined than the older ones and that’s what’s happened. And I
      think what we’ve seen is the other part of this great equation that was supposed
      to come out of Washington. Hezbollah have said categorically they will not accept
      any process that leads to their disarmament. Now this may end up in civil war
      in Lebanon, it could do what the Americans are pushing very, very hard in every
      way to disenfranchise, depoliticize, demilitarize the Shia who are the majority
      in Lebanon and it won’t happen. I mean they’ve been down that route in the past
      as you know and it’s not likely to happen. Chris Hedges Let’s just close with
      the next Israeli strike, which you talked about how Israel views ceasefires. This
      is writ large in Gaza, where Israel violates every single ceasefire they make
      to “mow the lawn.” That same kind of mentality will most likely be used to again
      make strikes against Iran if in Israeli eyes they feel they are reconstituting
      military defenses or a nuclear program. What do you, how do you picture that strike
      and the consequences? The next one. Alastair Crooke I think the first thing which
      is really important to say is that, and we follow the Israeli press very very
      closely, the Hebrew press, I mean not just the English language press. It’s very
      clear that they know now after what has happened, I mean they sustained much more
      damage than they had expected, that they cannot attack Iran without full unstinting
      American support. Now the question is, is that going to be forthcoming? And I
      think one of the things that I feel might stop it is the question of the MAGA.
      I think the MAGA are really quite unhappy. You know, there were two issues in
      the American election, immigration and forever wars. And MAGA came and also there
      is a quite a number of Democrats, young Democratic voters who supported Trump
      mainly because he promised peace and no more war. Not necessarily for the other
      part, but certainly for that. They are starting to filter away. And it’s also
      in the MAGA. You’ve seen, I mean, Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and everyone
      who, there’s a big pushback against it. They have, Trump has a majority, I think
      you can correct me if I’m wrong, about three in both houses, in the Senate and
      the House. It’s small. And midterms are just over a year away. So I think he is
      going to be worried about the internal position, the MAGA position and that. And
      that was obvious almost when Hexeth came in, spoke, and he said, he went on, you
      may remember it, he made a statement, I think, on Fox News saying, look, we’re
      not attacking Iran per se or the Iranian people, we’re just attacking the nuclear
      program. I think, you know, we’re not wanting to have a war with Iran, we’re just
      trying to, you know, sort this part out. So I think he will because, you know,
      with only three, it would be quite feasible if he gets stuck and locked into a
      long… bloody conflict in Iran and it would be because Iran’s got surprises for
      the United States and for Israel if it moves to another phase everyone is preparing
      for another phase. If it does that you know he may find that you know at the end
      of it I mean it would be a very different world. I mean one can’t even rule out
      if there is a change at the midterm elections you know impeachment and things
      might come back. on to the agenda. You know more about that than I, but it’s a
      generous moment and I think he’s right to be concerned about it because it’s from
      both ends of his, it’s the young and it is the MAGA who are both, you know, don’t
      want a war, a big war in the Middle East particularly. Chris Hedges Great, thanks.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, host Chris Hedges
      interviews former British diplomat Alastair Crooke about the escalating tensions
      in the Middle East following Israeli and American attacks on Iran, which raised
      fears of a potential World War III. After a 12-day conflict, a ceasefire has introduced
      new uncertainties regarding the future of the region. Crooke discusses the factors
      leading to the Israeli strikes, including advanced technology and support from
      neighboring countries, as well as the implications of American military involvement
      under Donald Trump's administration. Both Hedges and Crooke emphasize that the
      conflict is ongoing and that the future stability of the Middle East and the global
      economy is contingent on the actions of Israel, Iran, and the United States in
      the coming weeks and months. Hedges also appeals for support to sustain independent
      journalism amidst increasing censorship pressures.

    text: 'By Chris Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report This interview is also available
      on podcast platforms and Rumble . Following attacks on Iran by Israel and the
      United States, the world held its breath as the prospect of World War III loomed
      on the horizon. After 12 days of conflict, a ceasefire has brought about new uncertainty
      for the future. Former British diplomat Alastair Crooke joins host Chris Hedges
      on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to make sense of the current situation
      in the Middle East and what can be expected in the coming weeks or months. Crooke
      details the lead up to the Israeli attacks, including the use of technology and
      neighbouring countries that allowed for the element of surprise. Cyber attacks,
      drones flown in from Azerbaijan and American military software served as crucial
      elements for the Israeli attacks on Iran. As for the American strikes weeks later,
      Crooke explains Donald Trump’s alleged anxiety in not engaging in a prolonged
      conflict and theorizes about what the damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities actually
      looks like and what it could mean going forward. Hedges and Crooke lay out what
      could come next, indicating that this conflict is far from over and the future
      of the Middle East, along with the rest of the world’s economy, hinges on what
      comes next from Israel, Iran or the United States. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS

      Max Jones Intro: Diego Ramos Crew: Diego Ramos, Sofia Menemenlis and Thomas Hedges
      Transcript: Diego Ramos Transcript Chris Hedges The 12-day conflict between Israel,
      the United States and Iran is not over. It is the first phase of what could become
      an endless war, much like Israel’s decades-long sporadic war against Lebanon.
      The attacks on Iran, as with the invasion and occupation of Iraq, was based on
      a lie. Neither U.S. intelligence nor the U.N. concurred with Netanyahu and Trump’s
      claim that Iran was weaponizing its enriched uranium. Israel was able to inflict
      significant damage on Iran, including what it says were the targeted assassinations
      of 30 senior security officials and 11 senior nuclear scientists. But Israel and
      the United States do not appear to have, as Donald Trump insisted, obliterated
      Iran’s nuclear weapons program. At best, it probably set back any enrichment program
      by only a few weeks or months should Iran decide to build a bomb. Iran’s surface-to-surface
      missiles probably caused more damage and casualties than Israel expected, but
      because the Israeli Air Force had virtual control over the skies of Iran it was
      able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficacy. By shredding the
      nuclear agreement with Iran in Trump’s first administration, which the Iranians
      were abiding by, and then allowing Israel to carry out an attack while negotiations
      were ongoing with Iran, the United States and Israel have effectively shut the
      door on any diplomatic resolution to the conflict. The failure of European governments
      to condemn the bombing, a flagrant violation of Iran’s sovereignty, has only widened
      the divide between Iran and the West. Rather than weaken the Iranian regime, these
      attacks have enraged Iranians, especially young Iranians, who poured into the
      streets in the millions for the funerals of the victims of Israel’s attacks. It
      has hardened the resolve of the Iranians rulers who have suspended cooperation
      with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and rejected calls by the Trump
      administration to resume negotiations. Joining me to discuss the fallout from
      this 12-day war and what comes next is Alastair Crooke, a former British diplomat
      who served for many years in the Middle East working as a security advisor to
      the EU special envoy to the Middle East, as well as helping lead efforts to set
      up negotiations and truces between Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian
      resistant groups with Israel. He is also the author of Resistance: The Essence
      of the Islamist Revolution , which analyzes the ascendancy of Islamic movements
      in the Middle East. You can find his work at ConflictsForum.Substack.com . Let’s
      begin with a question that has puzzled me since these attacks began, and that
      is why it was so easy for Israel to take out Iran’s air defenses, which were a
      mixture of Iranian-produced air defenses, of course, but also Russian air defenses.
      Alastair Crooke Well, there’s a certain deception about what happened there. I
      know that it is advertised by Israel and by many in the United States that there
      was open skies and that Israel could actually come across and destroy the air
      defenses. That actually is not true. In fact, if you look, you’ll find there is
      not a single video. Many people were taking shots from their smartphones and things,
      not a single video of an Israeli aircraft over Tehran or Iran as a whole. What
      happened? It’s really very interesting because it has a very important impact.
      What happened was that well before the 13th of June surprise attack that Israel
      mounted on Iran, Israel Mossad and its special forces were pre-positioning anti-tank
      weapons from Kurdistan area, from Erbil and the Kurdistan area of Iraq across
      the border into Iran. Quite close, as close as they could get to the air defense
      systems that were present. And then special forces, Israelis have admitted they
      had special forces in Iran at that time, and the special forces then were coming
      and using ballistic missiles guided by American software, the Battlescape software
      system onto the targets that they wanted. Now, there were no aircraft crossing
      into Iranian airspace except that some aircraft from Israel flew right along the
      north of Iran, which is very mountainous and really deserted, into Azerbaijan,
      the airspace. And from Azerbaijan, Israel launched drones, attack drones. They
      didn’t have such a big warhead. But they also then flew down the Caspian till
      they were opposite Tehran. And from there, the Israeli planes fired these latest
      ballistic cruise missiles. Those are the ones that hit Tehran and made a big impact
      on it. So it was a very complicated setup that had taken months, if not years
      for Mossad to put all of those into position to infiltrate people, pre-position
      them. What took out the Iranian air defences in the first day was actually a cyber
      attack, a really major cyber attack on their air defences, and they managed to
      undo that and to correct it with eight hours after which their air defences were
      working again and you can see there’s evidence, we can see quite clear evidence
      of that happening. Why was Iran in such a vulnerable position? Well, that’s quite
      interesting too, because actually on that day, the 13th of June, scheduled, long
      scheduled, and with the Iranians expecting to go to talks on the Sunday with [United
      States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve] Witkoff in Oman and the Americans
      to talk about the nuclear program, the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]
      had a big program, a big exercise prepared with naval and other forces engaged
      with us and some of the missile launches were actually exposed and put out because
      of this big exercise. I think it involved the Chinese too as well. So they were
      all in this headquarters in a single room in the headquarters when Israel decapitated
      the line commanders of the IRGC and the military staff who were all preparing
      for this big exercise. They were taken by surprise and the decapitation happened.
      What happened with the civilian scientists, they were killed by spike missiles
      fired directly and small ballistic missiles fired by probably the special forces,
      I’m not quite sure, into their homes. Precise strikes into the homes killing them
      and their families too. I think it’s 10 or 11 scientists were killed. So that
      was really what happened. Now, the most important, there are two important things
      that flow from this. The first is this setup is not repeatable. You can’t, I mean,
      it was a very sophisticated, long-prepared positioning people in the site, both
      from the north, from Azerbaijan, and across the border from Kurdistan, the MEK
      [People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran] coming across Kurdistan, setting all
      these up. The cyber attack was set up and prepared and everything was ready for
      this. But now it’s exposed. You can’t go back to it. And also that now, I mean,
      the Iranian air defenses are fully operational. They’re getting more air defenses
      from the Chinese. So it won’t be the same. You can’t just repeat that operation.
      And the talk about open skies was very deceptive. It was really a lie. It wasn’t
      open skies. It was actually something rather different that happened. So that’s
      very important that it’s not something that can be repeated. Israel can’t do this
      next week or the week after. It would take months if possible. But in the meantime,
      Iran is, of course, operating around Erbil and Kurdistan. You’ve probably seen
      there have been many explosions and attacks there. In the north, removing Baluchis
      and refugees from across the border from that area. And there is a tough conversation
      taking place between Russia and [Ilham] Aliyev, the head of the Azeri state and
      also from Iran. So there is a great deal of tension there from Azerbaijan and
      Russia about different things. But it used to have good relations, but now it’s
      very tense indeed there. The Russians suspect that not only those tactics of infiltration,
      of saboteurs were done, if you like, during that attack on Russia’s strategic
      bomber force out of Kazakhstan, but they think that some of them were done by
      part of the illegal and criminal gangs who are Azeris as well as Russian citizens.
      And behind this, Russia sees the hand of Turkey and NATO for both the attack in
      Iran and also the attack that took place, I think it was called the Spider’s Web
      attack [Operation Spiderweb] on those strategic bombers that were out in the open
      on, again, the day before peace talks were taking place. Chris Hedges Let’s talk
      about the American strike. Correct me if I’m wrong, it was my understanding that
      the Israelis did take out air defenses to open a corridor for American bombers,
      but maybe that’s incorrect. And secondly, let’s talk about the, what is it, 408
      kilograms of enriched uranium. I think they’re supposedly at 60%. But let’s talk
      about the American strike. Alastair Crooke Well, the Americans warned these Iranians
      beforehand, either I think probably through the Swiss embassy in Tehran or through,
      perhaps equally likely through Oman, warned them in advance and also told them
      it was once and done, i.e. would be one strike, finish, end of the process. So
      they passed that information to the Iranians and I believe, I can’t budge for
      it perfectly, but my understanding is that the Russians said to them, look, just
      let it happen. It’s much better, just let it happen. You probably won’t, it won’t
      be as damaging as it may be advertised, just let it happen. And it’s true because
      in that time it’s fairly clear. There was no evidence you can see of any great,
      if you like, air defences being used or mounted or explosions. Iranians tell me,
      I was in Iran just before this happened, the Iranians tell me it was very quiet
      that night, there was nothing happening. So they just came in, they did what they
      wanted to do and then they left. What success they had, well, nobody can really
      say. At this stage, anyone who tells you or says they know, I don’t think is telling
      the truth because the only way you know… there are about five entrances to Fordow,
      five different entrances. Two of them were blocked up with soil by the Iranians
      before the strike, two days before. And the whole basis of this depends on a very
      controversial piece of, if you like, mechanics. Most of those entrances to the
      Fordow base have got blast bends in them. In other words, if there’s an explosion,
      it can’t go any further. It can’t reach the centrifuge hole. Centrifuge hole,
      don’t forget, is at 800 meters depth in this mountain. And then there is a vent.
      And this is a source of controversy in America as anywhere else is according to
      the Americans and who brief Trump, the vent had no, if you like, bend in it. It
      was vertical, straight from the surface down to the centrifuge hole. And many
      experts, professors from MIT and others, are very adamant and saying it’s unbelievable
      that the Iranians would have put blast vents in all of the entrances but have
      forget to do it in the vent. Well, I don’t know the answer to that. You’ll have
      to go and ask the professor about that. But, yes, four days beforehand there were
      trucks at Fordow and the Iranians and I think there’s some reasonably reliable
      reporting that the highly enriched uranium was removed and probably deposited
      in this other site called the Pickaxe Mountain, which is also quite close to Qom
      and I would think it’s probably hidden there somewhere. It’s even deeper than
      Fordow by the way, but it’s never mentioned because it seems to be off the radar.
      Anyway, I think that is probably where it is, but until the Iranians clear one
      of these entrances, which they deliberately blocked up to stop pressure rising
      and go into the hall, we won’t know how much damage is done. But I think the Isfahan
      one also is very deep and it’s quite likely that centrifuges were not destroyed
      at Isfahan. Natanz is different. Natanz is very old. It’s there from the Shah’s
      time. It’s mostly on the surface. I remember passing it and you could, you know,
      it’s there and you see it. But they put the centrifuges down I think between 60
      and 80 meters. So I mean, maybe they’re badly damaged, who knows. But they don’t
      need many centrifuges. One of the things that this professor from MIT, Postol,
      Ted Postol says that, you know, once you get to a certain point in the enrichment
      process, then it becomes exponential. You just have to do a tiny bit more and
      that you’re up at 90%. So I mean, you know, they don’t need many centrifuges to
      have survived. Chris Hedges The pilots talked about seeing explosions, but what
      I heard, that was in fact not a good sign. Alastair Crooke Yes, that’s right.
      That is a sign that there was a blast bend on the vent. And so the blast was coming
      up. And that’s why it had a spectacular view of explosion, because it hadn’t gone
      down to the centrifuge floor. It had come up and was at the surface. So it isn’t
      necessarily a good indicator of that. So that was really the gist of it, that
      I think it was clear that Trump wanted it. And we know quite a lot about that
      day because someone, and I wrote about it, it extends to you and I’m sure you
      probably know Michael Wolff, who’s written four books on Trump, and he was talking
      and calling. He works by calling interlocutors that the Trump has just spoken
      to on the phone. And he says it’s a really reliable way of finding out what Trump
      is thinking because he says the same question to each interlocutor. And it’s not
      really a question. So on the 12th, it seemed that… on the 22nd rather, the day
      of the American strike, Trump was quite anxious, according to Michael Wolff. And
      he kept asking people, I mean, is it going to work? Is it going to be a win? Is
      it going to be, I mean, a game changer? I’m hoping for a game change, we want
      something that is perfect and this will be a big headline and a big win and I
      want the headline, “We won.” So he says there was an element of sort of lack of
      confidence, almost, in Trump, I mean he went on saying the same thing you know,
      “this is what it’s got to be: in, boom, out. In, boom out, ceasefire.” And so
      that’s how it was presented. And actually, you know, this suits the Iranians quite
      well, because he says and insists, obliterated. Everything has been obliterated.
      There’s nothing left. It’s all over. No nuclear program. Well, this is fine from
      the Iranian point of view because they say, well then, to sort of [French President
      Emmanuel] Macron and others who saying, well, well, the IAEA have to go back and
      sort of inspect and find out what’s going on. And they say, but it’s you who say
      it’s all over. There isn’t a program. So why do we need the IAEA in there at all?
      In fact, the IAEA are already out and their return, I mean, I’m not exaggerating
      this, they need huge bodyguards if they ever went back to Iran. They are hated
      with a huge intensity by the ordinary population because they believe that particularly
      the assassination of the scientists and the identification of them came from the
      IAEA artificial intelligence program MOSAIC, which is one of the, if you like,
      Palantir stable of targeting systems, which relies on imputing motives to people,
      not on evidence. This is where you get the great disparity with Tulsi Gabbard,
      for example, because what the IAEA were using was this data gathering process
      examining 400 million pieces of data, social, what you read on your social platforms,
      where you move, who your children play with, all of this thing, just like Palantir
      uses the same system in Israel and in Gaza to impute to Israel, to Iran the idea
      that they are not being honest in moving the enriched uranium, that they’re not
      declaring things. And so that’s what happened on the 12th. The day before the
      Israeli attack on Iran, the board of the IAEA on the basis of this evidence said,
      Iran is accelerating towards enrichment and therefore to a bomb. And this is in
      breach of the protocols of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]. This
      is really the pretext for the attack on Iran that took place on Friday the 13th
      of June. That resolution that was prepared and stage managed effectively by the
      IAEA to give, if you like, a peg for the Israeli tact to take place, which is
      why the Iranians and the Russians too are so distrustful of the IAEA and I don’t
      think it’s going back into Iran. Chris Hedges Well, the UN inspection teams in
      Iraq were riddled with foreign intelligence operatives, including Israeli. One
      has to assume that’s also true with the IAEA. Alastair Crooke It’s completely,
      I mean it’s verified. I mean, we know that they were providing intelligence to
      the Mossad and to Israel about, and of course IAEA insisted on meeting the scientists
      involved in the nuclear program and therefore being able to identify them. Whether
      this was directly passed on, I can’t say. But the Iranians have intelligence which
      suggests that it was passed on. I haven’t seen the intelligence. Chris Hedges
      Let’s talk about the strikes on Israel. Of course, because of military censorship
      in Israel, we don’t know the full picture. We know that refineries were hit in
      Haifa. We know the Weizmann Institute was hit. Reading it from a distance, it
      does appear that Israel was probably a little surprised at the extent of the damage
      that the Iranians were able to inflict. Alastair Crooke I think they were very
      shocked by it. They were attacked as they’d never been attacked before. I mean,
      they might have been used to a few Katyusha rockets from Gaza, but this was a
      completely different order. As you say, there’s been a complete news blackout,
      but subsequently, from satellite images, it’s clear that at least five military
      sites were destroyed by the Iranians apart from, if you like, the main ones, which
      was the HaKirya, which was the equivalent of the Pentagon, the Mossad headquarters
      in Herzliya, and various other sites as well, as well as other damages. And those
      other ones are very important because this is key in their economic sense, that
      first of all, there was the attack on Haifa and the destruction of the refinery
      at Haifa. And the Israelis say it will not be able to operate for at least a month.
      And then there was the attack on the Ashdod Port which destroyed the electric
      power system. There’s a generator, the power generator there which led to the
      blackout in about a third of the country. It’s been restored. Israel has three
      ports, Eilat, which has been closed for months, Haifa and Ashdod. Both of those
      were heavily attacked and the economy was really at a halt and this is why Israel
      called to the Omanis and said we need a ceasefire and said the same to America,
      we need it. And the other reason was because they were running out of missiles,
      of intercept missiles. The Israelis themselves say 93 THAAD [Terminal High Altitude
      Area Defense] missiles were fired by the Americans and the Israelis in that period
      of the 12 days. 93, which is equivalent to $1.2 billion worth of missiles, which
      is about two to three years total production capacity of THAAD missile interceptors
      during that period. So again, not only can that operation that they did on the
      13th not be easily resurrected, but at the moment, Israel is going to have to
      wait to re-equip itself with air defenses in a major way before they could think
      of attacking. Iran is also doing the same. The Iranians believe and think that
      there will be a further attack from Israel because it’s not, they believe, in
      Israel’s interest to accept the Trump assertion that the program is over, that
      Israel wants to say that the program is there because that provides them with
      the cue to say, yes, within the ceasefire we have the right to attack when and
      as we want onto Iran, if we suspect that they’re enriching or moving uranium,
      we can attack at our initiative. This is what the basis of the ceasefire in Lebanon
      is, that there is to be a ceasefire, but Israel has the right to attack anywhere
      in Lebanon as it chooses and when it chooses. So they’ve been trying to impose
      the same terms, if you like, on Iran. And I think that is ultimately intended
      to try and pull in America to another round of attacks because the Israeli position
      is still, and this is very important really, that the Israeli position is that
      simply the enrichment program cannot be defeated by military systems alone. The
      only way ultimately to defeat it is by a regime change and the imposition of a
      Western style puppet government into Tehran because they believe that they cannot
      kill the technical knowledge or the will to move ahead with enrichment. I think
      there are two triggers that we should watch. If the West really pushes the Iranians
      to allow some sort of oversight or monitoring of the program with a reformed perhaps
      IAEA or whatever, by the way, Russia won’t push them very hard on that because
      the IAEA, Russia has its own quarrels with the IAEA. But if the West pushes, Trump
      pushes very hard on that, then I think, and it is required under the NPT, the
      Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, monitoring and accountability is part of the treaty.
      If that is pushed, then I think there will be an answer, which is we’re leaving
      the NPT. And if then, which is also likely, the Euro 3 and the JCPOA push for
      a snapback of sanctions on Iran. And they’ve already said publicly that they intend
      to push for snapback sanctions. Part of the whole process of putting more pressure
      on Iran and then the hope that Trump keeps saying that they will then come and
      offer an unconditional surrender, which will never happen. But that’s the plan
      anyway. But those two things were likely to push Iran off the NPT. What happens
      then? We have to wait and see. But there is a very strong patriotic mood, as you
      referred to in the introduction. And what is so striking is it’s the young, the
      people that people thought were not necessarily, you know, supporters of it. And
      they are totally, totally supporting the Supreme Leader. He’s like a sort of celebrity
      figure now for everyone, for the young and for all. So I don’t know whether they
      will decide to move towards a weapon or leave it in sort of strategic ambiguity.
      That’s a possibility too. Chris Hedges Well, these kinds of attacks always generate
      that kind of blowback. I was in Buenos Aires right before the British attacked
      the Falklands and the regime was about to fall, the junta. And then as soon as
      the attack began, these people became national galtiere and all these criminals
      became national heroes. I want to talk about that process because the Supreme
      Leader has, I think it was 2003, had written that it was against Sharia Islamic
      law to build a nuclear weapon. Alastair Crooke That’s perfectly true, but there
      is some important element. Under Sharia jurisprudence there’s a thing called Ijtihad,
      which is that you can change law through reasoning, through a process of reasoning.
      And that reasoning can be changed on the basis of time and circumstances. So that
      if it’s no longer appropriate because the world has moved on and life is different
      or because of a changed circumstances then a jurist, it has to be a jurist, it’s
      not a political decision but a qualified jurist, Hujjat al-Islam or [inaudible]
      can actually change the law and a new fatwa can be issued very easily. It doesn’t
      need parliamentary or a pew but there is a majority in Iran now of people who
      argued that it was a mistake never to go down this route and that this is going
      to be something that is going to be really much more, and this is something the
      Russians have alluded to, which I think is quite significant. They’re saying actually
      this whole proliferation process that the West had is actually back to front because
      actually it’s pushing people ultimately towards a weapon, not preventing them
      because this process of going around and just threatening states we’re going to
      bomb you to the stone age if you don’t do what we tell you actually has ended
      and that’s what happened of course with North Korea. I mean they’d agreed a process
      of giving it up but then more requirements and more requirements were imposed.
      I mean it was all agreed and there was going to be money put in and a new process
      and then the extra demands that Washington imposed on top of the original agreement
      prompted the North Koreans to say, hang it, it’s not worth it, I mean it’s much
      better that we should go for a bomb. So I mean the Russians and others are saying
      well this whole nonproliferation, actually the real proliferators at this moment
      is the West because they keep pushing people towards thinking the only thing that
      they need. And look what’s happened. They bombed Iran and now Saudi Arabia is
      talking about a weapon. Now India is expressing concerns about it and what the
      consequence will be. Other states will be pursuing it. So actually rather than
      stopping proliferation, acting to stop proliferation as the West says it’s doing,
      it is actually encouraging proliferation. That’s the Russian view. [Dmitry] Medvedev
      said that, the Vice President said that quite recently. Chris Hedges We also have
      the example of [Muammar] Gaddafi, who gave up his program. Alastair Crooke Exactly,
      It wasn’t too difficult to take away, I remember, because it was still in its
      packing cases. He hadn’t even unpacked it and it was removed. Anyway, that was,
      yes, there isn’t a good history [inaudible]. Chris Hedges Let’s talk about the
      increased drone activity that apparently is occurring over Iran and what that
      means. Alastair Crooke The Israeli drone activity over Iran at the moment is not
      attack drones. It is mostly surveillance drones. They’re sort of trying to scope
      out radar and the sort of the time it takes for radar to lock onto them and where
      the radar is. And that is being fed into the American, only the Americans have
      this sort of satellite-based battlescape map that sort of tracks all radar and
      air defenses so that you can, if you like, construct your missiles to sort of
      do a slalom between all the impediments to reach your target. So that’s what’s
      happening at the moment. Plus, and I heard this from Tehran just yesterday, they’re
      under huge cyber attack from all NATO, they say. I mean, there’s a big cyber attack
      going. So I think, you know, both parties expect there will be another round and
      Iran’s certainly and Israel is preparing for the next stage. So I think, you know,
      although Trump, and I don’t think he wanted this, I mean, from everything that
      Michael Wolff said about those calls which were, you know, I just want this to
      be perfect. I want this, you know, I want this to be in boom, out, finished, ceasefire,
      done, let’s close it, finish this talk. I think that what Trump is trying to do
      there is he does not, and Michael Wolff says, and I think this is absolutely right,
      he doesn’t think he has the attention span to do a long, drawn-out slugfest fight
      with Iran. What he’s trying to do is shut it down to give him enough space to
      get back to what he really wants, which is, if you like, this new Middle East
      business world, this new structure whereby Lebanon and Syria and others will be
      brought into some form. We will have the Abraham Accords 2.0. And this will open
      a universe of business and trading possibilities through and you know that he
      hopes that Iran can just sort of stand on the sidelines and not do anything about
      it till he can find some other agreement with Iran. The main thing is the headline.
      Let’s have a big headline. We’ve done it. There’s a new Middle East. Everyone’s
      in this new sort of matrix of money, investments, resources, and of course the
      resources of Iran, which are so vital to China. And also the fact that the Gulf
      states and that if he can take that whole, if you like, corridor of the Middle
      East, he can take it into southern Central Asia and disrupt the BRICS and their
      connectivity plans in those stung areas — Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, all those areas.
      He can disrupt it and start moving the economic sphere into this. At the same
      time, that he’s doing, if you like, an attempt to cage China literally by tariffs
      structures. And also weakening Russia by reigniting the tensions in the Caucasus
      again. And so Russia and Putin are taking this very seriously. And so is China.
      And they are very angry about this. They’re angry about the deceit because Putin
      thinks he was deceived by those attacks on the strategic bombers just the day
      before the Istanbul talks just as Iran is. And China believes also that Xi was
      cheated by Trump in the discussions that they had. So there’s a real sort of sense
      of preparing for a new and wider Cold War that is being pushed. I mean, Kazakhstan
      in the north that is, I was in Russia around about the time of the Crocus Hall,
      the concert hall that was burnt down. And they were Tajiks that had come down
      who were found to be responsible. And there was a big structure in Kazakhstan
      for recruiting people, Afghans and Tajiks and others and for infiltrating them
      into Russia or to Iran or whatever. And now we see that Azerbaijan is engaged
      in the same idea. Now the reports, I can’t verify them, but recently Russia arrested
      a number of Azeris-Russian citizens and that produced a dramatic response from
      Aliyev who arrested all the Sputnik journalists and many others in Azerbaijan
      and they roughed them up and they’ve charged them with espionage and other charges.
      Now there’s always been sort of criminal groups in Russia from Azerbaijan. They’re
      known as sort of a mafia there. But this is more serious, I believe, because it’s
      thinking the Russians may be suspected that these groups were also facilitating
      the infiltration of some of those pre-positioned units that were ready for the
      attack on the strategic bomber system in Russia, the Spider’s Web. And that also
      Azerbaijan was facilitating the attack on Iran. So Azerbaijan and Armenia too
      and the question of Turkey’s role. The United States is trying to woo [Recep Tayyip]
      Erdoğan with promises of F-35s, if only he’ll mothball the S-400s that he has
      and I think that the aim is, the Israeli aim is the key to their, if you like,
      their new corridor, the new, if you like, Abraham Accord 2.0, a business plan
      right through to Asia, is that Turkey should persuade both Syria and Lebanon that
      they have no choice and incentivize them both to join into this new sort of greater
      Israel project. So this is why there’s a lot of tensions that all these proposals
      that are coming out of America at the moment, the intent to sort of cut off China
      from trade by putting differential tariffs on China if they trans ship goods through
      Vietnam or another country. The prospect of new sanctions on Russia. The attack
      on Iran is a pivot, a key pivot for Russia and China of the whole BRICS structure.
      All of these things are producing a really strong response from Russia. I mean,
      it’s given very tough response to Trump and this and says, we know exactly what
      you’re doing in the Caucasus. We know what you are doing in Azerbaijan and we
      won’t put up with it. And so Russia responded to this by destroying the two refineries
      in Ukraine that were fueled from Baku, from Azerbaijan. There was Azerbaijan input
      that was fueling these two refineries. This was a warning to Azerbaijan, you know,
      stop playing around with this. So Iran will be saying something rather similar,
      I suspect, to the Azeris. Now, I think some people in the United States think,
      even dream, of the idea that Azerbaijan could invade at the right moment in coordination
      with Israel into Iran as the Baluch perhaps come from another side or the Kurds
      from the other. But I think that is very far-fetched because 85% of the areas
      are Shiʿi. There is, if you like, the leadership is Turkic more than Iranian Shiʿi
      but they’re Turkic, either Sunni or Shiʿi converted. Anyway, it’s very secular.
      And the Iranians, all the Azeris in Iran are very, very loyal to Iran. And people
      talk about, well, the Azeri’s glass ceiling. And I slightly laugh at that. And
      I say, well, there’s one person you probably have heard of who’s really well-known
      poet and he writes in the Azeri language and he’s fluent in the Azeri language
      and he is Azeri and that’s the Supreme Leader. So it’s not that the Azeris are
      completely sort of outliers in Iran. Chris Hedges Didn’t Israel launch drones
      from there? Isn’t that a launch point for… Alastair Crooke Yeah, exactly. They
      launched drones and also, as I say, the airspace of Azerbaijan was used for standoff
      firing of drones that had these new cruise missiles, multiple cruise missiles.
      They could launch them once they were in Iranian territory. Chris Hedges I have
      two last questions, but just on Gaza, because in the meeting in the White House,
      when reporters were allowed in, Trump and Netanyahu were talking about depopulating
      Gaza. Netanyahu very cynically said it’s not a prison. People who want to leave,
      of course, there’s enforced starvation since March 2nd, should have the right
      to leave. Just your thoughts on what’s happening in Gaza. Alastair Crooke What’s
      happening in Gaza is that Netanyahu and the right are intent on first of all pushing
      all the Palestinians into what amounts to a concentration camp in one small part.
      They will be put in but they will not be allowed out of it. And it is a stage
      towards, it’s politely called voluntary expatriation but it is of course mandatory,
      if you like, removal of the population from Gaza. And the same is going on in
      the West Bank. Huge process. [Bezalel] Smotrich is in charge of this aspect. And
      there is a real effort being made because they think they believe they can persuade
      Trump to annex most of the West Bank. But settlers have moved into large areas.
      New settlements are announced all the time. The annexation is afoot in the West
      Bank as in Gaza. I think I remember Smotrich was always very, very clear about
      this. I remember listening to him about six years ago or so and he said, listen,
      this is our plan, to remove all the Palestinians from the area. And he said, but
      you know, as it is with the legal system, it’s difficult. What we need is a big
      crisis or a big war. And when that happens, we will complete the project. That’s
      what we’re looking for. And that’s why they’re always sort of playing around with
      the Temple Mount, Al-Aqsa. Looking to use that perhaps as the pretext to sort
      of trigger a commotion in the whole Muslim world. Al-Aqsa is a neuralgic point
      in the Muslim world, that they could use this as the ability to sort of create
      the crisis that they could then, under the pretext of an emergency, really move,
      finish off the depopulation of Gaza and also much of the West Bank, drive the
      West Bank to Jordan. Chris Hedges Does that mean they would drive the Palestinians
      and try to drive them into Jordan and they would drive the Palestinians in Gaza
      into Egypt? The Egyptians and the Jordanians have been adamant that’s not going
      to happen. Alastair Crooke Yes, but I mean they are pushing them closer and closer
      to the Rafah Gate. And, you know, what’s going to happen if they open those gates
      and just push them out, tou know, a million or so Palestinians? It’s very, very
      sensitive in Egypt. The Egyptians are really, ordinary Egyptians, the Egyptian
      army is very angry with [Abdel Fattah El-]Sisi about his ineffectual response
      to what’s happening in Gaza. It could explode. The whole Egyptian element could
      explode in this process. Of course there will be some sort of public relations
      exercise of sending a few Palestinians to, I don’t know where, but somewhere to
      say, no they went voluntarily. But of course that’s not what’s planned. What’s
      planned is another Nakba from Gaza. And it’s unfolding, sadly, unfortunately.
      You know, Hamas demands are not met by this proposal. This is why I don’t, I think
      what we will get is probably some sort of ceasefire. But it’s a ceasefire designed
      to allow the Israelis to resume the attrition of Gaza either because they’ll claim
      it will break down or because they’ll claim the 60 days are over. And the Hamas
      position remains unchanged — we want an end to the war. We want the removal of
      all of the Israeli troops from Gaza and a reconstruction of the strip. And of
      course, the Witkoff proposal does none of those things. It doesn’t provide for
      an end of the war. There will still be Israeli forces inside Gaza during the ceasefire
      and after. And the proposals for reconstructing it is quite different to be done
      by pliant Arab states. Chris Hedges And we should just draw that parallel between
      decapitating Hamas. I knew Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, one of the co-founders of Hamas,
      assassinated with his son in 2004, a long litany of Hamas leaders who were killed.
      And of course, it disrupts the organization without question. But just because
      Israel has decapitated Iranian leadership, ultimately, I mean I’ll get your feed
      on this, it ultimately doesn’t disrupt the system. Alastair Crooke I think that’s
      exactly what we saw in Iran. I mean, that actually, as so often has happened,
      Israel decapitates the moderates and the younger generation that come in are much
      more hardline than, you know, their other elderly. I mean, some of the IRGC are
      veterans from the Iran-Iraq War and, you know, the younger are much more vigorous
      and much more determined than the older ones and that’s what’s happened. And I
      think what we’ve seen is the other part of this great equation that was supposed
      to come out of Washington. Hezbollah have said categorically they will not accept
      any process that leads to their disarmament. Now this may end up in civil war
      in Lebanon, it could do what the Americans are pushing very, very hard in every
      way to disenfranchise, depoliticize, demilitarize the Shia who are the majority
      in Lebanon and it won’t happen. I mean they’ve been down that route in the past
      as you know and it’s not likely to happen. Chris Hedges Let’s just close with
      the next Israeli strike, which you talked about how Israel views ceasefires. This
      is writ large in Gaza, where Israel violates every single ceasefire they make
      to “mow the lawn.” That same kind of mentality will most likely be used to again
      make strikes against Iran if in Israeli eyes they feel they are reconstituting
      military defenses or a nuclear program. What do you, how do you picture that strike
      and the consequences? The next one. Alastair Crooke I think the first thing which
      is really important to say is that, and we follow the Israeli press very very
      closely, the Hebrew press, I mean not just the English language press. It’s very
      clear that they know now after what has happened, I mean they sustained much more
      damage than they had expected, that they cannot attack Iran without full unstinting
      American support. Now the question is, is that going to be forthcoming? And I
      think one of the things that I feel might stop it is the question of the MAGA.
      I think the MAGA are really quite unhappy. You know, there were two issues in
      the American election, immigration and forever wars. And MAGA came and also there
      is a quite a number of Democrats, young Democratic voters who supported Trump
      mainly because he promised peace and no more war. Not necessarily for the other
      part, but certainly for that. They are starting to filter away. And it’s also
      in the MAGA. You’ve seen, I mean, Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and everyone
      who, there’s a big pushback against it. They have, Trump has a majority, I think
      you can correct me if I’m wrong, about three in both houses, in the Senate and
      the House. It’s small. And midterms are just over a year away. So I think he is
      going to be worried about the internal position, the MAGA position and that. And
      that was obvious almost when Hexeth came in, spoke, and he said, he went on, you
      may remember it, he made a statement, I think, on Fox News saying, look, we’re
      not attacking Iran per se or the Iranian people, we’re just attacking the nuclear
      program. I think, you know, we’re not wanting to have a war with Iran, we’re just
      trying to, you know, sort this part out. So I think he will because, you know,
      with only three, it would be quite feasible if he gets stuck and locked into a
      long… bloody conflict in Iran and it would be because Iran’s got surprises for
      the United States and for Israel if it moves to another phase everyone is preparing
      for another phase. If it does that you know he may find that you know at the end
      of it I mean it would be a very different world. I mean one can’t even rule out
      if there is a change at the midterm elections you know impeachment and things
      might come back. on to the agenda. You know more about that than I, but it’s a
      generous moment and I think he’s right to be concerned about it because it’s from
      both ends of his, it’s the young and it is the MAGA who are both, you know, don’t
      want a war, a big war in the Middle East particularly. Chris Hedges Great, thanks.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, host Chris Hedges
      interviews former British diplomat Alastair Crooke about the escalating tensions
      in the Middle East following Israeli and American attacks on Iran, which raised
      fears of a potential World War III. After a 12-day conflict, a ceasefire has introduced
      new uncertainties regarding the future of the region. Crooke discusses the factors
      leading to the Israeli strikes, including advanced technology and support from
      neighboring countries, as well as the implications of American military involvement
      under Donald Trump's administration. Both Hedges and Crooke emphasize that the
      conflict is ongoing and that the future stability of the Middle East and the global
      economy is contingent on the actions of Israel, Iran, and the United States in
      the coming weeks and months. Hedges also appeals for support to sustain independent
      journalism amidst increasing censorship pressures.

      negotiations in Doha are focusing on the potential of a 60-day ceasefire, during
      which the two sides are supposed to negotiate a long-term deal. Hamas is looking
      for a stronger guarantee from the US that it is committed to turning the temporary
      truce into a permanent one. There are conflicting reports on the progress in the
      ceasefire negotiations. Some have said the issues over aid deliveries have been
      resolved and that the main impasse is now over Israel’s demand to maintain control
      of the “Morag Corridor,” a strip of land between the southern Gaza cities of Rafah
      and Khan Younis, while other reports say there has been no progress at all. A
      Palestinian official told the Saudi Asharq News outlet that negotiations are “at
      a standstill” because the Israeli negotiating team is “limiting itself to listening
      rather than negotiating” and consulting on “every issue” with officials back in
      Israel. The official charged that the lack of authority for the negotiating team
      was “a continuation of the stalling policy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      to obstruct any potential agreement.” Drop Site News reporter Jeremy Scahill said
      in a post on X that a Hamas official told him that claims from US officials that
      there was progress are part of a “deception game,” likely so the US and Israel
      can blame Hamas for the lack of a deal. The official also mentioned Israel’s demands
      about the Morag Corridor and its plans to build a camp to concentrate Gaza’s civilian
      population on the ruins of Rafah, which Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced
      on Monday. “This is a fluid situation and developments can happen at any moment
      as the talks continue and with Netanyahu in DC,” Scahill said. “The bottom line
      will be what Trump wants and all parties know this.” While Trump says he wants
      a deal, it remains unclear if he’s willing to put enough pressure on Netanyahu
      to reach one. US military aid is required for Israel to sustain its military operations
      and continue its genocidal war on the Palestinians of Gaza, meaning Trump has
      significant leverage. Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court
      (ICC) for war crimes in Gaza, met with other US officials on Tuesday, including

      Polychroniou / Truthout Arecent study published by Ecological Economics reveals
      that the petrochemical industry, well known for creating pollution and health
      risks to predominantly poor and Black communities near its plants, also perpetuates
      stark racial disparities across its workforce, reflecting what can only be described
      as institutional racism. In the exclusive interview for Truthout , one of the
      co-authors of the study, University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Michael
      Ash talks about what goes on in the employment practices of the petrochemical
      industry. The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
      C.J. Polychroniou : The petrochemical industry creates huge amounts of pollution
      and is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Many petrochemical plants
      are also located on former slave plantation lands, such as those along the Mississippi
      River. These petrochemical plants affect predominantly Black, Brown, Indigenous,
      and poor communities as they are exposed to high risks of cancer and respiratory
      ailments from the pollutants emitted by these facilities. However, a growing body
      of literature also reveals sharp racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce.
      A recent study you co-authored supports such findings. Can you talk about these
      racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce? How pervasive are they, and
      are they confined to certain geographical locations, or is it a widespread phenomenon
      across the United States? Michael Ash : First, I really can’t discuss this study
      without reference to the struggle for academic freedom that our study has engendered
      for the lead author, Kimberly Terrell. Until June 11, Terrell was a research scientist
      and director of community engagement at the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at
      Tulane University. Our study discusses disparities in employment and access to
      high-quality jobs in the petrochemical industry in Louisiana and elsewhere; and
      the governor of Louisiana made it clear to the administration of Tulane University
      that this type of research, no matter how objective and scientific, would not
      be tolerated. The Tulane administration, to its grave discredit, bent to this
      pressure and attempted to gag Terrell’s communication with the public and with
      the media and to impede her scientific research on economic and environmental
      disparities. With the survival of the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at stake,
      Terrell chose to resign and will carry on her research under other auspices. The
      makeup of the petrochemical workforce is tightly bound with the political influence
      and pollution effluents of the petrochemical industry. Petrochemical employment
      is concentrated in the U.S., a product of both geographic and technological imperatives
      and industrial planning. Petrochemical jobs have historically been good jobs in
      the sense of offering a pay premium above similar work in other industries — made
      possible by capital-intensive production, monopoly profits, and an organized workforce.
      The employment disparities in petrochemical employment are widespread in the U.S.,
      but they are especially notable in Louisiana because the African American share
      of the workforce is so high; the environmental risks and harms disproportionately
      imposed on African Americans are so great; and the representation of African Americans
      in jobs in the petrochemical industry, especially in good jobs, is so poor. An
      account from my friend and colleague Jim Boyce illustrates the disconnect between
      who suffers environmental harms and who benefits from employment. When visiting
      African American frontline communities in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” along the
      Mississippi River, Jim asked, “Well, the chemical plants and refineries and paper
      mills obviously bring pollution, but don’t they also bring at least some good
      jobs? The reply came: ‘No, none of us work there. It’s all white guys who come
      in their pickup trucks from Baton Rouge.’” I should state explicitly that even
      access to good jobs cannot objectively make up for exposure to environmental harm.
      Environmental harm and risks and access to decent employment are non-commensurate
      costs and benefits. Indeed, everyone should and can have the right to both a clean,
      healthy, and safe environment and to a decent livelihood. But if there are no
      jobs — environment tradeoffs, even on their own impoverished and dehumanizing
      terms — then the environmental and economic injustice is especially stark. That’s
      what my work with Boyce showed on a national basis in our 2018 paper , and what
      Terrell, Gianna St. Julien, and I find in more detail in our 2025 study on Louisiana.
      What draws petrochemical industries to Louisiana and its so-called “Cancer Alley?”
      “Cancer Alley,” the stretch of the Mississippi River beginning near Baton Rouge,
      Louisiana, and running to the Gulf, is home to a planned and cultivated petrochemical
      industry. Some petrochemical hubs emerge because of proximity to mines or wells,
      and of course, Louisiana and offshore activity in the Gulf are sources. But the
      petrochemical industry along that stretch of the Mississippi began with planning
      — Standard Oil Company (ancestor of today’s ExxonMobil) initiated its Baton Rouge
      refining plans around 1910 — and flourished with state initiatives. The location
      fit into both John D. Rockefeller’s aim for mid-country, river-accessible petroleum
      processing and the new oil and gas discoveries along the Gulf Coast. Over the
      course of the 20th century, and especially in the decades after World War II,
      the petrochemical industry cemented its relationships with public leadership in
      Louisiana, garnering large public subsidies and tax exemptions. Many of the area’s
      petrochemical facilities are literally built on the sites of former plantations.
      So the coalescence of newer petroleum interests with the existing racist governance
      system enabled the development of new structures for the profitable exploitation
      of communities of color. In addition to exploring the employment gaps, we also
      document the very large subsidies and tax exemptions for petrochemicals and how
      these industries contribute little to total employment, and essentially nothing
      to fair employment in Louisiana. Some have suggested that the racial disparities
      encountered in the petrochemical industry can be at least partly attributed to
      the racial education gap. Is there any validity behind this claim? There’s an
      overwhelming urge, encouraged by the media and employers, to make gross inequities
      seem fair or deserved. Under this logic, racial gaps in employment or in access
      to good jobs are attributed to racial gaps in education. The truth about racial
      disparities in employment in the petrochemical industry (and in many other industries)
      is part of several longstanding employers’ strategies: (1) divide-and-conquer
      with segmented and segregated work; and (2) blame workers for the bad deal that
      workers get. These petrochemical jobs are skilled jobs, and while formal education
      provides some of the needed skills, skills learned in training programs or on
      the job are very important. That’s what makes equitable access to the jobs central.
      Without that, there’s simply a vicious cycle of no skills, no job; and no job,
      no skills. As a formal matter, we used statistical methods to control for educational
      differences in the available workforce, and we still find large disparities in
      employment, especially in the better jobs in the industry. So even on the terms
      of the industry’s apologists, education does not explain the racial employment
      gap. Petrochemical job disparities are outsized compared to the racial education
      gap. But the bigger point is that these exclusions are structural and self-sustaining
      unless there is a concerted public intervention. Education is wonderful; it makes
      workers more productive and opens the way to innovation. But if the institutions
      for sharing the gains from education aren’t set up correctly, then employers,
      instead of workers, can pocket the lion’s share of the benefits. So I want to
      dispel the notion that the racial disparity in employment and access to good jobs
      is zero-sum (what’s lost by Black workers is gained by white workers). White workers,
      too, get a worse deal than they would in a racially fair system because the racially
      unfair system stacks the deck against all workers, white and Black. If the racial
      disparities already discussed reflect institutional racism, how does the law address
      this problem? The petrochemical industry in Louisiana is regularly given a host
      of advantages by the public in Louisiana, including outright subsidies and exemptions
      from taxation, especially the local property tax. These are outright giveaways,
      with minimal payback in terms of employment and especially little benefit in terms
      of opportunities for excluded communities. The job numbers and new plant announcements
      are from companies’ reports of how they have used the public subsidies. But it’s
      easy to announce job numbers in the media, and the companies now receive their
      tax exemptions essentially without any actual demonstration of job creation or
      retention. The petrochemical industry is increasingly automated; so even these
      not-very-impressive announced job numbers may not reflect real or long-term opportunities.
      At a minimum, Louisiana could strike a better deal for itself in terms of requiring
      demonstrable benefits in terms of training and access in exchange for this large
      annual outlay. What role do the trade unions themselves play in people of color
      being underrepresented in high-paying jobs in the petrochemical industry? I mean,
      they must be aware of these racial disparities, so are they also not responsible
      for allowing this unfair state of affairs to continue? Trade unions are painfully
      aware of the divide-and-conquer tactics that employers use. The former Oil, Chemical,
      and Atomic Workers (OCAW) union, which eventually merged into the paper workers
      union and subsequently into the United Steel Workers, had a decent foothold in
      the Baton Rouge petrochemical industry. OCAW was the first union to put worker
      and community health, safety, and protection from pollution at the forefront of
      labor campaigns. OCAW, especially under the leadership of Tony Mazzocchi, always
      pushed hard for racial equity because they recognized that the working class was
      ultimately in it together. Indeed, the term “Cancer Alley” itself originated from
      a billboard that OCAW put up when cooperating with environmental groups in the
      1980s. Employers, on the other hand, are effective practitioners of divide-and-conquer
      and also operate with the knowledge that African Americans are, on average, more
      favorably disposed toward unions. What are the remedies for institutional racism
      in the petrochemical industry? A much closer and more detailed look is possible
      for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC. We used the best publicly
      available EEOC data for our study. The EEOC can take a deeper dive and examine
      exactly which companies are hiring into which occupations. With mandated environmental
      reporting, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory,
      the public has the right to know what chemicals companies are releasing into the
      environment. With additional modeling, we can learn, for example, that around
      80 percent of the potential chronic human health risk from the ExxonMobil facilities
      in Baton Rouge fall on people of color and nearly 30 percent on poor households
      — both of these are far out of line with the national and Louisiana shares of
      the population. But we do not know what ExxonMobil’s allocation of jobs, and especially
      of good jobs, is from the facilities. When I say, “we do not know,” I mean the
      general public; the EEOC collects this data from the ExxonMobil facilities. In
      the short run, there is nothing stopping companies from releasing their own EEOC
      reporting on how many and which jobs are represented, and which workers, in terms
      of sex and race or ethnicity, hold these jobs. In the longer run, we should have
      employment and job-quality transparency so that we can assess employment justice
      for industries as effectively as we can assess environmental justice. The tools
      for environmental justice assessment were the product of a long, determined campaign
      for transparency and the right to know. At the very least, we should have that
      kind of transparency for employment opportunities. Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      negotiations in Doha are focusing on the potential of a 60-day ceasefire, during
      which the two sides are supposed to negotiate a long-term deal. Hamas is looking
      for a stronger guarantee from the US that it is committed to turning the temporary
      truce into a permanent one. There are conflicting reports on the progress in the
      ceasefire negotiations. Some have said the issues over aid deliveries have been
      resolved and that the main impasse is now over Israel’s demand to maintain control
      of the “Morag Corridor,” a strip of land between the southern Gaza cities of Rafah
      and Khan Younis, while other reports say there has been no progress at all. A
      Palestinian official told the Saudi Asharq News outlet that negotiations are “at
      a standstill” because the Israeli negotiating team is “limiting itself to listening
      rather than negotiating” and consulting on “every issue” with officials back in
      Israel. The official charged that the lack of authority for the negotiating team
      was “a continuation of the stalling policy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      to obstruct any potential agreement.” Drop Site News reporter Jeremy Scahill said
      in a post on X that a Hamas official told him that claims from US officials that
      there was progress are part of a “deception game,” likely so the US and Israel
      can blame Hamas for the lack of a deal. The official also mentioned Israel’s demands
      about the Morag Corridor and its plans to build a camp to concentrate Gaza’s civilian
      population on the ruins of Rafah, which Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced
      on Monday. “This is a fluid situation and developments can happen at any moment
      as the talks continue and with Netanyahu in DC,” Scahill said. “The bottom line
      will be what Trump wants and all parties know this.” While Trump says he wants
      a deal, it remains unclear if he’s willing to put enough pressure on Netanyahu
      to reach one. US military aid is required for Israel to sustain its military operations
      and continue its genocidal war on the Palestinians of Gaza, meaning Trump has
      significant leverage. Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court
      (ICC) for war crimes in Gaza, met with other US officials on Tuesday, including
      House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA). Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

      Polychroniou / Truthout Arecent study published by Ecological Economics reveals
      that the petrochemical industry, well known for creating pollution and health
      risks to predominantly poor and Black communities near its plants, also perpetuates
      stark racial disparities across its workforce, reflecting what can only be described
      as institutional racism. In the exclusive interview for Truthout , one of the
      co-authors of the study, University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Michael
      Ash talks about what goes on in the employment practices of the petrochemical
      industry. The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
      C.J. Polychroniou : The petrochemical industry creates huge amounts of pollution
      and is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Many petrochemical plants
      are also located on former slave plantation lands, such as those along the Mississippi
      River. These petrochemical plants affect predominantly Black, Brown, Indigenous,
      and poor communities as they are exposed to high risks of cancer and respiratory
      ailments from the pollutants emitted by these facilities. However, a growing body
      of literature also reveals sharp racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce.
      A recent study you co-authored supports such findings. Can you talk about these
      racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce? How pervasive are they, and
      are they confined to certain geographical locations, or is it a widespread phenomenon
      across the United States? Michael Ash : First, I really can’t discuss this study
      without reference to the struggle for academic freedom that our study has engendered
      for the lead author, Kimberly Terrell. Until June 11, Terrell was a research scientist
      and director of community engagement at the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at
      Tulane University. Our study discusses disparities in employment and access to
      high-quality jobs in the petrochemical industry in Louisiana and elsewhere; and
      the governor of Louisiana made it clear to the administration of Tulane University
      that this type of research, no matter how objective and scientific, would not
      be tolerated. The Tulane administration, to its grave discredit, bent to this
      pressure and attempted to gag Terrell’s communication with the public and with
      the media and to impede her scientific research on economic and environmental
      disparities. With the survival of the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at stake,
      Terrell chose to resign and will carry on her research under other auspices. The
      makeup of the petrochemical workforce is tightly bound with the political influence
      and pollution effluents of the petrochemical industry. Petrochemical employment
      is concentrated in the U.S., a product of both geographic and technological imperatives
      and industrial planning. Petrochemical jobs have historically been good jobs in
      the sense of offering a pay premium above similar work in other industries — made
      possible by capital-intensive production, monopoly profits, and an organized workforce.
      The employment disparities in petrochemical employment are widespread in the U.S.,
      but they are especially notable in Louisiana because the African American share
      of the workforce is so high; the environmental risks and harms disproportionately
      imposed on African Americans are so great; and the representation of African Americans
      in jobs in the petrochemical industry, especially in good jobs, is so poor. An
      account from my friend and colleague Jim Boyce illustrates the disconnect between
      who suffers environmental harms and who benefits from employment. When visiting
      African American frontline communities in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” along the
      Mississippi River, Jim asked, “Well, the chemical plants and refineries and paper
      mills obviously bring pollution, but don’t they also bring at least some good
      jobs? The reply came: ‘No, none of us work there. It’s all white guys who come
      in their pickup trucks from Baton Rouge.’” I should state explicitly that even
      access to good jobs cannot objectively make up for exposure to environmental harm.
      Environmental harm and risks and access to decent employment are non-commensurate
      costs and benefits. Indeed, everyone should and can have the right to both a clean,
      healthy, and safe environment and to a decent livelihood. But if there are no
      jobs — environment tradeoffs, even on their own impoverished and dehumanizing
      terms — then the environmental and economic injustice is especially stark. That’s
      what my work with Boyce showed on a national basis in our 2018 paper , and what
      Terrell, Gianna St. Julien, and I find in more detail in our 2025 study on Louisiana.
      What draws petrochemical industries to Louisiana and its so-called “Cancer Alley?”
      “Cancer Alley,” the stretch of the Mississippi River beginning near Baton Rouge,
      Louisiana, and running to the Gulf, is home to a planned and cultivated petrochemical
      industry. Some petrochemical hubs emerge because of proximity to mines or wells,
      and of course, Louisiana and offshore activity in the Gulf are sources. But the
      petrochemical industry along that stretch of the Mississippi began with planning
      — Standard Oil Company (ancestor of today’s ExxonMobil) initiated its Baton Rouge
      refining plans around 1910 — and flourished with state initiatives. The location
      fit into both John D. Rockefeller’s aim for mid-country, river-accessible petroleum
      processing and the new oil and gas discoveries along the Gulf Coast. Over the
      course of the 20th century, and especially in the decades after World War II,
      the petrochemical industry cemented its relationships with public leadership in
      Louisiana, garnering large public subsidies and tax exemptions. Many of the area’s
      petrochemical facilities are literally built on the sites of former plantations.
      So the coalescence of newer petroleum interests with the existing racist governance
      system enabled the development of new structures for the profitable exploitation
      of communities of color. In addition to exploring the employment gaps, we also
      document the very large subsidies and tax exemptions for petrochemicals and how
      these industries contribute little to total employment, and essentially nothing
      to fair employment in Louisiana. Some have suggested that the racial disparities
      encountered in the petrochemical industry can be at least partly attributed to
      the racial education gap. Is there any validity behind this claim? There’s an
      overwhelming urge, encouraged by the media and employers, to make gross inequities
      seem fair or deserved. Under this logic, racial gaps in employment or in access
      to good jobs are attributed to racial gaps in education. The truth about racial
      disparities in employment in the petrochemical industry (and in many other industries)
      is part of several longstanding employers’ strategies: (1) divide-and-conquer
      with segmented and segregated work; and (2) blame workers for the bad deal that
      workers get. These petrochemical jobs are skilled jobs, and while formal education
      provides some of the needed skills, skills learned in training programs or on
      the job are very important. That’s what makes equitable access to the jobs central.
      Without that, there’s simply a vicious cycle of no skills, no job; and no job,
      no skills. As a formal matter, we used statistical methods to control for educational
      differences in the available workforce, and we still find large disparities in
      employment, especially in the better jobs in the industry. So even on the terms
      of the industry’s apologists, education does not explain the racial employment
      gap. Petrochemical job disparities are outsized compared to the racial education
      gap. But the bigger point is that these exclusions are structural and self-sustaining
      unless there is a concerted public intervention. Education is wonderful; it makes
      workers more productive and opens the way to innovation. But if the institutions
      for sharing the gains from education aren’t set up correctly, then employers,
      instead of workers, can pocket the lion’s share of the benefits. So I want to
      dispel the notion that the racial disparity in employment and access to good jobs
      is zero-sum (what’s lost by Black workers is gained by white workers). White workers,
      too, get a worse deal than they would in a racially fair system because the racially
      unfair system stacks the deck against all workers, white and Black. If the racial
      disparities already discussed reflect institutional racism, how does the law address
      this problem? The petrochemical industry in Louisiana is regularly given a host
      of advantages by the public in Louisiana, including outright subsidies and exemptions
      from taxation, especially the local property tax. These are outright giveaways,
      with minimal payback in terms of employment and especially little benefit in terms
      of opportunities for excluded communities. The job numbers and new plant announcements
      are from companies’ reports of how they have used the public subsidies. But it’s
      easy to announce job numbers in the media, and the companies now receive their
      tax exemptions essentially without any actual demonstration of job creation or
      retention. The petrochemical industry is increasingly automated; so even these
      not-very-impressive announced job numbers may not reflect real or long-term opportunities.
      At a minimum, Louisiana could strike a better deal for itself in terms of requiring
      demonstrable benefits in terms of training and access in exchange for this large
      annual outlay. What role do the trade unions themselves play in people of color
      being underrepresented in high-paying jobs in the petrochemical industry? I mean,
      they must be aware of these racial disparities, so are they also not responsible
      for allowing this unfair state of affairs to continue? Trade unions are painfully
      aware of the divide-and-conquer tactics that employers use. The former Oil, Chemical,
      and Atomic Workers (OCAW) union, which eventually merged into the paper workers
      union and subsequently into the United Steel Workers, had a decent foothold in
      the Baton Rouge petrochemical industry. OCAW was the first union to put worker
      and community health, safety, and protection from pollution at the forefront of
      labor campaigns. OCAW, especially under the leadership of Tony Mazzocchi, always
      pushed hard for racial equity because they recognized that the working class was
      ultimately in it together. Indeed, the term “Cancer Alley” itself originated from
      a billboard that OCAW put up when cooperating with environmental groups in the
      1980s. Employers, on the other hand, are effective practitioners of divide-and-conquer
      and also operate with the knowledge that African Americans are, on average, more
      favorably disposed toward unions. What are the remedies for institutional racism
      in the petrochemical industry? A much closer and more detailed look is possible
      for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC. We used the best publicly
      available EEOC data for our study. The EEOC can take a deeper dive and examine
      exactly which companies are hiring into which occupations. With mandated environmental
      reporting, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory,
      the public has the right to know what chemicals companies are releasing into the
      environment. With additional modeling, we can learn, for example, that around
      80 percent of the potential chronic human health risk from the ExxonMobil facilities
      in Baton Rouge fall on people of color and nearly 30 percent on poor households
      — both of these are far out of line with the national and Louisiana shares of
      the population. But we do not know what ExxonMobil’s allocation of jobs, and especially
      of good jobs, is from the facilities. When I say, “we do not know,” I mean the
      general public; the EEOC collects this data from the ExxonMobil facilities. In
      the short run, there is nothing stopping companies from releasing their own EEOC
      reporting on how many and which jobs are represented, and which workers, in terms
      of sex and race or ethnicity, hold these jobs. In the longer run, we should have
      employment and job-quality transparency so that we can assess employment justice
      for industries as effectively as we can assess environmental justice. The tools
      for environmental justice assessment were the product of a long, determined campaign
      for transparency and the right to know. At the very least, we should have that
      kind of transparency for employment opportunities. Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      donation . By Abrahm Lustgarten / ProPublica On July 4, the broken remnants of
      a powerful tropical storm spun off the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico so heavy
      with moisture that it seemed to stagger under its load. Then, colliding with another
      soggy system sliding north off the Pacific, the storm wobbled and its clouds tipped,
      waterboarding south central Texas with an extraordinary 20 inches of rain. In
      the predawn blackness, the Guadalupe River, which drains from the Hill Country,
      rose by more than 26 vertical feet in just 45 minutes, jumping its banks and hurtling
      downstream, killing 109 people, including at least 27 children at a summer camp
      located inside a federally designated floodway. Over the days and weeks to come
      there will be tireless — and warranted — analysis of who is to blame for this
      heart-wrenching loss. Should Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have
      installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children
      allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding? Why were urgent
      updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with
      limited connectivity? Did the National Weather Service, enduring steep budget
      cuts under the current administration, adequately forecast this storm? Those questions
      are critical. But so is a far larger concern: The rapid onset of disruptive climate
      change — driven by the burning of oil, gasoline and coal — is making disasters
      like this one more common, more deadly and far more costly to Americans, even
      as the federal government is running away from the policies and research that
      might begin to address it. President Lyndon B. Johnson was briefed in 1965 that
      a climate crisis was being caused by burning fossil fuels and was warned that
      it would create the conditions for intensifying storms and extreme events, and
      this country — including 10 more presidents — has debated how to respond to that
      warning ever since. Still, it took decades for the slow-motion change to grow
      large enough to affect people’s everyday lives and safety and for the world to
      reach the stage it is in now: an age of climate-driven chaos, where the past is
      no longer prologue and the specific challenges of the future might be foreseeable
      but are less predictable. Climate change doesn’t chart a linear path where each
      day is warmer than the last. Rather, science suggests that we’re now in an age
      of discontinuity, with heat one day and hail the next and with more dramatic extremes.
      Across the planet, dry places are getting drier while wet places are getting wetter.
      The jet stream — the band of air that circulates through the Northern Hemisphere
      — is slowing to a near stall at times, weaving off its tracks, causing unprecedented
      events like polar vortexes drawing arctic air far south. Meanwhile the heat is
      sucking moisture from the drought-plagued plains of Kansas only to dump it over
      Spain, contributing to last year’s cataclysmic floods. We saw something similar
      when Hurricane Harvey dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on parts of Texas in
      2017 and when Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina last year — and countless
      times in between. We witnessed it again in Texas this past weekend. Warmer oceans
      evaporate faster, and warmer air holds more water, transporting it in the form
      of humidity across the atmosphere, until it can’t hold it any longer and it falls.
      Meteorologists estimate that the atmosphere had reached its capacity for moisture
      before the storm struck. The disaster comes during a week in which extreme heat
      and extreme weather have battered the planet. Parts of northern Spain and southern
      France are burning out of control, as are parts of California. In the past 72
      hours, storms have torn the roofs off of five-story apartment buildings in Slovakia,
      while intense rainfall has turned streets into rivers in southern Italy. Same
      story in Lombok, Indonesia, where cars floated like buoys, and in eastern China,
      where an inland typhoon-like storm sent furniture blowing down the streets like
      so many sheafs of paper. Léon, Mexico, was battered by hail so thick on Monday
      it covered the city in white. And North Carolina is, again, enduring 10 inches
      of rainfall. There is no longer much debate that climate change is making many
      of these events demonstrably worse. Scientists conducting a rapid analysis of
      last week’s extreme heat wave that spread across Europe have concluded that human-caused
      warming killed roughly 1,500 more people than might have otherwise perished. Early
      reports suggest that the flooding in Texas, too, was substantially influenced
      by climate change. According to a preliminary analysis by ClimaMeter, a joint
      project of the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research,
      the weather in Texas was 7% wetter on July 4 than it was before climate change
      warmed that part of the state, and natural variability alone cannot explain “this
      very exceptional meteorological condition.” That the United States once again
      is reeling from familiar but alarming headlines and body counts should not be
      a surprise by now. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the number
      of extreme weather disasters has jumped fivefold worldwide over the past 50 years,
      and the number of deaths has nearly tripled. In the United States, which prefers
      to measure its losses in dollars, the damage from major storms was more than $180
      billion last year, nearly 10 times the average annual toll during the 1980s, after
      accounting for inflation. These storms have now cost Americans nearly $3 trillion.
      Meanwhile, the number of annual major disasters has grown sevenfold. Fatalities
      in billion-dollar storms last year alone were nearly equal to the number of such
      deaths counted by the federal government in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000.
      The most worrisome fact, though, may be that the warming of the planet has scarcely
      begun. Just as each step up on the Richter scale represents a massive increase
      in the force of an earthquake, the damage caused by the next 1 or 2 degrees Celsius
      of warming stands to be far greater than that caused by the 1.5 degrees we have
      so far endured. The world’s leading scientists, the United Nations panel on climate
      change and even many global energy experts warn that we face something akin to
      our last chance before it is too late to curtail a runaway crisis. It’s one reason
      our predictions and modeling capabilities are becoming an essential, lifesaving
      mechanism of national defense. What is extraordinary is that at such a volatile
      moment, President Donald Trump’s administration would choose not just to minimize
      the climate danger — and thus the suffering of the people affected by it — but
      to revoke funding for the very data collection and research that would help the
      country better understand and prepare for this moment. Over the past couple of
      months, the administration has defunded much of the operations of the National
      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the nation’s chief climate and scientific
      agency responsible for weather forecasting, as well as the cutting-edge earth
      systems research at places like Princeton University, which is essential to modeling
      an aberrant future. It has canceled the nation’s seminal scientific assessment
      of climate change and risk. The administration has defunded the Federal Emergency
      Management Agency’s core program paying for infrastructure projects meant to prevent
      major disasters from causing harm, and it has threatened to eliminate FEMA itself,
      the main federal agency charged with helping Americans after a climate emergency
      like the Texas floods. It has — as of last week — signed legislation that unravels
      the federal programs meant to slow warming by helping the country’s industries
      transition to cleaner energy. And it has even stopped the reporting of the cost
      of disasters, stating that doing so is “in alignment with evolving priorities”
      of the administration. It is as if the administration hopes that making the price
      tag for the Kerr County flooding invisible would make the events unfolding there
      seem less devastating. Given the abandonment of policy that might forestall more
      severe events like the Texas floods by reducing the emissions that cause them,
      Americans are left to the daunting task of adapting. In Texas, it is critical
      to ask whether the protocols in place at the time of the storm were good enough.
      This week is not the first time that children have died in a flash flood along
      the Guadalupe River, and reports suggest county officials struggled to raise money
      and then declined to install a warning system in 2018 in order to save approximately
      $1 million. But the country faces a larger and more daunting challenge, because
      this disaster — like the firestorms in Los Angeles and the hurricanes repeatedly
      pummeling Florida and the southeast — once again raises the question of where

    one_sentence_summary: A powerful tropical storm in Texas resulted in catastrophic
      flooding, causing the Guadalupe River to rise dramatically and leading to the
      deaths of 109 individuals, including 27 children at a summer camp.
    paragraph_summary: On July 4, a powerful tropical storm unleashed an unprecedented
      20 inches of rain on south central Texas, leading to catastrophic flooding that
      resulted in the deaths of 109 people, including 27 children at a summer camp situated
      in a designated flood zone. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, overwhelming
      its banks within 45 minutes. As communities grapple with the aftermath, critical
      questions arise regarding local preparedness, such as the lack of warning sirens
      and the decision to allow children to camp in a flood-prone area. Additionally,
      concerns are mounting over the National Weather Service's ability to forecast
      such events amid budget cuts. The article emphasizes that this tragedy is part
      of a broader trend linked to climate change, exacerbated by fossil fuel consumption,
      which is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters while the
      federal government retreats from necessary climate policies and research.

      donation . By Abrahm Lustgarten / ProPublica On July 4, the broken remnants of
      a powerful tropical storm spun off the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico so heavy
      with moisture that it seemed to stagger under its load. Then, colliding with another
      soggy system sliding north off the Pacific, the storm wobbled and its clouds tipped,
      waterboarding south central Texas with an extraordinary 20 inches of rain. In
      the predawn blackness, the Guadalupe River, which drains from the Hill Country,
      rose by more than 26 vertical feet in just 45 minutes, jumping its banks and hurtling
      downstream, killing 109 people, including at least 27 children at a summer camp
      located inside a federally designated floodway. Over the days and weeks to come
      there will be tireless — and warranted — analysis of who is to blame for this
      heart-wrenching loss. Should Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have
      installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children
      allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding? Why were urgent
      updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with
      limited connectivity? Did the National Weather Service, enduring steep budget
      cuts under the current administration, adequately forecast this storm? Those questions
      are critical. But so is a far larger concern: The rapid onset of disruptive climate
      change — driven by the burning of oil, gasoline and coal — is making disasters
      like this one more common, more deadly and far more costly to Americans, even
      as the federal government is running away from the policies and research that
      might begin to address it. President Lyndon B. Johnson was briefed in 1965 that
      a climate crisis was being caused by burning fossil fuels and was warned that
      it would create the conditions for intensifying storms and extreme events, and
      this country — including 10 more presidents — has debated how to respond to that
      warning ever since. Still, it took decades for the slow-motion change to grow
      large enough to affect people’s everyday lives and safety and for the world to
      reach the stage it is in now: an age of climate-driven chaos, where the past is
      no longer prologue and the specific challenges of the future might be foreseeable
      but are less predictable. Climate change doesn’t chart a linear path where each
      day is warmer than the last. Rather, science suggests that we’re now in an age
      of discontinuity, with heat one day and hail the next and with more dramatic extremes.
      Across the planet, dry places are getting drier while wet places are getting wetter.
      The jet stream — the band of air that circulates through the Northern Hemisphere
      — is slowing to a near stall at times, weaving off its tracks, causing unprecedented
      events like polar vortexes drawing arctic air far south. Meanwhile the heat is
      sucking moisture from the drought-plagued plains of Kansas only to dump it over
      Spain, contributing to last year’s cataclysmic floods. We saw something similar
      when Hurricane Harvey dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on parts of Texas in
      2017 and when Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina last year — and countless
      times in between. We witnessed it again in Texas this past weekend. Warmer oceans
      evaporate faster, and warmer air holds more water, transporting it in the form
      of humidity across the atmosphere, until it can’t hold it any longer and it falls.
      Meteorologists estimate that the atmosphere had reached its capacity for moisture
      before the storm struck. The disaster comes during a week in which extreme heat
      and extreme weather have battered the planet. Parts of northern Spain and southern
      France are burning out of control, as are parts of California. In the past 72
      hours, storms have torn the roofs off of five-story apartment buildings in Slovakia,
      while intense rainfall has turned streets into rivers in southern Italy. Same
      story in Lombok, Indonesia, where cars floated like buoys, and in eastern China,
      where an inland typhoon-like storm sent furniture blowing down the streets like
      so many sheafs of paper. Léon, Mexico, was battered by hail so thick on Monday
      it covered the city in white. And North Carolina is, again, enduring 10 inches
      of rainfall. There is no longer much debate that climate change is making many
      of these events demonstrably worse. Scientists conducting a rapid analysis of
      last week’s extreme heat wave that spread across Europe have concluded that human-caused
      warming killed roughly 1,500 more people than might have otherwise perished. Early
      reports suggest that the flooding in Texas, too, was substantially influenced
      by climate change. According to a preliminary analysis by ClimaMeter, a joint
      project of the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research,
      the weather in Texas was 7% wetter on July 4 than it was before climate change
      warmed that part of the state, and natural variability alone cannot explain “this
      very exceptional meteorological condition.” That the United States once again
      is reeling from familiar but alarming headlines and body counts should not be
      a surprise by now. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the number
      of extreme weather disasters has jumped fivefold worldwide over the past 50 years,
      and the number of deaths has nearly tripled. In the United States, which prefers
      to measure its losses in dollars, the damage from major storms was more than $180
      billion last year, nearly 10 times the average annual toll during the 1980s, after
      accounting for inflation. These storms have now cost Americans nearly $3 trillion.
      Meanwhile, the number of annual major disasters has grown sevenfold. Fatalities
      in billion-dollar storms last year alone were nearly equal to the number of such
      deaths counted by the federal government in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000.
      The most worrisome fact, though, may be that the warming of the planet has scarcely
      begun. Just as each step up on the Richter scale represents a massive increase
      in the force of an earthquake, the damage caused by the next 1 or 2 degrees Celsius
      of warming stands to be far greater than that caused by the 1.5 degrees we have
      so far endured. The world’s leading scientists, the United Nations panel on climate
      change and even many global energy experts warn that we face something akin to
      our last chance before it is too late to curtail a runaway crisis. It’s one reason
      our predictions and modeling capabilities are becoming an essential, lifesaving
      mechanism of national defense. What is extraordinary is that at such a volatile
      moment, President Donald Trump’s administration would choose not just to minimize
      the climate danger — and thus the suffering of the people affected by it — but
      to revoke funding for the very data collection and research that would help the
      country better understand and prepare for this moment. Over the past couple of
      months, the administration has defunded much of the operations of the National
      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the nation’s chief climate and scientific
      agency responsible for weather forecasting, as well as the cutting-edge earth
      systems research at places like Princeton University, which is essential to modeling
      an aberrant future. It has canceled the nation’s seminal scientific assessment
      of climate change and risk. The administration has defunded the Federal Emergency
      Management Agency’s core program paying for infrastructure projects meant to prevent
      major disasters from causing harm, and it has threatened to eliminate FEMA itself,
      the main federal agency charged with helping Americans after a climate emergency
      like the Texas floods. It has — as of last week — signed legislation that unravels
      the federal programs meant to slow warming by helping the country’s industries
      transition to cleaner energy. And it has even stopped the reporting of the cost
      of disasters, stating that doing so is “in alignment with evolving priorities”
      of the administration. It is as if the administration hopes that making the price
      tag for the Kerr County flooding invisible would make the events unfolding there
      seem less devastating. Given the abandonment of policy that might forestall more
      severe events like the Texas floods by reducing the emissions that cause them,
      Americans are left to the daunting task of adapting. In Texas, it is critical
      to ask whether the protocols in place at the time of the storm were good enough.
      This week is not the first time that children have died in a flash flood along
      the Guadalupe River, and reports suggest county officials struggled to raise money
      and then declined to install a warning system in 2018 in order to save approximately
      $1 million. But the country faces a larger and more daunting challenge, because
      this disaster — like the firestorms in Los Angeles and the hurricanes repeatedly
      pummeling Florida and the southeast — once again raises the question of where
      people can continue to safely live. It might be that in an era of what researchers
      are calling “mega rain” events, a flood plain should now be off-limits. Editor’s

      War kills in so many ways. These days, Americans are bombarded with images from
      Gaza and elsewhere of people or broken bodies being ferried on stretchers from
      the rubble of homes and hospitals, by rescue workers whose thin bodies and stricken
      faces suggest they are barely better off than those they’re helping. Social media
      and journalists make us eyewitnesses to emaciated children too weak to cry. And
      yet, compared with air raids that crush and bloody instantaneously, a slower disaster,
      more difficult to capture (especially given our made-for-TikTok attention spans),
      consists of the hours that many people in war zones spend wasting away from infectious
      diseases of one sort or another. Let me count a few of the ways. In Iraq in 2004,
      three-month-old Ali tries to cry but he’s too weak to make a sound, since his
      body has been ravaged by diarrhea. Between 2003 and 2007 , half of Iraq’s 18,000
      doctors left the country due to the deteriorating security situation (with few
      intending to return). Health facilities had also been bombed out and destroyed.
      By then, about two-thirds of the deaths of children under the age of five, like
      Ali, were due to respiratory infections and diarrhea compounded by malnutrition.
      In Pakistan in 2017, one of a handful of countries that has yet to eliminate the
      polio virus, the father of a five-year-old boy is inconsolable when he learns
      that his son will never walk on his own again. Among displaced people in the Afghan-Pakistani
      border region where they lived, concerns about counterinsurgency air raids from
      U.S. and later Pakistani government and opposition forces, security threats toward
      vaccination teams in conflict-torn parts of that country, and suspicions among
      parents like that boy’s father that health workers had been sent by the U.S. government
      to sterilize Pakistani children, all prevented kids from getting the immunizations
      that they needed. In Burkina Faso in 2019, three-year-old Abdoulaye dies after
      contracting malaria while in a shelter for people internally displaced by violence
      between government forces and Islamic militias. Malnourished and anemic, without
      direct access to a health clinic, he succumbs to a treatable illness. In Fayetteville,
      North Carolina, in 2020, as in other military towns across the U.S., rates of
      sexually transmitted infections like syphilis, herpes simplex, and HIV are among
      the highest in the country. Bases tend to drive up poverty among civilians by
      making the surrounding populations dependent on low-wage service work. And stressed-out,
      war-traumatized American soldiers are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior
      that spreads disease among the broader population. In Ukraine in 2023, a soldier
      treated for severe burns dies of sepsis, despite being given multiple antibiotics.
      Doctors found klebsiella, a multi-drug-resistant pathogen, in his body. Despite
      successful efforts by the Ukrainian government to curb antimicrobial resistance
      in its population prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion, mounting casualties, along
      with shortages of supplies and personnel, mean that Ukrainian health workers now
      try to do whatever they can to keep soldiers alive. In the long term, antibiotic-resistant
      infections traceable to Ukrainian patients are already beginning to appear in
      places as distant as Japan . In May 2025 in the Gaza strip, four-month-old Jenan
      dies from chronic diarrhea after losing half her bodyweight. She needed hypoallergenic
      milk formula, but aerial bombardments and blockades of basic food and medical
      supplies have made that once common product scarce. As anthropologist Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins
      points out, prior to the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October
      2023, cases of diarrhea in young children there averaged about 2,000 per month.
      In April of the following year, however, such cases already numbered more than
      100,000. Likewise, in the decade before the war, there were no large-scale epidemics
      in Gaza. In just the first seven months of that conflict, however, overcrowding
      in makeshift shelters, nutritional deficits, shortages of hygiene products — only
      one in every three Gazans has soap! — and contaminated water have led to new outbreaks
      of infectious diseases like measles, cholera, typhoid, and polio, exacerbated
      by widespread starvation. At some level, it couldn’t be simpler. War destroys
      all too many of the modern amenities that make life possible. Preventable illness
      and death occur even in industrialized settings that are marked by inequality,
      lack of information, psychological trauma, or just the chaos of combat that hinders
      long-term thinking. In poor- and middle-income countries like Yemen, Syria, and
      Nigeria, infectious diseases were already among the top causes of death, even
      before the outbreak of significant conflicts. Their incidence, however, grew so
      much worse in wartime, especially among civilians who didn’t have the same access
      to doctors and medical hospitals as armed groups. The body of a single child,
      wasting away from the lack of the basic fluid that runs in my sink or yours, best
      captures the way war casualties ripple across time and populations. For every
      soldier who dies in battle, exponentially more people suffer deaths from malnutrition,
      disease, or trauma-related violence even after battles end. Preventable infections
      play a large role in this story. The War on Children Children are particularly
      vulnerable to sickness and death in armed conflicts because of their immature
      immune systems, greater nutritional needs, tendency to succumb more easily to
      dehydration, and reliance on families who may not even be around to care for them.
      A study of more than 15,000 armed-conflict events in 35 African countries found
      that children aged 10 or younger were far more likely to die if they lived within
      100 kilometers of a battle zone than they would have in earlier periods of peacetime.
      Increases in mortality ranged from 3% to about 27%, varying with how many people
      also died in nearby battles. Strikingly, many more babies under the age of one
      died annually in the eight years following a conflict’s end than while the battles
      were going on — infectious disease being a primary killer. Take Yemen as an example
      of how war may affect young children and their families over time. Since the start
      of that country’s civil war in 2015, cholera, a waterborne illness doctors have
      known how to prevent since 1954, has ravaged the most vulnerable members of that
      country’s population, particularly children, due to a lack of appropriate sanitation
      or reasonable access to healthcare. As of December 2017, more than a million people
      had contracted the disease, nearly half of them children, and more than 2,000
      had died of the illness. Compare that to the more than 10,000 Yemenis estimated
      to have died in direct combat by that time, and you get an idea of how significantly
      death by illness counts among the casualties of war. Nearly a decade later, in
      fact, there are hundreds of thousands of new cases of that illness in Yemen each
      year and hundreds of annual deaths, making up more than a third of all cases globally.
      When Rami discovered that his daughters, aged 10 and 7, had cholera, he managed
      to scrape together the equivalent of about $15 to travel to a clinic so that the
      family could get lifesaving fluids and information to prevent further cases. Many
      families like his, however, can’t afford such treatment, forcing all too many
      of them to delay care or even experience the unthinkable: losing a child. Consider
      what it would do if someone you loved perished because they were born in the wrong
      place at the wrong time in the storm of war that destroys infrastructure so central
      to our lives that normally we barely even notice its presence. I hope it’s an
      experience that neither you nor I ever have. War and Displacement Still, I think
      about such things every day, as I bet do many of my colleagues connected to the
      Costs of War Project . When we first launched that project in 2011, Professors
      Catherine Lutz, Neta Crawford, and I met with experts in armed conflict to discuss
      how we would cover the issue of war’s health impacts. Repeatedly, they reminded
      us of how hard it is to talk about war and health without understanding what it’s
      like for families to be forced to leave their homes in search of safety. Unsurprisingly,
      refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) are uniquely vulnerable to disease
      and illness. Anyone who has gotten sick while traveling knows that the challenges
      of getting care are compounded by a lack of knowledge of the community you find
      yourself in. In the case of today’s more than 122 million war refugees or displaced
      people, stigma and harassment are frequent travel companions. According to one
      meta-analysis, more than one-fifth of refugee and IDP women have experienced some
      form of sexual violence while living in displacement settings. A study of more
      than 500 immigrants and refugees in Italy found that nearly half experienced physical
      violence, sexual abuse, harassment, or workplace discrimination. The stories that
      extremist politicians tell about migrants — think of Donald Trump’s tall tale
      of supposedly dog- and cat-eating Haitians in Springfield, Ohio — distract us
      from the social problems such politicians seem unwilling to deal with like loneliness
      and poverty. Displaced persons lack political clout and voting power in places
      that host them and, in actual war zones, fighters rarely respect shelters and
      camps designated for their survival. For people who flee their homes, the basic
      boring stuff is lacking, too. Only 35% of refugees have clean drinking water where
      they live, while less than a fifth of them have access to toilets . Imagine how
      that would affect all of the higher-order things you value in your life, including
      gatherings with people you care about, if you couldn’t even find a decent place
      to wash your hands or brush your teeth! Most of all, what stands out to me as
      both a social worker and a scholar of war is how people forced to leave their
      communities end up losing connections to health providers they trust. I can’t
      tell you how many individuals I’ve met in clinical and humanitarian settings who
      had declined to seek care for Covid-19, pneumonia, severe flu symptoms, and other
      illnesses because they lacked confidence that professionals in their host communities
      had their best interests at heart. My Government’s Assault on Public Health As
      Republicans in Congress struggle to pass a bill that would deprive millions of
      Americans of health insurance in the near term, as high-level officials spread
      disinformation about vaccines for once-eradicated illnesses like measles, and
      as public health workers and officials face threats of violence, all too many
      poor Americans are starting to experience the sorts of obstacles to healthcare
      common in war zones. Meanwhile, with the Trump administration’s decisions earlier
      this year to fire at least 2,000 U.S. Agency for International Development workers
      and freeze foreign aid dollars used (in part) to treat and monitor infectious
      diseases elsewhere on this planet, the threat that a foreign pandemic might make
      it to this country has grown considerably. To quote Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa)
      at a recent town hall with constituents worried about losing healthcare, “we are
      all going to die.” While that is indeed so, it also matters how. A long life with
      access to basic services like immunizations and clean water is one of the differences
      between dying like a human being and dying like one of the wild animals I find
      in my rural area, infected by bacteria in the water or exhausted from heat exposure.
      How, I wonder, did we Americans reach a place where many of us are silent or supportive
      of a strongman’s $45 million birthday military parade that closed roads to residents
      and commuters for days? How did we get to a time when our leaders seem loath to
      invest in healthcare and don’t even hide their disdain for poor people, a significant
      number of whom are military personnel and veterans? I’m not sure I know what this
      country stands for anymore. I don’t know about you, but these days America sometimes
      feels to me like a treacherous foreign land. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

      War kills in so many ways. These days, Americans are bombarded with images from
      Gaza and elsewhere of people or broken bodies being ferried on stretchers from
      the rubble of homes and hospitals, by rescue workers whose thin bodies and stricken
      faces suggest they are barely better off than those they’re helping. Social media
      and journalists make us eyewitnesses to emaciated children too weak to cry. And
      yet, compared with air raids that crush and bloody instantaneously, a slower disaster,
      more difficult to capture (especially given our made-for-TikTok attention spans),
      consists of the hours that many people in war zones spend wasting away from infectious
      diseases of one sort or another. Let me count a few of the ways. In Iraq in 2004,
      three-month-old Ali tries to cry but he’s too weak to make a sound, since his
      body has been ravaged by diarrhea. Between 2003 and 2007 , half of Iraq’s 18,000
      doctors left the country due to the deteriorating security situation (with few
      intending to return). Health facilities had also been bombed out and destroyed.
      By then, about two-thirds of the deaths of children under the age of five, like
      Ali, were due to respiratory infections and diarrhea compounded by malnutrition.
      In Pakistan in 2017, one of a handful of countries that has yet to eliminate the
      polio virus, the father of a five-year-old boy is inconsolable when he learns
      that his son will never walk on his own again. Among displaced people in the Afghan-Pakistani
      border region where they lived, concerns about counterinsurgency air raids from
      U.S. and later Pakistani government and opposition forces, security threats toward
      vaccination teams in conflict-torn parts of that country, and suspicions among
      parents like that boy’s father that health workers had been sent by the U.S. government
      to sterilize Pakistani children, all prevented kids from getting the immunizations
      that they needed. In Burkina Faso in 2019, three-year-old Abdoulaye dies after
      contracting malaria while in a shelter for people internally displaced by violence
      between government forces and Islamic militias. Malnourished and anemic, without
      direct access to a health clinic, he succumbs to a treatable illness. In Fayetteville,
      North Carolina, in 2020, as in other military towns across the U.S., rates of
      sexually transmitted infections like syphilis, herpes simplex, and HIV are among
      the highest in the country. Bases tend to drive up poverty among civilians by
      making the surrounding populations dependent on low-wage service work. And stressed-out,
      war-traumatized American soldiers are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior
      that spreads disease among the broader population. In Ukraine in 2023, a soldier
      treated for severe burns dies of sepsis, despite being given multiple antibiotics.
      Doctors found klebsiella, a multi-drug-resistant pathogen, in his body. Despite
      successful efforts by the Ukrainian government to curb antimicrobial resistance
      in its population prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion, mounting casualties, along
      with shortages of supplies and personnel, mean that Ukrainian health workers now
      try to do whatever they can to keep soldiers alive. In the long term, antibiotic-resistant
      infections traceable to Ukrainian patients are already beginning to appear in
      places as distant as Japan . In May 2025 in the Gaza strip, four-month-old Jenan
      dies from chronic diarrhea after losing half her bodyweight. She needed hypoallergenic
      milk formula, but aerial bombardments and blockades of basic food and medical
      supplies have made that once common product scarce. As anthropologist Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins
      points out, prior to the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October
      2023, cases of diarrhea in young children there averaged about 2,000 per month.
      In April of the following year, however, such cases already numbered more than
      100,000. Likewise, in the decade before the war, there were no large-scale epidemics
      in Gaza. In just the first seven months of that conflict, however, overcrowding
      in makeshift shelters, nutritional deficits, shortages of hygiene products — only
      one in every three Gazans has soap! — and contaminated water have led to new outbreaks
      of infectious diseases like measles, cholera, typhoid, and polio, exacerbated
      by widespread starvation. At some level, it couldn’t be simpler. War destroys
      all too many of the modern amenities that make life possible. Preventable illness
      and death occur even in industrialized settings that are marked by inequality,
      lack of information, psychological trauma, or just the chaos of combat that hinders
      long-term thinking. In poor- and middle-income countries like Yemen, Syria, and
      Nigeria, infectious diseases were already among the top causes of death, even
      before the outbreak of significant conflicts. Their incidence, however, grew so
      much worse in wartime, especially among civilians who didn’t have the same access
      to doctors and medical hospitals as armed groups. The body of a single child,
      wasting away from the lack of the basic fluid that runs in my sink or yours, best
      captures the way war casualties ripple across time and populations. For every
      soldier who dies in battle, exponentially more people suffer deaths from malnutrition,
      disease, or trauma-related violence even after battles end. Preventable infections
      play a large role in this story. The War on Children Children are particularly
      vulnerable to sickness and death in armed conflicts because of their immature
      immune systems, greater nutritional needs, tendency to succumb more easily to
      dehydration, and reliance on families who may not even be around to care for them.
      A study of more than 15,000 armed-conflict events in 35 African countries found
      that children aged 10 or younger were far more likely to die if they lived within
      100 kilometers of a battle zone than they would have in earlier periods of peacetime.
      Increases in mortality ranged from 3% to about 27%, varying with how many people
      also died in nearby battles. Strikingly, many more babies under the age of one
      died annually in the eight years following a conflict’s end than while the battles
      were going on — infectious disease being a primary killer. Take Yemen as an example
      of how war may affect young children and their families over time. Since the start
      of that country’s civil war in 2015, cholera, a waterborne illness doctors have
      known how to prevent since 1954, has ravaged the most vulnerable members of that
      country’s population, particularly children, due to a lack of appropriate sanitation
      or reasonable access to healthcare. As of December 2017, more than a million people
      had contracted the disease, nearly half of them children, and more than 2,000
      had died of the illness. Compare that to the more than 10,000 Yemenis estimated
      to have died in direct combat by that time, and you get an idea of how significantly
      death by illness counts among the casualties of war. Nearly a decade later, in
      fact, there are hundreds of thousands of new cases of that illness in Yemen each
      year and hundreds of annual deaths, making up more than a third of all cases globally.
      When Rami discovered that his daughters, aged 10 and 7, had cholera, he managed
      to scrape together the equivalent of about $15 to travel to a clinic so that the
      family could get lifesaving fluids and information to prevent further cases. Many
      families like his, however, can’t afford such treatment, forcing all too many
      of them to delay care or even experience the unthinkable: losing a child. Consider
      what it would do if someone you loved perished because they were born in the wrong
      place at the wrong time in the storm of war that destroys infrastructure so central
      to our lives that normally we barely even notice its presence. I hope it’s an
      experience that neither you nor I ever have. War and Displacement Still, I think
      about such things every day, as I bet do many of my colleagues connected to the
      Costs of War Project . When we first launched that project in 2011, Professors
      Catherine Lutz, Neta Crawford, and I met with experts in armed conflict to discuss
      how we would cover the issue of war’s health impacts. Repeatedly, they reminded
      us of how hard it is to talk about war and health without understanding what it’s
      like for families to be forced to leave their homes in search of safety. Unsurprisingly,
      refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) are uniquely vulnerable to disease
      and illness. Anyone who has gotten sick while traveling knows that the challenges
      of getting care are compounded by a lack of knowledge of the community you find
      yourself in. In the case of today’s more than 122 million war refugees or displaced
      people, stigma and harassment are frequent travel companions. According to one
      meta-analysis, more than one-fifth of refugee and IDP women have experienced some
      form of sexual violence while living in displacement settings. A study of more
      than 500 immigrants and refugees in Italy found that nearly half experienced physical
      violence, sexual abuse, harassment, or workplace discrimination. The stories that
      extremist politicians tell about migrants — think of Donald Trump’s tall tale
      of supposedly dog- and cat-eating Haitians in Springfield, Ohio — distract us
      from the social problems such politicians seem unwilling to deal with like loneliness
      and poverty. Displaced persons lack political clout and voting power in places
      that host them and, in actual war zones, fighters rarely respect shelters and
      camps designated for their survival. For people who flee their homes, the basic
      boring stuff is lacking, too. Only 35% of refugees have clean drinking water where
      they live, while less than a fifth of them have access to toilets . Imagine how
      that would affect all of the higher-order things you value in your life, including
      gatherings with people you care about, if you couldn’t even find a decent place
      to wash your hands or brush your teeth! Most of all, what stands out to me as
      both a social worker and a scholar of war is how people forced to leave their
      communities end up losing connections to health providers they trust. I can’t
      tell you how many individuals I’ve met in clinical and humanitarian settings who
      had declined to seek care for Covid-19, pneumonia, severe flu symptoms, and other
      illnesses because they lacked confidence that professionals in their host communities
      had their best interests at heart. My Government’s Assault on Public Health As
      Republicans in Congress struggle to pass a bill that would deprive millions of
      Americans of health insurance in the near term, as high-level officials spread
      disinformation about vaccines for once-eradicated illnesses like measles, and
      as public health workers and officials face threats of violence, all too many
      poor Americans are starting to experience the sorts of obstacles to healthcare
      common in war zones. Meanwhile, with the Trump administration’s decisions earlier
      this year to fire at least 2,000 U.S. Agency for International Development workers
      and freeze foreign aid dollars used (in part) to treat and monitor infectious
      diseases elsewhere on this planet, the threat that a foreign pandemic might make
      it to this country has grown considerably. To quote Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa)
      at a recent town hall with constituents worried about losing healthcare, “we are
      all going to die.” While that is indeed so, it also matters how. A long life with
      access to basic services like immunizations and clean water is one of the differences
      between dying like a human being and dying like one of the wild animals I find
      in my rural area, infected by bacteria in the water or exhausted from heat exposure.
      How, I wonder, did we Americans reach a place where many of us are silent or supportive
      of a strongman’s $45 million birthday military parade that closed roads to residents
      and commuters for days? How did we get to a time when our leaders seem loath to
      invest in healthcare and don’t even hide their disdain for poor people, a significant
      number of whom are military personnel and veterans? I’m not sure I know what this
      country stands for anymore. I don’t know about you, but these days America sometimes
      feels to me like a treacherous foreign land. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

      donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost When the history of the genocide
      in Gaza is written, one of the most courageous and outspoken champions for justice
      and the adherence to international law will be Francesca Albanese, the United
      Nations Special Rapporteur, who today the Trump administration is sanctioning.
      Her office is tasked with monitoring and reporting on human rights violations
      that Israel commits against Palestinians. Albanese, who regularly receives death
      threats and endures well-orchestrated smear campaigns directed by Israel and its
      allies, valiantly seeks to hold those who support and sustain the genocide accountable.
      She lambasts what she calls “the moral and political corruption of the world”
      that allows the genocide to continue. Her office has issued detailed reports documenting
      war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, one of which, called “ Genocide as colonial
      erasure ,” I have reprinted as an appendix in my latest book, “ A Genocide Foretold
      .” She has informed private organizations that they are “criminally liable” for
      assisting Israel in carrying out the genocide in Gaza. She announced that if true,
      as has been reported, that the former British prime minister David Cameron threatened
      to defund and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued
      arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense
      minister Yoav Gallant, which Cameron and the other former British prime minister
      Rishi Sunak could be charged with a criminal offense for, under the Rome Statue.
      The Rome Statue criminalizes those who seek to prevent war crimes from being prosecuted.
      She has called on top European Union (EU) officials to face charges of complicity
      of war crimes over their support for the genocide, saying that their actions cannot
      be met with impunity. She was a champion of the Madleen flotilla that sought to
      break the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, writing that the boat
      which was intercepted by Israel, was carrying not only supplies, but a message
      of humanity. You can see the interview I did with Albanese here . Her latest report
      lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc.,
      Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon, International Business Machine
      Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institute
      of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as BlackRock, insurers,
      real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law, are
      making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. You can
      read my article on Albanese’s most recent report here . Secretary of State Marco
      Rubio condemned her support for the ICC, four of whose judges have been sanctioned
      by the U.S. for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last year. He
      criticized Albanese for her efforts to prosecute American or Israeli nationals
      who sustain the genocide, saying she is unfit for service as a special rapporteur.
      Rubio also accused Albanese of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed
      support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the
      West.” The sanctions will most likely prevent Albanese from travelling to the
      U.S. and will freeze any assets she may have in the country. The attack against
      Albanese presages a world without rules, one where rogue states, such as the U.S.
      and Israel, are permitted to carry out war crimes and genocide without any accountability
      or restraint. It exposes the subterfuges we use to fool ourselves and attempt
      to fool others. It reveals our hypocrisy, cruelty and racism. No one, from now
      on, will take seriously our stated commitments to democracy, freedom of expression,
      the rule of law or human rights. And who can blame them? We speak exclusively
      in the language of force, the language of brutes, the language of mass slaughter,
      the language of genocide. “The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction
      of psychological and physical torture, the devastation, the creation of conditions
      of life that would not allow the people in Gaza to live, from the destruction
      of hospitals, the mass forced displacement and the mass homelessness, while people
      were being bombed daily, and the starvation — how can we read these acts in isolation?”
      Albanese asked in an interview I did with her when we discussed her report, “Genocide
      as colonial erasure.” The militarized drones, helicopter gunships, walls and barriers,
      checkpoints, coils of concertina wire, watchtowers, detention centers, deportations,
      brutality and torture, denial of entry visas, apartheidesque existence that comes
      with being undocumented, loss of individual rights and electronic surveillance,
      are as familiar to desperate migrants along the Mexican border, or attempting
      to enter Europe, as they are to Palestinians. This is what awaits those who Frantz
      Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth.” Those that defend the oppressed, such
      as Albanese, will be treated like the oppressed. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM

      of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as BlackRock, insurers,
      real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law, are
      making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. You can
      read my article on Albanese’s most recent report here . Secretary of State Marco
      Rubio condemned her support for the ICC, four of whose judges have been sanctioned
      by the U.S. for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last year. He
      criticized Albanese for her efforts to prosecute American or Israeli nationals
      who sustain the genocide, saying she is unfit for service as a special rapporteur.
      Rubio also accused Albanese of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed
      support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the
      West.” The sanctions will most likely prevent Albanese from travelling to the
      U.S. and will freeze any assets she may have in the country. The attack against
      Albanese presages a world without rules, one where rogue states, such as the U.S.
      and Israel, are permitted to carry out war crimes and genocide without any accountability
      or restraint. It exposes the subterfuges we use to fool ourselves and attempt
      to fool others. It reveals our hypocrisy, cruelty and racism. No one, from now
      on, will take seriously our stated commitments to democracy, freedom of expression,
      the rule of law or human rights. And who can blame them? We speak exclusively
      in the language of force, the language of brutes, the language of mass slaughter,
      the language of genocide. “The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction
      of psychological and physical torture, the devastation, the creation of conditions
      of life that would not allow the people in Gaza to live, from the destruction
      of hospitals, the mass forced displacement and the mass homelessness, while people
      were being bombed daily, and the starvation — how can we read these acts in isolation?”
      Albanese asked in an interview I did with her when we discussed her report, “Genocide
      as colonial erasure.” The militarized drones, helicopter gunships, walls and barriers,
      checkpoints, coils of concertina wire, watchtowers, detention centers, deportations,
      brutality and torture, denial of entry visas, apartheidesque existence that comes
      with being undocumented, loss of individual rights and electronic surveillance,
      are as familiar to desperate migrants along the Mexican border, or attempting
      to enter Europe, as they are to Palestinians. This is what awaits those who Frantz
      Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth.” Those that defend the oppressed, such
      as Albanese, will be treated like the oppressed. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM

    paragraph_summary: Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, is
      highlighted as a courageous advocate for justice in the face of the ongoing genocide
      in Gaza, particularly as she faces sanctions from the Trump administration and
      threats to her safety. Albanese's office is dedicated to monitoring human rights
      violations by Israel against Palestinians, and she has produced detailed reports
      documenting these war crimes, including one titled "Genocide as Colonial Erasure."
      She criticizes the global complicity that allows such atrocities to persist and
      has warned organizations of their potential criminal liability for supporting
      Israel's actions. Additionally, she has raised concerns about former British Prime
      Minister David Cameron's alleged threats to undermine the International Criminal
      Court in response to its actions against Israeli leaders, suggesting that such
      interference could constitute a criminal offense under international law.

      and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Belén Fernández / Fairness
      and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) And so it has come to pass: US President Donald
      Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” has set the stage for tax cuts for the rich, slashed
      services for the poor, and a host of other things that qualify as “beautiful”
      in the present dystopia. Some cuts, like those to Medicaid, have been heavily
      covered by the corporate media. But one key piece of the bill has gotten much
      less media scrutiny: The preposterous sum of $175 billion has been allocated to
      fund Trump’s signature mass deportation campaign, which, as a Salon article (
      7/3/25 ) points out, exceeds the military budget for every single country in the
      world aside from the US and China. Approximately $30 billion of that is destined
      directly for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the goons who have
      recently made a name for themselves by going around in masks and kidnapping people.
      This constitutes a threefold increase over ICE’s previous budget, and propels
      the outfit to the position of the largest US federal law enforcement agency in
      history. $45 billion will go toward building new ICE detention centers, including
      family detention centers. Prior to the signing into law of the sweeping bill on
      July 4, US Vice President JD Vance took to X to highlight what really mattered
      in the legislation: Everything else—the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] score,
      the proper baseline, the minutiae of the Medicaid policy—is immaterial compared
      to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions. Scant attention to ICE
      expansion And yet many US corporate media outlets have paid scant attention to
      this aspect of the bill and refrained from delving too deeply into the matter
      of what exactly this massive ramping up of ICE portends for American society.
      According to a search of the Nexis news database, while half (50%) of newspaper
      articles and news transcripts mentioning the reconciliation bill from its first
      passage in the House (May 20) to its signing into law (July 4) also mentioned
      Medicaid, less than 6% named Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE. Even
      many of those that did mention ICE barely gave it any attention. On July 3, for
      example, the New York Times presented readers with “ Nine Questions About the
      Republican Megabill, Answered ,” which in response to the first question—“Why
      is it being called a megabill?”—did manage to mention “a 150% boost to the Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement budget over the next five years.” However, there was no
      further discussion in the article’s remaining 1,500-plus words of potential ramifications
      of this boost—although there was a section devoted to the “tax break for Native
      Alaskan subsistence whaling captains.” That was more than CNN ’s intervention
      managed, also published on July 3, and headlined “Here’s Who Stands to Gain From
      the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill.’ And Who May Struggle.” The article aced a couple of
      no-brainers, including that “corporate America” would be “better off” thanks to
      the bill, while “low-income Americans” would be “worse off.” But there was not
      a single reference to the ICE budget—or who might “struggle” because of it. ‘Detention
      blitz’ This is not to imply, of course, that there are no articles detailing what
      ICE has been up to in terms of persecuting refuge seekers , visa holders, legal
      US residents and even US citizens —who supposedly have greater protections under
      the law—and how all of this stands to get worse, in accordance with the impending
      deluge of anti-immigration funds. In its report on ICE’s looming “detention blitz,”
      the Washington Post ( 7/4/25 ) noted that “at least 10 immigrants died while in
      ICE’s custody during the first half of this year,” and cited the finding that
      ICE is “now arresting people with no criminal charges at a higher rate than people
      charged with crimes.” The Post article also contained sufficiently thought-provoking
      details to enable the conscientious reader to draw their own conclusions regarding
      the ultimate purpose of manic detention schemes. (Hint: it’s not to keep America
      “safe.”) For instance, we learn that the share prices of GEO Group and CoreCivic—the
      two largest detention companies contracted by ICE, which have notorious reputations
      for detainee mistreatment—“each rose about 3%… as investors cheered the passage
      of congressional funding likely to result in a flurry of new contracts.” Lest
      there remain any doubt as to the centrality of profit flows to the immigration
      crackdown, the article specifies that GEO Group and CoreCivic “each gave $500,000
      to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, according to Federal Election Commission
      data.” This article, however, came after the legislation was passed. A Post opinion
      piece ( 6/30/25 ), meanwhile, put a human face on some of ICE’s victims, such
      as Jermaine Thomas, born to a US soldier on a military base in Germany. Following
      an incident of “suspected trespassing” in Texas, Thomas was deported by ICE to
      Jamaica, a country he had never set foot in. Other victims spotlighted by the
      Post include 64-year-old Iranian immigrant Madonna Kashanian, nabbed while gardening
      at her house in New Orleans, and a six-year-old Honduran boy with leukemia who
      was arrested at an immigration court in California while pursuing his asylum case
      with his family. It was also possible, if one sought it out, to find reporting
      on what the cash infusion entails from a logistical perspective: more agents ,
      more arrests, more racial profiling , increased detention capacity , and a deportation
      system that runs “like Amazon , trying to get your product delivered in 24 hours,”
      as ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons charmingly put it . ‘Police state first’ Gutting
      Medicaid is certainly an angle on the reconciliation bill that deserved the media
      attention it got, and will devastate millions in this country. But the massive
      infusion of money and power to ICE will likewise devastate millions with a ballooning
      police state that unleashes terror, rips apart families and creates a network
      of concentration camps across the country. Given ICE’s contemporary track record
      and de facto exemption from the constraints of due process , the public desperately
      needs a media that will connect the dots in order to convey a bigger-picture look
      of what America is up against. In an interview with Jacobin magazine ( 7/3/25
      ) on how “ICE Is About to Get More Money Than It Can Spend,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick
      —a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council—made the crucial observation:
      “You don’t build the mass deportation machine without building the police state
      first.” This is precisely the analysis that is missing from corporate media coverage
      of the bill. Beyond making life hell for the undocumented workers on whose very
      labor the US economy depends, ICE has become a tool for political repression as
      well—as evidenced by a slew of recent episodes involving the abduction and disappearance
      of international scholars whose political opinions did not coincide with those
      of the commander in chief of our, um, democracy. Take the case of 30-year-old
      Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student and Fulbright scholar studying childhood
      development at Tufts University in Massachusetts. While walking to an iftar dinner
      in March, Öztürk was accosted by six plainclothes officers, some of them masked,
      and forced into an unmarked van, after which she was flown halfway across the
      country to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Her crime, apparently, was to
      have co-written an opinion piece last year for the Tufts Daily ( 3/26/24 ), in
      which she and her co-authors encouraged the university to accede to demands by
      the Tufts Community Union Senate by recognizing the Israeli genocide in the Gaza
      Strip and divesting from companies with ties to Israel. Öztürk’s case is hardly
      an isolated one. There’s Badar Khan Suri , a postdoctoral researcher at Georgetown
      University who was seized by masked agents outside his Virginia home and swept
      off to an ICE facility in Texas. There’s Momodou Taal , a British-Gambian former
      PhD student at Cornell who sued the Trump administration over the crackdown on
      Palestine solidarity and then self-deported, explaining that he had “lost faith
      [he] could walk the streets without being abducted.” And the list goes on ( Al
      Jazeera , 5/15/25 ). ‘Homegrowns are next’ In the twisted view of the US government,
      of course, opposing the US-backed genocide of Palestinians equals support for
      “terrorism”—and in Trump’s view , basically anything that goes against his own
      thinking and policies potentially constitutes a criminal offense. It follows that
      Öztürk-style politically motivated kidnappings by the state are presumably merely
      the top of a very slippery slope that US citizens, too, will soon find themselves
      careening down—especially as Trump has already exhibited enthusiasm at the prospect
      of outsourcing the incarceration of US citizens to El Salvador: “The homegrowns
      are next,” he told Salvadoran autocrat Nayib Bukele. The line between citizens
      and residents has been intentionally blurred, with the Trump Justice Department
      announcing it was “Prioritizing Denaturalization”—that is, stripping citizenship
      from foreign-born citizens. This draconian punishment has been proposed for Trump’s
      political enemies, from New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to former BFF
      Elon Musk . Trump has also taken aim at the constitutional right of birthright
      citizenship , potentially turning millions of other Americans into ICE targets.
      Somehow, the elite media have not deemed it necessary to dwell even superficially
      on the implications of super-funding a rogue agency that has essentially been
      given carte blanche to indiscriminately round people up—be they undocumented workers,
      political dissidents, or just somebody who “looks like somebody we are looking
      for.” As for CNN ’s write-up on “who stands to gain from the ‘big, beautiful bill,’”
      it’s definitely not all the folks currently living in a permanent state of fear,
      deprived of basic freedoms like movement, speech and thought. Editor’s Note :

      the Tufts Community Union Senate by recognizing the Israeli genocide in the Gaza
      Strip and divesting from companies with ties to Israel. Öztürk’s case is hardly
      an isolated one. There’s Badar Khan Suri , a postdoctoral researcher at Georgetown
      University who was seized by masked agents outside his Virginia home and swept
      off to an ICE facility in Texas. There’s Momodou Taal , a British-Gambian former
      PhD student at Cornell who sued the Trump administration over the crackdown on
      Palestine solidarity and then self-deported, explaining that he had “lost faith
      [he] could walk the streets without being abducted.” And the list goes on ( Al
      Jazeera , 5/15/25 ). ‘Homegrowns are next’ In the twisted view of the US government,
      of course, opposing the US-backed genocide of Palestinians equals support for
      “terrorism”—and in Trump’s view , basically anything that goes against his own
      thinking and policies potentially constitutes a criminal offense. It follows that
      Öztürk-style politically motivated kidnappings by the state are presumably merely
      the top of a very slippery slope that US citizens, too, will soon find themselves
      careening down—especially as Trump has already exhibited enthusiasm at the prospect
      of outsourcing the incarceration of US citizens to El Salvador: “The homegrowns
      are next,” he told Salvadoran autocrat Nayib Bukele. The line between citizens
      and residents has been intentionally blurred, with the Trump Justice Department
      announcing it was “Prioritizing Denaturalization”—that is, stripping citizenship
      from foreign-born citizens. This draconian punishment has been proposed for Trump’s
      political enemies, from New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to former BFF
      Elon Musk . Trump has also taken aim at the constitutional right of birthright
      citizenship , potentially turning millions of other Americans into ICE targets.
      Somehow, the elite media have not deemed it necessary to dwell even superficially
      on the implications of super-funding a rogue agency that has essentially been
      given carte blanche to indiscriminately round people up—be they undocumented workers,
      political dissidents, or just somebody who “looks like somebody we are looking
      for.” As for CNN ’s write-up on “who stands to gain from the ‘big, beautiful bill,’”
      it’s definitely not all the folks currently living in a permanent state of fear,
      deprived of basic freedoms like movement, speech and thought. Editor’s Note :

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the implications of a significant legislative
      bill signed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which allocates a staggering $175
      billion for mass deportation efforts, overshadowing other budgetary concerns such
      as Medicaid cuts. This funding includes approximately $30 billion for U.S. Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement (ICE), marking a threefold increase in their budget and
      making ICE the largest federal law enforcement agency in U.S. history. Additionally,
      $45 billion is designated for the construction of new ICE detention centers, including
      those for families. The article emphasizes that while corporate media has focused
      on certain cuts, the massive financial commitment to immigration enforcement has
      received less scrutiny, with Vice President JD Vance highlighting its significance
      over other legislative details.

      / OtherWords The GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowly passed Congress
      and was recently signed by President Trump, represents the largest transfer of
      wealth from the poor to the rich since chattel slavery. Here are just 10 of the
      worst things about it. 1. It’s going to kill people. Cuts to Medicaid and the
      Affordable Care Act, combined with new administrative hurdles, could result in
      an estimated 51,000 preventable deaths per year. The new law and other actions
      by the Trump administration will strip health insurance from 17 million people
      . 2. It will be an apocalypse for rural hospitals. The budget restricts the provider
      taxes that many states use to fund Medicaid. The threat is particularly severe
      for rural hospitals , which rely heavily on Medicaid revenue. More than 700 rural
      hospitals are already at risk of closure — and at least 338 are at increased risk
      due to changes in this budget. 3. It takes food from the mouths of hungry people.
      New work requirements for SNAP benefits will take food assistance from millions
      , including children and veterans. As with Medicaid, new work requirements for
      SNAP will have little effect on employment, but will cause more children to go
      hungry. 4. It squeezes states on SNAP. For the first time, states will have to
      take on a significant share of funding SNAP. This unprecedented shift will likely
      lead many states to cut enrollees or even terminate food aid altogether. 5. It
      bars lawfully present immigrants from aid. Hundreds of thousands of lawfully present
      immigrants , including children, will lose access to Medicaid, the Children’ s
      Health Insurance Program, Medicare, ACA tax credits, and SNAP benefits. And 2.6
      million U.S. citizen children who live with only an undocumented adult are expected
      to lose their Child Tax Credit. 6. It terrorizes immigrant families. The GOP budget
      provides $170 billion to arrest, detain, deport, and wall off migrants. That includes
      $45 billion for new immigration detention centers, including family detention
      facilities —  a vast increase that will primarily benefit private companies contracted
      to build and run them. 7. It takes from the poor to give to the rich. The bill’s
      tax policies will overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest households . A Yale analysis
      of the bill’s combined tax and spending policies finds that the poorest 20 percent
      of households will suffer a net income loss of $700 per year on average, while
      the top 1 percent will get a $30,000 increase. 8. Corporations will take the spoils
      for themselves. The budget keeps the corporate tax rate at 21 percent, a drastic
      reduction from the 35 percent rate from before the first Trump tax cuts in 2018
      — despite the fact that ordinary workers have not benefited from this rate reduction.
      9. It rewards polluters while raising energy costs. The budget also includes more
      than $1 billion in new tax breaks and subsidies for the fossil fuel industry,
      accelerating climate change while costing taxpayers. It also allows oil and gas
      companies to avoid paying fees for polluting methane leaks, a major cause of climate
      change. Meanwhile, cuts to clean energy subsidies could raise household energy
      bills by $415 a year over the next decade. 10. It funds war and enriches war profiteers.
      The bill gives the Pentagon a $150 billion boost, bringing overall Pentagon spending
      to over $1 trillion — a record high. That includes $25 billion for the “Golden
      Dome,” a missile defense system that’s economically and physically impossible
      but would enrich wealthy Pentagon contractors like Elon Musk . Instead, Congress
      should harness America’s abundant wealth to create a moral economy that works
      for all of us. By fairly taxing the wealthy and big corporations, reducing our
      bloated military budget, and de-militarizing immigration policy, we could free
      up more than enough public funds to ensure we can all survive and thrive. We have
      no excuse for not investing our national resources in ways that reflect our Constitutional
      values: to establish justice, domestic tranquility, real security, and the general
      welfare for all. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By The Cradle’s Persian Gulf Correspondent / The Cradle The recent
      confrontation between Iran and Israel marked a decisive shift in regional power
      equations, particularly in the Persian Gulf. Iran’s direct and calibrated military
      response – executed through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – exposed
      the strategic vulnerabilities of Tel Aviv and forced Gulf capitals, chiefly Riyadh,
      to reassess long-standing assumptions about regional security. The Saudi-led recalibration
      did not emerge in isolation. Years of cumulative political, military, and diplomatic
      failures under the umbrella of US-Israeli tutelage have pushed Persian Gulf states
      to seek more viable, non-confrontational security arrangements. What we are witnessing
      is the slow dismantling of obsolete alliances and the opening of pragmatic, interest-driven
      channels with Tehran. Iran’s war strategy resets Gulf expectations Tehran’s handling
      of the latest military clash – with its reliance on precision strikes, regional
      alliances, and calibrated escalation – demonstrated a new level of deterrence.
      Using its regional networks, missile bases, and sophisticated drones, Tehran managed
      the confrontation very carefully, avoiding being drawn into all-out war, but at
      the same time sending clear messages to the enemy about its ability to deter and
      expand engagement if necessary. The message to the Gulf was clear: Iran is neither
      isolated nor vulnerable. It is capable of shaping outcomes across multiple fronts
      without falling into full-scale war. Speaking to The Cradle , a well-informed
      Arab diplomat says: “This war was a turning point in the Saudi thinking. Riyadh
      now understands Iran is a mature military power, immune to coercion. Traditional
      pressure no longer works. Saudi security now depends on direct engagement with
      Iran – not on Israel, and certainly not under the receding American security umbrella.”
      At the heart of Saudi discontent lies Tel Aviv’s escalating aggression against
      the Palestinians and its outright dismissal of Arab peace initiatives , including
      the Riyadh-led 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
      intransigence – particularly the aggressive expansion of settlements in Jerusalem
      and the occupied West Bank – has alarmed the Saudis. These provocations not only
      sabotage diplomatic efforts but strike at the kingdom’s pan-Islamic legitimacy,
      forcing a reassessment of Israel’s utility as a strategic partner. As the diplomatic
      source notes: “This Israeli political stalemate pushes Saudi Arabia to reconsider
      its regional bets and view Iran as a regional power factor that cannot be ignored.”
      Riyadh turns to Tehran: containment over confrontation Behind closed doors, Saudi
      Arabia is advancing a strategy of “positive containment” with Iran. This marks
      a clear departure from the era of proxy wars and ideological hostility. Riyadh
      is no longer seeking confrontation – it is seeking coordination, particularly
      on issues of regional security and energy. Diplomatic sources inform The Cradle
      that the reopening of embassies and stepped-up security coordination are not mere
      side effects of Chinese mediation . They reflect a deeper Saudi conviction: that
      normalization with Israel yields no meaningful security dividends, especially
      after Tel Aviv’s exposed vulnerabilities in the last war. Riyadh’s new path also
      signals its growing appetite for regional solutions away from Washington – a position
      increasingly shared by other Persian Gulf states. For its part, the Islamic Republic
      is moving swiftly to convert military leverage into political capital. Beyond
      showcasing its missile and drone capabilities , Iran is now actively courting
      Arab states of the Persian Gulf with proposals for economic cooperation, regional
      integration, and the construction of an indigenous security architecture. Informed
      sources reveal to The Cradle that Iran is pursuing comprehensive engagement with
      Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Oman. This includes economic partnerships and
      alignment on key regional files, from Yemen to Syria and Iraq. Tehran’s position
      is consistent with its long-stated view: The Persian Gulf’s security must be decided
      by its littoral states and peoples – not by foreign agendas. A new Gulf alliance
      is taking shape This is no longer a Saudi story alone. The UAE is expanding economic
      cooperation with Tehran, while maintaining open security channels. Qatar sustains
      a solid diplomatic line with Iran, using its credibility to broker key regional
      talks. Oman remains the region’s trusted bridge and discreet mediator. An Arab
      diplomat briefed on recent developments tells The Cradle : “Upcoming Gulf–Iran
      meetings will address navigation in the Strait of Hormuz, energy coordination,
      and broader regional files. There is consensus building that understanding with
      Iran open the door to a more stable phase in the Gulf.” Amid these realignments,
      Israel finds itself regionally sidelined – its project to forge an anti-Iran axis
      has crumbled. The US-brokered Abraham Accords – once trumpeted as a strategic
      triumph – now elicit little more than polite disinterest across the Gulf, with
      even existing Arab signatories walking back their engagement. Riyadh’s political
      elite now openly question the utility of normalization. As Tel Aviv continues
      its war on Gaza, Gulf populations grow more vocal and Saudi leaders more cautious.
      The Saudi position is unspoken but unmistakable: Tel Aviv can no longer guarantee
      security, nor can it be viewed as the gatekeeper to regional stability any longer.
      Pragmatism trumps ideology This Saudi–Iranian thaw is not ideological – it is
      hard-nosed realpolitik. As another senior Arab diplomat tells The Cradle: “Riyadh
      is discarding illusions. Dialogue with neighbors – not alliance with Washington
      and Tel Aviv – is now the route to safeguarding Saudi interests. This is now about
      facts, not old loyalties. Iran is now a fixed component of the Gulf’s security
      equation.” The binary of “Gulf versus Iran” is fading. The last war accelerated
      a trend long in motion: the collapse of Pax Americana and the emergence of multipolar
      regionalism . The Gulf is charting a new course – one less beholden to US-Israeli
      diktats. Today, Saudi Arabia sees Tehran not as a threat to be neutralized, but
      as a power to be engaged . Regional security frameworks are being built from within.
      Israel, meanwhile, despite its many pontifications about a Tel Aviv-led, Arab-aligned
      “Middle East,” is struggling to stay relevant. If these dynamics hold, we are
      on the cusp of a historic transition – one that may finally allow the Persian
      Gulf to define its own security and sovereignty, on its own terms. This is not
      an ideal future. But it is a strategic upgrade from decades of subservience. Saudi
      Arabia is turning toward Iran – not out of love, but out of logic. Editor’s Note

      failures under the umbrella of US-Israeli tutelage have pushed Persian Gulf states
      to seek more viable, non-confrontational security arrangements. What we are witnessing
      is the slow dismantling of obsolete alliances and the opening of pragmatic, interest-driven
      channels with Tehran. Iran’s war strategy resets Gulf expectations Tehran’s handling
      of the latest military clash – with its reliance on precision strikes, regional
      alliances, and calibrated escalation – demonstrated a new level of deterrence.
      Using its regional networks, missile bases, and sophisticated drones, Tehran managed
      the confrontation very carefully, avoiding being drawn into all-out war, but at
      the same time sending clear messages to the enemy about its ability to deter and
      expand engagement if necessary. The message to the Gulf was clear: Iran is neither
      isolated nor vulnerable. It is capable of shaping outcomes across multiple fronts
      without falling into full-scale war. Speaking to The Cradle , a well-informed
      Arab diplomat says: “This war was a turning point in the Saudi thinking. Riyadh
      now understands Iran is a mature military power, immune to coercion. Traditional
      pressure no longer works. Saudi security now depends on direct engagement with
      Iran – not on Israel, and certainly not under the receding American security umbrella.”
      At the heart of Saudi discontent lies Tel Aviv’s escalating aggression against
      the Palestinians and its outright dismissal of Arab peace initiatives , including
      the Riyadh-led 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
      intransigence – particularly the aggressive expansion of settlements in Jerusalem
      and the occupied West Bank – has alarmed the Saudis. These provocations not only
      sabotage diplomatic efforts but strike at the kingdom’s pan-Islamic legitimacy,
      forcing a reassessment of Israel’s utility as a strategic partner. As the diplomatic
      source notes: “This Israeli political stalemate pushes Saudi Arabia to reconsider
      its regional bets and view Iran as a regional power factor that cannot be ignored.”
      Riyadh turns to Tehran: containment over confrontation Behind closed doors, Saudi
      Arabia is advancing a strategy of “positive containment” with Iran. This marks
      a clear departure from the era of proxy wars and ideological hostility. Riyadh
      is no longer seeking confrontation – it is seeking coordination, particularly
      on issues of regional security and energy. Diplomatic sources inform The Cradle
      that the reopening of embassies and stepped-up security coordination are not mere
      side effects of Chinese mediation . They reflect a deeper Saudi conviction: that
      normalization with Israel yields no meaningful security dividends, especially
      after Tel Aviv’s exposed vulnerabilities in the last war. Riyadh’s new path also
      signals its growing appetite for regional solutions away from Washington – a position
      increasingly shared by other Persian Gulf states. For its part, the Islamic Republic
      is moving swiftly to convert military leverage into political capital. Beyond
      showcasing its missile and drone capabilities , Iran is now actively courting
      Arab states of the Persian Gulf with proposals for economic cooperation, regional
      integration, and the construction of an indigenous security architecture. Informed
      sources reveal to The Cradle that Iran is pursuing comprehensive engagement with
      Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Oman. This includes economic partnerships and
      alignment on key regional files, from Yemen to Syria and Iraq. Tehran’s position
      is consistent with its long-stated view: The Persian Gulf’s security must be decided
      by its littoral states and peoples – not by foreign agendas. A new Gulf alliance
      is taking shape This is no longer a Saudi story alone. The UAE is expanding economic
      cooperation with Tehran, while maintaining open security channels. Qatar sustains
      a solid diplomatic line with Iran, using its credibility to broker key regional
      talks. Oman remains the region’s trusted bridge and discreet mediator. An Arab
      diplomat briefed on recent developments tells The Cradle : “Upcoming Gulf–Iran
      meetings will address navigation in the Strait of Hormuz, energy coordination,
      and broader regional files. There is consensus building that understanding with
      Iran open the door to a more stable phase in the Gulf.” Amid these realignments,
      Israel finds itself regionally sidelined – its project to forge an anti-Iran axis
      has crumbled. The US-brokered Abraham Accords – once trumpeted as a strategic
      triumph – now elicit little more than polite disinterest across the Gulf, with
      even existing Arab signatories walking back their engagement. Riyadh’s political
      elite now openly question the utility of normalization. As Tel Aviv continues
      its war on Gaza, Gulf populations grow more vocal and Saudi leaders more cautious.
      The Saudi position is unspoken but unmistakable: Tel Aviv can no longer guarantee
      security, nor can it be viewed as the gatekeeper to regional stability any longer.
      Pragmatism trumps ideology This Saudi–Iranian thaw is not ideological – it is
      hard-nosed realpolitik. As another senior Arab diplomat tells The Cradle: “Riyadh
      is discarding illusions. Dialogue with neighbors – not alliance with Washington
      and Tel Aviv – is now the route to safeguarding Saudi interests. This is now about
      facts, not old loyalties. Iran is now a fixed component of the Gulf’s security
      equation.” The binary of “Gulf versus Iran” is fading. The last war accelerated
      a trend long in motion: the collapse of Pax Americana and the emergence of multipolar
      regionalism . The Gulf is charting a new course – one less beholden to US-Israeli
      diktats. Today, Saudi Arabia sees Tehran not as a threat to be neutralized, but
      as a power to be engaged . Regional security frameworks are being built from within.
      Israel, meanwhile, despite its many pontifications about a Tel Aviv-led, Arab-aligned
      “Middle East,” is struggling to stay relevant. If these dynamics hold, we are
      on the cusp of a historic transition – one that may finally allow the Persian
      Gulf to define its own security and sovereignty, on its own terms. This is not
      an ideal future. But it is a strategic upgrade from decades of subservience. Saudi
      Arabia is turning toward Iran – not out of love, but out of logic. Editor’s Note

    one_sentence_summary: The recent military confrontation between Iran and Israel
      has prompted a significant shift in regional power dynamics in the Persian Gulf,
      compelling Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, to reevaluate their security
      strategies in light of Iran's demonstrated military capabilities and the failures
      of US-Israeli influence.
    paragraph_summary: The recent military confrontation between Iran and Israel has
      significantly altered the power dynamics in the Persian Gulf, prompting Gulf states,
      particularly Saudi Arabia, to reevaluate their security strategies. Iran's strategic
      military response, executed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), highlighted
      Israel's vulnerabilities and demonstrated Iran's capability to engage in calibrated
      military actions without escalating to full-scale war. This situation has led
      Gulf nations to reconsider their long-standing alliances and seek more pragmatic,
      interest-driven relationships with Tehran, moving away from reliance on US-Israeli
      influence. An Arab diplomat noted that this conflict marks a pivotal shift in
      Saudi perceptions, recognizing Iran as a formidable military power that cannot
      be easily coerced.

      ordered the IDF to prepare a plan to establish a camp to concentrate the entire
      civilian population of Gaza on the ruins of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. According
      to Haaretz , Katz said that once Palestinian civilians are pushed into what he
      is calling a “humanitarian city,” they will not be allowed to leave. The idea
      is to first transfer 600,000 civilians from the al-Mawasi tent camp on the coast
      in southern Gaza, followed by the rest of the civilian population. Katz said that
      if conditions permit, the “city” could be built during a potential 60-day ceasefire,
      comments that will make Hamas less likely to agree to a temporary truce. The Israeli
      defense minister also said that during the ceasefire, Israel will maintain control
      of the “Morag Corridor,” a strip of land between Rafah and Khan Younis. Katz also
      suggested the camp can facilitate the government’s ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing,
      which it refers to as “voluntary migration,” telling reporters that Israel will
      implement “the emigration plan, which will happen.” Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel
      Smotrich has previously said that the goal of Israel’s current military operation,
      dubbed Gideon’s Chariots, is to create a concentration camp south of the Morag
      Corridor and pressure the civilians forced into it to leave. “The Gazan citizens
      will be concentrated in the south. They will be totally despairing, understanding
      that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for
      relocation to begin a new life in other places,” Smotrich said in May. Katz’s
      comments come after Reuters reported that the controversial US-backed Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF) had proposed to the US government the idea of creating camps
      it called “Humanitarian Transit Areas” inside Gaza or possibly outside Gaza. The
      GHF plan describes the camps as “large-scale” and “voluntary” places where the
      Palestinian population could “temporarily reside, deradicalize, re-integrate and
      prepare to relocate if they wish to do so.” Katz said Israel is seeking “international
      partners” to manage the zone and that four aid distribution sites would be set
      up inside the camp, suggesting the GHF will be involved in the plan. GHF aid sites
      are secured by American security contractors, who have been credibly accused of
      using live ammunition and stun grenades to disperse crowds of hungry Palestinian
      civilians. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      Press host Kristen Welker ( 6/29/25 ) showed courage by interviewing Zohran Mamdani,
      the winner of the Democratic mayoral primary for New York, after he’d been widely
      attacked by corporate media. But unfortunately, she fell into a trap that has
      been set repeatedly in recent months to smear Mamdani. She asked him to condemn
      the phrase “globalize the intifada,” claiming—without offering evidence—that the
      term “intifada” refers to “violence against Jews.” I doubt Welker is an Arabic
      linguist. But as a Palestinian journalist who covered the Intifada and helped
      introduce the term to Western media, I am appalled by this misrepresentation.
      Not only is the translation wrong, it’s an insult to the thousands of New York
      Jews who voted for Mamdani. For the record, intifada translates to “shake off.”
      Palestinians used the term to describe their popular resistance against an Israeli
      occupation of their land that had no end in sight. It emerged amid a steady expansion
      of illegal settlements, which were systematically turning the occupied territories
      into a Swiss cheese–like landscape, precisely designed to prevent the establishment
      of a Palestinian state. As someone who reported on the Intifada and explained
      its meaning to international audiences, I can say unequivocally: Intifada was
      used by Palestinian activists to describe a civil resistance movement rooted in
      dignity and national self-determination. Metaphor for liberation Let’s begin with
      the word’s literal meaning. As noted, in Arabic, intifada simply means “shaking
      off.” Since many—including Jewish leaders, Christian Zionists and GOP officials—have
      distorted the peaceful intentions behind the word, I turned to a source that might
      resonate more clearly with people of faith: the Bible. In the Arabic version of
      the Old Testament, the word intifada appears three times, both as a noun and a
      verb. Looking at its English equivalents in the New International Version (though
      other translations are similar) offers enlightening context: Judges 16:20 : “Samson
      awoke from his sleep and thought, ‘I’ll go out as before and shake myself free
      .’” Isaiah 52:2 : “ Shake off your dust; rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem. Free
      yourself from the chains on your neck, Daughter Zion, now a captive.” Psalm 109:23
      : “I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.” Each of
      these examples uses the term intifada —shaking off oppression, captivity or anguish—as
      a metaphor for liberation, not violence. While Google Translate and other modern
      tools often render intifada as “popular uprising,” its literal meaning—“to shake
      off”—captures the spirit with which Palestinians adopted the term. When they launched
      the first Intifada in 1987—after 20 years under a foreign military occupation—it
      was an expression of a desire to wake up, rise and throw off the chains of subjugation.
      It is not inherently antisemitic, nor does it refer by default to terrorism or
      violence. While accompanying international journalists covering the protests,
      I often discussed this with them. In Jerusalem, I explained to LA Times bureau
      chief Dan Fisher, the Washington Post ’s Glenn Frankel and the New York Times
      ’ John Kifner what Palestinians meant by the word. I told them that throughout
      Palestinian patriotic literature and slogans, two distinctions were always made:
      The Intifada was a protest against the Israeli occupation, not against Jews or
      the existence of Israel, and that the ultimate goal was to achieve an independent
      Palestinian state alongside Israel. Fisher , Frankel and Kifner included these
      clarifications in their reports, helping the Arabic term intifada enter the global
      lexicon with its intended meaning. ‘Bringing terror to the streets of America’
      But today, as protests against Israel’s devastating war on Gaza mount, the word
      is being twisted. When Rep. Elise Stefanik grilled the presidents of UPenn, Harvard,
      and MIT in December 2023 about pro-Palestinian chants invoking “intifada,” she
      equated the term with “genocide of Jews.” The university presidents faltered.
      They should have said clearly: Genocide against Jews—or any people—is abhorrent.
      But intifada is not synonymous with genocide. To equate a call to end the Israeli
      military occupation with a call for genocide or violence against Jews is a gross
      distortion—a bizarre reversal that paints the victims as aggressors. And yet this
      distortion persists. [Gillibrand] Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled
      Mamdani antisemitic. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt—who likely
      doesn’t speak Arabic— claimed on X that intifada is “explicit incitement to violence.”
      Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) added that the word is “well understood to refer to
      the violent terror attacks.” Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) told WNYC public
      radio ( 6/26/25 ), “The global intifada is a statement that means destroy Israel
      and kill all the Jews.” Media echoed the politicians’ misrepresentations of intifada
      . “Many Jews see it as a call to violence against Israeli civilians,” ABC ( 6/29/25
      ) reported. “Many Jews consider it a call to violence, a nod to deadly attacks
      on civilians in Israel by Palestinians in uprisings in the 1980s and 2000s,” wrote
      the New York Times ( 6/25/25 ). Of course, “many Jews” do not hear the word that
      way—but the more important question is, what is the accurate understanding of
      the word as used by Palestinians? Fox News ( 5/23/25 ) didn’t mince words: “‘Intifada’
      Means Bringing Terror to the Streets of America,” it said in a headline, citing
      notorious Islamophobe Douglas Murray. To the New York Times ‘ Bret Stephens (
      7/1/25 ), “What Intifada Really Means” is “giving moral comfort to people who
      deliberately murder innocent Jews.” Even liberal podcast host Donny Deutsch repeated
      the same claim while speaking on MSNBC ( Morning Joe , 6/30/25 ): I’m outraged
      that we have a candidate for mayor of New York, Mr. Mamdani, that cannot walk
      back or cannot condemn the words “globalize the intifada” and his nuance of, “Well,
      it means different things for different people.” Well, let me tell you what it
      means to a Jew—it means violence. Brutal suppression of protest The first Intifada
      embraced principles of nonviolent resistance championed by Martin Luther King
      Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. My cousin, Mubarak Awad , who established the Palestinian
      Center for the Study of Nonviolence, encouraged boycotts of Israeli products,
      labor strikes and grassroots economic development in preparation for statehood.
      He translated, printed and distributed Arabic translations of Gene Sharp’s writings
      on nonviolence throughout the occupied territories. Mubarak was deported on the
      eve of the Intifada by then–Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. After Shamir
      came Yitzhak Rabin, who called publicly to “ break the bones ” of Palestinian
      stone throwers. During the first Intifada, Israeli soldiers and settlers responded
      to the nonfatal protests with extreme violence. In the first phase of the uprising—a
      little more than a year—332 Palestinians were killed, along with 12 Israelis (
      Middle East Monitor , 12/8/16 ). This brutality did not suppress the protests,
      but merely escalated the violence: At the end of six years, more than 1,500 Palestinians,
      including more than 300 children, and 400 Israelis—18 of whom were children—were
      dead , according to the Israeli human rights group B’tselem. The same pattern
      recurred in the second Intifada: Only after the initial protests were met with
      massively disproportionate force did Palestinians, led by Hamas, turn to suicide
      bombing as a desperation tactic ( Al Jazeera , 9/28/20 ). To treat the response
      to the brutal suppression of protest as though it represented the essential nature
      of intifada is intellectually lazy and politically cynical. Zohran Mamdani never
      used the words “global intifada.” But he refused to denounce calls for the world
      to wake up and speak out against atrocities in Gaza. His victory in the Democratic
      primary—supported in part by Jewish New Yorkers—shows he is neither antisemitic
      nor willing to renounce an Arabic word that has been hijacked and misused by people
      who would rather Palestinians remain silent and submissive under occupation. Research

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab critiques
      Meet the Press host Kristen Welker for misrepresenting the term "intifada" during
      an interview with Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic mayoral primary winner in New York.
      Kuttab argues that Welker's suggestion that "intifada" implies violence against
      Jews is a significant misinterpretation, as the term actually means "to shake
      off" and has historically been used by Palestinians to describe their nonviolent
      resistance against Israeli occupation and illegal settlements. He emphasizes that
      the intifada symbolizes a struggle for dignity and national self-determination,
      and he expresses disappointment in the media's portrayal of this term, which he
      believes undermines the understanding of the Palestinian cause and disrespects
      the diverse opinions of Jewish voters who support Mamdani.

      Press host Kristen Welker ( 6/29/25 ) showed courage by interviewing Zohran Mamdani,
      the winner of the Democratic mayoral primary for New York, after he’d been widely
      attacked by corporate media. But unfortunately, she fell into a trap that has
      been set repeatedly in recent months to smear Mamdani. She asked him to condemn
      the phrase “globalize the intifada,” claiming—without offering evidence—that the
      term “intifada” refers to “violence against Jews.” I doubt Welker is an Arabic
      linguist. But as a Palestinian journalist who covered the Intifada and helped
      introduce the term to Western media, I am appalled by this misrepresentation.
      Not only is the translation wrong, it’s an insult to the thousands of New York
      Jews who voted for Mamdani. For the record, intifada translates to “shake off.”
      Palestinians used the term to describe their popular resistance against an Israeli
      occupation of their land that had no end in sight. It emerged amid a steady expansion
      of illegal settlements, which were systematically turning the occupied territories
      into a Swiss cheese–like landscape, precisely designed to prevent the establishment
      of a Palestinian state. As someone who reported on the Intifada and explained
      its meaning to international audiences, I can say unequivocally: Intifada was
      used by Palestinian activists to describe a civil resistance movement rooted in
      dignity and national self-determination. Metaphor for liberation Let’s begin with
      the word’s literal meaning. As noted, in Arabic, intifada simply means “shaking
      off.” Since many—including Jewish leaders, Christian Zionists and GOP officials—have
      distorted the peaceful intentions behind the word, I turned to a source that might
      resonate more clearly with people of faith: the Bible. In the Arabic version of
      the Old Testament, the word intifada appears three times, both as a noun and a
      verb. Looking at its English equivalents in the New International Version (though
      other translations are similar) offers enlightening context: Judges 16:20 : “Samson
      awoke from his sleep and thought, ‘I’ll go out as before and shake myself free
      .’” Isaiah 52:2 : “ Shake off your dust; rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem. Free
      yourself from the chains on your neck, Daughter Zion, now a captive.” Psalm 109:23
      : “I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.” Each of
      these examples uses the term intifada —shaking off oppression, captivity or anguish—as
      a metaphor for liberation, not violence. While Google Translate and other modern
      tools often render intifada as “popular uprising,” its literal meaning—“to shake
      off”—captures the spirit with which Palestinians adopted the term. When they launched
      the first Intifada in 1987—after 20 years under a foreign military occupation—it
      was an expression of a desire to wake up, rise and throw off the chains of subjugation.
      It is not inherently antisemitic, nor does it refer by default to terrorism or
      violence. While accompanying international journalists covering the protests,
      I often discussed this with them. In Jerusalem, I explained to LA Times bureau
      chief Dan Fisher, the Washington Post ’s Glenn Frankel and the New York Times
      ’ John Kifner what Palestinians meant by the word. I told them that throughout
      Palestinian patriotic literature and slogans, two distinctions were always made:
      The Intifada was a protest against the Israeli occupation, not against Jews or
      the existence of Israel, and that the ultimate goal was to achieve an independent
      Palestinian state alongside Israel. Fisher , Frankel and Kifner included these
      clarifications in their reports, helping the Arabic term intifada enter the global
      lexicon with its intended meaning. ‘Bringing terror to the streets of America’
      But today, as protests against Israel’s devastating war on Gaza mount, the word
      is being twisted. When Rep. Elise Stefanik grilled the presidents of UPenn, Harvard,
      and MIT in December 2023 about pro-Palestinian chants invoking “intifada,” she
      equated the term with “genocide of Jews.” The university presidents faltered.
      They should have said clearly: Genocide against Jews—or any people—is abhorrent.
      But intifada is not synonymous with genocide. To equate a call to end the Israeli
      military occupation with a call for genocide or violence against Jews is a gross
      distortion—a bizarre reversal that paints the victims as aggressors. And yet this
      distortion persists. [Gillibrand] Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled
      Mamdani antisemitic. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt—who likely
      doesn’t speak Arabic— claimed on X that intifada is “explicit incitement to violence.”
      Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) added that the word is “well understood to refer to
      the violent terror attacks.” Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) told WNYC public
      radio ( 6/26/25 ), “The global intifada is a statement that means destroy Israel
      and kill all the Jews.” Media echoed the politicians’ misrepresentations of intifada
      . “Many Jews see it as a call to violence against Israeli civilians,” ABC ( 6/29/25
      ) reported. “Many Jews consider it a call to violence, a nod to deadly attacks
      on civilians in Israel by Palestinians in uprisings in the 1980s and 2000s,” wrote
      the New York Times ( 6/25/25 ). Of course, “many Jews” do not hear the word that
      way—but the more important question is, what is the accurate understanding of
      the word as used by Palestinians? Fox News ( 5/23/25 ) didn’t mince words: “‘Intifada’
      Means Bringing Terror to the Streets of America,” it said in a headline, citing
      notorious Islamophobe Douglas Murray. To the New York Times ‘ Bret Stephens (
      7/1/25 ), “What Intifada Really Means” is “giving moral comfort to people who
      deliberately murder innocent Jews.” Even liberal podcast host Donny Deutsch repeated
      the same claim while speaking on MSNBC ( Morning Joe , 6/30/25 ): I’m outraged
      that we have a candidate for mayor of New York, Mr. Mamdani, that cannot walk
      back or cannot condemn the words “globalize the intifada” and his nuance of, “Well,
      it means different things for different people.” Well, let me tell you what it
      means to a Jew—it means violence. Brutal suppression of protest The first Intifada
      embraced principles of nonviolent resistance championed by Martin Luther King
      Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. My cousin, Mubarak Awad , who established the Palestinian
      Center for the Study of Nonviolence, encouraged boycotts of Israeli products,
      labor strikes and grassroots economic development in preparation for statehood.
      He translated, printed and distributed Arabic translations of Gene Sharp’s writings
      on nonviolence throughout the occupied territories. Mubarak was deported on the
      eve of the Intifada by then–Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. After Shamir
      came Yitzhak Rabin, who called publicly to “ break the bones ” of Palestinian
      stone throwers. During the first Intifada, Israeli soldiers and settlers responded
      to the nonfatal protests with extreme violence. In the first phase of the uprising—a
      little more than a year—332 Palestinians were killed, along with 12 Israelis (
      Middle East Monitor , 12/8/16 ). This brutality did not suppress the protests,
      but merely escalated the violence: At the end of six years, more than 1,500 Palestinians,
      including more than 300 children, and 400 Israelis—18 of whom were children—were
      dead , according to the Israeli human rights group B’tselem. The same pattern
      recurred in the second Intifada: Only after the initial protests were met with
      massively disproportionate force did Palestinians, led by Hamas, turn to suicide
      bombing as a desperation tactic ( Al Jazeera , 9/28/20 ). To treat the response
      to the brutal suppression of protest as though it represented the essential nature
      of intifada is intellectually lazy and politically cynical. Zohran Mamdani never
      used the words “global intifada.” But he refused to denounce calls for the world
      to wake up and speak out against atrocities in Gaza. His victory in the Democratic
      primary—supported in part by Jewish New Yorkers—shows he is neither antisemitic
      nor willing to renounce an Arabic word that has been hijacked and misused by people
      who would rather Palestinians remain silent and submissive under occupation. Research

      Ludwig / Truthout Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska cast a deciding vote
      for the GOP’s unpopular budget package after publicly admitting the bill is “bad”
      and would disadvantage people across the United States. After negotiating carveouts
      to protect some of her own constituents, Murkowski urged House Republicans to
      make revisions before sending the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk. Polls
      show the package is historically unpopular given its size and scope, but even
      Republicans who raised concerns about harming their own constituents fell in line.
      “I know that in many parts of the country, there are Americans who are not going
      to be advantaged by this bill,” Murkowski told reporters after voting for the
      package. “I don’t like that.” However, the House quickly voted along party lines
      to pass the bill, including multiple Republicans who previously expressed concern
      over deep cuts to health care and nutrition programs their constituents rely on.
      The cuts will pay for Trump’s brutal immigration crackdown as well as tax cuts
      to benefit his wealthy donors; all in all, the bill is projected to cost low-income
      families about $1,600 each year while boosting incomes for the highest earners
      by $12,000. At least two Republicans announced early retirement from Congress
      after facing controversy over Medicaid cuts that will push millions off health
      insurance. Trump signed the legislation into law on July 4. With at least one
      safety net hospital in Nebraska already announcing plans to close due to funding
      insecurity, and Democrats chomping at the bit for the midterms, why did so many
      vulnerable Republicans fall in line? Democrats say Republicans are terrified of
      Trump, but according to Omar Noureldin, the senior vice president for policy and
      litigation at Common Cause, the corruptive influence of big money in politics
      is a key reason why a bill like this one could pass. That influence exploded after
      the Supreme Court’s 2010 landmark decision in Citizens United vs. FEC , which
      dissolved decades-old restrictions on corporate political spending and ushered
      in the era of super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money. The
      cost of campaigns skyrocketed , and tens of billions of dollars now pour into
      federal elections during a single season. “A budget is a moral document. The reason
      why a bill like that can pass even though it has destructive effects on communities
      in red states and blue states is because of the corruptive influence of money
      in politics,” Noureldin said in an interview. “We’re at a place where a billionaire’s
      budget passed because money prevailed over morals.” Along with a coalition of
      public interest groups, Common Cause was instrumental in passing the Federal Election
      Campaign Act of 1971, which created the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) and
      set limits and rules for political contributions that became the bedrock of modern
      campaign finance law. Republicans and right-wing groups have challenged the law
      in court ever since, allowing conservative judges to chip away at contribution
      limits with Citizens United and related cases over the years. As Republicans deliberated
      over Trump’s bill on June 30, the Supreme Court agreed to consider another GOP
      lawsuit against the FEC. “You can’t begin to understand why one party would pass
      a bill that is unbelievably unpopular for stripping health care from poor people
      unless you understand Citizens United,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of
      the watchdog group Public Citizen, in an interview. The case that the Supreme
      Court agreed to hear calls on the First Amendment in an attempt to dismantle one
      of the last remaining pillars of campaign finance law. With Trump appointees among
      a solid conservative majority, the court will consider whether to strike down
      limits on coordinated campaign spending between candidates and political parties,
      which would blow the cap off the amount of money wealthy donors can funnel toward
      their preferred candidate through partisan “coordination” committees. The effort
      is a longtime priority for Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former GOP Senate majority
      leader who has long argued for more money in politics and filed a brief in support
      of the lawsuit in January. The Justice Department has traditionally defended the
      FEC regardless of which party controls the White House. However, the Trump administration
      refused to intervene in this case, leaving the job of defending limits on coordinated
      campaign spending to the Democratic Party. For the first time, Trump’s 2024 reelection
      campaign outsourced many key functions to super PACs and outside groups funded
      by a handful of wealthy donors, including tech mega-billionaire and DOGE founder
      Elon Musk , who was rewarded with a powerful, if temporary, position inside the
      White House. Musk is now attempting to forge his own political party after falling
      out with Trump. “We refuse to sit on the sidelines as Trump’s DOJ and the Republican
      Party attempt to throw out longstanding election laws for their own benefit,”
      said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, in a joint statement
      with other party leaders last week. “Republicans know their grassroots support
      is drying up across the country, and they want to drown out the will of the voters.”
      At issue are limits on how closely campaigns and political parties can coordinate
      the spending of donations from wealthy supporters of a particular candidate. Republicans
      argue political parties exist to elect candidates, so limits on campaign spending
      violate their First Amendment rights. However, Weissman said the GOP conflates
      the right to speak freely with the ability of the ultra-rich to drown out competing
      voices during election season. The Supreme Court has agreed with Republicans in
      past cases, including Citizens United , which famously granted corporations free
      speech rights. “The shell of what’s left is dollar restrictions on direct contributions
      to candidates,” Weissman said. “There’s already unlimited spending by rich people
      and corporations on outside entities such as super PACs … but if the outside entities
      are the specific party structure and can coordinate with candidates, then that
      direct contribution restriction is of diminishingly microscopic importance.” In
      other words, a billionaire seeking to influence a political candidate can skirt
      contribution limits by funneling money through the candidate’s political party,
      and without the current rules on the books, the party could coordinate directly
      with the candidate to spend the billionaire’s cash on millions of targeted ads.
      Campaign “coordination” committees already exist and are used extensively by both
      parties — the deadlocked FEC rarely enforces existing law — but a Supreme Court
      ruling against the FEC would further open the campaign cash floodgates and set
      a dangerous precedent, according to Noureldin. “This challenge would allow for
      there to be basically unlimited spending by political parties to get their candidates
      elected, and right now there are limits on their coordinated spending depending
      on the rules for Senate and House races,” Noureldin said. Billionaires are already
      taking advantage of holes in campaign finance law and a weak FEC. Noureldin said
      transparency proponents may be tempted to see an upside to parties spending unlimited
      donations in coordination with campaigns, because at least the names of those
      donors and the dollar amounts they spend must be reported to the public — a contrast
      to the so-called “dark money” that has exploded in politics, allowing the wealthy
      to influence elections anonymously. Currently, donations from an individual donor
      to a federal candidate’s campaign is capped at $3,500 per election under FEC rules,
      but donors can funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle through
      “additional accounts” at national party committees used to pay for presidential
      nominating conventions and legal challenges against election results, for example.
      Under these rules, Musk openly spent $277 million to elect Trump and Republicans
      in the last election and went on to dismantle lifesaving USAID programs through
      DOGE , which researchers say could lead to more than 14 million deaths worldwide
      over the next five years. Noureldin noted an FEC guidance for the 2024 election
      that defined “coordination” between campaigns and parties as “public” communication
      such as TV ads. However, fundraising solicitations and canvassing did not fall
      under the “public” category, allowing Musk to spend $100 million on Trump’s door-to-door
      ground game in 2024 while Trump centralized the Republican Party fundraising under
      his control . “What we’re having here is an all-out assault on any regulation
      on big money in politics,” Noureldin said, adding that as of May, the FEC lacks
      a quorum and its ability to do anything at this point is limited. “Congress is
      not looking at these issues anymore, because for one, there is a benefit to having
      this unlimited money in politics, and that is the sort of ‘soft corruption’ we’ve
      been talking about.” Noureldin and Weissman said there are already anti-corruption
      laws on the books against bribing politicians; the point of campaign finance regulation
      is to prevent billionaires like Musk from skirting these laws through third parties
      — including political parties. The Supreme Court has traditionally weighed the
      First Amendment claims made by Republican challengers in defense of billionaires,
      megadonors and, in this case, political parties, against the corrupting influence
      of unlimited campaign cash. Noureldin said conservative Supreme Court justices
      tend to take an “absolutist” view on corruption and have sided with the GOP’s
      free speech claims in Citizens United and other cases, which discourages Congress
      from regulating money in politics. “What the Supreme Court does not do is make
      policy decisions about how much or in what context we should have tighter disclosure
      requirements or do other things to mitigate the harms of political spending,”
      Noureldin said. “Our view is that this requires more nuanced policymaking, and
      that is for Congress to do. But once the Supreme Court makes this a constitutional
      issue, then no Congress in the future can do anything, and that is what the court
      has been doing in these cases going all the way back to Buckley vs. Valeo , ”
      referring to the 1976 landmark decision that struck down limits on expenditures
      by candidates and parties in federal elections. Noureldin said it’s not just the
      soft corruption associated with unlimited campaign donations that advocates are
      worried about, but the perception of corruption among the voting public. After
      Musk and other billionaires spent billions of dollars to elect Trump and the Republicans
      who just voted to slash the social safety net, the latest campaign finance case
      before the Supreme Court could become a flashpoint ahead of the 2026 midterms
      elections. “If the public believes their vote doesn’t matter, and that wealthy
      people are always going to get their way because of the amount of money they paid
      to get a candidate elected, then folks sit out elections,” Noureldin said. A Pew
      survey in 2023 found that 85 percent of Americans said the cost of running a political
      campaign makes it hard for “good people” to run for office, and a solid majority
      (63 percent) said all or most elected officials ran for office out of self-interest
      and a desire to make money. The public also rates members of Congress poorly on
      listening to people in their districts, making compromises with the other party,
      and “taking responsibility for their actions.” That’s why it must be lawmakers
      themselves, not the Supreme Court, who call out the problem and legislate new
      solutions for reducing the corruptive influence of big money in politics, Noureldin
      said. “We do need a new national conversation about money in politics, and that
      needs to be led by our elected legislators, for them to come out and say, ‘Yes,
      the soft corruption and corrosive influence is real. I’m a member of Congress,
      and I am telling you.’” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      Alaska voted in favor of a budget package that she publicly criticized as "bad"
      and detrimental to many Americans. Despite acknowledging the bill's unpopularity
      and its potential negative impact on her constituents, Murkowski negotiated specific
      protections for them and urged House Republicans to revise the legislation before
      it reached President Trump's desk. The House passed the bill along party lines,
      with several Republicans who had previously expressed concerns about cuts to essential
      health care and nutrition programs ultimately supporting it. The legislation,
      which aims to fund Trump's immigration policies and tax cuts for the wealthy,
      is expected to cost low-income families approximately $1,600 annually while providing
      significant financial benefits to high earners. Following backlash over the Medicaid
      cuts, which threaten millions of health insurance recipients, some Republicans
      announced their retirement. The bill was signed into law on July 4, raising questions

      Ludwig / Truthout Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska cast a deciding vote
      for the GOP’s unpopular budget package after publicly admitting the bill is “bad”
      and would disadvantage people across the United States. After negotiating carveouts
      to protect some of her own constituents, Murkowski urged House Republicans to
      make revisions before sending the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk. Polls
      show the package is historically unpopular given its size and scope, but even
      Republicans who raised concerns about harming their own constituents fell in line.
      “I know that in many parts of the country, there are Americans who are not going
      to be advantaged by this bill,” Murkowski told reporters after voting for the
      package. “I don’t like that.” However, the House quickly voted along party lines
      to pass the bill, including multiple Republicans who previously expressed concern
      over deep cuts to health care and nutrition programs their constituents rely on.
      The cuts will pay for Trump’s brutal immigration crackdown as well as tax cuts
      to benefit his wealthy donors; all in all, the bill is projected to cost low-income
      families about $1,600 each year while boosting incomes for the highest earners
      by $12,000. At least two Republicans announced early retirement from Congress
      after facing controversy over Medicaid cuts that will push millions off health
      insurance. Trump signed the legislation into law on July 4. With at least one
      safety net hospital in Nebraska already announcing plans to close due to funding
      insecurity, and Democrats chomping at the bit for the midterms, why did so many
      vulnerable Republicans fall in line? Democrats say Republicans are terrified of
      Trump, but according to Omar Noureldin, the senior vice president for policy and
      litigation at Common Cause, the corruptive influence of big money in politics
      is a key reason why a bill like this one could pass. That influence exploded after
      the Supreme Court’s 2010 landmark decision in Citizens United vs. FEC , which
      dissolved decades-old restrictions on corporate political spending and ushered
      in the era of super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money. The
      cost of campaigns skyrocketed , and tens of billions of dollars now pour into
      federal elections during a single season. “A budget is a moral document. The reason
      why a bill like that can pass even though it has destructive effects on communities
      in red states and blue states is because of the corruptive influence of money
      in politics,” Noureldin said in an interview. “We’re at a place where a billionaire’s
      budget passed because money prevailed over morals.” Along with a coalition of
      public interest groups, Common Cause was instrumental in passing the Federal Election
      Campaign Act of 1971, which created the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) and
      set limits and rules for political contributions that became the bedrock of modern
      campaign finance law. Republicans and right-wing groups have challenged the law
      in court ever since, allowing conservative judges to chip away at contribution
      limits with Citizens United and related cases over the years. As Republicans deliberated
      over Trump’s bill on June 30, the Supreme Court agreed to consider another GOP
      lawsuit against the FEC. “You can’t begin to understand why one party would pass
      a bill that is unbelievably unpopular for stripping health care from poor people
      unless you understand Citizens United,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of
      the watchdog group Public Citizen, in an interview. The case that the Supreme
      Court agreed to hear calls on the First Amendment in an attempt to dismantle one
      of the last remaining pillars of campaign finance law. With Trump appointees among
      a solid conservative majority, the court will consider whether to strike down
      limits on coordinated campaign spending between candidates and political parties,
      which would blow the cap off the amount of money wealthy donors can funnel toward
      their preferred candidate through partisan “coordination” committees. The effort
      is a longtime priority for Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former GOP Senate majority
      leader who has long argued for more money in politics and filed a brief in support
      of the lawsuit in January. The Justice Department has traditionally defended the
      FEC regardless of which party controls the White House. However, the Trump administration
      refused to intervene in this case, leaving the job of defending limits on coordinated
      campaign spending to the Democratic Party. For the first time, Trump’s 2024 reelection
      campaign outsourced many key functions to super PACs and outside groups funded
      by a handful of wealthy donors, including tech mega-billionaire and DOGE founder
      Elon Musk , who was rewarded with a powerful, if temporary, position inside the
      White House. Musk is now attempting to forge his own political party after falling
      out with Trump. “We refuse to sit on the sidelines as Trump’s DOJ and the Republican
      Party attempt to throw out longstanding election laws for their own benefit,”
      said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, in a joint statement
      with other party leaders last week. “Republicans know their grassroots support
      is drying up across the country, and they want to drown out the will of the voters.”
      At issue are limits on how closely campaigns and political parties can coordinate
      the spending of donations from wealthy supporters of a particular candidate. Republicans
      argue political parties exist to elect candidates, so limits on campaign spending
      violate their First Amendment rights. However, Weissman said the GOP conflates
      the right to speak freely with the ability of the ultra-rich to drown out competing
      voices during election season. The Supreme Court has agreed with Republicans in
      past cases, including Citizens United , which famously granted corporations free
      speech rights. “The shell of what’s left is dollar restrictions on direct contributions
      to candidates,” Weissman said. “There’s already unlimited spending by rich people
      and corporations on outside entities such as super PACs … but if the outside entities
      are the specific party structure and can coordinate with candidates, then that
      direct contribution restriction is of diminishingly microscopic importance.” In
      other words, a billionaire seeking to influence a political candidate can skirt
      contribution limits by funneling money through the candidate’s political party,
      and without the current rules on the books, the party could coordinate directly
      with the candidate to spend the billionaire’s cash on millions of targeted ads.
      Campaign “coordination” committees already exist and are used extensively by both
      parties — the deadlocked FEC rarely enforces existing law — but a Supreme Court
      ruling against the FEC would further open the campaign cash floodgates and set
      a dangerous precedent, according to Noureldin. “This challenge would allow for
      there to be basically unlimited spending by political parties to get their candidates
      elected, and right now there are limits on their coordinated spending depending
      on the rules for Senate and House races,” Noureldin said. Billionaires are already
      taking advantage of holes in campaign finance law and a weak FEC. Noureldin said
      transparency proponents may be tempted to see an upside to parties spending unlimited
      donations in coordination with campaigns, because at least the names of those
      donors and the dollar amounts they spend must be reported to the public — a contrast
      to the so-called “dark money” that has exploded in politics, allowing the wealthy
      to influence elections anonymously. Currently, donations from an individual donor
      to a federal candidate’s campaign is capped at $3,500 per election under FEC rules,
      but donors can funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle through
      “additional accounts” at national party committees used to pay for presidential
      nominating conventions and legal challenges against election results, for example.
      Under these rules, Musk openly spent $277 million to elect Trump and Republicans
      in the last election and went on to dismantle lifesaving USAID programs through
      DOGE , which researchers say could lead to more than 14 million deaths worldwide
      over the next five years. Noureldin noted an FEC guidance for the 2024 election
      that defined “coordination” between campaigns and parties as “public” communication
      such as TV ads. However, fundraising solicitations and canvassing did not fall
      under the “public” category, allowing Musk to spend $100 million on Trump’s door-to-door
      ground game in 2024 while Trump centralized the Republican Party fundraising under
      his control . “What we’re having here is an all-out assault on any regulation
      on big money in politics,” Noureldin said, adding that as of May, the FEC lacks
      a quorum and its ability to do anything at this point is limited. “Congress is
      not looking at these issues anymore, because for one, there is a benefit to having
      this unlimited money in politics, and that is the sort of ‘soft corruption’ we’ve
      been talking about.” Noureldin and Weissman said there are already anti-corruption
      laws on the books against bribing politicians; the point of campaign finance regulation
      is to prevent billionaires like Musk from skirting these laws through third parties
      — including political parties. The Supreme Court has traditionally weighed the
      First Amendment claims made by Republican challengers in defense of billionaires,
      megadonors and, in this case, political parties, against the corrupting influence
      of unlimited campaign cash. Noureldin said conservative Supreme Court justices
      tend to take an “absolutist” view on corruption and have sided with the GOP’s
      free speech claims in Citizens United and other cases, which discourages Congress
      from regulating money in politics. “What the Supreme Court does not do is make
      policy decisions about how much or in what context we should have tighter disclosure
      requirements or do other things to mitigate the harms of political spending,”
      Noureldin said. “Our view is that this requires more nuanced policymaking, and
      that is for Congress to do. But once the Supreme Court makes this a constitutional
      issue, then no Congress in the future can do anything, and that is what the court
      has been doing in these cases going all the way back to Buckley vs. Valeo , ”
      referring to the 1976 landmark decision that struck down limits on expenditures
      by candidates and parties in federal elections. Noureldin said it’s not just the
      soft corruption associated with unlimited campaign donations that advocates are
      worried about, but the perception of corruption among the voting public. After
      Musk and other billionaires spent billions of dollars to elect Trump and the Republicans
      who just voted to slash the social safety net, the latest campaign finance case
      before the Supreme Court could become a flashpoint ahead of the 2026 midterms
      elections. “If the public believes their vote doesn’t matter, and that wealthy
      people are always going to get their way because of the amount of money they paid
      to get a candidate elected, then folks sit out elections,” Noureldin said. A Pew
      survey in 2023 found that 85 percent of Americans said the cost of running a political
      campaign makes it hard for “good people” to run for office, and a solid majority
      (63 percent) said all or most elected officials ran for office out of self-interest
      and a desire to make money. The public also rates members of Congress poorly on
      listening to people in their districts, making compromises with the other party,
      and “taking responsibility for their actions.” That’s why it must be lawmakers
      themselves, not the Supreme Court, who call out the problem and legislate new
      solutions for reducing the corruptive influence of big money in politics, Noureldin
      said. “We do need a new national conversation about money in politics, and that
      needs to be led by our elected legislators, for them to come out and say, ‘Yes,
      the soft corruption and corrosive influence is real. I’m a member of Congress,
      and I am telling you.’” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      health care and nutrition programs ultimately supporting it. The legislation,
      which aims to fund Trump's immigration policies and tax cuts for the wealthy,
      is expected to cost low-income families approximately $1,600 annually while providing
      significant financial benefits to high earners. Following backlash over the Medicaid
      cuts, which threaten millions of health insurance recipients, some Republicans
      announced their retirement. The bill was signed into law on July 4, raising questions
      about the motivations behind the party's unity in the face of potential electoral
      repercussions.

      Less than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a budget package that
      pushes annual military spending past $1 trillion, researchers on Tuesday published
      a report detailing how much major Pentagon contractors have raked in since 2020.
      Sharing The Guardian ‘s exclusive coverage of the paper on social media, U.K.-based
      climate scientist Bill McGuire wrote : “Are you a U.S. taxpayer? I am sure you
      will be delighted to know where $2.4 TRILLION of your money has gone.” The report
      from the Costs of War Project at Brown University’s Watson School of International
      and Public Affairs and the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft shows that
      from 2020-24 private firms received $2.4 trillion in Department of Defense contracts,
      or roughly 54% of DOD’s $4.4 trillion in discretionary spending for that five-year
      period. The publication highlights that “during those five years, $771 billion
      in Pentagon contracts went to just five firms: Lockheed Martin ($313 billion),
      RTX (formerly Raytheon, $145 billion), Boeing ($115 billion), General Dynamics
      ($116 billion), and Northrop Grumman ($81 billion).” In a statement about the
      findings, Stephanie Savell, director of the Costs of War Project, said that “these
      figures represent a continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to
      fund war and weapons manufacturing.” “This is not an arsenal of democracy—it’s
      an arsenal of profiteering,” Savell added. “We should keep the enormous and growing
      power of the arms industry in mind as we assess the rise of authoritarianism in
      the U.S. and globally.” Between 2020 and 2024, $771 billion in Pentagon contracts
      went to just five firms: Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop
      Grumman. By comparison, the total diplomacy, development, and humanitarian aid
      budget, excluding military aid, was $356 billion. [5/12] [image or embed] — The
      Costs of War Project ( @costsofwar.bsky.social ) July 8, 2025 at 2:43 PM The paper
      points out that “by comparison, the total diplomacy, development, and humanitarian
      aid budget, excluding military aid, was $356 billion. In other words, the U.S.
      government invested over twice as much money in five weapons companies as in diplomacy
      and international assistance.” “Record arms transfers have further boosted the
      bottom lines of weapons firms,” the document details. “These companies have benefited
      from tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel and Ukraine, paid for
      by U.S. taxpayers. U.S. military aid to Israel was over $18 billion in just the
      first year following October 2023; military aid to Ukraine totals $65 billion
      since the Russian invasion in 2022 through 2025.” “Additionally, a surge in foreign-funded
      arms sales to European allies, paid for by the recipient nations—over $170 billion
      in 2023 and 2024 alone—have provided additional revenue to arms contractors over
      and above the funds they receive directly from the Pentagon,” the paper adds.
      The 23-page report stresses that “annual U.S. military spending has grown significantly
      this century,” as presidents from both major parties have waged a so-called Global
      War on Terror and the DOD has continuously failed to pass an audit. Specifically,
      according to the paper, “the Pentagon’s discretionary budget—the annual funding
      approved by Congress and the large majority of its overall budget—rose from $507
      billion in 2000 to $843 billion in 2025 (in constant 2025 dollars), a 66% increase.
      Including military spending outside the Pentagon—primarily nuclear weapons programs
      at the Department of Energy, counterterrorism operations at the Federal Bureau
      of Investigation (FBI), and other military activities officially classified under
      ‘Budget Function 050’— total military spending grew from $531 billion in 2000
      to $899 billion in 2025, a 69% increase.” Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill
      Act passed earlier this month “adds $156 billion to this year’s total, pushing
      the 2025 military budget to $1.06 trillion,” the document notes. “After taking
      into account this supplemental funding, the U.S. military budget has nearly doubled
      this century, increasing 99% since 2000.” Noting that “taxpayers are expected
      to fund a $1 trillion Pentagon budget,” Security Policy Reform Institute co-founder
      Stephen Semler said the paper, which he co-authored, “illustrates what they’ll
      be paying for: a historic redistribution of wealth from the public to private
      industry.” Semler produced the report with William Hartung, senior research fellow
      at the Quincy Institute. Hartung said that “high Pentagon budgets are often justified
      because the funds are ‘for the troops.''” “But as this paper shows, the majority
      of the department’s budget goes to corporations, money that has as much to do
      with special interest lobbying as it does with any rational defense planning,”
      he continued. “Much of this funding has been wasted on dysfunctional or overpriced
      weapons systems and extravagant compensation packages.” The arms industry has
      used an array of tools of influence to create an atmosphere where a Pentagon budget
      that is $1 trillion per year is deemed “not enough” by some members of Congress.

      July 8, 2025 at 2:43 PM In addition to spotlighting how U.S. military budgets
      funnel billions of dollars to contractors each year, the report shines a light
      on the various ways the industry influences politics. “The ongoing influence of
      the arms industry over Congress operates through tens of millions in campaign
      contributions and the employment of 950 lobbyists, as of 2024,” the publication
      explains. “Military contractors also shape military policy and lobby to increase
      military spending by funding think tanks and serving on government commissions.”
      “Senior officials in government often go easy on major weapons companies so as
      not to ruin their chances of getting lucrative positions with them upon leaving
      government service,” the report notes. “For its part, the emerging military tech
      sector has opened a new version of the revolving door—the movement of ex-military
      officers and senior Pentagon officials, not to arms companies per se, but to the
      venture capital firms that invest in Silicon Valley arms industry startups.” The
      paper concludes by arguing that “the U.S. needs stronger congressional and public
      scrutiny of both current and emerging weapons contractors to avoid wasteful spending
      and reckless decision-making on issues of war and peace. Profits should not drive
      policy.” “In particular,” it adds, “the role of Silicon Valley startups and the
      venture capital firms that support them needs to be better understood and debated
      as the U.S. crafts a new foreign policy strategy that avoids unnecessary wars
      and prioritizes cooperation over confrontation.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      first year following October 2023; military aid to Ukraine totals $65 billion
      since the Russian invasion in 2022 through 2025.” “Additionally, a surge in foreign-funded
      arms sales to European allies, paid for by the recipient nations—over $170 billion
      in 2023 and 2024 alone—have provided additional revenue to arms contractors over
      and above the funds they receive directly from the Pentagon,” the paper adds.
      The 23-page report stresses that “annual U.S. military spending has grown significantly
      this century,” as presidents from both major parties have waged a so-called Global
      War on Terror and the DOD has continuously failed to pass an audit. Specifically,
      according to the paper, “the Pentagon’s discretionary budget—the annual funding
      approved by Congress and the large majority of its overall budget—rose from $507
      billion in 2000 to $843 billion in 2025 (in constant 2025 dollars), a 66% increase.
      Including military spending outside the Pentagon—primarily nuclear weapons programs
      at the Department of Energy, counterterrorism operations at the Federal Bureau
      of Investigation (FBI), and other military activities officially classified under
      ‘Budget Function 050’— total military spending grew from $531 billion in 2000
      to $899 billion in 2025, a 69% increase.” Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill
      Act passed earlier this month “adds $156 billion to this year’s total, pushing
      the 2025 military budget to $1.06 trillion,” the document notes. “After taking
      into account this supplemental funding, the U.S. military budget has nearly doubled
      this century, increasing 99% since 2000.” Noting that “taxpayers are expected
      to fund a $1 trillion Pentagon budget,” Security Policy Reform Institute co-founder
      Stephen Semler said the paper, which he co-authored, “illustrates what they’ll
      be paying for: a historic redistribution of wealth from the public to private
      industry.” Semler produced the report with William Hartung, senior research fellow
      at the Quincy Institute. Hartung said that “high Pentagon budgets are often justified
      because the funds are ‘for the troops.''” “But as this paper shows, the majority
      of the department’s budget goes to corporations, money that has as much to do
      with special interest lobbying as it does with any rational defense planning,”
      he continued. “Much of this funding has been wasted on dysfunctional or overpriced
      weapons systems and extravagant compensation packages.” The arms industry has
      used an array of tools of influence to create an atmosphere where a Pentagon budget
      that is $1 trillion per year is deemed “not enough” by some members of Congress.

      July 8, 2025 at 2:43 PM In addition to spotlighting how U.S. military budgets
      funnel billions of dollars to contractors each year, the report shines a light
      on the various ways the industry influences politics. “The ongoing influence of
      the arms industry over Congress operates through tens of millions in campaign
      contributions and the employment of 950 lobbyists, as of 2024,” the publication
      explains. “Military contractors also shape military policy and lobby to increase
      military spending by funding think tanks and serving on government commissions.”
      “Senior officials in government often go easy on major weapons companies so as
      not to ruin their chances of getting lucrative positions with them upon leaving
      government service,” the report notes. “For its part, the emerging military tech
      sector has opened a new version of the revolving door—the movement of ex-military
      officers and senior Pentagon officials, not to arms companies per se, but to the
      venture capital firms that invest in Silicon Valley arms industry startups.” The
      paper concludes by arguing that “the U.S. needs stronger congressional and public
      scrutiny of both current and emerging weapons contractors to avoid wasteful spending
      and reckless decision-making on issues of war and peace. Profits should not drive
      policy.” “In particular,” it adds, “the role of Silicon Valley startups and the
      venture capital firms that support them needs to be better understood and debated
      as the U.S. crafts a new foreign policy strategy that avoids unnecessary wars
      and prioritizes cooperation over confrontation.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment

    one_sentence_summary: A recent report reveals that major Pentagon contractors have
      received $2.4 trillion since 2020, coinciding with President Trump's signing of
      a budget package that increases annual military spending to over $1 trillion.
    paragraph_summary: A recent report from the Costs of War Project and the Quincy
      Institute reveals that from 2020 to 2024, U.S. taxpayers funded $2.4 trillion
      in Department of Defense contracts, with a significant portion going to major
      defense contractors. This figure represents approximately 54% of the Department
      of Defense's discretionary spending during that period. Notably, five firms—Lockheed
      Martin, RTX, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman—accounted for $771
      billion of these contracts. Stephanie Savell, director of the Costs of War Project,
      criticized this trend as a "massive transfer of wealth" from taxpayers to the
      arms industry, emphasizing the implications for rising authoritarianism both in
      the U.S. and globally.

      donation . By Les Leopold / Substack Many moons ago, the late Sam Myers, UAW 259
      president, asked me to run a workshop for auto mechanics in the New York area.
      Sam, an old-time socialist who somehow survived the McCarthy era labor purges,
      was eager to expose his workers to our new political economy courses. At the end
      of the first workshop, I slipped in one final question on politics: “Should labor
      support the Democrats, the Republicans, or a new party of working people?” Nearly
      everyone’s hand shot up for the prospect of a new labor party. Sam shot up too
      and said, “You can’t do that! We need to support the Democrats, no matter what.”
      And that was the end of the conversation. For many labor leaders today not much
      has changed. They are still all in for the Democrats, even though more of their
      rank-and-file members are not. Many have drifted to the Republicans. Others have
      stopped voting. And nearly all feel that the Democrats have let them down. No
      amount of cajoling will bring these disappointed workers back to the Dems. Yet
      many union leaders continue the ritual, pushing union voters toward the Democrats
      while praying that nearly half their members who vote the other way won’t rebel.
      It isn’t working. It’s time to build a political home for these disaffected working
      people, not only those who have given up on the Democrats, but also those who
      have been attracted to the Republicans’ rhetorical turn to populism. That’s certainly
      what workers say they want, according to the recent YouGov survey we conducted
      of 3,000 voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. (See here and
      here .) Our survey shows that 57 percent of the Rust Belt voters support the following
      statement. Note especially the first two policy proposals: Would you support a
      new organization, the Independent Workers Political Association, that would support
      working-class issues independent of both the Democratic and Republican parties.
      It would run and support independent political candidates committed to a platform
      that included Stop big companies that receive tax dollars from laying off workers
      who pay taxes. Guarantee everyone who wants to work has a decent-paying job, and
      if the private sector can’t provide it, the government will Raise the minimum
      wage so every family can lead a decent life Stop drug company price-gouging and
      put price controls on food cartels Every demographic group supported these proposals,
      led by 71 percent of Rust Belt voters under 30 years of age, and 74 percent of
      those who feel very insecure about losing their job. Again, please look at those
      first two policy planks. No national Democrat in memory, except for the independent
      Bernie, has said anything like that in their campaigns. And yet 57 percent of
      the voters in these Rust Belt states said they supported these radical policies,
      with only 19 percent opposed. Most labor leaders and Democratic party strategists,
      however, don’t want to hear it, no matter what our polling shows and no matter
      what their own constituents say they really want. While some unions are willing
      to flirt with fusion efforts, like the Working Families Party, they know that
      in the end fusion parties will support the Democrats. It’s understandable that
      labor leaders are gun shy about building a new political formation. They just
      don’t have the bandwidth while trying to keep their unions afloat, given incessant
      assaults by corporate forces and anti-labor politicians. They are backed into
      a corner. What they’re missing is the potential power that would flow from a new
      entity of disgruntled working people, totally independent of the two parties.
      A new independent party could help unions organize new members while also building
      stronger connections with and among their membership. Instead of dividing their
      members by pushing the tarnished Democratic brand, a new worker political formation
      could build solidarity around the issues that affect workers most. How a new party
      of working people helps progressive Democrats Imagine that a new Independent workers
      political association (maybe call it Workers USA?) formed to run more labor candidates
      in one-party races – that is in any of the 132 congressional districts and 20
      senatorial races in which the Republicans won by 25 or more percent. Doing so
      would not split the Democratic vote because that vote evaporated long ago. Dan
      Osborn, a former local union president in Nebraska, is a good example of a working-class
      candidate who nearly took down three-term Senator Deb Fischer by running on a
      strong anti-corporate populist program as an independent in 2024. The Democrats
      didn’t even bother to field a candidate. So, Osborn filled the breach, forced
      Fischer and her party to spend millions of dollars they didn’t plan on, and came
      within seven percent of Fischer in Nebraska, a state Kamala Harris lost by 20
      percent to Trump. Osborn ran unabashedly on an anti-corporate populist program
      and proved it could gain traction in a deep red state. He believes he is opening
      the working-class door to more such races: “(Our effort is) going to tell people
      all around the country that you don’t have to be a self-funding crypto billionaire
      to run for office. So, nurses, teachers, plumbers, carpenters, mechanics, they
      can all now know that they can do the same thing.” If more and more working-class
      candidates entered these one-party races and showed promise running on a strong
      populist economic platform, their successes would support those within the Democratic
      Party who want to move the party more in a progressive populist direction, and
      away from the corporatist path it has traveling since the days of Bill Clinton.
      If these ideas gain traction in traditionally red districts, offered by independent
      working-class campaigns, the Democratic Party might have no choice but to bend
      in this direction. Osborn-like political competition would breathe some new life
      into the currently gasping Democrats. And by running in one-party districts, there
      is no obvious “spoiler” downside for the Democrats who have long ago abandoned
      those races. They should be cheering on more and more independent working-class
      candidates like Osborn. What does the Labor movement gain through a new political
      formation? For more than a generation, organizing new members has been and continues
      to be an existential problem for all labor unions. Labor law is so stacked against
      union organizing that it takes nearly miraculous efforts just to maintain the
      current paltry union density of six percent in the private sector and barely 10
      percent overall. Organizing shop by shop is a Sisyphean task. Winning an election
      is extremely difficult against corporations and their high-powered and expensive
      anti-union consultants who are more than willing to break the law by firing organizers,
      threatening layoffs, and building campaigns based on lies about the union. And
      even if the union wins, it’s even harder still to secure a first contract. For
      more than 50 years, labor has struggled to level the playing field through national
      labor law reforms enacted by the Democratic Party. That strategy has utterly failed.
      Some argue that the real problem is that unions are not putting enough resources
      into organizing. They should be raiding their war chests and mortgaging their
      union hall properties to create a ten-fold increase in organizing funds. Then,
      they say, we would see a rebirth of the labor movement. I disagree. Even a ten-fold
      increase in organizing funds is likely, at best, to have marginally better results.
      Labor law is just too stacked against organizing. And those laws will only change
      when national politics changes. The first step to remold the political terrain
      is to invest a small amount of money in building a new Independent workers political
      formation that allows unions to mobilize working-class people outside of collective
      bargaining . There are no laws that interfere with people joining a new political
      organization that fights for working-class candidates and promotes ballot initiatives
      and new policies to enhance the well-being of working people. That field is wide
      open, and I believe that workers and those friendly to working-class issues, if
      given the chance, will come running. Imagine millions of workers, some in unions,
      many not, banding together to advocate and vote for candidates and issues of importance
      to them and their families. Working together on political initiatives would also
      turn up new contacts for workplace organizing and increase pressure on the companies
      they negotiate with. A popular workers’ movement certainly could spark more interest
      in labor unions, especially if unions took the lead on building this new political
      organization. What could a party of working people do? Not only could working-class
      candidates be fielded in one-party districts, but the new formation could run
      ballot initiatives that give working people an opportunity to set policy. For
      example, our polling shows that there is very strong support for a ballot initiative
      that would prohibit large corporations that receive taxpayer money from conducting
      compulsory layoffs. Instead, all layoffs in those contracting corporations would
      be voluntary based on buyouts like those corporate executives usually receive.
      No one would be forced out of their job. Our Rust Belt research suggests that
      such an initiative would be well-received and could mobilize millions of voters.
      It is even more popular than raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Why not
      give it a try in Michigan, for example, which permits ballot initiatives? Musk
      picks up the scent Thirty years ago, the late Tony Mazzocchi, a radical leader
      of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, said that if labor doesn’t build
      a new political formation, some right-wing racist charlatan will fill the breach.
      Oh, was he right. Now, we see another charlatan sense that people are sick and
      tired of a failed two-party system that delivers for the super-rich and their
      political hacks, and no one else. Elon Musk has such a large following and war
      chest that he could convincingly claim that his third party is the answer to the
      woes of workers, even though it would really give us a third party dominated by
      billionaires. Musk’s grandstanding proves the point I’ve been trying to make for
      the last several years: Building something new is in the air. Or as my astute
      colleague put it, “any argument for a progressive third party, including how to
      build it, has to acknowledge the ugly creatures already crawling into the void.”
      To fill that void, voters in key Rust Belt swing states want a new political formation,
      and they want one that fights for radical economic populism, not billionaire rip-offs.

      bargaining . There are no laws that interfere with people joining a new political
      organization that fights for working-class candidates and promotes ballot initiatives
      and new policies to enhance the well-being of working people. That field is wide
      open, and I believe that workers and those friendly to working-class issues, if
      given the chance, will come running. Imagine millions of workers, some in unions,
      many not, banding together to advocate and vote for candidates and issues of importance
      to them and their families. Working together on political initiatives would also
      turn up new contacts for workplace organizing and increase pressure on the companies
      they negotiate with. A popular workers’ movement certainly could spark more interest
      in labor unions, especially if unions took the lead on building this new political
      organization. What could a party of working people do? Not only could working-class
      candidates be fielded in one-party districts, but the new formation could run
      ballot initiatives that give working people an opportunity to set policy. For
      example, our polling shows that there is very strong support for a ballot initiative
      that would prohibit large corporations that receive taxpayer money from conducting
      compulsory layoffs. Instead, all layoffs in those contracting corporations would
      be voluntary based on buyouts like those corporate executives usually receive.
      No one would be forced out of their job. Our Rust Belt research suggests that
      such an initiative would be well-received and could mobilize millions of voters.
      It is even more popular than raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Why not
      give it a try in Michigan, for example, which permits ballot initiatives? Musk
      picks up the scent Thirty years ago, the late Tony Mazzocchi, a radical leader
      of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, said that if labor doesn’t build
      a new political formation, some right-wing racist charlatan will fill the breach.
      Oh, was he right. Now, we see another charlatan sense that people are sick and
      tired of a failed two-party system that delivers for the super-rich and their
      political hacks, and no one else. Elon Musk has such a large following and war
      chest that he could convincingly claim that his third party is the answer to the
      woes of workers, even though it would really give us a third party dominated by
      billionaires. Musk’s grandstanding proves the point I’ve been trying to make for
      the last several years: Building something new is in the air. Or as my astute
      colleague put it, “any argument for a progressive third party, including how to
      build it, has to acknowledge the ugly creatures already crawling into the void.”
      To fill that void, voters in key Rust Belt swing states want a new political formation,
      and they want one that fights for radical economic populism, not billionaire rip-offs.

      from the BRICS countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from July 6-7 for
      their 17th summit. At the summit, BRICS countries denounced the attempts by the
      United States to undermine global trade by waging a tariff war. They called for
      strengthening multilateral forums and international laws to create a more equitable
      global order, in a joint declaration adopted during the summit. The joint declaration
      titled “Strengthening Global South Cooperation for Inclusive and Sustainable Governance”
      was adopted on Sunday, July 6, calling for increased cooperation among BRICS members
      in areas such as politics and security, economy and finance, and culture and people
      to people contacts. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva led the proceedings
      of the two day summit, which began on Sunday. The summit was attended by Chinese
      Premier Li Qiang, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President
      Cyril Ramaphosa, and several heads of other member states and their representatives.
      Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the summit through a video conference.
      This is the first summit attended by Indonesia, which became the 11th full member
      of BRICS in January this year. During his inaugural speech, Lula called BRICS
      a successor of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). He claimed that since there are
      growing attacks on multilateralism and international laws and the world is witnessing
      “unprecedented” conflict since World War II, it is necessary for “BRICS to contribute”
      to bring peace and development in the world through strengthening multilateral
      forums. Lula reiterated BRICS’ resolve to work for comprehensive reforms in the
      existing multilateral forums such as the UN, including its Security Council, the
      International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and others to “increase their
      legitimacy, representativeness, effectiveness and democratic character.” Several
      other leaders, including Chinese premier Li Qiang talked about BRICS playing a
      more concrete role in international politics at a time when “unilateralism and
      protectionism” are on the rise and the principles of UN and other multilateral
      forums such as WTO are under attack. The joint declaration mentions 126 commitments
      made by the leaders of BRICS, including their resolve to enhance mutual trade,
      cooperation in science and technology, climate cooperation and so on. Multipolarity
      and representation In the joint declaration, BRICS nations agreed to enhance their
      strategic partnership for “promoting peace, a fairer and more representative international
      order, a revitalized and reformed multilateral system, sustainable development
      and inclusive growth.” BRICS believes that “multipolarity can create opportunities
      for developing countries and emerging markets” and reiterated the need for comprehensive
      reforms in the UN, including in the Security Council as stated by its Johannesburg
      summit declaration in 2023. Affirming that the Global South is “a driver of positive
      change” in the world, the BRICS countries voiced “serious concerns about the rise
      of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent
      with WTO rules.” They reiterated their collective opposition to “unilateral coercive
      measures” or sanctions, calling them contrary to international law. These unilateral
      measures violate the basic human rights of the people in the targeted countries
      and deny them the opportunity to develop and particularly affect the most vulnerable
      and poor sections of the population, BRICS members noted. The joint declaration
      announced that BRICS members “do not impose or support non-UN Security Council
      authorized sanctions.” BRICS also agreed to work on an increased quota at the
      IMF and the World Bank for emerging and developing countries. Demanding that these
      quotas should reflect the “relative positions of countries in the global economy”
      and must not favor the developed west as it does now. The Rio declaration also
      called for cooperation in “global AI governance” claiming any such move “must
      mitigate potential risks and meet the needs of all countries, including those
      in the Global South.” Making it one of the top priorities of the Brazilian presidency,
      the BRICS declaration called for global health governance by enhancing international
      cooperation and solidarity for the elimination of socially-determined diseases.
      It identifies hunger and poverty as the root of these diseases and vows for enhanced
      cooperation for their elimination. Global conflicts and wars BRICS nations unanimously
      condemned the Israeli and US military strikes inside Iran last month, calling
      them “a violation of international law and charter of the United Nations.” They
      pointed out that the attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities were in violation of
      the relevant resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
      demanded that “nuclear safeguards, safety, and security must always be upheld,
      including in armed conflicts, to protect people and the environment from harm.”
      Speaking during the summit, Iran’s Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, demanded
      that the attacks which targeted his country’s civilian infrastructure, innocent
      citizens, and protected nuclear facilities must be condemned by the global community
      as their effects are not limited to Iran and will be felt by “the whole region
      and beyond.” BRICS nations also condemned Israel’s continued war and aggression
      against Palestinians in Gaza. “We condemn all violations of international humanitarian
      law (IHL), including the use of starvation as a method of warfare,” the joint
      declaration said, also condemning Israel’s attempts to “politicize or militarize
      humanitarian assistance”. The BRICS joint declaration also demanded that Israel
      must stop its repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements with Lebanon and
      withdraw all its “occupying forces from all of the Lebanese territories”. It also
      expressed support for peace efforts in Syria, Sudan, and other parts of the world,
      emphasizing the need for local and domestic initiatives. President Lula, during
      his inaugural speech, mentioned how NATO’s recent decision to increase the defense
      expenditure to 5% of their GDP demonstrates the misplaced priorities of the global
      north. He noted that they have money for war but no money for climate action or
      helping poorer countries achieve their sustainable development goals. “It is easier
      [for NATO members] to designate 5% of the GDP to military spending than to allocate
      the 0.7% that has been promised for Official Development Assistance [for poorer
      countries].” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      and poor sections of the population, BRICS members noted. The joint declaration
      announced that BRICS members “do not impose or support non-UN Security Council
      authorized sanctions.” BRICS also agreed to work on an increased quota at the
      IMF and the World Bank for emerging and developing countries. Demanding that these
      quotas should reflect the “relative positions of countries in the global economy”
      and must not favor the developed west as it does now. The Rio declaration also
      called for cooperation in “global AI governance” claiming any such move “must
      mitigate potential risks and meet the needs of all countries, including those
      in the Global South.” Making it one of the top priorities of the Brazilian presidency,
      the BRICS declaration called for global health governance by enhancing international
      cooperation and solidarity for the elimination of socially-determined diseases.
      It identifies hunger and poverty as the root of these diseases and vows for enhanced
      cooperation for their elimination. Global conflicts and wars BRICS nations unanimously
      condemned the Israeli and US military strikes inside Iran last month, calling
      them “a violation of international law and charter of the United Nations.” They
      pointed out that the attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities were in violation of
      the relevant resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
      demanded that “nuclear safeguards, safety, and security must always be upheld,
      including in armed conflicts, to protect people and the environment from harm.”
      Speaking during the summit, Iran’s Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, demanded
      that the attacks which targeted his country’s civilian infrastructure, innocent
      citizens, and protected nuclear facilities must be condemned by the global community
      as their effects are not limited to Iran and will be felt by “the whole region
      and beyond.” BRICS nations also condemned Israel’s continued war and aggression
      against Palestinians in Gaza. “We condemn all violations of international humanitarian
      law (IHL), including the use of starvation as a method of warfare,” the joint
      declaration said, also condemning Israel’s attempts to “politicize or militarize
      humanitarian assistance”. The BRICS joint declaration also demanded that Israel
      must stop its repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements with Lebanon and
      withdraw all its “occupying forces from all of the Lebanese territories”. It also
      expressed support for peace efforts in Syria, Sudan, and other parts of the world,
      emphasizing the need for local and domestic initiatives. President Lula, during
      his inaugural speech, mentioned how NATO’s recent decision to increase the defense
      expenditure to 5% of their GDP demonstrates the misplaced priorities of the global
      north. He noted that they have money for war but no money for climate action or
      helping poorer countries achieve their sustainable development goals. “It is easier
      [for NATO members] to designate 5% of the GDP to military spending than to allocate
      the 0.7% that has been promised for Official Development Assistance [for poorer
      countries].” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      P residents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have spoken by telephone numerous
      times since the former reassumed office seven months ago. Not much appears to
      have been  accomplished by way of these exchanges, some of which have been lengthy,
      according to the accounts Washington and Moscow have provided afterward. No progress
      toward a durable settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Talk and desultory diplomatic
      contacts with a view to repairing the profligate damage successive American administrations
      have done to U.S.–Russian relations, but no substantive advances. O.K., it is
      what it is, as we say. But there was something singularly conclusive about the telephone
      conversation the U.S. and Russian leaders had last Thursday. I detect that a dead
      end has been reached. Trump was trying once again to get Putin to agree to an
      “immediate and unconditional ceasefire” in Ukraine — “the quick end to the military
      action,” as Yuri Ushakov, the Kremlin’s senior foreign policy adviser, put it.
      Putin was trying once again to explain that the time has come to structure an
      enduring settlement by addressing — the Kremlin’s favored phrase these days —
      the “root causes” of the conflict. Maybe it is the barrage of drones and missiles
      with which the Russians bombarded Kiev and other Ukrainian cities within a few
      hours of the Trump–Putin exchange that prompts me to think the two leaders or
      their diplomats are unlikely ever to get anywhere on the telephone or at the mahogany
      table. The Ukrainians, for what their word is worth, counted 539 drones and 11
      missiles, including a hard-to-intercept, high-velocity (Mach 10 hypersonic) projectile
      called the Kinzhal. This was the largest aerial attack so far in the war, by the
      Ukrainians’ reckoning, and it left Kiev smoldering last Friday morning. It is
      hard to avoid concluding the Kremlin had a point to make after the failure of
      the phone call. Trump Has Nothing to Propose Or maybe it is Trump’s remarks after
      the call that makes me think a diplomatic settlement seems simply beyond reach
      — this at least until the Ukrainian military is decisively smashed, and very possibly
      not even then. “I was very unhappy with my call with President Putin,” Trump told
      reporters aboard Air Force One afterward. “I didn’t make any progress with him
      at all. He wants to go all the way, just keep killing people, it’s no good.” You
      cannot be surprised at this current state of affairs. Trump made no progress with
      the Russian leader because he has nothing to propose that would make progress
      possible. Social media messages demanding a ceasefire, replete with capital letters
      and exclamation points, do not count and do not work as statecraft; they betoken
      nothing so much as Trump’s — read, the West’s — un-seriousness. The fundamental
      problem here is that Kiev and its sponsors are unable to accept defeat. I concluded
      more than a year ago that Ukraine and its Western powers had lost the war — “effectively
      lost,” I thought for a time, but then I dropped “effectively.” For a good long time
      now what we’ve watched is nothing more than postwar gore. If you have lost a war
      but cannot admit you have lost because the West must never lose anything, you
      are down to the old game of pretend. And so long as the U.S. and its European
      clients insist that they deserve any consequential say in the terms of negotiation —
      as if they can assert the authority of a victor — it amounts to the pointlessness
      of pretending. It is as if the Germans, if you do not mind the comparison, insisted
      they set the terms of surrender in May 1945, or had a say in the settlement concluded
      at Versailles in 1919. When a settlement is finally reached it will not be termed
      a surrender — you can count on this — but this is what it will come to. And Russia,
      to turn this question another way, will have a responsibility to avoid turning
      a finally achieved peace into another Versailles disaster — where the victors
      planted the seeds for a renewal of conflict — by asking too much. I am confident
      Moscow will hold to its currently expressed demands, which I consider eminently
      just and not at all excessive: A new security architecture in Europe; no NATO membership
      for a neutral Ukraine that must be demilitarized and de-Nazified; and recognition
      of the four oblasts that voted to join Russia. Ressentiment But I am not confident
      Ukraine and the neo–Nazis who control the military and the civilian administration
      — yes, both — will ever accept any kind of coexistence with the Russian Federation.
      The hatred is too visceral, too irrational, too atavistic, too pathological. This
      is why de–Nazification was and remains a Russian objective. The neo–Nazi beast,
      never far below the surface in post–1945 Ukraine, was sprung into the open air
      with the U.S.–cultivated coup in 2014. Washington and its clients in Kiev needed the
      neo–Nazis, especially but not only the armed militias, because they could be relied upon
      to fight the Russians with the sort of visceral animus the occasion required.
      I do not know what a de–Nazification operation would look like, given the phenomenon’s above-noted
      characteristics, but something will have to be done to rid the Ukrainian consciousness
      of this deformity. What we will see in Ukraine otherwise will prove an horrific
      case of ressentiment — enduring and poisonous. Ressentiment is a term the Germans, Friedrich Nietzsche
      among them, borrowed from the French in the 19th century because they had no term
      for the phenomenon. It denotes the hostility and anger within a group arising
      from a shared sense of inferiority in the face of another — this other becoming
      a kind of scapegoat for a society’s frustrations and complexes. Max Scheler, the
      19th and early 20th century phenomenologist, explored all this in Ressentiment
      , a brief but pithy book he published in 1912 (in English, Marquette Univ. Press,
      1994). As Scheler explained in interesting detail, a socially accepted set of
      values arises from this complex of feelings. Ressentiment is a potentially dangerous
      sentiment when it animates a society that feels itself wounded over a sustained
      period of time. We need look no further than the extreme Russophobia evident today
      among some segments of the Ukrainian population for a case in point. Against this
      historical and social backdrop, I do not see the Ukrainians as capable of reaching
      a settlement to end the war that has already torn apart the nation and its people.
      I do not see that they can achieve peace, either with others or among themselves,
      because they do not know peace and they are not capable of it. A Rockface of History
      But I see another reason peace in Ukraine will prove elusive, if not impossible,
      even as the Russians achieve it on the battlefield. (And I tend toward the latter
      probability.) This judgment arises when we put the Ukraine crisis in a larger,
      global context. I think of Ukraine as resembling the rock face in a mine, or a
      front line in a global conflict: It is where the non–West is most urgently chiseling
      a new world order into being. It is a site of insistence, let us say. And it is
      where the West proposes to stop this world-historical turn of history’s wheel
      — a turn that simply cannot be stopped. Think of Putin’s demands. Apart from de–Nazification
      — an objective that, to me, reflects considerable insight on Moscow’s part — there
      are the more encompassing “root causes.” I gather Putin used this phrase yet again
      in his call with Trump. [See: Rootin g Out the Root Causes in Ukraine ] Putin,
      Sergei Lavrov, his foreign minister, and other senior Russian officials have been clear
      on this point at least since Moscow sent those two draft treaties Westward in December
      2021 as the proposed basis of negotiations that would lead to an encompassing new
      security structure between Russia and the West. This framework would relieve the
      decades of tension along Russia’s western flank and Europe’s east and would be
      of benefit to both sides. This was and remains Moscow’s intent. Settlements that
      address the concerns of all sides, as against one side’s at the expense of another,
      is the very essence of sound statecraft. But any such settlement would stand as
      an expression of parity between West and non–West. As I have argued severally
      over the years, parity between these two spheres is a 21st century imperative.
      There will be no world order without it — only more of the disorder the Western
      powers call, altogether absurdly, “the rules-based order.” But it is precisely
      even the thought of parity that the United States and its trans–Atlantic allies
      refuse to accept. It would bring to an end the half-millennium of dominance the
      West cannot release from its grasp even as it will eventually have to do so. “It
      is no good,” Trump said after his latest telephone talk with Putin. No, and I
      do not see how it can be. Trump has nothing to offer the Russians that would amount
      to a serious address of what is genuinely at issue between America and Russia
      — between the West and non–West. I leave it to readers to conclude where this
      leaves the Ukraine conflict and the larger question of Russo–American relations. It
      is, once again, what it is — or what it is at the moment. In another column I
      will revisit this question of parity as it applies in West Asia. Editor’s Note

    one_sentence_summary: Despite multiple lengthy phone conversations between President
      Trump and President Putin since Trump's return to office, there has been little
      progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict or improving U.S.-Russian relations.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Patrick Lawrence discusses the ongoing telephone
      conversations between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin
      since Trump took office again, noting that these discussions have yielded little
      progress towards resolving the Ukraine conflict or improving U.S.-Russian relations.
      Despite attempts by Trump to persuade Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire,
      the Kremlin has emphasized the need to address the "root causes" of the war. The
      situation appears stagnant, especially in light of recent Russian military actions
      against Ukraine, suggesting that meaningful diplomatic progress is unlikely. Lawrence
      concludes that the exchanges between the two leaders may have reached a dead end,
      highlighting the challenges in achieving a resolution.

    one_sentence_summary: Despite multiple lengthy phone conversations between President
      Trump and President Putin since Trump's return to office, there has been little
      progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict or improving U.S.-Russian relations.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Patrick Lawrence discusses the ongoing telephone
      conversations between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin
      since Trump took office again, noting that these discussions have yielded little
      progress towards resolving the Ukraine conflict or improving U.S.-Russian relations.
      Despite attempts by Trump to persuade Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire,
      the Kremlin has emphasized the need to address the "root causes" of the war. The
      situation appears stagnant, especially in light of recent Russian military actions
      against Ukraine, suggesting that meaningful diplomatic progress is unlikely. Lawrence
      concludes that the exchanges between the two leaders may have reached a dead end,
      highlighting the challenges in achieving a resolution.

      the outcomes of Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the White House on Monday and the
      latest scenario for a ceasefire in Gaza, a bilateral policy of genocide has united
      the Israeli and U.S. governments in a pact of literally breath-taking cruelty.
      That pact and its horrific consequences for Palestinian people either continue
      to shock Americans or gradually normalize indifference toward ongoing atrocities
      on a massive scale. Recent news reporting that President Trump has pushed for
      a ceasefire in Gaza is an echo of a familiar refrain about peace-seeking efforts
      from the Biden and Trump administrations. The spin remained in sync with the killing
      – not only with American bombs and bullets but also with Israel’s refusal to allow
      more than a pittance of food and other essentials into Gaza. Last year began with
      a United Nations statement that “Gazans now make up 80 per cent of all people
      facing famine or catastrophic hunger worldwide, marking an unparalleled humanitarian
      crisis in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s continued bombardment and siege.” The UN
      quoted experts who said: “Currently every single person in Gaza is hungry, a quarter
      of the population are starving and struggling to find food and drinkable water,
      and famine is imminent.” In late February 2024, President Biden talked to journalists
      about prospects for a “ceasefire” (which did not take place) while holding a vanilla
      ice cream cone. “My national security adviser tells me that we’re close, we’re
      close, we’re not done yet,” Biden said , before sauntering off. He spoke during
      a photo op at an ice cream parlor in Manhattan, while the UN was sounding an alarm
      that “very little humanitarian aid has entered besieged Gaza this month.” During
      the 16 months since then, variants of facile verbiage from top U.S. government
      officials have repeated endlessly, while normalizing genocide with a steep race
      to the ethical bottom, so that – in Orwellian terms, much like “war is peace,
      freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength” – genocide is not genocide. Refusal
      to acknowledge the complicity and impunity is most of all maintained by avoidance
      and silence. The process makes a terrible truth inadmissible rather than admittable.
      All the doublethink and newspeak must detour around the reality that the U.S.-supported
      Israeli siege of Gaza is genocide, which the international Genocide Convention
      defines as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
      ethnical, racial or religious group” – with such actions as “deliberately inflicting
      on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction
      in whole or in part.” Israel’s actions in Gaza clearly meet that definition, as
      Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have unequivocally concluded with
      exhaustive reports. But under the cloaks of the Israeli and American flags, the
      official stories insist that the unconscionable should be invisible. Liberal Zionist
      groups in the United States are part of the process. Here’s what I wrote in an
      article for The Nation early this year after examining public statements by the
      “pro-Israel, pro-peace” group J Street: “Routinely, while calling for the release
      of the Israeli hostages, the organization also expressed concern about the deaths
      and suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. But none of J Street’s 132 news
      releases between October 7 and the start of the [temporary] ceasefire in late
      January 2025 called for an end to shipments of the U.S. bombs and weapons that
      were killing those civilians while enforcing Israel’s policy of using starvation
      as a weapon of war – a glaring omission for a group that declares itself to be
      ‘pro-peace.’ It was as if J Street thought that vague humanistic pleas could paper
      over these gaping cracks in its stance. “However, J Street felt comfortable taking
      a firm line on the question of whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.
      Here, it aligned itself completely with the position of the U.S. and Israeli governments.
      In mid-January 2024, when oral arguments ended at the International Court of Justice
      in the case brought by South Africa that charged the Israeli government with violating
      the Genocide Convention in Gaza, a news release declared that ‘J Street rejects
      the allegation of genocide against the State of Israel.’ Four months later, on
      May 24, J Street responded quickly when the ICJ ordered Israel to ‘immediately
      halt its military offensive’ in Rafah. ‘J Street continues to reject the allegation
      of genocide in this case,’ a news release said.” Likewise, with rare exceptions,
      U.S. news media and members of Congress dodge the reality of genocide against
      Palestinians in Gaza. Meanwhile, the events in Gaza and the evasions in the United
      States have been enormously instructive, shattering illusions along the way. Many
      Americans, especially young people, know much more about their country and its
      government than they did just two years ago. What has come to light includes mass
      murder of certain other human beings as de facto policy and functional ideology.

      Weiss / Mondoweiss In a clear sign that it intends to batter Zohran Mamdani, the
      Democratic nominee for mayor, and disrespect the voters who have generated the
      leftwinger’s spectacular rise, the New York Times last week published a lengthy
      investigation of Mamdani’s statement about his racial identity as a college applicant
      in 2009 as if it had found a smoking gun. The ensuing controversy has done nothing
      to hurt Mamdani politically but engulfed the Times, further damaging the paper’s
      credibility. The July 3 article, titled “ Mamdani Identified as Asian and African
      American on College Application ” was based on a hack of Columbia University admissions
      records by a right-wing white nationalist and suggested that at 18, Mamdani lied
      about his identity in his 2009 application to Columbia by checking boxes stating
      that he was “Asian” and “Black or African-American.” Mamdani didn’t get in. As
      the Times noted in gotcha style, Mamdani says on the campaign trail that he is
      Muslim of South Asian heritage but “claimed another label” when he was a teenager.
      “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked
      multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background,” Mamdani explained
      to the Times . Mamdani was born in 1991 in Uganda, where his father’s Gujarati
      family had lived for 100 years. The budding pol spent his first 7 years in Uganda
      and has expressed pride in his African roots. The article’s gravity and length
      and very-thin accusation have been condemned by Mamdani supporters as a smear
      and a weak one, but have already predictably been picked up by pro-Israel groups
      that hate Mamdani and his movement. The charge’s weakness was clear when House
      minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, who still has not endorsed Mamdani, was asked
      about it on MSNBC and changed the subject. He knows this is a foolish claim. Meanwhile,
      the outrage over the article has again put the Times on the defensive over its
      dismissive coverage of Mamdani. The paper is obviously at war with itself. Editors
      have sought to justify the investigation, not very convincingly, and Times columnist
      Jamelle Bouie posted, “i think you should tell readers if your source is a nazi.”
      He then deleted the post. But later posted, “NYT & many of its elite white readers
      are still obsessed with race-conscious college admissions,” according to Semafor
      . The investigation is absurd and malignant for several reasons. Even if you buy
      the premise that Mamdani stretched his identity at 18 to try and get into Columbia,
      the story is laughable. We all know kids who have played up one part or another
      of their identity. Big deal. And anyway, the evidence is not convincing. Mamdani’s
      father was a professor of political science at Columbia at the time, so the admissions
      office likely knew who he was. Mahmood Mamdani had lately published a book, “Good
      Muslim, Bad Muslim,” in which he identified himself as a “third generation East
      African of Indian descent” who “grew up in Kampala, Uganda.” But no one should
      buy the premise here, because it is so ugly. That premise is that people have
      fixed racial identities, and these categories are strict. The most disturbing
      line in the article is this righteous bit—“asked if any of his family had intermarried
      while in East Africa, he said in the interview on Thursday, ‘They’re all of Indian
      origin, from Gujarat.’” As if Mamdani would be a legitimate “African” if his South
      Asian family had mixed its blood with blacks? You’d think that pseudo-race science
      would have no place in our best newspaper. Countless Americans today have fluid
      identities, and we should respect their choices about what is important to them
      in their own backgrounds. Barack Obama made such a choice, and it was honored.
      It is hard to believe the NYT could possibly think this is a story. So yes, the
      motivation is clear, they were trying to make it a scandal: all you have to do
      is throw this out there and conservatives all over Twitter are saying he is a
      commie Muslim liar… That’s another reason the investigation is absurd. This is
      all they could come up with? The story doesn’t hurt Mamdani politically. His base
      is appalled by it, and Democratic voters don’t care, as Hakeem Jeffries has indicated.
      Jeffries is aware of the profound shifts taking place in the Democratic base that
      Michael Arria and Peter Feld have documented here . Jeffries knows that when Mamdani
      refused to apologize for defending the phrase “globalize the intifada,” the story
      disappeared, but that when Senator Kirsten Gillibrand revived that line of attack
      on WNYC by claiming that Mamdani supports jihad, she was forced to apologize for
      Islamophobia. Young Democrats are aware and somewhat radicalized, and Jeffries
      needs them if he is going to counter Trumpism. The Times is out of step with that
      base. Of course, a newspaper gets to choose what it believes in. But the Times
      is the most important newspaper in the country and a generally liberal voice,
      and it is making grievous political and ethical errors in its coverage of a young
      politician who excites a wide coalition for idealistic reasons. Because he is
      optimistic and energetic and inclusive and offers a stirring vision for the future.
      Some day the Times is sure to reflect this American political movement. But now
      it is stuck by its own choice in the worst muck of the Israel lobby. The core
      issue here is Israel. The young are mobilized by the horror of the Gaza genocide.
      The Democratic base demands that its leaders express their outrage at Israel’s
      rolling massacres and stop sending arms to war criminals. The Times has pointedly
      refused to honor that point of view. The Times ’s acceptance of the genocide is
      best captured by a piece by Nicholas Kristof, a liberal columnist at the paper,
      when he wrote in April, “the Netanyahu government is now again escalating in Gaza.
      Is this really the best use of American weaponry?” Is this really the best use
      of American weaponry? This is a morally idiotic question. We know the answer,
      have known it for years, and we want our journals, intellectuals, and leaders
      to say emphatically: No. Thanks to Donald Johnson Editor’s Note : A t a moment

    one_sentence_summary: The New York Times faced backlash for publishing a controversial
      investigation into Zohran Mamdani's racial identity on a college application,
      which has not harmed his political standing but has further damaged the paper's
      credibility.
    paragraph_summary: The New York Times recently published a controversial article
      scrutinizing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, regarding his racial
      identity on a college application from 2009, suggesting he misrepresented himself
      by identifying as both "Asian" and "Black or African-American." This investigation,
      stemming from a hack of Columbia University admissions records, has been criticized
      as a smear by Mamdani's supporters, who argue it disrespects the voters who have
      propelled his political rise. Mamdani clarified that he checked multiple boxes
      to reflect his diverse heritage, as there was no specific option for his Indian-Ugandan
      background. Despite the article's intent to undermine him, it has not negatively
      impacted Mamdani's campaign and has instead drawn attention to the Times' credibility,
      while also being seized upon by pro-Israel groups opposed to his political stance.

      and very-thin accusation have been condemned by Mamdani supporters as a smear
      and a weak one, but have already predictably been picked up by pro-Israel groups
      that hate Mamdani and his movement. The charge’s weakness was clear when House
      minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, who still has not endorsed Mamdani, was asked
      about it on MSNBC and changed the subject. He knows this is a foolish claim. Meanwhile,
      the outrage over the article has again put the Times on the defensive over its
      dismissive coverage of Mamdani. The paper is obviously at war with itself. Editors
      have sought to justify the investigation, not very convincingly, and Times columnist
      Jamelle Bouie posted, “i think you should tell readers if your source is a nazi.”
      He then deleted the post. But later posted, “NYT & many of its elite white readers
      are still obsessed with race-conscious college admissions,” according to Semafor
      . The investigation is absurd and malignant for several reasons. Even if you buy
      the premise that Mamdani stretched his identity at 18 to try and get into Columbia,
      the story is laughable. We all know kids who have played up one part or another
      of their identity. Big deal. And anyway, the evidence is not convincing. Mamdani’s
      father was a professor of political science at Columbia at the time, so the admissions
      office likely knew who he was. Mahmood Mamdani had lately published a book, “Good
      Muslim, Bad Muslim,” in which he identified himself as a “third generation East
      African of Indian descent” who “grew up in Kampala, Uganda.” But no one should
      buy the premise here, because it is so ugly. That premise is that people have
      fixed racial identities, and these categories are strict. The most disturbing
      line in the article is this righteous bit—“asked if any of his family had intermarried
      while in East Africa, he said in the interview on Thursday, ‘They’re all of Indian
      origin, from Gujarat.’” As if Mamdani would be a legitimate “African” if his South
      Asian family had mixed its blood with blacks? You’d think that pseudo-race science
      would have no place in our best newspaper. Countless Americans today have fluid
      identities, and we should respect their choices about what is important to them
      in their own backgrounds. Barack Obama made such a choice, and it was honored.
      It is hard to believe the NYT could possibly think this is a story. So yes, the
      motivation is clear, they were trying to make it a scandal: all you have to do
      is throw this out there and conservatives all over Twitter are saying he is a
      commie Muslim liar… That’s another reason the investigation is absurd. This is
      all they could come up with? The story doesn’t hurt Mamdani politically. His base
      is appalled by it, and Democratic voters don’t care, as Hakeem Jeffries has indicated.
      Jeffries is aware of the profound shifts taking place in the Democratic base that
      Michael Arria and Peter Feld have documented here . Jeffries knows that when Mamdani
      refused to apologize for defending the phrase “globalize the intifada,” the story
      disappeared, but that when Senator Kirsten Gillibrand revived that line of attack
      on WNYC by claiming that Mamdani supports jihad, she was forced to apologize for
      Islamophobia. Young Democrats are aware and somewhat radicalized, and Jeffries
      needs them if he is going to counter Trumpism. The Times is out of step with that
      base. Of course, a newspaper gets to choose what it believes in. But the Times
      is the most important newspaper in the country and a generally liberal voice,
      and it is making grievous political and ethical errors in its coverage of a young
      politician who excites a wide coalition for idealistic reasons. Because he is
      optimistic and energetic and inclusive and offers a stirring vision for the future.
      Some day the Times is sure to reflect this American political movement. But now
      it is stuck by its own choice in the worst muck of the Israel lobby. The core
      issue here is Israel. The young are mobilized by the horror of the Gaza genocide.
      The Democratic base demands that its leaders express their outrage at Israel’s
      rolling massacres and stop sending arms to war criminals. The Times has pointedly
      refused to honor that point of view. The Times ’s acceptance of the genocide is
      best captured by a piece by Nicholas Kristof, a liberal columnist at the paper,
      when he wrote in April, “the Netanyahu government is now again escalating in Gaza.
      Is this really the best use of American weaponry?” Is this really the best use
      of American weaponry? This is a morally idiotic question. We know the answer,
      have known it for years, and we want our journals, intellectuals, and leaders
      to say emphatically: No. Thanks to Donald Johnson Editor’s Note : A t a moment

    one_sentence_summary: The New York Times faced backlash for publishing a controversial
      investigation into Zohran Mamdani's racial identity on a college application,
      which has not harmed his political standing but has further damaged the paper's
      credibility.
    paragraph_summary: The New York Times recently published a controversial article
      scrutinizing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, regarding his racial
      identity on a college application from 2009, suggesting he misrepresented himself
      by identifying as both "Asian" and "Black or African-American." This investigation,
      stemming from a hack of Columbia University admissions records, has been criticized
      as a smear by Mamdani's supporters, who argue it disrespects the voters who have
      propelled his political rise. Mamdani clarified that he checked multiple boxes
      to reflect his diverse heritage, as there was no specific option for his Indian-Ugandan
      background. Despite the article's intent to undermine him, it has not negatively
      impacted Mamdani's campaign and has instead drawn attention to the Times' credibility,
      while also being seized upon by pro-Israel groups opposed to his political stance.

      Sanity (VIPS) / Consortium News July 5, 2025 MEMORANDUM FOR: The President FROM:
      Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) SUBJECT: Data Collection
      Can Be Effective and Legal Introduction It’s an Artificial Conundrum I t is not
      necessary to make an end-run around the U.S. Constitution to thwart terrorism
      and other crimes. Those claiming otherwise have been far from candid – especially
      since June 2013, when Edward Snowden revealed gross violations of the Fourth Amendment
      by NSA’s bulk electronic collection. U.S. citizens have been widely misled into
      believing that their Constitutional right to privacy had to yield to a superseding
      need to combat terrorism. The choice was presented as an Either-Or conundrum.
      In what follows, we will show that this is a false choice. Rather, the “choice”
      can be a Both-And . In sum, all that is needed is to place advanced technology
      that has been already demonstrated into the hands of officials not driven by lust
      for a cushy retirement. Sophisticated collection and processing technology that
      also protects the right to privacy has been available for decades, enabling highly
      efficient and discriminating collection. Despite that, top officials have opted
      for quasi-legal, cumbersome, ineffective – and wildly expensive – technology that
      has done little more than line the pockets of contractors and “old-friend” retirees.
      U.S. officials have been caught lying under oath – with impunity – with false
      claims about the effectiveness of the intrusive, high price-tag technology they
      procured and implemented. In the Annex to this Memo we briefly portray the illustrative
      behavior of one such senior official. We do so in the belief that a short case
      study may shed light on the apparent motivation of many senior officials who seem
      to take far too lightly their oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the
      United States. We took the same oath. It has no expiration date. Security and
      Privacy: NOT Incompatible Technology already available – and already demonstrated
      to be effective – makes it possible for law-abiding officials, together with experienced
      technical people to create a highly efficient system in which both security and
      privacy can be assured. Again, the basic problems are corruption in government
      and the prevailing incestuous relationships with contractors. Advanced technology
      can pinpoint and thwart corruption in the intelligence, military, and civilian
      domain. At its core, this requires automated analysis of attributes and transactional
      relationships among individuals. The large data sets in government files already
      contain the needed data. And proven methodologies can automatically isolate activity
      of interest and equate this activity to profiles of interest, with inference to
      intentions and capabilities. To implement this approach requires assigning trustworthy
      people with deep knowledge of relevant activities in government agencies. This
      is a monumental task as these government agencies have been evolving and operating
      in their own way for decades and cloning their work force to perpetually operate
      in that way. So, the real problem goes beyond top management. Sweeping changes
      are required at all levels of management. Managing Intelligence Databases On the
      Intelligence Community side, there are ways to purge databases of irrelevant data
      and deny government officials the ability to spy on anyone they want. These methodologies
      protect the privacy of innocent people, while enhancing the ability to discover
      criminal threats. This process creates a rich but scaled-down environment to focus
      analysts for optimum success. If this method had been in place in 2016, it would
      have been impossible to spy on the president. In addition, this approach would
      provide a basis to monitor other government activities – like use or testing of
      biological or Directed Energy Weapons inside the U.S. – or other kinds of illegal
      activity by any government agency. It also means honest expert input is available
      to make sure the intelligence community does not deprive the White House of what
      it needs to know about the collection systems of NSA and others – like those exposed
      by Edward Snowden. This acquisition system can collect and store virtually all
      data passed on the worldwide web and the public switched telephone network. Legal
      Compliance In order to ensure continuous legal compliance with these changes,
      it is necessary to establish a central technical group or organization to continuously
      monitor and validate compliance with the Constitution and U.S. law. Such a group
      would need to have the highest-level access to all agencies to ensure compliance
      behind the classification doors. It must be able to go into any agency to inspect
      its activity at any time. In addition, whenever possible, it would be best to
      make government financial and operational transactions open to the public for
      review as a means of assuring the public that government agencies are doing their
      job properly. This new organization would be responsible for verifying that all
      government agencies are continuing to play by the rules, thus validating compliance
      with the law. Last, but hardly least, unbiased monitors must be in place to ensure
      funds are invested on the basis of merit not on the age-old practice of “who you
      know.” Potential For Abuse All the above-mentioned areas, and still more (e.g.,
      import and export smuggling) can be exposed using these automated analytic processes.
      But we need to emphasize that this could become a double-edged sword. These techniques
      can be used against innocent people. Actually, data from NSA’s mass collection
      is currently used by DOJ, F.B.I., DEA and DHS to target U.S. citizens, most of
      them innocent. If automated analytic technology was added to the current state
      of surveillance and combined with AI, robotics and drone technology, the result
      would be devastating to privacy and to democracy. This is precisely why it is
      absolutely critical to create a separate, independent, highly technical group
      to inspect government agency activities at all classification levels and to give
      that group the power to terminate special access programs that happen to be illegal,
      but kept hidden. In addition, this group should also be given authority to perform
      automated analysis of all government network logs. This, too, is key: a fail-safe
      method to detect any attempt to hide activity from oversight and inspection. To
      make this group or organization fully acceptable, it’s charter would probably
      require it to report to all three branches of government. Such an organization
      would go a long way toward making government truly transparent to the public in
      these areas. Moreover, automated analysis of network logs could also make intrusion
      detection easier to detect and thus improve cyber security. This would make it
      possible to stop intruders before they do damage – no matter the nature of the
      attack. Techniques That Are Both Legal and Effective In the above context, we
      suggest the following techniques for the Intelligence Community and broader government
      to manage mass surveillance data in a way that protects privacy, while maximizing
      the probability of threat detection. (Again, what we propose has been tested.
      In sum, it amounts to proof positive that it is unnecessary to sacrifice the right
      to privacy for some perceived measure of enhanced security.) First, do a focused
      professional study based on attributes and transactions that form the basis of
      probable cause. These techniques could also be used to purge current data bases
      of irrelevant data and enhance smart data collection. The following analytic techniques
      would protect privacy, detect impending threats, and optimize productivity of
      analysis: Focus on entities within two degrees of separation in communications
      or transactional relationships. Here, the second degree must not go through a
      commercial or government entity as this would pull in large numbers of irrelevant
      entities and bury analysts in too much information making them dysfunctional.
      This approach lets analysts focus on known targets and the ability to monitor
      new or expanding elements of these threats. Target surveillance on entities that
      have attributes like: frequent use of satellite phones in areas of the world where
      terrorists, drug smugglers, or other criminal activities are prevalent; target
      entities that frequently visit Internet sites that advocate violence, bomb making,
      pedophilia, and other types of criminality; target entities based on asset or
      informant information. Based on metadata, examine first degree networks in the
      communications or transactional relationships that cluster in areas where criminal
      activity is prevalent. This enables discovery of targets of interest previously
      unknown. Created, Tested, Proven In-House: Then Thwarted By early 1998, our NSA
      team in the SIGINT Automation Research Center (SARC) developed the ability to
      reconstruct files at fiber optic rates in the worldwide Internet. This meant NSA
      no longer had to select only a small percentage of internet data to process, but
      could get all data. Now, the only limitation was available power and space for
      equipment to process information. In August 1998, we gave a copy of this code
      to an NSA station in Bad Aibling, Bavaria, Germany to test and critique. The specialists
      at Bad Aibling found our method so superior to what they were using at the time
      that they installed it across the entire site late on a Friday night. However,
      they did not adopt our smart selection approach and continued to use the existing
      selection system. This meant, when our system reconstructed virtually everything
      on the lines, their existing selection system forwarded almost all of it. Consequently,
      eight to twelve hours later the NSA data storage system was about to crash. We
      were called in to shut down the input and prevent the impending crash. This event
      made it clear to NSA management not only the magnitude of the data explosion in
      the internet, but also that there were smart ways to address that data. That methodology
      had been created in-house and were dirt cheap. Creation of Google In his book,
      Pay Any Price (page 237), James Risen noted that at the time of the Bad Aibling
      event, there was a near simultaneous development in the ultimate creation of what
      became Google. It became clear several years later that both NSA and C.I.A. solicited
      and funded efforts to develop Google in September 1998 just one month after the
      Bad Aibling demonstration. So, in effect, the distributed data storage, metadata
      indexed, content management, profile development system we had operating at NSA’s
      SARC, and had been tested at Bad Aibling, was out-sourced to two beneficiaries
      at Stanford (Larry Page and Sergey Brin). With still more government funding (as
      well as access to SARC’s ingenuity and creative in-house system) Page and Brin
      went on to develop Google. What followed inside NSA after the Bad Aibling event
      was an effort to stop development of our in-house system – the one that had been
      proven to work, but had now been given to Page and Brin. NSA management officially
      shut SARC down in August 2001. Corruption The only fault in the unprecedentedly
      efficient system we had created was not a technical flaw, but a matter of cost,
      but it is not what you may be thinking. The system worked so well that it simply
      cost too little. The contractor systems NSA ended up buying were much less efficient
      but had the “advantage” of costing a lot more. Opting for outside systems required
      a much bigger budget and more staff to manage and perform related functions for
      the IC agencies involved. In addition, the mass data collection systems chosen
      lacked privacy protections and gave government agencies information on virtually
      everyone on the planet. (So much for the Fourth Amendment!) In sum, for the government
      and for Silicon Valley, there were huge financial and bureaucratic motives to
      stop us. For example, to develop our system to full capability in the NSA system
      would have cost about 3.2 million dollars. In contrast, the development of other
      privatized systems has cost the government 10’s of billions of dollars since 2001.
      A good deal of that cost went to formulating an effective process to analyze data.
      This effort was being done by contractors with expertise in classical technical
      skills like computer programming. The basic skills required to resolve such issues,
      however, are experience in intelligence analysis and in applying mathematics to
      organizations. Annex: A Case Study In spring 2013, after Edward Snowden exposed
      NSA abuses, U.S. intelligence directors misled Congress. In retrospect, it seems
      clear they wanted to avoid being held accountable long enough to retire and cash
      in (literally) on their experience managing technology centers and hiring contractors.
      One example may suffice. Alexander the Great (Prevaricator) For one such official
      this gambit worked like a charm. In 2013, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander went
      on the offensive, accusing Edward Snowden of breaking the law and endangering
      Americans. The supreme irony is that the lawbreaker was not Snowden. Rather, those
      breaking the law were NSA directors like Alexander playing fast and loose with
      the Fourth Amendment, and then claiming success in thwarting terrorism. After
      9/11 it was child’s play to manipulate members of Congress to take liberties with
      the Constitution and approve methods of dubious legality ostensibly to apprehend
      terrorists. Few in Congress would risk voting against legislation that officials
      like Gen. Alexander could later claim “might have prevented” an act of terrorism.
      As explained above, the technical collection methods they chose were not only,
      arguably, illegal. They were also so inefficient as to hinder, rather than help,
      intelligence efforts to thwart terrorist attacks. Not to worry: the contractors
      who introduced those systems profiteered grandly. So did the senior government
      officials who awarded multiple contracts and then slipped into highly comfortable
      retirement. Mr. Alexander is but one example. The public record shows that Alexander
      lied repeatedly in sworn testimony to members of Congress, who were intimidated
      into going along with his disingenuousness. After the Snowden disclosures, Alexander
      testified under oath that 54 terrorist plots had been foiled by the bulk collection
      in NSA’s vast phone records database. Under follow-up congressional questioning,
      Alexander admitted that only 13 of those 54 cases had any connection to the U.S.
      and that in only one, or perhaps two, of the 13 cases had a crime been foiled.
      At a hearing on Oct. 7, 2013, Senate Judiciary chair Patrick Leahy (D, VT) corrected
      Alexander’s prior testimony: “ There is no evidence that [bulk] phone records
      collection helped to thwart dozens or even several terrorist plots. These weren’t
      all plots and they weren’t foiled.” Lucrative Retirement When Gen. Alexander retired
      in early 2014, he landed a multi-million-dollar technical consulting job. Members
      of Congress accused him of profiteering by trading secrets for cash. Rep. Alan
      Grayson (D-FL), for example, charged him with disclosing “classified information
      to bank trade groups for monthly fees of up to $1,000,000.” In May 2014 Alexander
      founded IronNet Cybersecurity. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and
      bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. Listed on the NYSE in 2021, IronNet
      Cybersecurity was delisted in August 2023, leaving investors with worthless shares.

      the narrative suggesting a trade-off between national security and privacy rights

      need to combat terrorism. The choice was presented as an Either-Or conundrum.
      In what follows, we will show that this is a false choice. Rather, the “choice”
      can be a Both-And . In sum, all that is needed is to place advanced technology
      that has been already demonstrated into the hands of officials not driven by lust
      for a cushy retirement. Sophisticated collection and processing technology that
      also protects the right to privacy has been available for decades, enabling highly
      efficient and discriminating collection. Despite that, top officials have opted
      for quasi-legal, cumbersome, ineffective – and wildly expensive – technology that
      has done little more than line the pockets of contractors and “old-friend” retirees.
      U.S. officials have been caught lying under oath – with impunity – with false
      claims about the effectiveness of the intrusive, high price-tag technology they
      procured and implemented. In the Annex to this Memo we briefly portray the illustrative
      behavior of one such senior official. We do so in the belief that a short case
      study may shed light on the apparent motivation of many senior officials who seem
      to take far too lightly their oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the
      United States. We took the same oath. It has no expiration date. Security and
      Privacy: NOT Incompatible Technology already available – and already demonstrated
      to be effective – makes it possible for law-abiding officials, together with experienced
      technical people to create a highly efficient system in which both security and
      privacy can be assured. Again, the basic problems are corruption in government
      and the prevailing incestuous relationships with contractors. Advanced technology
      can pinpoint and thwart corruption in the intelligence, military, and civilian
      domain. At its core, this requires automated analysis of attributes and transactional
      relationships among individuals. The large data sets in government files already
      contain the needed data. And proven methodologies can automatically isolate activity
      of interest and equate this activity to profiles of interest, with inference to
      intentions and capabilities. To implement this approach requires assigning trustworthy
      people with deep knowledge of relevant activities in government agencies. This
      is a monumental task as these government agencies have been evolving and operating
      in their own way for decades and cloning their work force to perpetually operate
      in that way. So, the real problem goes beyond top management. Sweeping changes
      are required at all levels of management. Managing Intelligence Databases On the
      Intelligence Community side, there are ways to purge databases of irrelevant data
      and deny government officials the ability to spy on anyone they want. These methodologies
      protect the privacy of innocent people, while enhancing the ability to discover
      criminal threats. This process creates a rich but scaled-down environment to focus
      analysts for optimum success. If this method had been in place in 2016, it would
      have been impossible to spy on the president. In addition, this approach would
      provide a basis to monitor other government activities – like use or testing of
      biological or Directed Energy Weapons inside the U.S. – or other kinds of illegal
      activity by any government agency. It also means honest expert input is available
      to make sure the intelligence community does not deprive the White House of what
      it needs to know about the collection systems of NSA and others – like those exposed
      by Edward Snowden. This acquisition system can collect and store virtually all
      data passed on the worldwide web and the public switched telephone network. Legal
      Compliance In order to ensure continuous legal compliance with these changes,
      it is necessary to establish a central technical group or organization to continuously
      monitor and validate compliance with the Constitution and U.S. law. Such a group
      would need to have the highest-level access to all agencies to ensure compliance
      behind the classification doors. It must be able to go into any agency to inspect
      its activity at any time. In addition, whenever possible, it would be best to
      make government financial and operational transactions open to the public for
      review as a means of assuring the public that government agencies are doing their
      job properly. This new organization would be responsible for verifying that all
      government agencies are continuing to play by the rules, thus validating compliance
      with the law. Last, but hardly least, unbiased monitors must be in place to ensure
      funds are invested on the basis of merit not on the age-old practice of “who you
      know.” Potential For Abuse All the above-mentioned areas, and still more (e.g.,
      import and export smuggling) can be exposed using these automated analytic processes.
      But we need to emphasize that this could become a double-edged sword. These techniques
      can be used against innocent people. Actually, data from NSA’s mass collection
      is currently used by DOJ, F.B.I., DEA and DHS to target U.S. citizens, most of
      them innocent. If automated analytic technology was added to the current state
      of surveillance and combined with AI, robotics and drone technology, the result
      would be devastating to privacy and to democracy. This is precisely why it is
      absolutely critical to create a separate, independent, highly technical group
      to inspect government agency activities at all classification levels and to give
      that group the power to terminate special access programs that happen to be illegal,
      but kept hidden. In addition, this group should also be given authority to perform
      automated analysis of all government network logs. This, too, is key: a fail-safe
      method to detect any attempt to hide activity from oversight and inspection. To
      make this group or organization fully acceptable, it’s charter would probably
      require it to report to all three branches of government. Such an organization
      would go a long way toward making government truly transparent to the public in
      these areas. Moreover, automated analysis of network logs could also make intrusion
      detection easier to detect and thus improve cyber security. This would make it
      possible to stop intruders before they do damage – no matter the nature of the
      attack. Techniques That Are Both Legal and Effective In the above context, we
      suggest the following techniques for the Intelligence Community and broader government
      to manage mass surveillance data in a way that protects privacy, while maximizing
      the probability of threat detection. (Again, what we propose has been tested.
      In sum, it amounts to proof positive that it is unnecessary to sacrifice the right
      to privacy for some perceived measure of enhanced security.) First, do a focused
      professional study based on attributes and transactions that form the basis of
      probable cause. These techniques could also be used to purge current data bases
      of irrelevant data and enhance smart data collection. The following analytic techniques
      would protect privacy, detect impending threats, and optimize productivity of
      analysis: Focus on entities within two degrees of separation in communications
      or transactional relationships. Here, the second degree must not go through a
      commercial or government entity as this would pull in large numbers of irrelevant
      entities and bury analysts in too much information making them dysfunctional.
      This approach lets analysts focus on known targets and the ability to monitor
      new or expanding elements of these threats. Target surveillance on entities that
      have attributes like: frequent use of satellite phones in areas of the world where
      terrorists, drug smugglers, or other criminal activities are prevalent; target
      entities that frequently visit Internet sites that advocate violence, bomb making,
      pedophilia, and other types of criminality; target entities based on asset or
      informant information. Based on metadata, examine first degree networks in the
      communications or transactional relationships that cluster in areas where criminal
      activity is prevalent. This enables discovery of targets of interest previously
      unknown. Created, Tested, Proven In-House: Then Thwarted By early 1998, our NSA
      team in the SIGINT Automation Research Center (SARC) developed the ability to
      reconstruct files at fiber optic rates in the worldwide Internet. This meant NSA
      no longer had to select only a small percentage of internet data to process, but
      could get all data. Now, the only limitation was available power and space for
      equipment to process information. In August 1998, we gave a copy of this code
      to an NSA station in Bad Aibling, Bavaria, Germany to test and critique. The specialists
      at Bad Aibling found our method so superior to what they were using at the time
      that they installed it across the entire site late on a Friday night. However,
      they did not adopt our smart selection approach and continued to use the existing
      selection system. This meant, when our system reconstructed virtually everything
      on the lines, their existing selection system forwarded almost all of it. Consequently,
      eight to twelve hours later the NSA data storage system was about to crash. We
      were called in to shut down the input and prevent the impending crash. This event
      made it clear to NSA management not only the magnitude of the data explosion in
      the internet, but also that there were smart ways to address that data. That methodology
      had been created in-house and were dirt cheap. Creation of Google In his book,
      Pay Any Price (page 237), James Risen noted that at the time of the Bad Aibling
      event, there was a near simultaneous development in the ultimate creation of what
      became Google. It became clear several years later that both NSA and C.I.A. solicited
      and funded efforts to develop Google in September 1998 just one month after the
      Bad Aibling demonstration. So, in effect, the distributed data storage, metadata
      indexed, content management, profile development system we had operating at NSA’s
      SARC, and had been tested at Bad Aibling, was out-sourced to two beneficiaries
      at Stanford (Larry Page and Sergey Brin). With still more government funding (as
      well as access to SARC’s ingenuity and creative in-house system) Page and Brin
      went on to develop Google. What followed inside NSA after the Bad Aibling event
      was an effort to stop development of our in-house system – the one that had been
      proven to work, but had now been given to Page and Brin. NSA management officially
      shut SARC down in August 2001. Corruption The only fault in the unprecedentedly
      efficient system we had created was not a technical flaw, but a matter of cost,
      but it is not what you may be thinking. The system worked so well that it simply
      cost too little. The contractor systems NSA ended up buying were much less efficient
      but had the “advantage” of costing a lot more. Opting for outside systems required
      a much bigger budget and more staff to manage and perform related functions for
      the IC agencies involved. In addition, the mass data collection systems chosen
      lacked privacy protections and gave government agencies information on virtually
      everyone on the planet. (So much for the Fourth Amendment!) In sum, for the government
      and for Silicon Valley, there were huge financial and bureaucratic motives to
      stop us. For example, to develop our system to full capability in the NSA system
      would have cost about 3.2 million dollars. In contrast, the development of other
      privatized systems has cost the government 10’s of billions of dollars since 2001.
      A good deal of that cost went to formulating an effective process to analyze data.
      This effort was being done by contractors with expertise in classical technical
      skills like computer programming. The basic skills required to resolve such issues,
      however, are experience in intelligence analysis and in applying mathematics to
      organizations. Annex: A Case Study In spring 2013, after Edward Snowden exposed
      NSA abuses, U.S. intelligence directors misled Congress. In retrospect, it seems
      clear they wanted to avoid being held accountable long enough to retire and cash
      in (literally) on their experience managing technology centers and hiring contractors.
      One example may suffice. Alexander the Great (Prevaricator) For one such official
      this gambit worked like a charm. In 2013, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander went
      on the offensive, accusing Edward Snowden of breaking the law and endangering
      Americans. The supreme irony is that the lawbreaker was not Snowden. Rather, those
      breaking the law were NSA directors like Alexander playing fast and loose with
      the Fourth Amendment, and then claiming success in thwarting terrorism. After
      9/11 it was child’s play to manipulate members of Congress to take liberties with
      the Constitution and approve methods of dubious legality ostensibly to apprehend
      terrorists. Few in Congress would risk voting against legislation that officials
      like Gen. Alexander could later claim “might have prevented” an act of terrorism.
      As explained above, the technical collection methods they chose were not only,
      arguably, illegal. They were also so inefficient as to hinder, rather than help,
      intelligence efforts to thwart terrorist attacks. Not to worry: the contractors
      who introduced those systems profiteered grandly. So did the senior government
      officials who awarded multiple contracts and then slipped into highly comfortable
      retirement. Mr. Alexander is but one example. The public record shows that Alexander
      lied repeatedly in sworn testimony to members of Congress, who were intimidated
      into going along with his disingenuousness. After the Snowden disclosures, Alexander
      testified under oath that 54 terrorist plots had been foiled by the bulk collection
      in NSA’s vast phone records database. Under follow-up congressional questioning,
      Alexander admitted that only 13 of those 54 cases had any connection to the U.S.
      and that in only one, or perhaps two, of the 13 cases had a crime been foiled.
      At a hearing on Oct. 7, 2013, Senate Judiciary chair Patrick Leahy (D, VT) corrected
      Alexander’s prior testimony: “ There is no evidence that [bulk] phone records
      collection helped to thwart dozens or even several terrorist plots. These weren’t
      all plots and they weren’t foiled.” Lucrative Retirement When Gen. Alexander retired
      in early 2014, he landed a multi-million-dollar technical consulting job. Members
      of Congress accused him of profiteering by trading secrets for cash. Rep. Alan
      Grayson (D-FL), for example, charged him with disclosing “classified information
      to bank trade groups for monthly fees of up to $1,000,000.” In May 2014 Alexander
      founded IronNet Cybersecurity. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and
      bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. Listed on the NYSE in 2021, IronNet
      Cybersecurity was delisted in August 2023, leaving investors with worthless shares.

      in a memorandum that effective and legal data collection methods exist to combat
      terrorism without violating the Fourth Amendment, countering claims made since
      Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA's bulk surveillance practices.

      a memorandum to the President arguing that effective data collection to combat
      terrorism and crime does not require violating the U.S. Constitution, particularly

      the narrative suggesting a trade-off between national security and privacy rights

      Reed / The Grayzone On July 2, the Associated Press released an exposé containing
      short videos which appeared to show American mercenaries associated with the Gaza
      Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) opening fire on aid-seekers in Gaza during an incident
      in southern Gaza this May. The footage was supplied by a former employee of UG
      Solutions, a firm charged with securing GHF distribution sites. “I think you hit
      one,” one soldier of fortune says to another following a loud burst of gunfire.
      “Hell yeah, boy!” another exclaims. In an apparent attempt to control the damage
      from the AP investigation, UG Solutions has distributed a pair of videos comprising
      over seven minutes of footage to the press. The newly released footage offers
      an unprecedented glimpse of the disturbing interactions between the starving population
      of Gaza and well-armed, clearly unprepared Americans hired to provide security
      for GHF’s chaotic aid operations. Filmed by one of its own employee, the recordings
      were seemingly distributed in an effort to show UG Solutions’ agents have not
      fired live bullets on unarmed crowds of Palestinians. According to a UG Solutions
      statement, the videos “not only clarify what happened, but provide critical context,
      which contradicts that [sic] AP’s reporting and shows that the accusations are
      unfounded.” However, a closer examination by The Grayzone demonstrates that the
      video was anything but exculpatory. In one video, a ragtag group of mercenaries
      can be seen firing what they called “warning shots” toward a crowd of Palestinian
      civilians, whom they acknowledged to be non-threatening, before radioing the notoriously
      trigger-happy Israeli military for backup. Following a series of nearby gunshots,
      a UG Solutions mercenary can be heard radioing the IDF to inform them, “We are
      firing warning shots. Warning shots – that’s from us,” he says. Like all others
      heard in the video, he speaks in an American accent. Seconds before the gunshots
      ring out, a UG Solutions agent can be seen in the lower left hand corner of the
      screen aiming his rifle in the direction of a crowd of aid seekers. These crucial
      pieces of evidence undermine claims by a UG Solutions spokesman, who told the
      AP he was “unaware of video showing gunfire from someone believed to be a UG Solutions
      contractor.” While eroding the mercenary firm’s defense, the UG Solutions video
      also underscores the shambolic state of GHF’s supposedly humanitarian operations.
      Mercenary candid camera exposes “amateur hour” In the footage, the mercenary filming
      acknowledges that he and his fellow guns for hire are unable to exchange even
      basic Arabic phrases with the starving crowds. “Think I’m gonna write down some…
      Arabic words,” he says, before rattling off a series of expressions that reflected
      his team’s lack of training and utter inability to communicate: “Tomorrow. Back.
      Go home. Stop.” The mercenary tacitly acknowledges that in the absence of translation
      help, he and his team have been forced to rely on English speaking Gazan aid seekers.
      “There were a couple [Palestinians] that, like you said, spoke decent English,
      that were pretty helpful.” “I think for the most part they don’t have any mal
      intent, because they’re desperate,” the American continues, noting the absence
      of genuine security threats. A nearby mercenary chimes in, “They’re desperate
      as fuck.” Later, the cameraman complains that refugees hauled off a light pole
      and a nearby tree — presumably for firewood — before grumbling that the desperate
      crowds took GHF’s distribution tables from the site as well. The unsettling video
      seems to corroborate a high ranking UG Solutions contractor’s characterization
      of the firm’s Gaza operations as “amateur hour.” US spooks and ISIS affiliates
      team up with Israel. What could go wrong? UG Solutions splits armed operations
      in the besieged Gaza Strip with another US private mercenary firm, Safe Reach
      Solutions, which was founded by former CIA operative Philip Reilly. Both operate
      under the auspices of the Trump-aligned Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which received
      an initial investment from McNally Capital, a private equity firm founded by mapping
      heir Ward McNally. The Grayzone has reported that GHF also appears to have received
      substantial funding from Israel’s Mossad and Ministry of Defense. The US Department
      of State has since pledged $30 million dollars to keep the scandal-stained GHF
      operations afloat. As of July 6, 2025, over 700 people had been killed at the
      hands of the only armed factions operating in the so-called “humanitarian zones”:
      the GHF, Israel, and the formerly ISIS-aligned clan of Bedouin gang leader Yasser
      Abu Shabab , who was recently deputized as Israel’s local enforcers. Several Israeli
      soldiers have told Haaretz that they received orders to fire at aid seekers drawn
      to GHF distribution hubs, causing high numbers of deaths and injuries. “Where
      I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day,” one soldier
      told the Israeli paper. “They’re treated like a hostile force – no crowd-control
      measures, no tear gas – just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine
      guns, grenade launchers, mortars.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

      over seven minutes of footage to the press. The newly released footage offers
      an unprecedented glimpse of the disturbing interactions between the starving population
      of Gaza and well-armed, clearly unprepared Americans hired to provide security
      for GHF’s chaotic aid operations. Filmed by one of its own employee, the recordings
      were seemingly distributed in an effort to show UG Solutions’ agents have not
      fired live bullets on unarmed crowds of Palestinians. According to a UG Solutions
      statement, the videos “not only clarify what happened, but provide critical context,
      which contradicts that [sic] AP’s reporting and shows that the accusations are
      unfounded.” However, a closer examination by The Grayzone demonstrates that the
      video was anything but exculpatory. In one video, a ragtag group of mercenaries
      can be seen firing what they called “warning shots” toward a crowd of Palestinian
      civilians, whom they acknowledged to be non-threatening, before radioing the notoriously
      trigger-happy Israeli military for backup. Following a series of nearby gunshots,
      a UG Solutions mercenary can be heard radioing the IDF to inform them, “We are
      firing warning shots. Warning shots – that’s from us,” he says. Like all others
      heard in the video, he speaks in an American accent. Seconds before the gunshots
      ring out, a UG Solutions agent can be seen in the lower left hand corner of the
      screen aiming his rifle in the direction of a crowd of aid seekers. These crucial
      pieces of evidence undermine claims by a UG Solutions spokesman, who told the
      AP he was “unaware of video showing gunfire from someone believed to be a UG Solutions
      contractor.” While eroding the mercenary firm’s defense, the UG Solutions video
      also underscores the shambolic state of GHF’s supposedly humanitarian operations.
      Mercenary candid camera exposes “amateur hour” In the footage, the mercenary filming
      acknowledges that he and his fellow guns for hire are unable to exchange even
      basic Arabic phrases with the starving crowds. “Think I’m gonna write down some…
      Arabic words,” he says, before rattling off a series of expressions that reflected
      his team’s lack of training and utter inability to communicate: “Tomorrow. Back.
      Go home. Stop.” The mercenary tacitly acknowledges that in the absence of translation
      help, he and his team have been forced to rely on English speaking Gazan aid seekers.
      “There were a couple [Palestinians] that, like you said, spoke decent English,
      that were pretty helpful.” “I think for the most part they don’t have any mal
      intent, because they’re desperate,” the American continues, noting the absence
      of genuine security threats. A nearby mercenary chimes in, “They’re desperate
      as fuck.” Later, the cameraman complains that refugees hauled off a light pole
      and a nearby tree — presumably for firewood — before grumbling that the desperate
      crowds took GHF’s distribution tables from the site as well. The unsettling video
      seems to corroborate a high ranking UG Solutions contractor’s characterization
      of the firm’s Gaza operations as “amateur hour.” US spooks and ISIS affiliates
      team up with Israel. What could go wrong? UG Solutions splits armed operations
      in the besieged Gaza Strip with another US private mercenary firm, Safe Reach
      Solutions, which was founded by former CIA operative Philip Reilly. Both operate
      under the auspices of the Trump-aligned Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which received
      an initial investment from McNally Capital, a private equity firm founded by mapping
      heir Ward McNally. The Grayzone has reported that GHF also appears to have received
      substantial funding from Israel’s Mossad and Ministry of Defense. The US Department
      of State has since pledged $30 million dollars to keep the scandal-stained GHF
      operations afloat. As of July 6, 2025, over 700 people had been killed at the
      hands of the only armed factions operating in the so-called “humanitarian zones”:
      the GHF, Israel, and the formerly ISIS-aligned clan of Bedouin gang leader Yasser
      Abu Shabab , who was recently deputized as Israel’s local enforcers. Several Israeli
      soldiers have told Haaretz that they received orders to fire at aid seekers drawn
      to GHF distribution hubs, causing high numbers of deaths and injuries. “Where
      I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day,” one soldier
      told the Israeli paper. “They’re treated like a hostile force – no crowd-control
      measures, no tear gas – just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine
      guns, grenade launchers, mortars.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

    one_sentence_summary: An exposé by the Associated Press reveals footage of American
      mercenaries allegedly shooting at aid-seekers in Gaza, prompting UG Solutions
      to release counter-videos in an attempt to mitigate the fallout from the investigation.
    paragraph_summary: An exposé by the Associated Press revealed disturbing footage
      of American mercenaries linked to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) opening
      fire on aid-seekers in Gaza, raising serious concerns about the conduct of these
      hired security personnel. The videos, provided by a former employee of UG Solutions,
      show mercenaries celebrating after gunfire and attempting to control the narrative
      by releasing additional footage to counter the AP's claims. Despite UG Solutions'
      assertion that their videos clarify the situation and refute accusations of misconduct,
      an analysis by The Grayzone suggests that the footage actually highlights the
      mercenaries' reckless behavior, including firing "warning shots" at non-threatening
      Palestinian civilians before calling in the Israeli military for support.

      donation . By Victoria Malis, Katherine Dailey and Sadie Leite, Medill Investigative
      Lab, and Debbie Cenziper and Megan Rose, ProPublica Inspectors charged with safeguarding
      America’s drug supply say they are reeling from deep cuts at the Food and Drug
      Administration despite promises by the Trump administration to preserve the work
      of the agency’s investigative force. Dozens of people who help coordinate travel
      for complex inspections of foreign drug-making factories have been let go, and
      though some have since been rehired, inspectors said the ongoing strain of policing
      an industry spread across more than 90 countries has exhausted staff and could
      compromise the safety of medications used by millions of people. For years, inspectors
      have uncovered dirty equipment, contaminated supplies and fraudulent testing records
      in some overseas factories — serious safety and quality breaches that can sicken
      or kill consumers. Last month, ProPublica reported that a generic immunosuppression
      drug for transplant patients could dissolve too quickly when ingested, increasing
      the risk of kidney failure. The drug was made at an Indian factory with a history
      of quality violations that was banned from the U.S. market. The company previously
      told ProPublica it believes the medication is safe. In April, more than 3,500
      FDA employees were laid off under U.S. Department and Health and Human Services
      Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a roughly 15% reduction in force. “We aren’t
      just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its
      core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,”
      Kennedy said . At the time, the agency said the reductions would not impact inspectors.
      Kennedy has since announced that HHS would reverse 20% of the cuts across the
      agency. Amid news reports describing the layoffs at the FDA, Kennedy did not specify
      how many people would be reinstated. ProPublica spoke to 10 current and former
      FDA staff members and leaders in recent weeks, including inspectors who said that
      the loss of support staff has slowed critical investigations and that little relief
      has materialized. Most declined to be named because they were not authorized to
      speak publicly or feared backlash within the industry as they search for new jobs.
      One veteran drug inspector said nearly 70 people who helped arrange travel, budgets,
      translators and contingency plans for investigations were laid off. Only about
      one-third have been brought back, forcing a handful of busy managers to coordinate
      travel clearances and visas for inspections that can span weeks and include stops
      in multiple countries. “It’s difficult to get inspections done,” the investigator
      said. “The pace has slowed down. You can’t inspect as many sites.” In an email,
      an HHS spokesperson said inspections have not been affected by downsizing. The
      agency did not address questions about how many people have been let go or reinstated
      or whether additional help will be brought on. “To be clear, FDA inspectors were
      not impacted, and this critical work continues,” the agency said. Two former FDA
      commissioners and the agency’s longtime head of drug safety, however, said that
      the loss of support staff has undermined one of the FDA’s most essential missions
      at a time when Americans get most of their generic drugs from overseas manufacturers.
      That includes chemotherapy treatments, sedatives, antibiotics and medications
      on hospital crash carts. “It’s like saying, ‘Oh we didn’t fire any of the doctors
      or nurses at the hospital, but we fired all the lab techs, all the orderlies,
      all the phlebotomists … oh, but the doctors and nurses are still left so it’s
      fine,’” said Janet Woodcock, who ran the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and
      Research for more than two decades and retired in 2004. “A lot of the connective
      tissue that deals with drug safety and similar things are going to be missing.”
      Beyond the staff cuts, the departures of some longtime investigators and leaders
      in recent months have left less experienced people tasked with rooting out dangerous
      and sometimes deceptive manufacturing practices. The investigative unit, which
      looks into potential safety issues with drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other
      products, has had a retention problem for years. Inspectors leave so often that
      even with hiring blitzes, the FDA has been unable to get ahead. Between 2022 and
      2024, the agency hired 105 inspectors but about the same number left, leaving
      the inspection pool with about 230 people, according to the Government Accountability
      Office , the watchdog arm of Congress. About one-third did not have the experience
      to conduct independent foreign inspections, the GAO found. Two FDA inspectors
      said the agency needs an additional 100 to 200 experienced investigators to do
      the work. The job can be grueling. Some inspectors who travel to overseas drug-making
      factories can be away for as long as 15 weeks a year. Some have described threats
      of violence by company managers, days on planes and trains in oppressive heat
      and long nights preparing inspection reports before they head to the next stop.
      The loss of experienced investigators and cuts to support staff have also hamstrung
      other inspectors. “I am in utter shock that they don’t support and promote those
      of us who can do a decent inspection,” said one investigator who scrutinizes factories
      that produce vaccines, cell therapies and other biological products. “You’re adding
      to the chaos.” Dozens of employees who handled technology support, facilities,
      supplies and equipment were dismissed as well, snarling some day-to-day operations
      at the agency. One current employee recalled how a colleague couldn’t find replacement
      batteries for a computer mouse and how another locked herself out of her office
      and couldn’t get back in because there was no one to open the door. Even before
      the layoffs, the FDA’s investigative force struggled to monitor drug-making factories
      in countries that include India and China, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,
      raising alarms in Congress that serious manufacturing lapses may have gone unchecked.
      The FDA received more than 1 million reports from doctors, patients and others
      in 2023 about product quality issues or consumers who had adverse reactions to
      drugs, FDA data shows. “Things will be missed,” former FDA inspector Patrick Stone
      said about the layoffs. “We are going to have a lot less safe drugs.” The Trump
      administration has said little about the layoffs in recent weeks, though Kennedy
      told Congress late last month that more than 900 employees at the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health had been
      reinstated. The FDA announced in May that it would expand the use of unannounced
      inspections at overseas factories, a move that some members of Congress have been
      pushing for years. And FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that a new AI tool
      known as Elsa would help identify inspection targets. Current and former employees
      others say that won’t make up for the losses. “You can’t just expect the inspector
      to take care of all the complexities of organizing their trips overseas,” said
      former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, who served under the Obama administration.
      “Even though it might be said we’ve kept the inspectors, that doesn’t mean that
      they’ve kept the infrastructure … that actually supports safe and meaningful inspections.”

      At least 82 people have died and dozens are still unaccounted for after flash
      flooding in central Texas over the weekend, when the Guadalupe River rose about
      26 feet in less than an hour on Friday amid torrential downpours. At least 10
      girls who attended Camp Mystic, a girls’ summer camp located on the banks of the
      river, are among the missing. In Kerr County, the most devastated area, at least
      40 adults and 28 children have died. The speed and scale of the natural disaster
      has raised questions about why officials weren’t better prepared, and whether
      the Trump administration’s cuts to scientific positions exacerbated the situation.
      “The National Weather Service, like a lot of federal agencies, went through significant
      loss of staff back in the spring,” says retired NOAA meteorologist Alan Gerard,
      now the CEO of Balanced Weather, which provides critical weather and climate alerts.
      Gerard says that while it appears there was appropriate staffing ahead of the
      Texas flood, the impact of current budget cuts and even deeper reductions being
      considered by the administration are a cause for concern. “We still have all of
      hurricane season to deal with,” he says. Transcript This is a rush transcript.
      Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: The death toll from the catastrophic
      flooding in central Texas has reached 82 people. Dozens are still unaccounted
      for following flash flooding over the weekend. The Guadalupe River rose some 26
      feet in less than an hour Friday amidst torrential downpours. The rain followed
      a long drought in the region that left the soil bone dry and increased the potential
      for flooding. Among the missing are at least 10 girls who attended Camp Mystic,
      located on the banks of the river. In Kerr County, the most devastated area, at
      least 40 adults and 28 children have died. This is Kerrville resident Scott Walden
      describing the terrifying moments before he was swept almost 200 feet by raging
      floodwaters. SCOTT WALDEN: About 6:30 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning, we
      heard some thumps. I had a shed around the corner, and the shed started banging
      against the house. And my wife jumped up, and she looked out the back, and she
      said, “There’s a river back there.” And so we ran to the front. And by the time
      we grabbed two dogs and a set of keys, the water had risen, covered four motorcycles
      and flooded a jeep and then flooded a big truck. AMY GOODMAN: Rescue workers and
      volunteers are continuing their search for the fourth day. Questions and anger
      are mounting over local authorities’ preparedness warnings ahead of the disaster,
      as well as the current and future role of federal authorities. Experts say staff
      shortages at local offices of the National Weather Service and the lack of a local
      severe weather warning system, which the state wouldn’t fund, may have been part
      of the problem. President Trump has said he plans to phase out FEMA by the end
      of this year’s hurricane season and shift those responsibilities to states. A
      reporter asked Trump about his plans for FEMA Sunday. REPORTER: Are you still
      planning to phase out FEMA? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, FEMA is something we
      can talk about later, but right now they’re busy working, so we’ll leave it at
      that. AMY GOODMAN: Trump was also asked if the federal government should hire
      back any of the meteorologists that have been fired in recent months, to which
      President Trump said, quote, “I wouldn’t know that, and I would think not,” unquote.
      Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s 2026 budget promises to dismantle critical
      scientific research programs that could improve early warning capabilities and
      upgrade technology. That’s according to our next guest, who knows these programs
      extremely well. Dr. Alan Gerard is the CEO of Balanced Weather and a retired NOAA meteorologist
      with more than three decades of experience. He’s the former head of the Warning
      Research and Development Division of the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory.
      He’s been following the flooding closely on his Substack , Balanced Weather .
      Welcome to Democracy Now! , Alan Gerard. Thank you so much for being with us.
      This is absolutely devastating. It looks like well over a hundred people have
      died. About a quarter of them are children. We just heard Trump’s response, both
      on not hiring meteorologists that have been fired and not clear whether FEMA will
      continue, yet we hear local officials saying how desperate they are to continue
      to work with the National Weather Service. Can you talk about what took place
      and the fact that part of the severe flash flooding was caused by a drought? ALAN GERARD:
      Yeah. So, we’ll start with the flash flood. That area of the country is very vulnerable
      to flash flooding due to a number of factors, partially just due to the proximity
      of the Gulf and the moisture that can come up from there. And then also, that
      soil in central Texas, which is also very hilly, when there’s a prolonged drought,
      becomes almost like concrete, so the heavy rainfall just runs off into these river
      basins that, you know, runs through the Hill Country and can create these massive
      flood waves, like what we saw, unfortunately, on the south fork of the Guadalupe.
      AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the National Weather Service — in a moment,
      we’re going to talk about the new law, the budget law that went into effect — but
      the National Weather Service and the depletion of jobs and what is missing, what
      — most importantly, as we look forward, what is needed? ALAN GERARD: Yeah, so,
      the National Weather Service, you know, like a lot of federal agencies, went through
      significant loss of staff back in the spring with federal buyouts under the plans
      of DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management, and a number of experienced staff
      were lost. The office in Austin/San Antonio, which is the office that was responsible
      the flash flood warnings in this case, have lost two of their most senior staff
      as part of that: their warning coordination meteorologist, who’s responsible for
      the outreach to emergency management, and the science and operations officer,
      who oversees the operations and training of the meteorology staff. So, obviously,
      those are critical positions. I will say that it does appear like, overall, for
      the actual event, when it occurred, the warnings went out as they should have,
      that the office was staffed appropriately. But it is definitely a concern overall,
      you know, how well the staff, overall, would have been prepared, given those losses,
      and how well they’ll be prepared going forward, as we still have all of hurricane
      season to deal with. And then, kind of from a longer-term perspective, as you
      mentioned, the 2026 presidential budget proposal would make significant cuts to NOAA,
      including completely eliminating NOAA’s research line office, the Office of Oceanic
      and Atmospheric Research. And obviously, if that were to happen, all of this research
      that’s being done to try to improve warnings for events like this would be terminated.
      AMY GOODMAN: In fact, isn’t this weather research lab in Norman, where you are,
      Norman, Oklahoma, in the crosshairs of the cuts at the federal level, where you
      worked as you were former head of the warning research unit there? ALAN GERARD:
      Yes, the division that I was in charge of actually does a lot of research to improve
      flash flood warnings. The system that the National Weather Service uses to, in
      real time, estimate the probability of flash flooding and help issue their warnings
      was developed here in our division at the National Severe Storms Lab. And under
      the current presidential budget, it would be closed along with all of the other NOAA weather
      and climate labs. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, from the heat dome that we’re seeing in
      this country and in Europe — I was just in Geneva; it’s just scalding — in Spain,
      the fires outside Barcelona, can you end by talking about how serious the threat
      of climate change is right now to the planet, beginning right there in Texas,
      in this horrific flash flooding event that has killed, it looks like, well, over
      80, probably over a hundred, half — a quarter of them children? ALAN GERARD: Yeah,
      as someone that’s been doing this for 35 years, I’ll admit that early in my career
      I was a little skeptical about how much climate change would actually impact the
      weather events that I would see in my career. But after doing it for three decades
      and seeing the research and actually watching the weather every single day and
      seeing the increased frequency of these type of events, it’s a huge concern for
      me. And, you know, that’s part of the reason why, even in retirement, I’m doing
      the Substack, trying to speak out about this, because I’m extremely concerned
      about the threat of climate change and having more increased flash floods, wildfires,
      heat waves. And regardless of the politics of it, we need to be prepared. And
      really, my focus is just trying to improve our resilience and our ability to be
      prepared for these kind of events. And obviously, I strongly believe that having
      a robust NOAA and a robust National Weather Service, a robust research program
      from NOAA, is an important part of all of that, of keeping us as safe as we can
      be as the climate continues to change. AMY GOODMAN: This final point, Alan Gerard,
      Elon Musk’s own AI bot Grok also blamed the rising death toll in Texas on cuts
      made by the Trump administration and DOGE — right, Doge that was run by Elon Musk
      — saying, “While absolute proof of counterfactuals is impossible, evidence strongly
      suggests yes: Pre-cut NWS” — National Weather Service — “models accurately predicted
      similar floods (e.g. Vermont 2023). 2025 cuts reduced staff and balloon launches
      by 25%, leading to underestimated rainfall forecasts for Kerr County. Experts,
      including ex-NOAA heads, say this delayed warnings, preventing Camp Mystic evacuation
      and contributing to the 24 deaths. Sources: PBS, NPR, Guardian .” Your final 30
      seconds. Alan Gerard, on Democracy Now! today. ALAN GERARD: Not to contradict
      Grok, but I will say that this event did have quite a bit different than, like,
      the Vermont event that it cited. This was a very small-scale event that was very
      difficult for the computer models and for humans to really forecast, you know,
      very far in advance. Having said that, there is no question that the Weather Service
      is being left in a more vulnerable state. And whether it was this event or whether
      it’s going to be with future hurricane flood events like this, we’re needlessly
      putting ourselves into increased danger by these cuts to NOAA and the Weather
      Service and NOAA Research. And hopefully, you know, this is a horrible tragedy
      that, you know, is really unspeakable, but if anything positive could come out
      of it, maybe it will be a reconsideration of some of these cuts. AMY GOODMAN:
      Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us from Norman, Oklahoma, Alan
      Gerard, retired NOAA — that’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

      spreading across the region, from Lebanon and Syria to Oman and Saudi Arabia.
      Joining him in creating this vision is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
      who is slated to visit the White House on Monday. While there are potentially
      many obstacles to enacting this U.S./Israeli plan, it is clear that one focus
      is to quash any Palestinian aspirations for freedom. The aftermath of the attack
      on Iran Trump had little to say about Iran’s decision to suspend its cooperation
      with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), contenting himself with a
      State Department statement calling the decision “unacceptable.” For his own part,
      Trump has downplayed any continuing negotiations with Iran, claiming they would
      serve no purpose, given that he claims ( inaccurately ) that American strikes
      have “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program. Meanwhile, Trump has been pressing
      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to find an off-ramp in Gaza. He claims
      that Israel has accepted an American proposal for a 60-day ceasefire that would
      see the return of ten living Israeli hostages and an additional 15 bodies of hostages
      who died or were killed while in captivity. Israel has yet to confirm, despite
      misleading reports to the contrary. Whether there is a path toward Hamas accepting
      such a proposal is unclear, given that Hamas has insisted that they will only
      agree to a deal if it means freeing all the hostages in exchange for a permanent
      end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Ha’aretz reported on Thursday that Hamas “was
      satisfied” with the terms of the American proposal, but their source for this
      news, the New York Times, contained no mention of such satisfaction. Yet the Trump
      administration is clearly trying to get a ceasefire, and there is good reason
      to believe they do want to end the genocide. How far they will go to achieve that
      goal is an open question, but there is also the possibility that Netanyahu might
      be more amenable than he has been in the past. The reason for all of this has
      nothing to do with the Palestinians, but rather the region at large and domestic
      Israeli politics. Netanyahu’s strengthened position In the wake of the strikes
      on Iran, Netanyahu is in a stronger position politically than he has been in a
      long time. Polls suggest that neither he nor the opposition can cobble together
      a coalition if elections were held today. That’s familiar territory for Netanyahu.
      The problem he still faces is the corruption charges for which his trial is never-ending.
      Trump’s intervention, calling for the charges against Netanyahu to be dropped
      , is telling in this regard. While it is unlikely that Trump’s call will move
      the attorney general (whom Netanyahu is trying to fire) to drop the charges or
      for the President, Isaac Herzog, to pardon Netanyahu (something it is not clear
      he can do without Netanyahu being convicted first), it does indicate that Trump
      recognizes the need to remove this trial from Netanyahu’s path. Trump has certainly
      heard from Netanyahu that he cannot end the genocide in Gaza — because if he does,
      this trial will swallow him up and end his premiership in Israel. That is the
      sort of self-interest that Trump understands. But he also knows that the ambition
      he has for the region, which centers on a massive expansion of the Abraham Accords
      and widespread normalization between key Arab states and Israel, cannot move forward
      while the genocide continues. If Netanyahu’s government lasts until the next elections,
      which are scheduled for the end of October 2026, it is possible he could postpone
      them if he can make the case that the “security situation” demands it. But, given
      the diminished capacities of Iran and Hezbollah, the fall of Bashar al-Assad,
      and the fact that Hamas and other Palestinian groups are both diminished in terms
      of arms and too busy getting bombed and starving to pose much of a threat to Israeli
      citizens, that would be a difficult case to make. So, for Netanyahu, everything
      hinges on the corruption trial disappearing. It’s less crucial for Trump, as his
      plans would probably be supported by anyone who could defeat Netanyahu, be that
      former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, or opposition leaders Yair Lapid or Gadi
      Eizenkot (Benny Gantz, who last opposed Netanyahu, has faded badly). But the coalition
      they would form would be less militant, as it would not feature extreme ideologues
      like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir or supportive religious parties such
      as Shas and United Torah Judaism. It would still have plenty of right-wing figures,
      like Bennett and Avigdor Liberman, but it would be a coalition that was at once
      a bit more pragmatic than Netanyahu’s and a bit less in tune with Trump’s brand
      of right-wing populism. On top of all of that, the moment of triumphalism over
      the strikes on Iran is now. Already, more and more people are becoming aware of
      the fact that the operations against Iran, though devastating in many ways, did
      not “obliterate” Iran’s nuclear program . But they did change a lot of minds in
      Iran that had been reluctant to pursue a nuclear weapon. Although Iran is sticking
      with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for the moment, its decision to quit
      cooperating with the IAEA opens the door for leaving the NPT. The attacks on Iran
      have convinced many Iranians that only a nuclear deterrent will stop future attacks
      by Israel and the U.S. What does Trump want? In the wake of the American attack
      on Iranian nuclear facilities, Donald Trump’s key mediator, Steve Witkoff, teased
      that there were potentially several new and surprising countries that might soon
      join the Abraham Accords. One can only guess at what countries Witkoff was referring
      to, but some Israeli and Arab diplomats suggested that Saudi Arabia might be willing
      to at least resume discussions on normalization and that Oman might be willing
      to entertain normalization talks. Both would only happen if the genocide in Gaza
      stops. There is also Syria. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the country’s new leader, has made
      no secret of his willingness to find an accommodation with Israel. For Trump,
      this means normalization. But the situation there is far more fraught than Trump
      might think. There are major obstacles to normalization with Israel. Beyond the
      ongoing genocide in Gaza, there is the outstanding issue of the Golan Heights.
      Trump may have recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the portion of the Golan that
      Israel captured before the armistice with Syria in 1974, but the rest of the world,
      and certainly the Syrian people across the ethnic and political spectrum, have
      not. Al-Sharaa is not in a very secure position in Syria, to say the least. Skepticism
      about his rule remains in the country as well as in the wider Arab world and the
      West. Years ago, there were various scenarios about compromise on the Golan, mostly
      pursued under the rule of Hafez al-Assad. But it’s been many years since any substantive
      discussions took place. They were controversial in Syria then, and they would
      be even more so now. A deal with Israel and the American support it would bring
      would be a huge boon to the shattered Syrian economy, which gives al-Sharaa some
      room to maneuver. Syria has been said to have proposed two scenarios in which
      it would get back part of the Golan that Israel seized prior to the armistice
      between the two states in 1974. Israel would have to be willing, however, to make
      that compromise and withdraw from all of the territory it invaded after Bashar
      al-Assad’s fall and, obviously, cease all its attacks in Syria. Whether Israel
      would be willing to do that is very much open to question. More than that, al-Sharaa
      has to consider the response to compromising any part of the Golan domestically.
      If he gets a significant part of the Golan back, it might be enough, given the
      dire need in Syria and the potential for a deal to address that need. But Israeli
      Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said recently that, “Israel applied its laws to
      the Golan Heights over 40 years ago, and in any peace agreement, the Golan will
      remain an inseparable part of the State of Israel.” Lebanon has also attracted
      Trump’s attention. It is doubtful that even in his most wide-eyed moments, Trump
      believes the shaky Lebanese government could agree to relations with Israel, even
      if Israel withdrew from the areas of southern Lebanon it still occupies and stopped
      its ongoing (though rarely reported very widely) attacks in Lebanon. Instead,
      Trump wants to see Hezbollah fully disarmed, a goal shared by Lebanon’s new President,
      Joseph Aoun. But where Aoun wants to do this gradually, through dialogue as a
      path to Lebanese unity, Trump wants it done quickly and in a way that visibly
      diminishes Hezbollah — not only as a military force but as a political power.
      U.S. envoy Tom Barrack has been pushing the government to quickly move to disarm
      Hezbollah. That indicates a reckless impatience on the part of the Trump administration
      that threatens to undermine the efforts by the Lebanese government under Aoun
      to negotiate Hezbollah’s disarmament and establish the Lebanese Armed Forces as
      the sole defender of Lebanon. Hezbollah has already stated its refusal to the
      American plan. It has indicated its willingness to engage in dialogue with Aoun,
      but its position is that it will not disarm. Aoun would have to negotiate a deal
      to change their minds. He has also demanded that progress on disarming Hezbollah
      be met with steps by Israel to back out of its ongoing occupation of Lebanese
      territory and its routine attacks. Israel, for its part, is not showing much flexibility,
      demanding that Hezbollah be disarmed immediately, that its forces be moved even
      farther north than they’ve already gone, and indicating it will not give up its
      positions in southern Lebanon, offering to abandon only one of the five sites
      it occupies. The vision for Netanyahu’s visit What emerges from all of this is
      that Trump envisions Syria joining Jordan and Egypt as neighbors that make peace
      with Israel, with Lebanon joining that group sometime in the future. If Oman can
      be persuaded to join the Abraham Accords alongside Gulf Arab states Bahrain and
      the UAE, this would pave the way for Saudi Arabia to join as well. With what Trump
      sees as a chastened Iran forced to watch from the sidelines, that would create
      a Middle East whose center is in an exclusively Israeli Jerusalem. Iran, Iraq,
      and even Yemen would be forced to reckon with a playing field that forefronts
      Israel, relegates the Palestinians to an afterthought, and strongly incentivizes
      states that haven’t normalized with Israel to find an accommodation with Israel
      and its Arab partners. In Trump’s view, this could all be accomplished merely
      by ending the genocide in Gaza, not requiring an actual Palestinian state or any
      other measure of freedom for the Palestinian people. Is that realistic? Certainly
      not within the kind of timeframe Trump envisions. The Saudis would, if the genocide
      ended and a number of other states normalized relations with Israel, find a reason
      to join, given the right amount of bribes from Washington, probably including
      help on a Saudi nuclear program and significantly upgraded weapon sales. They
      would likely go back to demanding some vague roadmap to a Palestinian state, but
      would not demand a more solid commitment to a process as they are doing now. But
      in Syria and Lebanon, the opposition would be tremendous, and it would very likely
      be supported by many voices in Jordan and Egypt, and obviously, in Iran, Iraq,
      and Yemen. The repression against such solidarity would need to be draconian,
      and it’s not at all clear that Syria or Lebanon has either the security capacity
      or the political space to do that. Indeed, abandoning the Palestinians to that
      degree, while perhaps not unprecedented for Arab leaders, would spark considerable
      outrage in both Jordan and Egypt as well and, at least in Jordan, could very well
      be fatally destabilizing. Netanyahu might be willing to embrace this as a long-term
      vision as he sits with Trump in Washington next week. But he knows it can’t be
      achieved in the short term. Instead, he is going to move forward with the genocide
      in Gaza until Trump makes him stop. Meanwhile, pressure from Netanyahu’s Likud
      party to annex the West Bank is growing, with some ultra-nationalists also calling
      to annex Gaza . Netanyahu is not likely to approve such moves as long as Trump’s
      efforts to expand normalization keep moving forward. If and when they fail, however,
      Netanyahu will be ready with annexation. This is likely a tool Trump will use
      in pressing Arab leaders to normalize relations with Israel. In all of it, whichever
      direction events move, the Palestinians are, once again, being set up for abandonment.
      The question is how long Arab leaders can keep a lid on the outrage throughout
      the region and how long Western leaders will continue to ignore and repress the
      growing anger over the support Israel is getting from our governments. Please

      By Juan Cole / Informed Comment Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – The fascist government
      of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to wage war on Gaza civilians,
      in the longest and most intense violation of the Geneva Conventions, the Rome
      Statute and other elements of International Humanitarian Law in this century.
      The United Nations Human Rights office in the Occupied Palestinian territories
      recently revealed that the Israeli military continues to subject the al-Mawasi
      region in western Khan Younis to military strikes, which for the most part “appear
      to target directly makeshift tents” and so manage to wipe out entire families.
      The UN says, “Between 18 March and 16 June 2025, OHCHR recorded 112 attacks on
      Al Mawasi, killing 380 people, including at least 158 women and children.” At
      the same time, sadistic commanders are ordering Palestinian civilians from other
      parts of Gaza to go to “known shelters” in that very Al Mawasi area where such
      shelters are being bombarded. Since last March when Israel violated the ceasefire
      negotiated by the Trump administration, its minions have forced over 300,000 people
      into Al Mawasi, an area of about 3.5 square miles. There are now 425,000 people
      huddling there, mostly in so-called “tents” — really just odd bits of plastic
      and cloth. And they are sometimes being shot at like fish in a barrel, even as
      Israel’s military attacks in Rafah and Khan Younis have become more intense. At
      the same time, Israeli commanders continue deliberately to starve the civilian
      population, continuing in some form a blockade on staples they began on March
      2, when they began violating the ceasefire arranged by President Trump, according
      to Amnesty International. The blockade on food and other aid has been only slightly
      adjusted in recent weeks, leaving many people hungry — including children. That’s
      right, Israel is deliberately starving children. The UN Office for the Coordination
      of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated in mid-June that 18,741 children have
      been hospitalized for acute malnutrition since the beginning of the year. And
      mind you, few hospitals are functioning even at a basic level in Gaza, because
      Israeli troops have deliberately destroyed them. The harried doctors and nurses
      who haven’t been assassinated by the Israeli army are trying to deal with those
      injured in the war, and you wonder if they can do much for children with stick-like
      arms and distended bellies. They don’t have food aid to give out, and what food
      there is has become extremely expensive. That is, by the way, typical of famine
      situations, which usually develop not because there is no food at all but because
      people cannot afford what little there is. That is how a million Irish died during
      the Potato Famine in the mid-nineteenth century, when British landlords continued
      to export food from the country. Amnesty quotes Susan Maarouf of the Benevolent
      Friend Patient Hospital in Gaza City: “But this year for us the situation began
      to drastically get worse again in April. Since then, out of approximately 200-250
      children we have screened daily for malnutrition. Nearly 15% showed signs associated
      with severe or moderate malnutrition.” They exhibited signs such as “pale skin,
      falling hair and nails, and alarming weight loss.” There are a million minors
      in Gaza, so we could be talking about 150,000 children with malnutrition, if Maarouf’s
      sample is representative. Please share this story and help us grow our network!

      from Damascus, local sources told Al Mayadeen . The troops raided a site belonging
      to the Republican Guard of Syria’s former military. “The search operation lasted
      for five hours before the force departed via helicopter,” Al Mayadeen ’s sources
      added. “Another Israeli force entered the village of Saysoun in the Yarmouk Basin
      area of ​​the western Deraa countryside, with six military vehicles,” the sources
      went on to say. Simultaneously, Israeli troops launched ground incursions into
      Rakhlah in the western Damascus countryside. Additional forces reportedly entered
      Ayn Dhakar in the Yarmouk Basin area. “This was the first incursion of its kind
      into the area,” Al Mayadeen ’s sources noted. Since the fall of former Syrian
      president Bashar al-Assad’s government last year, Israeli forces have established
      a widespread occupation across southern Syria. Israeli troops have set up a new
      base on Eastern al-Ahmar hill in Quneitra governorate in southern Syria, local
      sources told Al-Akhbar newspaper on 1 July. The hill lies adjacent to a nearby
      Israeli base established months earlier on the western side of the same ridge.
      Israeli forces are “rapidly working to turn it into a key operational hub,” the
      sources said. Israel’s continued expansion in Syria comes amid negotiations between
      Tel Aviv and Damascus, and talk of a potential normalization agreement between
      them. The Syrian government claims the negotiations are indirect. However, Israeli
      National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi confirmed on 24 June that Israel is engaged
      in direct, daily communication with Syria’s interim authorities, with the aim
      of exploring normalization. Speaking to Israel Hayom , Hanegbi said he personally
      leads the talks “at all levels” with political officials in Damascus. According
      to Israeli media reports, a potential meeting between Syrian interim President
      Ahmad al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is being considered
      for the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York. Please share this story

      More than 1 million people in the European Union died from avoidable causes in
      2022, according to new data from a Eurostats report. Of these, over 386,000 deaths
      were attributed to diseases treatable with quality healthcare, while at least
      725,000 could have been prevented through effective public health interventions.


      The conditions cited include heart disease, COVID-19, and several cancers – such
      as colon, breast, and lung cancer – that experts have long said could be more
      effectively addressed with proper investment in screening and treatment. Despite
      these warnings, European authorities continue to slash funding for health and
      care services while committing record sums to military spending.


      Eurostat’s report indicates that Eastern European countries are disproportionately
      affected. Latvia had the highest rate, with 543 preventable deaths per 100,000
      people, followed by Romania, Hungary, and Lithuania: countries where public health
      systems have been severely weakened by fiscal constraints and transition to profit-oriented
      services. In comparison, Sweden and Luxembourg recorded 169 and 180 preventable
      deaths per 100,000, respectively.


      “It is shocking and unacceptable that more than a million people are losing their
      lives every year in the EU to avoidable conditions because our healthcare services
      are not properly funded,” said Esther Lynch, General Secretary of the European
      Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). “It also shows there is absolutely no room to
      reallocate resources from social spending to defense.”


      In response, trade unions have renewed their call to end austerity and ensure
      that the wealthiest contribute fairly to the functioning of public services. “The
      resources exist: even a modest 1% tax on extreme wealth would be sufficient to
      cover staff shortages in health,” stated Jan Willem Goudriaan of the European
      Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU). “Our public services need more investment
      and the wealthiest should pay their fair share in the wake of record corporate
      profits and dividend payouts,” added Lynch.


      A key trade union demand is increased funding for the training and hiring of healthcare
      workers. OECD data shows a current shortage of at least 1.2 million healthcare
      workers in Europe: this figure is likely underestimated, as it is based on minimum
      Universal Health Coverage (UHC) thresholds rather than the actual requirements
      for universal care.


      The staffing crisis is taking a serious toll on both workers and patients, with
      widespread reports of burnout and unsafe conditions, including overcrowded corridors
      and inadequate staffing ratios. “Commercialization and privatization do not solve
      these issues,” Goudriaan said. “We urgently need more public funding to address
      this. ‘Austerity kills’ is not just a slogan – it’s the reality faced daily by
      patients and health professionals.”

      By Kit Klarenberg / The Cradle


      Ever since Israel launched its illegal war of aggression against Iran on 13 June,
      speculation has swirled around the role played by MOSAIC – a tool created by shadowy
      spy-tech firm Palantir.


      This software has been deeply embedded within the International Atomic Energy
      Agency’s (IAEA) operations, particularly its “safeguarding” mission: inspections
      and monitoring state compliance with non-proliferation agreements.


      MOSAIC has been central to this work for a decade and was quietly integrated by
      former US president Barack Obama’s administration into the July 2015 Joint Comprehensive
      Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal with Iran.


      Espionage disguised as oversight


      The deal granted IAEA inspectors unfettered access to Iran’s nuclear facilities
      to confirm the absence of a nuclear weapons program. In the process, the agency
      accumulated an immense trove of data: surveillance imagery, sensor measurements,
      facility documents – all of which were fed into MOSAIC’s predictive system.


      Yet the software’s pivotal role in the deal remained concealed until a Bloomberg
      exposé in May 2018, just days before US President Donald Trump, during his first
      term, unilaterally tore up the agreement and launched Washington’s so-called “maximum
      pressure” campaign against Tehran.


      Despite Trump tearing up the deal, inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities continued,
      as did MOSAIC’s monitoring of Tehran’s nuclear program. As Bloomberg noted, Palantir’s
      technology helped the IAEA scrutinize vast swaths of information from disparate
      sources, including 400 million “digital objects” globally, such as “social media
      feeds and satellite photographs inside Iran” – a capability that “raised concern
      the IAEA may overstep the boundary between nuclear monitoring and intelligence-gathering.”


      The Bloomberg piece also provided fodder for an oft-stated Iranian concern that
      Mosaic was helping Israelis track Iranian scientists for assassination:


      “The tool is at the analytical core of the agency’s new $50 million MOSAIC platform,
      turning databases of classified information into maps that help inspectors visualize
      ties between the people, places and material involved in nuclear activities, IAEA
      documents show.”


      Bloomberg quoted the head of a British company that “advises governments on verification
      issues” on the hazards of false data being fed into MOSAIC, “either by accident
      or design”:


      “You will generate a false return if you add a false assumption into the system
      without making the appropriate qualifier …You’ll end up convincing yourself that
      shadows are real.”


      The underlying and ongoing concern for Tehran is that MOSAIC is heavily influenced
      by Palantir’s “predictive-policing software.” Employed by many law enforcement
      agencies across the western world at enormous expense, this technology is highly
      controversial and has been found to exhibit dangerous, misleading biases, leading
      to erroneous “pre-crime” interventions.


      Indeed, MIT Technology Review has flat-out called for the dismantlement of predictive
      tech in a report that looks at how dangerous the technology has been in analyzing
      even domestic criminal data:


      “Lack of transparency and biased training data mean these tools are not fit for
      purpose. If we can’t fix them, we should ditch them.”


      Given the inclusion of dubious intelligence – such as the Mossad-stolen Iranian
      nuclear archive, openly celebrated by the Israeli agency for its deception – it
      is highly probable that such corrupted data triggered unjustified inspections.
      Bloomberg quoted a negotiator who helped craft the 2015 deal, expressing concern
      over how “dirty or unstructured data” could lead to “a flurry of unnecessary snap
      inspections.”


      Palantir’s software specifically helped the IAEA “plan and justify unscheduled
      probes” – at least 60 of these conducted until US-Israeli strikes put an end to
      inspections.


      Data as a weapon


      On 31 May, the IAEA released a report suggesting Iran may still be developing
      nuclear weapons. Although it presented no new evidence, its dubious charges related
      “to activities dating back decades” at three sites where, purportedly, until the
      early 2000s, “undeclared nuclear material” was handled.


      Its findings prompted the UN nuclear watchdog’s Board of Governors to charge Iran
      as “in breach of its non-proliferation obligations” on 12 June, providing Tel
      Aviv with a propaganda pretext for its illegal attack the next day.


      On 17 June, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi conceded that the agency had “no proof of
      a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon” by Tehran. Still, the damage
      was done. Iranian lawmakers, citing the IAEA’s secret sharing of sensitive data
      with Tel Aviv and Grossi’s covert collusion with Israeli officials, suspended
      all cooperation with the agency.


      This may be the wisest course for other states under IAEA scrutiny. MOSAIC is
      now so entwined with the agency’s daily function that any country targeted for
      regime change could find itself accused of nuclear ambitions based on manufactured
      evidence.


      A 2017 IAEA document reveals MOSAIC is comprised of “over 20 different software
      development projects.” Launched in May 2015, it was hoped to revolutionize “safeguarding”
      the world over.


      The report described MOSAIC as providing inspectors with “a suite of tools with
      which to face the challenges of tomorrow.” For instance, the Electronic Verification
      Package (EVP) enables field data – including planning, reporting, and review –
      to be automatically collected and processed. When inspectors visit a facility,
      they record vast amounts of information – instantly analyzed at headquarters via
      EVP.


      Elsewhere, the Collaborative Analysis Platform (CAP) enables deep cross-referencing
      of internal and open-source data, including overhead imagery. It supports the
      IAEA’s core safeguarding processes: “planning, information collection and analysis,
      verification, and evaluation.”


      CAP gives the IAEA “the capability to search, collect, and integrate multiple
      data and information sources to enable comprehensive analysis.” An IAEA official
      quoted in the document declared the platform represented “a major leap forward
      in analytics” and “a game changer”, allowing the IAEA to collect “a much greater
      amount of information, and also analyze that information in greater depth than
      before.”


      Such analytical capacity grants inspectors “the ability to establish relationships
      between information from multiple sources, across time,” and “make sense out of
      huge amounts of data.”


      CAP also assists in the collection and evaluation of open-source information.
      The document noted the platform could “process much more open-source information
      than the Department currently has capacity for,” and lets staff “search information
      across the entire repository; carefully cross-check different types of information;
      and utilize information in visual formats,” such as “overhead imagery.”


      ‘Extra-budgetary contributions’ from the US government


      All of this intelligence is highly sensitive and would be a treasure trove for
      states intent on military action against nations in the IAEA’s crosshairs. According
      to the 2017 report, inspectors spent 13,248 days in the field in 2015 and inspected
      709 nuclear facilities. Those figures have since grown. All the while, MOSAIC
      – a little-known tool for the “early detection of the misuse of nuclear material
      or technology” – has remained operational.


      The report noted that MOSAIC was financed through the IAEA’s regular budget, the
      Major Capital Investment Fund, and “extra-budgetary contributions.” Its cost at
      the time was around €41 million (approximately $44.15 million) – almost 10 percent
      of the agency’s total annual budget. The source and size of those extra-budgetary
      contributions remain vague, perhaps deliberately, but a Congressional Research
      Service briefing note indicates Washington formally funds the IAEA to the tune
      of over $100 million annually.


      Moreover, the US consistently provides in excess of $90 million in extra-budgetary
      contributions every year. In other words, almost half of the IAEA’s budget flows
      from Stateside, suggesting MOSAIC was created wholly on Washington’s dime.


      The timing of its rollout – two months prior to the Obama administration’s nuclear
      deal being agreed – could further indicate it was explicitly funded with Iran
      in mind. As then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano revealed in March 2018, the
      association’s penetration of Tehran was unprecedented.


      At a press conference, Amano referred to the IAEA’s nuclear “verification regime”
      in Iran as “the world’s most robust.” The organization’s inspectors spent “3,000
      calendar days per year on the ground” in the country, capturing “hundreds of thousands
      of images captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras,” which was
      “about half of the total number of such images that we collect throughout the
      world.”


      In all, “over one million pieces of open source information” were collected by
      the IAEA monthly.


      The IAEA’s fixation on Iran, coupled with suspicions that it provided the names
      of nuclear scientists – later assassinated by Israel – raises the question: Was
      the 2015 deal always an industrial-scale espionage operation designed to prepare
      for war?


      A wave of assassinations of nuclear scientists and IRGC commanders in the early
      stages of Tel Aviv’s failed war on Iran appears to support that conclusion.


      Iranian officials not only suspended cooperation with the IAEA and ordered the
      dismantlement of inspection cameras, but also rejected Grossi’s request to visit
      bombed nuclear sites. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi branded the IAEA chief’s
      insistence on visiting under the pretext of safeguards “meaningless and possibly
      even malign in intent.”


      What is clear is that any state still cooperating with the IAEA must now reckon
      with the possibility that it is not being monitored – it is being mapped for war.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the controversial role of MOSAIC, a software
      developed by Palantir, in the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) monitoring
      of Iran's nuclear program, particularly following Israel's military actions against
      Iran. Initially integrated into the 2015 nuclear deal under the Obama administration,
      MOSAIC has been used to analyze vast amounts of data, including surveillance imagery
      and social media, raising concerns about its potential misuse for espionage rather
      than purely for oversight. Critics argue that the software could lead to unjustified
      inspections and has been implicated in facilitating the tracking of Iranian scientists
      for assassination. The IAEA's reliance on MOSAIC, funded significantly by the
      U.S., has led to fears that its operations may serve as a pretext for military
      action against Iran, prompting Iranian officials to suspend cooperation with the
      agency. The article highlights the implications of using such technology in international
      relations, suggesting that countries under IAEA scrutiny could be at risk of being
      mapped for potential military intervention rather than being monitored for compliance.

      By Vijay Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research


      A decade ago, I was a fly on the wall during a trade negotiation between the United
      States and a small country in Southeast Asia. What interested me was not the substance
      of the negotiation, the deliberations around an issue of minor concern to world
      affairs but of great concern to this one country, but the disproportionality between
      the personnel at the negotiating table.


      The delegation from the United States that arrived at this nondescript office
      in Geneva, Switzerland, was considerable in two respects: first, it had an overabundance
      of lawyers and associates, and second, they came armed with a large number of
      binders that had all the paperwork for their case, replete with labelled page-holders
      so that they could dive directly into the points they needed to make in the discussion.
      The contingent from the Asian country, on the other hand, was sparse: it was made
      up of a lone representative from its United Nations office in Geneva who was neither
      a trade specialist nor a lawyer and who came armed only with a manila folder holding
      a few sheets of paper. The negotiations reflected this unevenness, with the US
      trade representatives running circles around the junior Asian bureaucrat. I went
      to have a coffee with this bureaucrat afterwards. He was rattled. He felt robbed.


      A few years ago, a mid-level official from an East African country told me that
      he had signed a loan agreement with an Asian bank without having the skills to
      understand the loan document or the time to read it from start to finish. Around
      the same time, an official from a ministry in Latin America told me that they
      outsource their analysis of trade documents to a foundation linked to a non-profit
      organisation from the United States. In other words, their negotiations are based
      on the briefs provided by this foundation and not their own analysis and assessment.
      These examples could easily be multiplied, the stories recounted vaguely so as
      not to embarrass colleagues and countries that have been put in very difficult
      circumstances by neocolonial structures.


      It is hard to quantify the impact of such institutional imbalances, largely because
      there is no international agency that collects data on government officials in
      general or on negotiators in particular. Among the sparse data that exists in
      this arena is the World Bank’s Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators Dashboard, which
      shows that roughly 18.6% of the total working population in the Global North is
      employed by the government, while in the Global South that number is closer to
      10%. An International Labour Organisation study on Africa shows us that the numbers
      are much lower in many countries, below 3% in African countries such as Chad,
      Côte d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, and Tanzania. While there is no granular data
      on the number of trade negotiators or trade lawyers in the government, for instance,
      the above is a reasonable picture of the general disparity between the state capacity
      in the North and South.


      The scale of this disparity is incredible (the exceptions are socialist state
      projects, such as China and Vietnam, where government officials remain well trained
      and in larger numbers – making up about a fifth of the workforce in China). Many
      of the reasons for this inequality are obvious, but they are worth listing at
      any rate:


      Most public administration schools in the Global South have seen enormous budget
      cuts induced by the International Monetary Fund’s debt-austerity policies, impacting,
      for instance, the ability to train teachers and create syllabi that are both up
      to date and relevant to the specific national conditions in which these future
      public servants will have to operate. Alongside the austerity measures imposed
      on public administration schools, there has also been a steady closure or contraction
      of state planning commissions and research departments. These are the institutions
      that would normally provide government cadres with an intellectual orientation
      toward their country’s position in the international economy and the immediate
      tasks for a national development programme. The lack of such institutions leaves
      cadres without a clear mandate or direction. There has been an attrition of general
      patriotic and anti-colonial sentiment among government employees who are underpaid
      and undertrained. This psychological warfare brought about by neoliberalism and
      cultural imperialism means that newer generations of public servants are both
      unable to argue the case for the well-being of their people and are prone to inducements
      of different kinds (including corruption). An increased sense of individualism
      among the population has also led to careerism and the accumulation of personal
      wealth and privileges at the expense of national interest. As state-run institutions
      have been closed or shrunk, Western-funded non-governmental organisations have
      emerged to provide ‘technical assistance’. These programmes are often staffed
      by people who are trained in foreign universities, have a class background that
      is not necessarily aligned with the vast majority of the population, and have
      a limited understanding of the historical and sociological developments in their
      country. Moreover, the agendas of these institutions are designed by their foreign
      benefactors who are often driven by their own self-interest.


      The attrition of public administration schools, combined with the lack of political
      will within governments to assert the sovereignty of their societies, has allowed
      the ambitions of multinational corporations and international financial institutions
      to set the direction of these countries. This lack of capacity and political clarity
      has meant that states in the Global South routinely surrender to the well-developed
      agendas of foreign institutions that are often much clearer about what they want.
      The need to build administrative capacities in the Global South goes hand in hand
      with the broader need for a new development theory for the South so that we may
      be able to define our own agenda, against that of the neocolonial interlopers.


      Sitting in that meeting in Geneva some years ago, watching the US officials and
      their lawyers walk circles around the junior Southeast Asian official, I thought
      of Nizar Qabbani’s 1967 poem ‘Footnotes to the Book of the Setback’, written shortly
      after the Palestinians’ defeat in the Six-Day War. The poem, published in Damascus,
      Syria, was subsequently banned and smuggled into countries across the Arab world.
      Two lines from the poem ricocheted around my mind:


      Our enemies did not cross our borders.


      They crept through our weaknesses like ants.


      We must strengthen our weaknesses.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the significant disparities in negotiating
      power and institutional capacity between the Global North and South, highlighting
      how these imbalances hinder effective representation and decision-making for countries
      in the Global South during international trade negotiations.
    paragraph_summary: In his article, Vijay Prashad highlights the significant disparities
      in negotiating power between representatives from the Global North and Global
      South, illustrated through personal anecdotes from trade negotiations and loan
      agreements. He emphasizes the institutional weaknesses faced by countries in the
      Global South, stemming from budget cuts to public administration schools and the
      contraction of state planning commissions due to austerity measures imposed by
      international financial institutions. This has resulted in a lack of trained personnel
      capable of effectively representing their nations' interests in international
      negotiations, leading to a reliance on foreign NGOs for technical assistance,
      which often do not align with local needs. Prashad argues that the erosion of
      national sovereignty and capacity allows multinational corporations and foreign
      institutions to dictate terms, underscoring the urgent need for the Global South
      to build administrative capacities and develop a new framework for self-determined
      progress against neocolonial influences.

      By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News


      On Tuesday, July 1, 2025, African Stream published its final video, a defiant
      farewell message. With that, the once-thriving pan-African media outlet confirmed
      it was shutting down for good. Not because it broke the law. Not because it spread
      disinformation or incited violence. But because it told the wrong story, one that
      challenged U.S. power in Africa and resonated too deeply with Black audiences
      around the world. When Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused it of being a
      Kremlin front, Big Tech didn’t hesitate, and within hours, the platform was erased
      from nearly every major social media site.


      In September, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made the call and announced
      an all-out war against the organization, claiming, without evidence, that it was
      a Russian front group. “Russian state-funded media outlet RT secretly runs the
      online platform, African Stream, across a wide range of social media platforms,”
      he said, adding:


      According to the outlet’s website, ‘African Stream is’ – and I quote ‘a pan-African
      digital media organization based exclusively on social media platforms, focused
      on giving a voice to all Africans, both at home and abroad.’ In reality, the only
      voice it gives is to Kremlin propagandists.”


      Within hours, big social media platforms jumped into action. Google, YouTube,
      Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok all deleted African Stream’s accounts, while Twitter
      demonetized the organization.


      AFRICAN STREAM IS CLOSING DOWN




      This is, sadly, a farewell to you, our loyal followers and supporters. Under relentless
      attack, we’ve made the painful decision to shut down African Stream—a platform
      that many of you’ve come to trust and love. This decision was not made lightly.…
      pic.twitter.com/LNRbT00Lkv — African Stream (@african_stream) June 22, 2025


      African Stream attempted to continue, but it finally ceased operations this week.
      MintPress News spoke with the company’s founder and CEO, Ahmed Kaballo, who told
      us that, with just one statement, Washington was able to destroy their entire
      operation, stating:


      We are shutting down because the business has become untenable. After we got attacked
      by Antony Blinken, we really tried to continue, but without a platform on YouTube,
      Instagram, TikTok, and being demonetized on X, it just meant the ability to generate
      income became damn near impossible.”


      The news has disappointed the Nairobi, Kenya-based outlet’s large and rapidly
      growing follower base. At the time of the coordinated operation against it, the
      account boasted almost one million followers on TikTok, almost 880,000 on Instagram,
      and almost half a million on YouTube, reaching 30-40 million people per month.
      Growing from nothing in 2022, it expanded rapidly, offering a pan-African perspective
      on global events, and worked to expose the role of imperialism on the continent.


      African Stream cultivated a large and committed audience among African Americans,
      with celebrities, rappers, and NBA basketball stars regularly sharing their content.
      It was this combination of anti-imperialist messaging and influence with Black
      America that Kaballo believes triggered the State Department smears, explaining
      that:


      We criticized the Republicans and the Democrats. We followed the pan-African tradition
      of Malcolm X, who said that there is no difference between the fox and the wolf,
      you get bitten either way. And because we had so much influence on the Black community
      in the U.S., we were seen to be a threat to the Democratic Party. That’s why we
      feel like it was a partisan attack.”


      Blinken’s attack was not the first African Stream had received. Last June, NBC
      News claimed (without providing examples) that African Stream sought to undermine
      the 2024 elections by spreading disinformation. Then, in August, U.S. government-funded
      media outlet Voice of America wrote that Kaballo’s organization “distorts the
      U.S. military’s mission in Somalia,” insisting that the U.S. is bombing one of
      the continent’s poorest countries to “protect civilians.” Leaked documents also
      show that the British Foreign Office plotted to run a smear campaign against them.


      Kaballo told MintPress that he expected the attacks. “It’s no real surprise,”
      he said. “The surprise was that big tech, with no evidence whatsoever, decided
      to take us down.”


      However, given the extremely close ties between Silicon Valley and the U.S. national
      security state – something that MintPress has consistently reported on – Kaballo
      should perhaps have been more prepared for this outcome.


      Google’s Director of Security and Public Trust, Ben Randa, for example, was formerly
      NATO’s Strategic Planning and Information Officer. Meanwhile, Facebook’s Senior
      Misinformation Policy Manager, Aaron Berman, the individual most responsible for
      determining the platform’s political direction, is a former high-ranking CIA agent.
      Like other platforms, TikTok has also hired dozens of former officials from the
      FBI, CIA, and State Department to oversee its most sensitive internal affairs.


      If Blinken genuinely wanted to unearth a government-sponsored influence operation,
      he would not have to look far. Earlier this year, a funding freeze at the U.S.
      government agency USAID exposed a global network of supposedly “independent” media
      outlets that Washington secretly bankrolled. The scale of this operation was vast:
      more than 6,200 journalists at nearly 1,000 organizations across five continents
      had their salaries secretly paid in whole or in part by the U.S. government.


      While the outlooks of these media groups differed, they all shared one similarity:
      an unwavering commitment to promoting Washington’s interests.


      The pause in funding was keenly felt in Ukraine. Oksana Romanyuk, the director
      of the country’s Institute for Mass Information, lamented that almost 90% of local
      media outlets were funded by USAID, including many with no other source of income.


      In neighboring Belarus, a survey of 20 leading outlets found that 60% of their
      budgets came directly from Washington.


      Following the freeze, anti-government Cuban media were plunged into an existential
      crisis. Miami-based CubaNet, for instance, published an editorial soliciting donations
      from its readers. “We are facing an unexpected challenge: the suspension of key
      funding that sustained part of our work,” they wrote; “If you value our work and
      believe in keeping the truth alive, we ask for your support.”


      In 2024, CubaNet received around half a million dollars from USAID alone. U.S.-backed
      Iranian media, meanwhile, resorted to mass layoffs of their staff.


      The African Stream story highlights the sorry state of global communications,
      where the United States has the power to choke, and even simply delete, media
      outlets that stand for an alternative vision of the world. Washington both funds
      thousands of journalists around the planet to produce pro-U.S. propaganda, and,
      through its close connections to Silicon Valley, has the power to destroy those
      that do not toe the line.


      African Stream is far from the first independent, anti-imperialist news organization
      to have been targeted by Washington. MintPress itself has been repeatedly attacked
      and smeared as a secret Iranian, Chinese, Russian, Syrian, or even Venezuelan
      operation. Our reach on social media has been throttled, and we have been debanked
      by PayPal. Other leading alternative media outlets tell a similar story.


      It is a similar story in Europe, where the region’s support for Israeli actions
      in Palestine has sparked a crackdown on independent journalism. British journalists
      Richard Medhurst and Asa Winstanley have had their homes raided by police, while
      the European Union has sanctioned Hüseyin Dogru for his coverage of pro-Palestine
      protests.


      In what may prove to be their final post, on Tuesday, July 1, African Stream released
      a video of their staff dancing, accompanied by the words:


      It’s tough to accept that we had to shut down over baseless accusations by the
      U.S. government. But instead of bowing out in silence, the team chose to resist,
      just as our ancestors often did, through dance. You can deplatform us. You can
      smear us. But you can’t stop us dancing.”


      On the surface, the overt censorship of a Kenyan media outlet by the U.S. government
      may be a depressing story. Yet Kaballo remained upbeat about the situation, noting
      that the state of radical African media has drastically improved since 2022, with
      many channels taking up a pan-African, anti-imperialist message. “In the next
      few years, hopefully there will be 20 or 30 different versions of African Stream,
      hitting people with high-quality content,” he said.

      By Ben Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report


      The Global South-led organization BRICS continues to expand.


      While the United States and Israel were busy waging war on Iran in June, BRICS
      quietly announced that Vietnam had accepted the group’s invitation to join as
      a partner country.


      With the addition of Vietnam, the extended BRICS+ has 20 members and partners,
      as of July 2025.


      The 10 BRICS members are Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia,
      Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.


      The 10 BRICS partners are Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria,
      Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.


      Together, the BRICS 20 make up 43.93% of the global economy, when their combined
      GDP is measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), according to IMF data.


      The BRICS 20 have a combined population of 4.45 billion, out of a global population
      of 8.01 billion in 2025, based on IMF data.


      This means that BRICS+ represents 55.61% of the world population.


      BRICS was initially founded as BRIC – by Brazil, Russia, India, and China – in
      2009. South Africa joined in 2010, and it became BRICS.


      The Global South-led organization first expanded at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg,
      South Africa in 2023, adding new members.


      At its 2024 summit in Kazan, Russia, BRICS invited a dozen more countries to join
      as “partner states”.


      Since it has expanded, the group has frequently been referred to as BRICS+, although
      there is not a fixed definition of this term, and both names are used.


      Vietnam had been invited to become a BRICS partner at the summit in October 2024,
      but it waited to accept the invitation until June 2025.


      USA fails to divide China and Vietnam: Hanoi maintains non-alignment


      Vietnam’s decision to join BRICS is deeply symbolic, because it reaffirms the
      country’s independent foreign policy and strategic non-alignment.


      BRICS itself shares many commonalities with the Non-Aligned Movement, which was
      founded by anti-colonial Global South leaders who refused to participate in the
      First Cold War.


      In the 21st century, the United States has sought to divide Vietnam from China,
      as part of the Second Cold War that Washington is waging against Beijing.


      The US government plans to reroute supply chains through Vietnam to exclude China,
      in an example of what has been dubbed “friendshoring”.


      Washington has pressured US companies to technologically “decouple” from China,
      to pull their investments out of the country, and to instead relocate to Vietnam.


      This divide-and-conquer policy has been pursued by both the Donald Trump and Joe
      Biden administrations.


      US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager from Wall
      Street, sought to recruit Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, and India to isolate China
      in what Bloomberg described as a “grand encirclement” strategy.


      Vietnam, however, has adamantly resisted US efforts to sabotage its relations
      with China.


      In fact, relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in recent years, following
      the tumultuous decades of the First Cold War and the Sino-Soviet split, when Vietnam
      had leaned much closer to the USSR.


      China is Vietnam’s largest trading partner. The US is the second-biggest.


      Donald Trump’s threat to impose high tariffs on Vietnam, whose economy depends
      a lot on exports to the US market, has only encouraged Hanoi and Beijing to move
      closer together.


      Today, Vietnam promotes non-alignment, based on the policy of the “Four Nos”,
      which the Vietnamese government has defined as follows:


      no partaking in military alliances,


      no siding with one country to act against another,


      no foreign military bases in the Vietnamese territory or using Viet Nam as leverage
      to counteract other countries, and


      no using force or threatening to use force in international relations.


      Despite their geopolitical differences after the Sino-Soviet split, the People’s
      Republic of China and Socialist Republic of Vietnam have very similar political
      and economic systems, especially after both carried out a market reform process.


      China describes its system as a socialist market economy. Vietnam calls its system
      a socialist-oriented market economy.


      The market-socialist models in China and Vietnam have been remarkably successful
      in economically developing, reducing poverty, raising incomes of the working class,
      and moving up the global value chain of industrial manufacturing.

      By DemocracyNow!


      In our July Fourth special broadcast, we revisit our interview with longtime technology
      reporter Karen Hao, author of the new book Empire of AI, which unveils the accruing
      political and economic power of AI companies — especially Sam Altman’s OpenAI.
      Her reporting uncovered the exploitation of workers in Kenya, attempts to take
      massive amounts of freshwater from communities in Chile, along with numerous accounts
      of the technology’s detrimental impact on the environment. “This is an extraordinary
      type of AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental
      harms,” says Hao, in an extended interview.


      Transcript


      This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.


      AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
      I’m Amy Goodman.


      We turn now to the Empire of AI. That’s the name of a new book by the journalist
      Karen Hao, who’s closely reported on the rise of the artificial intelligence industry
      with a focus on Sam Altman’s OpenAI. That’s the company behind ChatGPT. Karen
      Hao compares the actions of the AI industry to those of colonial powers in the
      past. She writes, quote, “The empires of AI are not engaged in the same overt
      violence and brutality that marked this history. But they, too, seize and extract
      precious resources to feed their vision of artificial intelligence: the work of
      artists and writers; the data of countless individuals posting about their experiences
      and observations online; the land, energy, and water required to house and run
      massive data centers and supercomputers,” she writes.


      Karen Hao is a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal and MIT Technology Review,
      where she became the first journalist to profile OpenAI. Democracy Now!’s Juan
      González and I spoke to her in May. I began by asking her to explain what artificial
      intelligence is.


      KAREN HAO: So, AI is a collection of many different technologies, but most people
      were introduced to it through ChatGPT. And what I argue in the book, and what
      the title refers to, Empire of AI, it’s actually a critique of the specific trajectory
      of AI development that led us to ChatGPT and has continued since ChatGPT. And
      that is specifically Silicon Valley’s scale-at-all-costs approach to AI development.


      AI models in modern day, they are trained on data. They need computers to train
      them on that data. But what Silicon Valley did, and what OpenAI did in the last
      few years, is they started blowing up the amount of data and the size of the computers
      that need to do this training. So, we are talking about the full English-language
      internet being fed into these models — books, scientific articles, all of the
      intellectual property that has been created — and also massive supercomputers
      that run tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of computer chips that
      are the size of dozens, maybe hundreds, of football fields and use practically
      the entire energy demands of cities now. So, this is an extraordinary type of
      AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental harms.
      And that is ultimately why I evoke this analogy to empire.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Karen, could you talk some more about not only the energy
      requirements, but the water requirements of these huge data centers that are,
      in essence, the backbone of this widening industry?


      KAREN HAO: Absolutely. I’ll give you two stats on both the energy and the water.
      When talking about the energy demand, McKinsey recently came out with a report
      that said in the next five years, based on the current pace of AI computational
      infrastructure expansion, we would need to put as much energy on the global grid
      as what is consumed by two to six times the energy consumed annually by the state
      of California, and that will mostly be serviced by fossil fuels. We’re already
      seeing reporting of coal plants with their lives being extended. They were supposed
      to retire, but now they cannot, to support this data center development. We are
      seeing methane gas turbines, unlicensed ones, being popped up to service these
      data centers, as well.


      From a freshwater perspective, these data centers need to be trained on freshwater.
      They cannot be trained on any other type of water, because it can corrode the
      equipment, it can lead to bacterial growth. And most of the time, it actually
      taps directly into a public drinking water supply, because that is the infrastructure
      that has been laid to deliver this clean freshwater to different businesses, to
      different homes. And Bloomberg recently had an analysis where they looked at the
      expansion of these data centers around the world, and two-thirds of them are being
      placed in water-scarce areas. So they’re being placed in communities that do not
      have access to freshwater. So, it’s not just the total amount of freshwater that
      we need to be concerned about, but actually the distribution of this infrastructure
      around the world.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And most people are familiar with ChatGPT, the consumer aspect
      of AI, but what about the military aspect of AI, where, in essence, we’re finding
      Silicon Valley companies becoming the next generation of defense contractors?


      KAREN HAO: One of the reasons why OpenAI and many other companies are turning
      to the defense industry is because they have spent an extraordinary amount of
      money in developing these technologies. They’re spending hundreds of billions
      to train these models. And they need to recoup those costs. And there are only
      so many industries and so many places that have that size of a paycheck to pay.
      And so, that’s why we’re seeing a cozying up to the defense industry. We’re also
      seeing Silicon Valley use the U.S. government in their empire-building ambitions.
      You could argue that the U.S. government is also trying to use Silicon Valley,
      vice versa, in their empire-building ambitions.


      But certainly, these technologies are not — they are not designed to be used in
      a sensitive military context. And so, the aggressive push of these companies to
      try and get those defense contracts and integrate their technologies more and
      more into the infrastructure of the military is really alarming.


      AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to the countries you went to, or the stories you covered,
      because, I mean, this is amazing, the depth of your reporting, from Kenya to Uruguay
      to Chile. You were talking about the use of water. And I also want to ask you
      about nuclear power.


      KAREN HAO: Yeah.


      AMY GOODMAN: But in Chile, what is happening there around these data centers and
      the water they would use and the resistance to that?


      KAREN HAO: Yeah. So, Chile has an interesting history in that it’s been under
      — it was under a dictatorship for a very long time. And so, during that time,
      most public resources were privatized, including water. But because of an anomaly,
      there’s one community in the greater Santiago metropolitan region that actually
      still has access to a public freshwater resource that services both that community,
      as well as the rest of the country in emergency situations. That is the exact
      community that Google chose to try to put a data center in. And they proposed
      for their data center to use a thousand times more freshwater than that community
      used annually.


      AMY GOODMAN: And it would be free.


      KAREN HAO: And it — you know, I have no idea. That is a great question. But what
      the community told me was they weren’t even paying taxes for this, because they
      believed, based on reading the documentation, that the taxes that Google was paying
      was, in fact, to where they had registered their offices, their administrative
      offices, not where they were putting down the data center. So they were not seeing
      any benefit from this data center directly to that community, and they were seeing
      no checks placed on the freshwater that this data center would have been allowed
      to extract.


      And so, these activists said, “Wait a minute. Absolutely not. We’re not going
      to allow this data center to come in, unless they give us a legitimate reason
      for why it benefits us.” And so, they started doing boots-on-the-ground activism,
      pushing back, knocking on every single one of their neighbors’ doors, handing
      out flyers to the community, telling them, “This company is taking our freshwater
      resources without giving us anything in return.”


      And so, they escalated so dramatically that it escalated to Google Chile. It escalated
      to Google Mountain View, which, by the way, then sent representatives to Chile
      that only spoke English. But then, it eventually escalated to the Chilean government.
      And the Chilean government now has roundtables where they ask these community
      residents and the company representatives and representatives from the government
      to come together to actually discuss how to make data center development more
      beneficial to the community.


      The activists say the fight is not over. Just because they’ve been invited to
      the table doesn’t mean that everything is suddenly better. They need to stay vigilant.
      They need to continue scrutinizing these projects. But thus far, they’ve been
      able to block this project for four to five years and have gained that seat at
      the table.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how is it that these Western companies, in essence, are exploiting
      labor in the Global South? You go into something called data annotation firms.
      What are those?


      KAREN HAO: Yeah, so, because AI, modern-day AI systems are trained on massive
      amounts of data, and they’re scraped — that’s scraped from the internet, you can’t
      actually pump that data directly into your AI model, because there are a lot of
      things within that data. It’s heavily polluted. It needs to be cleaned. It needs
      to be annotated. So, this is where data annotation firms come in. These are middle-man
      firms that hire contract labor to provide to these AI companies to do that kind
      of data preparation.


      And OpenAI, when it was starting to think about commercializing its products and
      thinking about, “Let’s put text-generation machines that can spew any kind of
      text into the hands of millions of users,” they realized they needed to have some
      kind of content moderation. They needed to develop a filter that would wrap around
      these models and prevent these models from actually spewing racist, hateful and
      harmful speech to users. That would not make a very good, commercially viable
      product.


      And so, they contracted these middle-man firms in Kenya, where the Kenyan workers
      had to read through reams of the worst text on the internet, as well as AI-generated
      text, where OpenAI was prompting its own AI models to imagine the worst text on
      the internet and then telling these Kenyan workers to detail — to categorize them
      in detailed taxonomies of “Is this sexual content? Is this violent content? How
      graphic is that violent content?” in order to teach its filter all the different
      categories of content it had to block.


      And this is an incredibly uncommon form of labor. There are lots of other different
      types of contract labor that they use. But these workers, they’re paid a few bucks
      an hour, if at all. And just like the era of social media, these content moderators
      are left very deeply psychologically traumatized. And ultimately, there is no
      real philosophy behind why these workers are paid a couple bucks an hour and have
      their lives destroyed, and why AI researchers who also contribute to these models
      are paid million-dollar compensation packages simply because they sit in Silicon
      Valley, in OpenAI’s offices. That is the logic of empire, and that harkens back
      to my title, Empire of AI.


      AMY GOODMAN: So, let’s go back to your title, Empire of AI, the subtitle, Dreams
      and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI. So, tell us the story of Sam Altman and
      what OpenAI is all about, right through to the deal he just made in the Gulf,
      when President Trump, Sam Altman and Elon Musk were there.


      KAREN HAO: Altman is very much a product of Silicon Valley. His career was first
      as a founder of a startup, and then as the president of Y Combinator, which is
      one of the most famous startup accelerators in Silicon Valley, and then the CEO
      of OpenAI. And there’s no coincidence that OpenAI ended up introducing the world
      to the scale-at-all-costs approach to AI development, because that is the way
      that Silicon Valley has operated in the entire time that Altman came up in it.


      And so, he is a very strategic person. He is incredibly good at telling stories
      about the future and painting these sweeping visions that investors and employees
      want to be a part of. And so, early on at YC, he identified that AI would be one
      of the trends that could take off. And he was trying to build a portfolio of different
      investments and different initiatives to place himself in the center of various
      different trends, depending on which one took off. He was investing in quantum
      computing, he was investing in nuclear fusion, he was investing in self-driving
      cars, and he was developing a fundamental AI research lab. Ultimately, the AI
      research lab was the ones that started accelerating really quickly, so he makes
      himself the CEO of that company.


      And originally, he started it as a nonprofit to try and position it as a counter
      to for-profit-driven incentives in Silicon Valley. But within one-and-a-half years,
      OpenAI’s executives identified that if they wanted to be the lead in this space,
      they “had to” go for this scale-at-all-costs approach — and “had to” should be
      in quotes. They thought that they had to do this. There are actually many other
      ways to develop AI and to have progress in AI that does not take this approach.


      But once they decided that, they realized the bottleneck was capital. It just
      so happened Sam Altman is a once-in-a-generation fundraising talent. He created
      this new structure, nesting a for-profit arm within the nonprofit, to become this
      fundraising vehicle for the tens of billions, and ultimately hundreds of billions,
      that they needed to pursue the approach that they decided on. And that is how
      we ultimately get to present-day OpenAI, which is one of the most capitalistic
      companies in the history of Silicon Valley, continuing to raise hundreds of billions,
      and, Altman has joked, even trillions, to produce a technology that ultimately
      has a middling economic impact thus far.


      AMY GOODMAN: We’ll return to our conversation in a minute with Karen Hao, author
      of the new book, Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI. Stay
      with us.

      By Ana Vračar / Peoples Dispatch


      With a majority of 385 to 26, British parliamentarians voted on Wednesday to proscribe
      the direct action group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation, moving
      one step closer to criminalizing public support for its campaigns. The move, announced
      by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper after activists threw red paint on two Royal Air
      Force (RAF) planes, has drawn widespread condemnation as an assault on free speech
      and dissent, and has already sparked protests.


      “The British government deciding that Palestine Action should be proscribed as
      a terrorist organization is insanity, but not quite as insane at the continued
      support of Israel, an apartheid and genocidal state,” a Palestine Action activist
      told Peoples Dispatch. But the goal of this decision goes much further than a
      single group. “This is about silencing support of Palestine and silencing support
      of the resistance. Whilst mainstream media and everyone’s focus is on this, Israel
      is still murdering Palestinians daily.”


      Ahead of the vote, a group of UN experts urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration
      to reconsider, warning that the terrorism charges cited by Cooper are misleading
      and risk setting a dangerous precedent. Rather than addressing genuine acts of
      terror, the experts argued, the move will impact individuals exercising their
      rights to free opinion, peaceful assembly, and political participation. “This
      would have a chilling effect on political protest and advocacy generally in relation
      to defending human rights in Palestine,” the experts wrote.


      Attacks on the Palestine solidarity movement intensify


      Solidarity with Palestine has come under intense repression across Europe, especially
      as public opposition to government complicity in the Gaza genocide continues to
      grow louder. Artists who have expressed support on stage, as well as campaigners,
      face legal action. In the UK alone, activists Chris Nineham of Stop the War Coalition
      and Ben Jamal from Palestine Solidarity Campaign are both scheduled to stand trial
      just days after a final decision on the proscription of Palestine Action is expected.
      Activists who took direct action against enterprises complicit in genocide, including
      weapon manufacturers like Rafael, remain imprisoned. At the same time, bands like
      Kneecap and Bob Vylan face frenzied mainstream media backlash for expressing support
      for Palestinian liberation at concerts.


      “The attempt to proscribe Palestine Action as a ‘terrorist’ organization is yet
      another British colonial crime against the Palestinian people and a clear indication
      of British imperialism’s commitment to full complicity and participation in the
      ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and throughout occupied Palestine,”
      the prisoner solidarity network Samidoun said in a statement ahead of Wednesday’s
      vote.


      As the government moves to ban Palestine Action, critics highlight its own continued
      and active role in enabling Israeli war crimes. British authorities have allowed
      Israeli aircraft, including some linked to bombing campaigns in Gaza, to use RAF
      bases, including the site activists targeted with paint. “As the government criminalizes
      those engaged in protesting a genocide, it continues to shamefully facilitate
      the real violence these protestors oppose,” independent MP Jeremy Corbyn told
      Drop Site.


      Corbyn and other independent and former Labour MPs have proposed a formal inquiry
      into Britain’s complicity in the genocide, seeking to review all military, political,
      and economic cooperation with Israel since October 2023. However, few are holding
      their breath for a meaningful change in government policy, especially given ongoing
      industrial and tech ties, such as Elbit Systems’ operations in the UK and Palantir’s
      planned role in the National Health Service.


      “In coming to this decision [proscribing Palestine Action], the government has
      decided that an Israeli arms manufacturer has more rights than a British citizen
      who cannot abide killing and maiming,” the Palestinian Youth Movement wrote. Similarly,
      MP Zarah Sultana stated that Palestine Action’s true crime was shutting down Elbit
      Systems sites that provide supplies to the Israeli military. “Its true offence
      is being audacious enough to expose the blood soaked ties between this government
      and the genocidal Israeli apartheid state and its war machine,” Sultana said.


      Action against genocide as moral duty


      If Palestine Action is officially listed as a terrorist organization, activists
      could face severe prison sentences simply for displaying the group’s merchandise
      or expressing support. Journalists could also be targeted, as staff at Novara
      Media have warned, highlighting the potential for raids on homes and the seizure
      of devices just for reporting factually on the matter.


      The way the vote was orchestrated has also attracted serious criticism. Cooper
      bundled the proscription of Palestine Action with votes on far-right groups, including
      one called “Maniacs Murder Cult.” The move was widely understood as a tactic to
      block MPs from dissenting. In response, Palestine Action warned that MPs should
      be able to see through manipulations like these and oppose them. “All those who
      vote to take away everyone’s freedom of speech today must be held accountable,”
      the group wrote on Wednesday. “Putting us alongside the Maniacs Murder Cult is
      no excuse to vote for proscription.”


      If the motion passes through parliamentary procedure this week as planned, the
      ban could come into effect as early as Saturday. Despite the risk, public support
      for the group remains intact. Protesters have continued to rally in its defense,
      insisting on the legitimacy of direct action in the face of genocide. “Supporting
      a genocide is terrorism, direct action to stop a genocide is the duty of humanity,”
      wrote the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).

      By Sasha Abramsky / Truthout


      At last week’s NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that
      his country would be buying a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S., each one
      capable of carrying a payload of tactical nuclear weapons. It marks the first
      time since shortly after the end of the Cold War that U.S. nuclear weapons capable
      of being dropped from aircraft are to be stationed in the U.K.


      At the NATO summit, a triumphant Trump — who has made skepticism about NATO and,
      at best, ambivalence about its collective defense provisions centerpieces of his
      emergent political ideology over the decades – engaged in one of the most brazen
      displays of shakedown politics in modern history. In exchange for maintaining
      U.S. security commitments, the U.S. president demanded, in the weeks leading up
      to the summit, that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent
      of their GDP on defense and security, more than doubling what most NATO members,
      with the exception of Poland and the Baltic States, currently spend.


      Leaders of the NATO member countries competed with each other over who could fawn
      the most in efforts to gain Trump’s favor, and ultimately almost all of them fell
      into line, agreeing to huge defense spending hikes over the coming decade. Their
      goal is that by 2035 they will be spending at least 3.5 percent of their respective
      GDPs on core military spending, and another 1.5 percent on security and miscellaneous
      other expenditures designed to harden economies and infrastructure against cyberattacks,
      people trafficking, and additional risks and perceived risks to NATO economies.


      The one exception was Spain, the socialist government of which balked at the increased
      spending commitment and received an opt-out, to the chagrin of Trump, who launched
      a blitz of social media posts against the Spanish government and declared that,
      in consequence, Spain would have to pay twice as much in tariffs in any future
      trade deal with the U.S. (This seemingly ignores the fact that Spain is a part
      of the EU and can’t be treated differently from other bloc members in any negotiated
      agreement.)


      NATO leader Mark Rutte, ex-head of the Dutch government, lauded Trump as “Daddy,”
      and praised to the rafters his decision to pre-emptively attack Iran’s nuclear
      facilities. Photos showed him laughing and smiling at every Trump aside, like
      a courtier at the Sun King’s court, a display of quite astounding sycophancy.
      Other NATO leaders followed suit. Cumulatively, The Guardian wrote, it was an
      “orchestrated grovel,” the likes of which hadn’t previously been seen in U.S.
      relations with its allies. This wasn’t a conference of equals; rather it was a
      spectacle in which the U.S.’s strongman demanded — and received — the sort of
      accolades and over-the-top tributes that Soviet general secretaries used to demand
      from satellite state leaders in Eastern Europe, or that emperors of old required
      of conquered vassals.


      Trump’s agenda was pretty straightforward: if Europe and Canada wanted the security
      guarantees that the U.S. has provided since World War II, then they would have
      to pay through the nose for the privilege. This would be manifested through massively
      increasing military spending, reducing domestic safety net spending, and channeling
      hundreds of billions of dollars toward U.S. arms manufacturers.


      The F-35A fighter jets alone will cost the British government over 1 billion pounds,
      and, once refueling planes, which the jets will need to operate far from U.K.
      shores, and other supportive infrastructure are factored in, that cost will rise
      still further. That’s money going straight to Lockheed Martin.


      This same week, the U.K. government has been pushing for massive reductions to
      social safety-net payments for hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities
      — and has, in consequence, faced a huge rebellion from within its own Labour Party
      ranks. And that follows on from an ill-fated effort last year to curtail an energy
      assistance program intended to ensure that Brits, especially pensioners, could
      keep their heating on during the cold winter months.


      Similar trade-offs will, in coming years, be felt throughout NATO. Unlike the
      U.S., which for years has been able to tap international lenders’ willingness
      to fund an American debt spree, most other NATO members simply do not have the
      market clout — or under the rules that bind the EU together, the legal right —
      to borrow on such a massive scale. As a result, much of the increase in military
      spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and
      even pension and health care systems. Germany, for example, is planning to nearly
      double its military spending over the next five years, leaving a hole of tens
      of billions of euros in its budget. Denmark has created an “acceleration fund”
      that will channel an additional $7 billion into military spending over the coming
      two years, representing roughly 1.5 percent of its GDP. France, which has long
      battled with its own budget woes, will likely have to introduce a combination
      of tax hikes and social spending cuts to fund its military build-up. Poland has
      asked the European Commission to shift nearly $7 billion in green projects expenditures
      allotted to Poland into military spending instead. The continental commitments
      to increased military spending likely will result in a further erosion of the
      decades-old European social compact.


      Caught between Putin’s expansionist and imperialistic impulses — as demonstrated
      so brutally in Ukraine and with the increasingly militarist rhetoric coming out
      of the Kremlin — and Trump’s transactional, America First foreign policy, Europe’s
      leaders have decided to embrace the sort of massive ramp-up in military spending
      that so often serves as the prelude to war. No one wants to be caught wrongfooted
      should Putin order his military to breach NATO borders on the East, or NATO airspace
      elsewhere in Europe. No one wants to be the country that Trump steps back from
      defending — as he has, in the past explicitly said he would do, announcing he
      would encourage Putin’s forces to “do whatever the hell they want” — because they
      aren’t meeting the military spending goals that he has laid out. And thus, NATO’s
      member states have ratcheted up military expenditures to a degree that, even a
      couple of months ago, would have seemed to be both implausible and dangerously
      destructive toward Europe and Canada’s social compacts.


      Not all of that money now earmarked for military spending will flow to U.S. defense
      contractors; but given the U.S.’s pre-eminence in the field of high-tech weaponry,
      it’s a sure bet that, at least in the short term, while Europe grapples with how
      to diversify away from an unpredictable and even predatory U.S., an awful lot
      of it will.


      All of this stands to benefit the military-industrial complex mightily. The losers,
      of course, will be those who rely on the social safety net programs that get pushed
      aside in the rush to find funds to boost military spending. But it won’t happen
      without resistance: Stamer’s announcement immediately triggered opposition from
      anti-nuclear groups. During the last years of the Cold War, groups such as the
      Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament engaged in civil disobedience campaigns to pressure
      the government to remove nuclear weapons from the Greenham Common air base. Now,
      the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups have once again begun
      mobilizing for rallies, as early as this weekend, at the Royal Air Force bases
      slated to host the planes and weapons.


      It is, of course, early days. But there are signs that European populaces won’t
      uncritically rally around Trump’s demand for wholesale, breakneck rearmament.
      Of course, Europe and Canada do need to work out ways to protect their interests
      in the face of U.S. retrenchment. But what Trump is demanding is something entirely
      different; he is insisting on a form of tribute imposed via mandated weapons purchases
      — and while Europe’s leaders fawn, it’s not at all clear that their populaces
      will back them up.

    one_sentence_summary: At the 2025 NATO Summit, President Trump pressured member
      countries to significantly increase their military spending in exchange for U.S.
      security commitments, leading to a historic arms deal with the UK and raising
      concerns about the impact on social programs across Europe.
    paragraph_summary: At the NATO Summit 2025 in The Hague, British Prime Minister
      Keir Starmer announced the purchase of a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S.,
      marking the reintroduction of U.S. nuclear-capable aircraft in the U.K. since
      the Cold War. President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of NATO, leveraged
      this summit to demand that member countries significantly increase their military
      spending, aiming for 5% of GDP, which led to widespread agreement among leaders,
      except for Spain, which faced Trump's ire for resisting the increase. The summit
      showcased a stark power dynamic, with NATO leaders displaying extreme deference
      to Trump, reminiscent of historical vassal states, as they committed to massive
      military expenditure increases that could undermine social safety nets across
      Europe. This military buildup, driven by fears of Russian aggression and Trump's
      transactional foreign policy, raises concerns about the erosion of social programs
      and the potential for increased public dissent against such defense spending priorities.

      By Gregory Shupak / Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR)


      Aggression is widely understood as the most serious form of the illegal use of
      force under international law. At the post–World War II Nuremberg Trials, British
      Judge Norman Birkett said:


      To initiate a war of aggression…is not only an international crime; it is the
      supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains
      within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.


      UN General Assembly Resolution 3314 lists seven acts that constitute aggression,
      including:


      The invasion or attack by the armed forces of a state of the territory of another
      State….


      Bombardment by the armed forces of a state against the territory of another state,
      or the use of any weapons by a state against the territory of another state.


      In a clear instance of such aggression, 125 US military aircraft (along with a
      submarine) unleashed 75 weapons against Iran on June 21, including 14 GBU-57 Massive
      Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), each of which weighs 30,000 pounds (BBC, 6/23/25).
      The MOPs are the most powerful non-nuclear weapons in the US arsenal (Democracy
      Now!, 6/23/25).


      ‘Brilliant military operation’


      Rather than condemning this blatant violation of international law, US corporate
      media commentators gushed over what the Boston Globe (6/24/25) called a “brilliant
      military operation.” The Wall Street Journal (6/22/25) gave President Donald Trump
      “credit…for meeting the moment.”


      To the New York Times’ Bret Stephens (6/22/25), Trump made “a courageous and correct
      decision that deserves respect.” “The president acted before it was too late,”
      he wrote. “It is the essence of statesmanship.”


      For the Washington Post’s Max Boot (6/25/25), it’s “good news…that both Israel
      and the United States showed they can bombard Iranian nuclear facilities and other
      targets at will.”


      Rather than toasting aggression, these observers could have used their platforms
      to try to help foster a political climate that prioritizes peace and the international
      legal principles that could help create a less violent world.


      Meanwhile, some opinion mongers thought the US was at risk of insufficiently violating
      international law. The Post’s editorial board (6/22/25) said Trump


      should ensure that Iran’s nuclear program is demolished, as he appeared to claim
      it was on Saturday. This would mean the destruction of the targeted sites plus
      any residual weapons-building capacity.


      In other words, the authors are glad that the US bombed Iran in violation of international
      law, and think it might be best to do more of the same.


      A Journal editorial (6/23/25) put forth a similar view, warning that Trump will
      “squander” any “gains” that the US and Israel may have made against Iran if he
      “lets Iran take a breather, retain any enriched uranium it has secretly stored,
      and then rearm. But the last fortnight creates a rare opportunity for a more peaceful
      Middle East.” I’m not a big Orwell fan, but there’s something to his vision of
      the propaganda slogan “war is peace.”


      Upside-down world


      These celebrations of bomb-dropping occur in an upside-down world, where Iran
      is an aggressor against the United States. One form of this lie is accusing Iran
      of wantonly killing Americans or seeking to do so. The Journal (6/22/25) cited
      “1,000 Americans killed by Iran-supplied roadside bombs and other means”—referring
      to the dubious claim that Iran is responsible for US soldiers killed during the
      illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq (Progressive, 1/7/20). Thus, to the editors,
      “Mr. Trump had to act to stop the threat in front of him to protect America.”


      For Boot (6/22/25), Iran is a “predator” that the United States and Israel “will
      still have to deal with…for years to come.”


      It would be nice to be able to assess the evidence for these allegations, but
      the authors don’t so much as hint at any. What is well documented, though, is
      that the US has been the aggressor in its longrunning war with Iran.


      The US ruling class initiated the conflict by overthrowing Iran’s democratically
      elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 (NPR, 2/7/19), propping up the
      Shah’s torture regime for 26 years (BBC, 6/3/16; AP, 2/6/19), sponsoring the Iraqi
      invasion of Iran and helping Iraq use chemical weapons against Iran (Foreign Policy,
      8/26/13), supporting Israel’s years-long campaign of murdering Iranian scientists
      (Responsible Statecraft, 12/21/20), and asphyxiating Iran’s civilian population
      through economic sanctions (Human Rights Watch, 10/29/19).


      In other words, the US has been prosecuting a war against the Iranian people for
      more than 70 years, and Iran hasn’t done anything remotely comparable to the US,
      but the corporate media pretends that the inverse is true.


      The consent manufacturers went even further, characterizing Iran as a threat to
      the world more generally. The Journal (6/22/25) said “Iran has been waging regional
      and terrorist war for decades,” and that “the world is safer” because the US bombed
      the country. Stephens proclaimed the Iranian government “the world’s leading state
      sponsor of terrorism,” a claim Boot (6/25/25) echoed, writing that the nation
      has a “decades-long track record as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism.” Sickeningly,
      Antony Blinken (New York Times, 6/24/25), a leading architect of the genocide
      of Gaza’s civilian population, called Iran “a leading state sponsor of terrorism;
      a destructive and destabilizing force via its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza,
      Yemen and Iraq.”


      As usual, none of these writers bothered to say which acts of “terrorism” Iran
      has backed, never mind provide proof. Of course, if one wanted to make a serious
      argument that Iran has won the planet’s “state sponsor of terrorism” gold medal,
      then it would be necessary to show how they trumped, say, US support for Al Qaeda
      in Syria. For such a case to be convincing, it would furthermore be necessary
      to assess where bankrolling a genocide ranks in the terror-sponsoring Olympics.


      ‘A grave nuclear threat’


      In the fantasy world where Iran is a grave danger to the US and indeed the world,
      then wrongly implying that it has or is about to have nuclear weapons packs a
      heavier punch. The Journal (6/22/25) said, “President Trump’s decision to strike
      Iran’s three most significant nuclear sites on Saturday helped rid the world of
      a grave nuclear threat.” The editorial would later add, “Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
      wanted a bomb more than peace.”


      Boot (6/25/25) wrote that “preliminary Israeli intelligence assessments [of the
      US bombing of Iran] conclude that the damage to the Iranian nuclear weapons program
      was more extensive—enough to set back the program by several years.” Stephens
      began his piece:


      For decades, a succession of American presidents pledged that they were willing
      to use force to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But it was President
      Trump who, by bombing three of Iran’s key nuclear sites on Sunday morning, was
      willing to demonstrate that those pledges were not hollow and that Tehran could
      not simply tunnel its way to a bomb because no country other than Israel dared
      confront it.


      As FAIR contributor Bryce Greene (6/23/25) recently demonstrated, there is no
      proof that Iran has nuclear weapons or is close to having any. Yet the op-ed pages
      are peppered with insinuations that Iran’s imaginary nukes legitimize the US’s
      aggression against the country.


      A Boston Globe editorial (6/24/25) read:


      After years of insisting it would not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,
      Israel followed through by launching a wide-ranging attack earlier this month,
      assassinating nuclear scientists and military leaders and destroying many sites
      associated with Iran’s decades-long nuclear program. Trump initially stayed on
      the sidelines, until Saturday when US bombers delivered the coup de grâce, destroying—or
      at least heavily damaging—a key underground site that only American bunker-buster
      bombs could reach…. Stopping Iran, whose unofficial national motto is “Death to
      America,’’ from gaining a nuclear weapon has rightly been a US priority for decades.
      Iran’s nuclear program is now damaged but not destroyed.


      What’s missing from this chatter is that, even if we lived in an alternate reality
      where Iran had nuclear weapons or was hours away from having them, attacking them
      on these grounds would not be legitimate. After all, international law does not
      grant states a right to attack each other on a preventive (Conversation, 6/18/25)
      or pre-emptive basis (Conversation, 6/23/25). This crucial point was entirely
      absent in the coverage I’ve discussed.


      Also overlooked are the 90 nuclear warheads that Israel is believed to have, as
      well as the more than 5,200 that the US reportedly possesses, none of which apparently
      constitute “a grave nuclear threat,” even as it’s not Iran but the US and Israel
      that routinely carry out full-scale invasions and occupations of nations in West
      Asia.


      Whether it’s Iran’s supposed support for terrorism or Iran’s nonexistent and non-imminent
      nuclear weapons, the propaganda follows the same formula: make an unsubstantiated
      claim about Iranian malfeasance, and use that as a premise on which to defend
      Washington openly carrying out acts of aggression, perhaps the gravest violation
      of international law.


      If you want the US and Israel to stop killing and immiserating people in Iran,
      remember this pattern and get used to debunking it. Because, last week’s ceasefire
      notwithstanding, the US/Israeli war on Iran isn’t over.

      praising President Trump's decision while ignoring the historical context of U.S.-Iran
      relations, where the U.S. has been the aggressor for decades. The author argues
      that claims of Iran being a grave threat, particularly regarding nuclear weapons

      A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act that may define a Tyrant,
      is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Thomas Jefferson, The Declaration of
      Independence, July 4, 1776


      In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about that has been a
      beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt,
      incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in
      democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your
      voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring. Bruce Springsteen, Land
      of Hope and Dreams Tour


      Manchester, England, May 14, 2025


      In his farewell letter to the American people, President George Washington warned
      about “the impostures of pretended patriotism.” Born on my country’s birthday
      in 1946, I was proud to be an American and blessed to have been born on such a
      special day. You could say that from the very beginning I was truly, as the song
      implies, a Yankee Doodle Dandy and a real live nephew of my Uncle Sam.


      I wasn’t pretending to be a patriot. I was one from the very start. I was the
      real thing, the authentic American: red, white and blue all over. As a young boy,
      I was a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout. I read Boys Life magazine and played second
      base in the Massapequa Little League and dreamed of playing for the New York Yankees
      someday.


      But I also read the Marine Corp guidebook when I was seven, a gift from my Uncle
      Jimmy who had served as a Marine during the Korean War, and I would practice for
      hours standing at attention and saluting in front of the mirror in my room.


      l was inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s, “Ask not what your country can
      do for you, but what you can do for your country” speech in 1961 and couldn’t
      wait to serve my country as the young president had asked us to do. As soon as
      I turned 18, I joined the United States Marine Corps, volunteering for my first
      tour of duty in Vietnam. After a 13-month tour, I decided to set my own example
      of patriotism by returning to Vietnam a second time, willing to risk my life on
      behalf of my country.


      On Jan. 20, 1968, during my second tour of duty I was shot and paralyzed from
      my mid chest down and have been confined to a wheelchair ever since. I received
      several medals during my time in the Marine Corp, including the Purple Heart,
      Bronze Star with Combat V (for valor) and Navy Commendation Medal with Combat
      V.


      After my wounding and a year recuperating with other severely wounded veterans
      at a Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital paraplegic ward in the Bronx, NY, I continued
      to serve my country. Profoundly affected by what I saw in the hospital and my
      own wounding, I joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War organization and became
      deeply committed to peace and nonviolence.


      Inspired by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Gandhi,
      I often opposed my country’s foreign policy decisions. I knew there had to be
      a better way and was arrested numerous times over the years for protesting, remaining
      firmly committed to peaceful, nonviolent change.


      President Washington was speaking to all of us, to the citizens of his time and
      those of us yet to come, he clearly understood how fragile and vulnerable our
      bold new democracy was and how easily it could be taken from us.


      Now, as we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation’s birth and my 80th birthday
      on July 4th, 2026, George Washington’s prophetic farewell letter has come back
      to awaken us all: A cruel and arrogant dictator has arisen in our midst. A convicted
      criminal has arrived in the night, and our democracy is now on life support.


      Fear and intimidation now rule the land. Suddenly and without warning, a brutal
      tyranny has arrived, and the crackdown has begun. Frightening shades of Germany,
      1939: heavily armed guardsmen and Marines now occupy my city.


      Universities and freedom of speech are under attack. Foreign students are being
      dragged from their classrooms. A U.S. senator was brutally manhandled, thrown
      to the floor and handcuffed. Masked agents infiltrate our neighborhoods hunting
      immigrants, grabbing them in front of supermarkets, schools and workplaces, even
      at churches, and their children’s graduation ceremonies.


      Many are afraid to leave their homes, wary that the masked ICE agents will be
      waiting to abduct them and send them to detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz
      located in an alligator and snake infested Florida swamp, among other frightening
      detention centers. No phone call, no due process, no trial. Disappeared, lost,
      forever and forgotten.


      This is America in the spring of 2025, brutal and cruel. I cannot help but sense
      this nightmare is just beginning. Many now hide, frightened of being caught. Migrant
      farmworkers hunted down like frightened animals in the fields of Salinas, ripped
      from their families and disappeared to some awful prison in El Salvador never
      to be seen or heard from again.


      I cannot help but think of Anne Frank and her family hiding in the annex, afraid
      of being rounded up by the Gestapo. I think of what that must have felt like and
      what these poor souls in our country must be going through right now because they
      are afraid of leaving their homes with ICE agents not just arresting “hardened”
      criminals, but grabbing everyone, poor, innocent, human beings.


      The Statue of Liberty weeps tonight. (“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled
      masses yearning to be free!”) The cruel masked government men must make their
      sickening quotas. “My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I cry,
      of thee I weep, of thee I rage.”


      Never have the citizens of this country been so threatened, never before has life
      and liberty been in such peril. Not in the 250 years since our revolution have
      we as a people and a nation been at such a crucial turning point. These are dangerous
      times; a century of arrogance, brutality and aggression have come back to haunt
      us all.


      The mask has been ripped away, the lie has been exposed, and this criminal president
      and administration now stand naked before the world. These are provocative words
      and the truth may be deeply unsettling but when will we speak the truth? When
      will we end this silence? How much longer will we wait until we are ready to finally
      admit that the tyrant now lives in our house? That this government of the people,
      by the people and for the people that we entrusted long ago with the sacred task
      of protecting life and liberty, now, by its every unjust, immoral and illegal
      action now threatens the freedom of us all?


      Have we become so complacent, so cowered and intimidated by this administration
      and president that we have forgotten our own revolutionary birthright of rebellion
      and dissent? Have we become so paralyzed with fear that we would give up our liberty
      and freedom for the promise of a security that does not exist by a government
      and president that now threatens our very freedom?


      What will it take before we realize the true reality of this crisis? How many
      more human beings must suffer before we finally begin to break the silence of
      this shameful night? Let us open up our hearts and speak in a way we have never
      spoken before, knowing that lives now depend on it and the very survival of our
      democracy is now at stake. Let not our silence in this crucial moment betray us
      from our destiny.


      Some additional notes on our American Democracy at the crossroads


      The nation is stunned. The sound of military marching music and beating of drums
      fills the air, whipping the crowd into a frenzy as they obediently pay homage
      to their dear leader — the strongman, the billionaire, the genius, as a million
      frightened voices begin to sing.


      The song is a bit off key, but it doesn’t seem to matter as the Commander in Chief
      in a clown suit beats a happy tyrannical tune, “keep in step, everyone, keep in
      step!” the big boss shouts with glee. “Democracy is dead!” a woman shouts from
      the crowd and is quickly taken away.


      It is almost midnight, and I notice our rights beginning to slip away. The flag
      is now at half-mast as an ancient bugle plays a sad and mournful tune, a dirge
      to a dying nation. “A dream deferred, or does it explode?” someone whispers from
      the crowd holding up a faded photograph of the poet Langston Hughes until they
      are also taken away.


      As the band keeps playing the ghost of Jackson Pollock proudly claims he has been
      commissioned to do a painting for the 250th anniversary of America, 2026. The
      theme of the painting will be, “American democracy at the crossroads.” It is a
      gigantic canvas and the deadline to complete this great work of art is Friday,
      July 4th, 2026.


      Pollock has been working on the painting for nearly a year, but he has a problem.
      After weeks and months of effort, the canvas continues to remain blank. As the
      big day approaches and Pollock’s deadline looms, he throws his hands up in disgust
      and begins throwing paint on to canvas determined to complete his celebration
      of American democracy on time.


      He uses his legendary drip technique. It is an extremely complex piece, layer
      upon layer of paint, wild swirls of reds, whites and blues followed by an almost
      frantic black paint flung violently across the canvas in desperation as if to
      say this is it. This is the best that I can do. The following morning, exhausted
      and near collapse, Pollack finally completes his painting and immediately falls
      asleep on the floor of his South Hampton studio.


      Several hours later, as the bright afternoon sun enters the room, he slowly opens
      his eyes and, to his surprise, the canvas is again completely blank. Pollack is
      heartbroken and feels as if he has failed. Regardless, the 250th Anniversary committee
      accepts the painting where it is prominently displayed on the national mall.


      The critics hail it as a masterpiece while many, including the President and his
      minions, call it a wonderful depiction of our democracy. “Betrayal?” whispers
      a homeless veteran from the crowd as he is quickly whisked away. Never have the
      people of our country been so threatened. Never has our democracy\


      been in such grave danger. A dark shroud covers the land. The flag is drenched
      in blood and sorrow. The founders weep. Fear, confusion, shock, disbelief, a tyrant
      and unholy cabal, dark clouds, 1939, Yorktown, “The world turned upside down.”


      “My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, land of the pilgrim’s pride, land
      where our fathers lied of thee, I sing, let freedom ring, let freedom ring!”


      ——


      A disabled veteran in a wheelchair slowly wheels onto the stage and faces the
      audience. He clears his throat and almost in a whisper that grows in intensity,
      he begins to speak:


      “Two centuries and five decades ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent
      a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men
      are created equal. Now, we are engaged in a great struggle testing whether that
      nation, or any other nation, so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. It
      is all together fitting and proper that we should do this. It is for us, the living
      on this Independence Day 2025, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which
      those who long ago have thus far so nobly advanced and that we here highly resolve
      that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that this government
      of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the Earth.”


      Have hope, my fellow citizens, have confidence and faith. We are on the right
      side of history. A powerful resistance has already begun. We will reclaim our
      country and not abandon it. Millions have already gone to the streets and millions
      more will soon follow. In the spirit of nonviolence, in the spirit of Reverend
      Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, let us go forth
      and march together in growing confidence.


      Let us always seek the moral high ground with dignity and with malice toward none;
      with charity for all, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up
      the nation’s wounds, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting
      peace. Be patient and be not afraid. We are not alone. Remember the democracy
      movement and the courageous Chinese students at Tiananmen Square. Remember the
      brave young man who stood before the tank and refused to move.




      A new nation is awaiting to be born. Have no doubt about it, these are extraordinary
      times. Mandela in South Africa. Václav Havel in the Prague Spring. Rosa Parks
      in Montgomery. King and James Bevel at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. These
      are people and movements who all participated in successful struggles against
      the darkest nights.


      As the late Congressman Allard Lowenstein once said, it is better to reclaim the
      country than abandon it. This is our moment in history. This is our opportunity
      to make history and not shirk from it.


      For my country and its people, happy birthday.

      An analysis released Thursday estimates that the Republican legislation on the
      brink of final passage in Congress would deliver over $1 trillion in combined
      tax breaks to the richest 1% of Americans over the next decade—an amount roughly
      equal to the bill’s unprecedented cuts to Medicaid.


      The new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), which
      utilizes data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and other sources,
      finds that the “tiny sliver of affluent families” in the top 1% of the U.S. income
      distribution will “receive tax cuts totaling $1.02 trillion over the next decade.”


      The centerpiece of Trump''s megabill is a trillion-dollar tax cut to the wealthy,
      paid for by increasing the national debt and cutting public services. pic.twitter.com/ISr2XuIdJQ
      — ITEP (@iteptweets) July 3, 2025


      ITEP has previously shown that the Republican bill’s tax cuts—largely extensions
      of expiring provisions of the 2017 Trump-GOP tax law—would be highly skewed to
      the wealthy, with the small percentage of households at the very top receiving
      significantly more in total tax breaks than middle- and lower-income Americans.


      “Sixty-nine percent of the net tax cuts would go to the richest fifth of Americans
      in 2026, only 11% would go to the middle fifth of Americans, and less than 1%
      would go to the poorest fifth,” the group found. “The $107 billion in net tax
      cuts going to the richest 1% next year would exceed the amount going to the entire
      bottom 60% of taxpayers.”


      ITEP’s new analysis was released as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.)
      wrapped up a record-breaking, eight-hour-plus speech against the GOP legislation,
      which delayed a final vote on the measure. Republicans are expected to pass the
      unpopular bill on Thursday.

      In his first live broadcast interview since being released from ICE detention,
      Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil tells Democracy Now! about his experience
      behind bars, the ongoing threat of deportation that hangs over him and why he
      continues to speak out against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza. The Columbia
      University graduate was the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed
      by the Trump administration. Khalil is now reunited with his wife Noor and newborn
      son Deen, after he was released on bail last month by a federal judge. Khalil
      says the Trump administration’s attempts to silence him are “a distraction from
      the genocide in Palestine.” Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not
      be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org,
      The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. Officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks
      have killed over 300 Palestinians over the past 48 hours. One strike on the home
      of the renowned cardiologist Marwan al-Sultan at Indonesian Hospital killed the
      doctor, along with his mother, sister and aunt. He’s at least the 70th healthcare
      worker killed by Israel in the past 50 days. This comes as Palestinians say at
      least 33 people were slaughtered today as they lined up for aid at militarized
      aid distribution sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation. The reportedly unprovoked killings came as the Associated Press published
      recent video showing U.S. contractors at GHF sites firing live ammunition and
      stun grenades at starving Palestinians as they scrambled for food. The AP says
      it received the footage from two U.S. contractors who wish to remain anonymous
      in order to blow the whistle on abuses. The contractors report security staffers
      were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed, and seemed to have an open license
      to do whatever they wished. In this clip published by the AP, contractors erupt
      in cheers as shots ring out. JULIA FRANKEL: At that moment, bursts of gunfire
      erupt close by, at least 15 shots. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1: I think you hit one. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1:
      Hell, yeah, boy! AMY GOODMAN: This comes as the Trump administration continues
      its crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators, especially at universities across
      the United States. In a moment, we’ll be joined by the first pro-Palestinian campus
      protester to be jailed by the Trump administration: Columbia University graduate
      and Palestinian student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil. Video shows his arrest
      on March 8th, when he was detained by plainclothes officers who did not identify
      themselves. The video was filmed by his eight-month-pregnant wife, Noor Abdalla,
      whose voice you’re hearing in this clip. DR. NOOR ABDALLA: Can you — can you please
      specify what agency is taking him, please? Excuse me. They’re — nobody — they’re
      not talking to me. I don’t know. Excuse me, the lawyer would like to speak to
      somebody. Oh my god, they’re literally running away from me. AMY GOODMAN: That
      was March. Mahmoud Khalil has now reunited with his wife and newborn son, after
      he was released on bail less than two weeks ago by a federal judge following over
      100 days in a Louisiana ICE jail. Khalil spoke outside the jail in Jena, Louisiana,
      when he was freed. MAHMOUD KHALIL: No one is illegal. No human is illegal. That’s
      the message. The message is: Justice will prevail, no matter what this administration
      may try to portray. AMY GOODMAN: Two weeks ago, on Saturday, Democracy Now! was
      at Newark Airport when Mahmoud Khalil was reunited with his wife and his son.
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I just want to go back and just continue the work that I was already
      doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated
      rather than punished, as this administration wants to do. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud
      Khalil was standing next to the New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
      On Sunday, the following day, the Palestinian student leader, now graduate of
      Columbia University, stood next to his wife, Noor Abdalla, and addressed over
      a thousand supporters, as well as the press, on the Upper West Side outside the
      Cathedral of St. John the Divine here in Manhattan, blocks from his campus of
      Columbia University. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I would like to salute the courage of all
      the students at Columbia and across the nation, these students who continue to
      protest. I want to honor especially my friends at Columbia University, especially
      those who are currently battling expulsion and suspension for their consciousness
      stand. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil is lawful permanent resident green card holder
      who has not been charged with any crimes, yet he was held in a Jena, Louisiana, ICE jail
      for 104 days. This all comes amidst growing calls for Israel to be held accountable
      for alleged war crimes in Gaza, including attacks on hospitals. Mahmoud Khalil
      joins us now for his first live global broadcast since his release. Mahmoud, welcome
      to Democracy Now! MAHMOUD KHALIL: Thanks, Amy. Thanks for having me. AMY GOODMAN:
      So, I want to start with the same question I asked you at the airport: How does
      it feel to be free? MAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, absolutely, it goes without saying,
      it feels — it feels good just to be reunited with the family and with my baby
      son. But at the same time, it feels difficult watching the Palestinian people,
      like, massacred, being massacred right now in Gaza. And this really adds more
      responsibility on me to continue advocating for the rights of the Palestinians.
      And this is what we should focus on right now, because my freedom is nothing compared
      to the suffering that the Palestinian people are going through right now in Palestine.
      And this is what the message should be, that whether it’s my arrest, whether the
      focus right now on immigration, it’s just like a distraction of what’s really
      happening in Palestine, that this administration is investing and funding war
      crimes in Gaza, that this administration is unconditionally supporting Israel,
      whether politically or militarily. This is what we should focus on rather than
      individual cases, I believe. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, I’m wondering if you can take
      us back to March 8th, that day when you were taken by Homeland Security or federal
      agents. I don’t even know — at this point, do you know who it is that you were
      taken by? And what happened on that day, where you were? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      so, the Trump administration basically illegally ripped me away from my family,
      because they are simply trying to silence anyone speaking out against Israel atrocities
      against the Palestinians. The officers or the agents who kidnapped me did not
      introduce themselves. They said at first it’s police, then DHS, without giving
      any details, without even presenting an arrest warrant, which is the most basic
      thing that any law enforcement — any law enforcement should do in a country that
      proclaims justice and due process, which unfortunately did not happen. So, they
      basically kidnapped me and, for more than 30 hours, kept moving me from one place
      to another, literally moving me more than 1,400 miles across the country. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can I ask you something? One of the men who abducted you in your Columbia University
      housing, is it true that he was the Homeland Security agent who was honored by
      President Trump in his first term in office, Elvin Hernandez? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      To be honest, I don’t have concrete information about that. It has been only two
      weeks since my release. I — AMY GOODMAN: And you didn’t know at the time who he
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Inside, I didn’t have access to internet. AMY GOODMAN: You didn’t
      know at the time who these men were. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I didn’t. AMY GOODMAN: So,
      I mean — MAHMOUD KHALIL: No, no, I didn’t. Like, to be honest, the story that
      the government presented was once over — one time over another changed to sort
      of serve their part of the story. At the beginning, they said, “Well, we had an
      arrest warrant, and we arrested Mahmoud outside of Columbia, of his Columbia residence.”
      But then, when we presented the video evidence, they said, “Oh, he tried to flee.”
      So, these agents are trained to lie, are trained to just instigate violence with
      those who they are seeking to detain. AMY GOODMAN: So, we have played over and
      over the video of your wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, on the phone with the lawyer, desperately
      trying to figure out what was happening and where you were being taken. In fact,
      can you talk about when you had emailed the president of Columbia University,
      Dr. Armstrong at the time, because you were so concerned about what was happening
      to you? You wanted some kind of protection. MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. I mean, ICE, ICE acts
      as Trump’s militia arm. That’s the way that now they are functioning. And we can
      see this evident not only in my case, in just like cases across the country. In
      the weeks leading up to my arrest, I noticed a more vicious, coordinated smear
      campaign against me online, the same — the same accounts mentioning Rubio, the
      White House, mentioning also, like, just baseless claims about Mahmoud Khalil,
      who he is, like an international student, a Hamas agent and all these labels.
      So, I felt that since I didn’t have any legal, at that point, representation,
      I wanted, like, Columbia first to protect me, because these actors are Columbia
      students and faculty, the ones who were waging this smear campaign against me
      online and calling for the administration to deport me. So, this is the minimum
      that Columbia should have done, is to protect the students against these hostile
      actors. So, and that was not — I mean, I sent the email the morning of my arrest,
      I believe. And this was not the first email that we sent to Columbia and no answer.
      Unfortunately, Columbia did not and does not, until now, treat all students as
      equal. What they care about is basically money and protecting their brand, rather
      than going and listening to their students, protecting their students with their
      legitimate concerns, not to have any special treatment for the Palestinian or
      the students supporting Palestine on campus. AMY GOODMAN: I’m wondering if Columbia
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: But Columbia failed to do that. AMY GOODMAN: Did Columbia University
      support you in any way? I remember in the case of Rümeysa Öztürk, who is the Tufts
      Fulbright scholar and graduate student also abducted by federal agents, Tufts
      wrote a statement of support. And then Suri Khan, the Dr. Suri Khan at Georgetown,
      Georgetown also spoke out. What about Columbia University on your behalf? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      Columbia did not offer any sort of support when it comes to the legal case. And
      this is shameful on a university that claims to support international students
      and to support the right of freedom of speech. But this was not surprising. Columbia
      has capitulated to the Trump administration, but before then, they capitulated
      to the Zionist donors and politicians in this country. So, to see them not offer
      this kind of support absolutely was not surprising, unfortunately. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can you talk about your time in the Jena ICE jail? You were held for over a hundred
      days there. Can you talk about the other prisoners, the conditions under which
      you were held? And then I want to get to the day your baby, your baby Deen, was
      born without you there. But talk about the jail until that point. MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      So, in jail, you spend 24/7 with the same people. So, one of the things that we
      do is to just share stories from people from around the ward. And every day it’s
      just a more heartbreaking story than another, with people being snatched off the
      street or during their court hearings or ICE check-ins, where these people, like,
      they were trying to fix their documentation. They committed no crimes whatsoever.
      So, you have this shock with everyone who’s coming in around why they are there.
      I shared a dorm with over 70 men, and the stories are really heartbreaking, Amy,
      with people leaving their family outside without any kind of support, people who
      don’t have their rights — don’t know their rights, don’t know if they have any
      rights, in fact. And with ICE, who basically don’t tell anyone what their rights
      are and just deport people, I’ve seen people who unknowingly sign their deportation
      documents because ICE agents tricked them into doing so, which is a blatant violation
      of any rule of law or due process. And just, like, to say that, like, the conditions
      inside were horrible. The food was horrible, the sleep quality equally bad, and
      just the atmosphere, where you are inside, you don’t know what’s happening, and
      you’re just expecting to follow orders and wait for an ICE officer to come and
      update you on your case. Unfortunately, a lot of these detainees don’t have legal
      representation. And I was very privileged to have an amazing legal team fighting
      on my behalf. And that took us three months for me to be released, despite me
      being a legal resident in the United States. So, imagine for a lot of these individuals
      who don’t have this kind of representation and who have, like, more complications
      in their documentation. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, can you talk about the day of Deen’s
      birth, your firstborn son? How did you learn that Noor had given birth? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      That days was absolutely one of the most difficult days that I had to endure in
      my life, being away from my wife and not having the opportunity to support her
      during this moment. And I was over the phone, so I would call every hour just
      to see, like, if Noor is in labor, yeah or no. And the moment of the delivery,
      I spent like over three hours over the phone, from 1:00 — I think 1:30 in the
      morning until 4:00 or 4:30, just, like, trying to support Noor as much as I could,
      because I did not want to miss that moment at all. And what made it very difficult
      is because, like, this could have been easily avoided, were the Trump administration
      to follow the law, or at least, like, to offer me furlough, like, to go and be
      with my family for a few hours. But they refused that, because this administration
      thrives on cruelty and thrives on separation and family separation. So that was
      not surprising. AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the moment when you met Deen
      for the first time? I mean, as you describe it now, you really were with Noor
      then. Of course, you were separate, but you were there. Over the phone, you heard
      his first cries. But talk about holding him for the first time. I remember — I
      mean, it was just weeks ago. Why it was that your lawyers had to fight, a battery
      of lawyers, for so many hours for Noor and Deen, for you to be able to have a
      contact visit? I mean, you have not been charged with a crime. But in the jail
      — is that right — where it was, in Jena, Louisiana? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. As you
      said, I mean, it shouldn’t take an army of lawyers to get a one-hour contact visit
      to let me hold my son. The first time I saw my son was, in fact, through glass.
      So, he was literally in front of me, but separated by glass. I couldn’t hold him
      during the first time I saw him, which made me very, very angry about, like, a
      one-centimeter or one-inch glass separating me from holding my son. And this is
      all by design, the cruelty of this administration, because their goal is to punish
      me as much as they could and in any way that they find, because what they want
      is they want to break me. They want to make an example out of me. So, the first
      time when we managed to get a court order, in fact — imagine getting a court order
      to force ICE to let me hold my son. And we had it for literally an hour, 7:00
      in the morning. So, even when they agreed to do that — or, not agreed — even when
      they were forced to allow me to hold my son, they chose to make it at 7:00 in
      the morning in detention. So, I mean, the feeling, I don’t think I can describe
      it. I was both very happy, but at the same time very angry and sad that it took
      us all this effort to have this one hour in detention. And basically, I was really
      anxious. I was just looking at the clock, when this hour would end. I just didn’t
      want this hour to end. And the hour was the fastest hour in my life, just like
      — you know, like, it went like this. AMY GOODMAN: And so — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      Amy. AMY GOODMAN: You were released less than two weeks ago, and now you are living
      at home with your wife and your infant son. Do you feel safe? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      I don’t fully feel safe, to be honest, Amy. We all know the rhetoric that’s currently
      going around in this country, the Islamophobia, the anti-Palestinian bigotry and
      racism, and this violence that was exported by Israel to this country. I’m being
      targeted by Israeli government-affiliated groups here in the U.S. who are very
      dangerous, who would do anything to silence Palestinians, because, for them, silencing
      is much more easier than dealing with the argument, because they have no argument
      about what they are doing in Palestine. And this is why they want to shut off
      the — shut down the conversation any way they can do, even if this would mean
      hurting or harming me and my family. And it’s a huge concern. But it’s a price
      that I need to accept for advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people,
      because, once again, this is all just a distraction from the genocide in Palestine.
      And these attempts to silence me are just one way for them to attack us and to
      cut — just not to let the public know about what Israel is doing and how the U.S.
      is complicit in this genocide. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, you led a march from
      the steps of St. John the Divine up to Columbia University, wearing a Palestinian
      flag as a kind of cape, with a thousand supporters there, and you were one of
      the leaders of the encampment at Columbia that led to so many protests and encampments
      around the country on university campuses. Many of the protesters were Jewish.
      Many of the supporters for you who would march when you were detained were Jewish.
      I was wondering: What did that level of Jewish support mean to you here in the
      United States? MAHMOUD KHALIL: First of all, just a correction: The student movement
      at Columbia doesn’t have leaders. I believe all the students equally contribute
      to the movement. And it’s being mobilized by a large number of students, hundreds
      of students at Columbia University. But going back to your question, Amy, I mean,
      Jewish students are an integral part of the student movement, whether at Columbia
      or in the United States. And this is very, very important, because these Jewish
      students, they show the world that what Israel is doing is not in their name,
      is not in the name of Jewish safety, which is very important. And these, also,
      Jewish students are acting upon their values, of protecting the — protecting the
      weak or supporting justice. So, it’s really — to us, it’s very important. This
      shows that the Palestinian cause goes beyond Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims. It’s
      a universal cause for justice, for freedom and for human rights. AMY GOODMAN:
      And finally, Mahmoud, as you are free now here in New York, you still face deportation?
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I do. I mean, now I’m out on bail, which means that the court
      proceedings can continue while I am out. So, I’m still facing deportation. However,
      a judge, a federal judge, ruled that the Rubio determination on what Rubio did
      to me is likely unconstitutional, and that’s why he ordered my release on bail.
      So I’m confident that we will prevail in court, that this administration attempts
      to silence us wouldn’t succeed, and now that I will seek accountability. I will
      seek accountability from this administration, from the individuals and actors
      who contributed to my arrest, and now exploring these options with my lawyer,
      because in the first place, what I was protesting, I was protesting for accountability,
      to hold Columbia and the U.S. government accountable for their complicity in war
      crimes and genocide against the Palestinians. And I will continue to do so, because
      what happened to me shouldn’t have happened in the first place. I shouldn’t have
      been prosecuted simply for my freedom of speech, simply for speaking up for Palestinian
      rights. And those who have contributed to that in any way should be held accountable.
      AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, thanks so much for joining us, Columbia University
      graduate, Palestinian student activist, detained by ICE March 8th and held for
      104 days at the ICE jail in Jena, Louisiana. During that time, his wife, Dr. Noor
      Abdalla, gave birth to their first child, Deen. Mahmoud was released June 20th.
      You can see him coming to Newark Airport and the next day’s event in front of
      St. John the Divine with a thousand people greeting him at democracynow.org ,
      as well as our interview with Mohsen Mahdawi, who also graduated from Columbia

    one_sentence_summary: Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, recently released from
      ICE detention, discusses his experiences and the ongoing threat of deportation
      while advocating against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza in his first live
      interview since his release.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent interview with Democracy Now!, Palestinian activist
      Mahmoud Khalil, who was released from ICE detention, shared his harrowing experiences
      behind bars and the ongoing threat of deportation he faces. Khalil, a Columbia
      University graduate and the first pro-Palestinian campus protester jailed under
      the Trump administration, emphasized his commitment to speaking out against the
      U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza, which he believes is being obscured by attempts
      to silence him. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains dire, with officials
      reporting over 300 Palestinian deaths due to Israeli attacks in just 48 hours,
      including the killing of healthcare workers and civilians seeking aid. Recent
      footage has emerged showing U.S. contractors at aid distribution sites using live
      ammunition against desperate Palestinians, highlighting the severe humanitarian
      crisis exacerbated by the conflict.

      In his first live broadcast interview since being released from ICE detention,
      Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil tells Democracy Now! about his experience
      behind bars, the ongoing threat of deportation that hangs over him and why he
      continues to speak out against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza. The Columbia
      University graduate was the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed
      by the Trump administration. Khalil is now reunited with his wife Noor and newborn
      son Deen, after he was released on bail last month by a federal judge. Khalil
      says the Trump administration’s attempts to silence him are “a distraction from
      the genocide in Palestine.” Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not
      be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org,
      The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. Officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks
      have killed over 300 Palestinians over the past 48 hours. One strike on the home
      of the renowned cardiologist Marwan al-Sultan at Indonesian Hospital killed the
      doctor, along with his mother, sister and aunt. He’s at least the 70th healthcare
      worker killed by Israel in the past 50 days. This comes as Palestinians say at
      least 33 people were slaughtered today as they lined up for aid at militarized
      aid distribution sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation. The reportedly unprovoked killings came as the Associated Press published
      recent video showing U.S. contractors at GHF sites firing live ammunition and
      stun grenades at starving Palestinians as they scrambled for food. The AP says
      it received the footage from two U.S. contractors who wish to remain anonymous
      in order to blow the whistle on abuses. The contractors report security staffers
      were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed, and seemed to have an open license
      to do whatever they wished. In this clip published by the AP, contractors erupt
      in cheers as shots ring out. JULIA FRANKEL: At that moment, bursts of gunfire
      erupt close by, at least 15 shots. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1: I think you hit one. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1:
      Hell, yeah, boy! AMY GOODMAN: This comes as the Trump administration continues
      its crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators, especially at universities across
      the United States. In a moment, we’ll be joined by the first pro-Palestinian campus
      protester to be jailed by the Trump administration: Columbia University graduate
      and Palestinian student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil. Video shows his arrest
      on March 8th, when he was detained by plainclothes officers who did not identify
      themselves. The video was filmed by his eight-month-pregnant wife, Noor Abdalla,
      whose voice you’re hearing in this clip. DR. NOOR ABDALLA: Can you — can you please
      specify what agency is taking him, please? Excuse me. They’re — nobody — they’re
      not talking to me. I don’t know. Excuse me, the lawyer would like to speak to
      somebody. Oh my god, they’re literally running away from me. AMY GOODMAN: That
      was March. Mahmoud Khalil has now reunited with his wife and newborn son, after
      he was released on bail less than two weeks ago by a federal judge following over
      100 days in a Louisiana ICE jail. Khalil spoke outside the jail in Jena, Louisiana,
      when he was freed. MAHMOUD KHALIL: No one is illegal. No human is illegal. That’s
      the message. The message is: Justice will prevail, no matter what this administration
      may try to portray. AMY GOODMAN: Two weeks ago, on Saturday, Democracy Now! was
      at Newark Airport when Mahmoud Khalil was reunited with his wife and his son.
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I just want to go back and just continue the work that I was already
      doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated
      rather than punished, as this administration wants to do. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud
      Khalil was standing next to the New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
      On Sunday, the following day, the Palestinian student leader, now graduate of
      Columbia University, stood next to his wife, Noor Abdalla, and addressed over
      a thousand supporters, as well as the press, on the Upper West Side outside the
      Cathedral of St. John the Divine here in Manhattan, blocks from his campus of
      Columbia University. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I would like to salute the courage of all
      the students at Columbia and across the nation, these students who continue to
      protest. I want to honor especially my friends at Columbia University, especially
      those who are currently battling expulsion and suspension for their consciousness
      stand. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil is lawful permanent resident green card holder
      who has not been charged with any crimes, yet he was held in a Jena, Louisiana, ICE jail
      for 104 days. This all comes amidst growing calls for Israel to be held accountable
      for alleged war crimes in Gaza, including attacks on hospitals. Mahmoud Khalil
      joins us now for his first live global broadcast since his release. Mahmoud, welcome
      to Democracy Now! MAHMOUD KHALIL: Thanks, Amy. Thanks for having me. AMY GOODMAN:
      So, I want to start with the same question I asked you at the airport: How does
      it feel to be free? MAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, absolutely, it goes without saying,
      it feels — it feels good just to be reunited with the family and with my baby
      son. But at the same time, it feels difficult watching the Palestinian people,
      like, massacred, being massacred right now in Gaza. And this really adds more
      responsibility on me to continue advocating for the rights of the Palestinians.
      And this is what we should focus on right now, because my freedom is nothing compared
      to the suffering that the Palestinian people are going through right now in Palestine.
      And this is what the message should be, that whether it’s my arrest, whether the
      focus right now on immigration, it’s just like a distraction of what’s really
      happening in Palestine, that this administration is investing and funding war
      crimes in Gaza, that this administration is unconditionally supporting Israel,
      whether politically or militarily. This is what we should focus on rather than
      individual cases, I believe. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, I’m wondering if you can take
      us back to March 8th, that day when you were taken by Homeland Security or federal
      agents. I don’t even know — at this point, do you know who it is that you were
      taken by? And what happened on that day, where you were? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      so, the Trump administration basically illegally ripped me away from my family,
      because they are simply trying to silence anyone speaking out against Israel atrocities
      against the Palestinians. The officers or the agents who kidnapped me did not
      introduce themselves. They said at first it’s police, then DHS, without giving
      any details, without even presenting an arrest warrant, which is the most basic
      thing that any law enforcement — any law enforcement should do in a country that
      proclaims justice and due process, which unfortunately did not happen. So, they
      basically kidnapped me and, for more than 30 hours, kept moving me from one place
      to another, literally moving me more than 1,400 miles across the country. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can I ask you something? One of the men who abducted you in your Columbia University
      housing, is it true that he was the Homeland Security agent who was honored by
      President Trump in his first term in office, Elvin Hernandez? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      To be honest, I don’t have concrete information about that. It has been only two
      weeks since my release. I — AMY GOODMAN: And you didn’t know at the time who he
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Inside, I didn’t have access to internet. AMY GOODMAN: You didn’t
      know at the time who these men were. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I didn’t. AMY GOODMAN: So,
      I mean — MAHMOUD KHALIL: No, no, I didn’t. Like, to be honest, the story that
      the government presented was once over — one time over another changed to sort
      of serve their part of the story. At the beginning, they said, “Well, we had an
      arrest warrant, and we arrested Mahmoud outside of Columbia, of his Columbia residence.”
      But then, when we presented the video evidence, they said, “Oh, he tried to flee.”
      So, these agents are trained to lie, are trained to just instigate violence with
      those who they are seeking to detain. AMY GOODMAN: So, we have played over and
      over the video of your wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, on the phone with the lawyer, desperately
      trying to figure out what was happening and where you were being taken. In fact,
      can you talk about when you had emailed the president of Columbia University,
      Dr. Armstrong at the time, because you were so concerned about what was happening
      to you? You wanted some kind of protection. MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. I mean, ICE, ICE acts
      as Trump’s militia arm. That’s the way that now they are functioning. And we can
      see this evident not only in my case, in just like cases across the country. In
      the weeks leading up to my arrest, I noticed a more vicious, coordinated smear
      campaign against me online, the same — the same accounts mentioning Rubio, the
      White House, mentioning also, like, just baseless claims about Mahmoud Khalil,
      who he is, like an international student, a Hamas agent and all these labels.
      So, I felt that since I didn’t have any legal, at that point, representation,
      I wanted, like, Columbia first to protect me, because these actors are Columbia
      students and faculty, the ones who were waging this smear campaign against me
      online and calling for the administration to deport me. So, this is the minimum
      that Columbia should have done, is to protect the students against these hostile
      actors. So, and that was not — I mean, I sent the email the morning of my arrest,
      I believe. And this was not the first email that we sent to Columbia and no answer.
      Unfortunately, Columbia did not and does not, until now, treat all students as
      equal. What they care about is basically money and protecting their brand, rather
      than going and listening to their students, protecting their students with their
      legitimate concerns, not to have any special treatment for the Palestinian or
      the students supporting Palestine on campus. AMY GOODMAN: I’m wondering if Columbia
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: But Columbia failed to do that. AMY GOODMAN: Did Columbia University
      support you in any way? I remember in the case of Rümeysa Öztürk, who is the Tufts
      Fulbright scholar and graduate student also abducted by federal agents, Tufts
      wrote a statement of support. And then Suri Khan, the Dr. Suri Khan at Georgetown,
      Georgetown also spoke out. What about Columbia University on your behalf? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      Columbia did not offer any sort of support when it comes to the legal case. And
      this is shameful on a university that claims to support international students
      and to support the right of freedom of speech. But this was not surprising. Columbia
      has capitulated to the Trump administration, but before then, they capitulated
      to the Zionist donors and politicians in this country. So, to see them not offer
      this kind of support absolutely was not surprising, unfortunately. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can you talk about your time in the Jena ICE jail? You were held for over a hundred
      days there. Can you talk about the other prisoners, the conditions under which
      you were held? And then I want to get to the day your baby, your baby Deen, was
      born without you there. But talk about the jail until that point. MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      So, in jail, you spend 24/7 with the same people. So, one of the things that we
      do is to just share stories from people from around the ward. And every day it’s
      just a more heartbreaking story than another, with people being snatched off the
      street or during their court hearings or ICE check-ins, where these people, like,
      they were trying to fix their documentation. They committed no crimes whatsoever.
      So, you have this shock with everyone who’s coming in around why they are there.
      I shared a dorm with over 70 men, and the stories are really heartbreaking, Amy,
      with people leaving their family outside without any kind of support, people who
      don’t have their rights — don’t know their rights, don’t know if they have any
      rights, in fact. And with ICE, who basically don’t tell anyone what their rights
      are and just deport people, I’ve seen people who unknowingly sign their deportation
      documents because ICE agents tricked them into doing so, which is a blatant violation
      of any rule of law or due process. And just, like, to say that, like, the conditions
      inside were horrible. The food was horrible, the sleep quality equally bad, and
      just the atmosphere, where you are inside, you don’t know what’s happening, and
      you’re just expecting to follow orders and wait for an ICE officer to come and
      update you on your case. Unfortunately, a lot of these detainees don’t have legal
      representation. And I was very privileged to have an amazing legal team fighting
      on my behalf. And that took us three months for me to be released, despite me
      being a legal resident in the United States. So, imagine for a lot of these individuals
      who don’t have this kind of representation and who have, like, more complications
      in their documentation. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, can you talk about the day of Deen’s
      birth, your firstborn son? How did you learn that Noor had given birth? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      That days was absolutely one of the most difficult days that I had to endure in
      my life, being away from my wife and not having the opportunity to support her
      during this moment. And I was over the phone, so I would call every hour just
      to see, like, if Noor is in labor, yeah or no. And the moment of the delivery,
      I spent like over three hours over the phone, from 1:00 — I think 1:30 in the
      morning until 4:00 or 4:30, just, like, trying to support Noor as much as I could,
      because I did not want to miss that moment at all. And what made it very difficult
      is because, like, this could have been easily avoided, were the Trump administration
      to follow the law, or at least, like, to offer me furlough, like, to go and be
      with my family for a few hours. But they refused that, because this administration
      thrives on cruelty and thrives on separation and family separation. So that was
      not surprising. AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the moment when you met Deen
      for the first time? I mean, as you describe it now, you really were with Noor
      then. Of course, you were separate, but you were there. Over the phone, you heard
      his first cries. But talk about holding him for the first time. I remember — I
      mean, it was just weeks ago. Why it was that your lawyers had to fight, a battery
      of lawyers, for so many hours for Noor and Deen, for you to be able to have a
      contact visit? I mean, you have not been charged with a crime. But in the jail
      — is that right — where it was, in Jena, Louisiana? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. As you
      said, I mean, it shouldn’t take an army of lawyers to get a one-hour contact visit
      to let me hold my son. The first time I saw my son was, in fact, through glass.
      So, he was literally in front of me, but separated by glass. I couldn’t hold him
      during the first time I saw him, which made me very, very angry about, like, a
      one-centimeter or one-inch glass separating me from holding my son. And this is
      all by design, the cruelty of this administration, because their goal is to punish
      me as much as they could and in any way that they find, because what they want
      is they want to break me. They want to make an example out of me. So, the first
      time when we managed to get a court order, in fact — imagine getting a court order
      to force ICE to let me hold my son. And we had it for literally an hour, 7:00
      in the morning. So, even when they agreed to do that — or, not agreed — even when
      they were forced to allow me to hold my son, they chose to make it at 7:00 in
      the morning in detention. So, I mean, the feeling, I don’t think I can describe
      it. I was both very happy, but at the same time very angry and sad that it took
      us all this effort to have this one hour in detention. And basically, I was really
      anxious. I was just looking at the clock, when this hour would end. I just didn’t
      want this hour to end. And the hour was the fastest hour in my life, just like
      — you know, like, it went like this. AMY GOODMAN: And so — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      Amy. AMY GOODMAN: You were released less than two weeks ago, and now you are living
      at home with your wife and your infant son. Do you feel safe? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      I don’t fully feel safe, to be honest, Amy. We all know the rhetoric that’s currently
      going around in this country, the Islamophobia, the anti-Palestinian bigotry and
      racism, and this violence that was exported by Israel to this country. I’m being
      targeted by Israeli government-affiliated groups here in the U.S. who are very
      dangerous, who would do anything to silence Palestinians, because, for them, silencing
      is much more easier than dealing with the argument, because they have no argument
      about what they are doing in Palestine. And this is why they want to shut off
      the — shut down the conversation any way they can do, even if this would mean
      hurting or harming me and my family. And it’s a huge concern. But it’s a price
      that I need to accept for advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people,
      because, once again, this is all just a distraction from the genocide in Palestine.
      And these attempts to silence me are just one way for them to attack us and to
      cut — just not to let the public know about what Israel is doing and how the U.S.
      is complicit in this genocide. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, you led a march from
      the steps of St. John the Divine up to Columbia University, wearing a Palestinian
      flag as a kind of cape, with a thousand supporters there, and you were one of
      the leaders of the encampment at Columbia that led to so many protests and encampments
      around the country on university campuses. Many of the protesters were Jewish.
      Many of the supporters for you who would march when you were detained were Jewish.
      I was wondering: What did that level of Jewish support mean to you here in the
      United States? MAHMOUD KHALIL: First of all, just a correction: The student movement
      at Columbia doesn’t have leaders. I believe all the students equally contribute
      to the movement. And it’s being mobilized by a large number of students, hundreds
      of students at Columbia University. But going back to your question, Amy, I mean,
      Jewish students are an integral part of the student movement, whether at Columbia
      or in the United States. And this is very, very important, because these Jewish
      students, they show the world that what Israel is doing is not in their name,
      is not in the name of Jewish safety, which is very important. And these, also,
      Jewish students are acting upon their values, of protecting the — protecting the
      weak or supporting justice. So, it’s really — to us, it’s very important. This
      shows that the Palestinian cause goes beyond Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims. It’s
      a universal cause for justice, for freedom and for human rights. AMY GOODMAN:
      And finally, Mahmoud, as you are free now here in New York, you still face deportation?
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I do. I mean, now I’m out on bail, which means that the court
      proceedings can continue while I am out. So, I’m still facing deportation. However,
      a judge, a federal judge, ruled that the Rubio determination on what Rubio did
      to me is likely unconstitutional, and that’s why he ordered my release on bail.
      So I’m confident that we will prevail in court, that this administration attempts
      to silence us wouldn’t succeed, and now that I will seek accountability. I will
      seek accountability from this administration, from the individuals and actors
      who contributed to my arrest, and now exploring these options with my lawyer,
      because in the first place, what I was protesting, I was protesting for accountability,
      to hold Columbia and the U.S. government accountable for their complicity in war
      crimes and genocide against the Palestinians. And I will continue to do so, because
      what happened to me shouldn’t have happened in the first place. I shouldn’t have
      been prosecuted simply for my freedom of speech, simply for speaking up for Palestinian
      rights. And those who have contributed to that in any way should be held accountable.
      AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, thanks so much for joining us, Columbia University
      graduate, Palestinian student activist, detained by ICE March 8th and held for
      104 days at the ICE jail in Jena, Louisiana. During that time, his wife, Dr. Noor

      By Kit Klarenberg / The Grayzone


      A notorious British MI6 agent infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency
      (IAEA) on London’s behalf, according to leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone.
      The agent, Nicholas Langman, is a veteran intelligence operative who claims credit
      for helping engineer the West’s economic war on Iran.


      Langman’s identity first surfaced in journalistic accounts of his role in deflecting
      accusations that British intelligence played a role in the death of Princess Diana.
      He was later accused by Greek authorities of overseeing the abduction and torture
      of Pakistani migrants in Athens.


      In both cases, UK authorities issued censorship orders forbidding the press from
      publishing his name. But Greek media, which was under no such obligation, confirmed
      that Langman was one of the MI6 assets withdrawn from Britain’s embassy in Athens.


      The Grayzone discovered the résumé of the journeyman British operative in a trove
      of leaked papers detailing the activities of Torchlight, a prolific British intelligence
      cutout. The bio of the longtime MI6 officer reveals he “led large, inter-agency
      teams to identify and defeat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
      technology, including by innovative technical means and sanctions.”


      In particular, the MI6 agent says he “worked to prevent WMD proliferation through…
      support for the [IAEA] and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
      [OPCW] and through high level international partnerships.”


      Langman’s CV credits him with playing a major role in organizing the sanctions
      regime on Iran by “[building] highly effective and mutually supportive relations
      across government and with senior US, European, Middle and Far Eastern colleagues
      for strategy” between 2010 and 2012. He boasts in his bio that this achievement
      “enabled [the] major diplomatic success of [the] Iranian nuclear and sanctions
      agreement.”


      The influence Langman claimed to have exerted on the IAEA adds weight to Iranian
      allegations that the international nuclear regulation body colluded with the West
      and Israel to undermine its sovereignty. The Iranian government has alleged that
      the IAEA supplied the identities of its top nuclear scientists to Israeli intelligence,
      enabling their assassinations, and provided critical intelligence to the US and
      Israel on the nuclear facilities they bombed during their military assault this
      June.


      This June 12, under the direction of its Secretary General Rafael Grossi, the
      IAEA issued a clearly politicized report recycling questionable past allegations
      to accuse Iran of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The next day, Israel
      attacked the country, assassinating nine nuclear scientists as well as numerous
      top military officials and hundreds of civilians.


      Iranian former Vice President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif has since called
      for the IAEA’s Grossi to be sacked, accusing him of having “abetted the slaughter
      of innocents in the country.” This June 28, the Iranian government broke ties
      with the IAEA, refusing to allow its inspectors into the country.


      While Iranian officials may have had no idea about the involvement of a shadowy
      figure like Langman in IAEA business, it would likely come as little surprise
      to Tehran that the supposedly multilateral agency had been compromised by a Western
      intelligence agency.


      Langman’s name placed under official UK censorship order


      In 2016, Langman was named a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George,
      the same title bestowed on fictional British spy James Bond. By that point, the
      supposed secret agent held the dubious distinction of being publicly ‘burned’
      as an MI6 operative on two separate occasions.


      First, in 2001, journalist Stephen Dorril revealed that Langman had arrived in
      Paris weeks prior to Princess Diana’s fatal car crash in the city on August 31
      1997, and was subsequently charged with conducting “information operations” to
      deflect widespread public speculation British intelligence was responsible for
      her death.


      Then, in 2005, he was formally accused by Greek authorities of complicity in the
      abduction and torture of 28 Pakistanis in Athens. The Pakistanis, all migrant
      workers, were suspected of having had contact with individuals accused of perpetrating
      the 7/7 bombings in London, July 2005.


      Brutally beaten and threatened with guns in their mouths, the victims “were convinced
      their interrogators were British.” When Greek media named Langman as the MI6 operative
      who oversaw the migrants’ torture, British news outlets universally complied with
      a government D-notice – an official censorship order – and kept his identity under
      wraps when reporting on the scandal.


      London vehemently denied any British involvement in torturing the migrants, with
      then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw dismissing the charge as “utter nonsense.” In
      January 2006 though, London admitted MI6 officers were indeed present during the
      Pakistanis’ torture, although officials insisted the operatives played no active
      part in their arrests, questioning or abuse.


      Following his withdrawal from Athens, Langman returned to London to head the UK
      Foreign Office’s Iran Department, a shift which highlights his importance to MI6
      and suggests the British government had no qualms about his allegedly brutal evidence
      gathering methods.


      Britain’s Foreign Office collaborates closely with MI6, whose agents use it as
      cover just as the CIA does with State Department diplomatic postings.


      MI6’s man on Iran takes credit for “maximum pressure” strategy


      While leading the Foreign Office’s Iran Department from 2006 – 2008, Langman oversaw
      a team seeking to “develop understanding” of the Iranian government’s “nuclear
      program.”


      It’s unclear exactly what that “understanding” entailed. But the document makes
      clear that Langman then “generated confidence” in that assessment among “European,
      US and Middle Eastern agencies” in order to “delay programme [sic] and pressurise
      Iran to negotiate.” The reference to “Middle Eastern agencies” strongly implied
      MI6 cooperation with Israel’s Mossad intelligence service.


      In April 2006, Tehran announced it had successfully enriched uranium for the first
      time, although officials denied any intention to do so for military purposes.
      This development may have triggered Langman’s intervention.


      The Islamic Republic has rejected any suggestion it harbors ambitions to possess
      nuclear weapons. Its denials were corroborated by a November 2007 US National
      Intelligence Estimate expressing “high confidence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted”
      any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment remained unchanged
      for several years, and was reportedly shared by the Mossad, despite Benjamin Netanyhau’s
      constant declarations that Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon.


      Langman’s IAEA support work overlaps with Iran sanctions blitz


      International governmental attitudes towards Iran changed abruptly between 2010
      and ‘12. During this period, Western states and intergovernmental institutions
      initiated an array of harshly punitive measures against the country, while Israel
      ramped up its deadly covert operations against Iran’s nuclear scientists.


      This period precisely overlapped with Langman’s tenure at the Counter-Proliferation
      Centre of the UK Foreign Office. His bio implies he used this position to influence
      the IAEA and other UN-affiliated organizations to foment a campaign of global
      hostility towards Iran.


      In June 2010, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1929, which froze the
      Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ assets, and banned overseas financial institutions
      from opening offices in Tehran. A month later, the Obama administration adopted
      the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. This set
      off a global chain of copycat sanctions by Washington’s vassals, who often imposed
      even more stringent measures than those levied by the UN and US.


      In March 2012, the EU voted unanimously to cut Iranian banks out of the SWIFT
      international banking network. That October, the bloc imposed the harshest sanctions
      to date, restricting trade, financial services, energy and technology, along with
      bans on the provision of insurance to Iranian companies by European firms.


      BBC reporting on the sanctions acknowledged European officials merely suspected
      Tehran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but lacked concrete proof. And behind
      the scenes, the MI6 operative Langman was claiming credit for helping legitimize
      the allegations against Iran.


      Nuclear agreement lays foundations for war


      Following the Western-led campaign isolation of Iran from 2010 – 2012, over its
      purported nuclear weapon program, the Obama administration negotiated a July 2015
      agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the JCPOA’s
      terms, the Islamic Republic agreed to limit its nuclear research activities in
      return for sanctions relief. In the years that followed, the IAEA was granted
      virtually unlimited access to Tehran’s nuclear complexes, ostensibly to ensure
      the facilities were not used to develop nuclear weapons.


      Along the way, IAEA inspectors collected vast amounts of information on the sites,
      including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents. The Iranian
      government has since accused the Agency of furnishing the top secret profiles
      of its nuclear scientists to Israel. These include the godfather of Iran’s nuclear
      program, Mohsen Fakrizadeh, who was first publicly named in a menacing 2019 powerpoint
      presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The following year,
      the Mossad assassinated Fakrizadeh in broad daylight with a remote-controlled
      machine gun.


      Internal IAEA documents leaked this June indicated that IAEA Secretary General
      Rafael Grossi has enjoyed a much closer relationship with Israeli officials than
      was previously known, and suggested he leveraged his cozy ties with Tel Aviv to
      secure his current position.


      During a June 24 interview with Fox News’ war-crazed anchor Martha MacCallum,
      Grossi did not deny making the inflammatory claim that “900 pounds of potentially
      enriched uranium was taken to an ancient site near Isfahan.” Instead the IAEA
      director asserted, “We do not have any information on the whereabouts of this
      material.”


      Well before Grossi rose to the top of the IAEA with Western and Israeli backing,
      the agency appears to have been penetrated by a British intelligence agent who
      took responsibility in his bio for engineering the West’s economic attack on Iran.


      The IAEA has not responded to an email from The Grayzone seeking clarification
      on its relationship with Langman and the MI6.

      By Susan Kang / Truthout


      By now, much ink has been spilled and many takes have been shared on the resounding
      12-point victory of Zohran Mamdani over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last Tuesday
      in the New York City primary to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for
      mayor. There are many reasons for this win, including Mamdani’s talents; his clear
      progressive message focusing on affordability in one of the most expensive cities
      in the country; and his excellent use of social media, earned media, and traditional
      ads.


      Mamdani’s plans were almost immediately denounced as “unrealistic” and pie in
      the sky by political commentators. The Atlantic suggested that his accessible,
      unified message of affordability — with key policies, such as free child care,
      free bus service, and rent freezes for New York City’s 2 million rent-stabilized
      tenants — was a form of “magical realism.” Pundits and political elites repeatedly
      claimed that such universal affordability type policies did not speak to voters
      of color, but rather only appealed to highly educated white younger voters. Underlying
      the tired trope of the socialist “Bernie Bro” was the implicit idea that Mamdani’s
      voter base would be limited only to college-educated transplants, out of touch
      with the experience of working-class communities of color.


      Despite nearly universal opinions and polling data predicting a Cuomo victory,
      the underdog’s victory last week revealed many of his advantages. Commentators
      have pointed to a plethora of explanations — Cuomo’s toxicity and scandals, as
      well as Mamdani’s charisma, political talent, clear messaging, and excellent social
      media strategy and ground game. The City called his tens of thousands of volunteers
      Mamdani’s “army,” and according to the campaign, canvassers knocked on over 1
      million doors.


      All of these factors undoubtedly contributed to Mamdani’s win, but these were
      obvious factors prior to his upset victory. One factor of Mamdani’s campaign that
      gets less attention is its grassroots nature, which goes beyond merely running
      an impressive ground game door-knocking operation; Mamdani’s campaign is grassroots
      in its origins, its associations, its practice, and its theory of governance.
      The media does not quite understand this orientation, because most candidates
      and politicians are so divorced from the grassroots. The clarity of Mamdani’s
      message and his unique talent may serve as an inspiration for other insurgents,
      as might his grassroots commitments.


      While Mamdani’s affordability agenda was mocked as unrealistic, and even out of
      touch with the working-class communities he needed to win the primary, this narrative
      ignores his “man on the street” style of campaigning that he began following Donald
      Trump’s general election victory in November 2024. Specifically, Latino voters
      in the Bronx and Asian voters in Queens noticeably broke for Trump, compared to
      their voting behavior in 2020. Shortly after the 2024 election, Mamdani spoke
      with voters in the Bronx and Queens about why they chose to vote for Trump (or
      chose not to vote) and recorded their answers. The voters gave different responses:
      affordability, problems with the system, rent and food costs, general disappointment
      in the Democrats, and Israel’s U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza. Absent were mentions
      of disliking immigrants (as these neighborhoods are diverse and immigrant heavy)
      or other so-called “woke” issues. Rather, this video captured a bottom-up desire
      for Democratic politicians to respond to people’s immediate economic needs.


      Mamdani’s messaging came from countless conversations like the ones in the video.
      His unified message of affordability, universal programs, and solidarity wasn’t
      just popular — it was also digestible and easy to understand. In response, Cuomo
      came prepared with a well-funded media campaign backed by super PACs, blanketing
      the airwaves with anti-Mamdani commercials and filling mailboxes with mailers,
      spending a record-breaking $25 million. But all this propaganda, which characterized
      Mamdani as dangerous and inexperienced, did not work. And part of this is because
      of the strength of the grassroots efforts, which went beyond canvassing.


      Aaron Fernando is a member of New York City’s chapter of Democratic Socialists
      of America (DSA), a law student, and a volunteer for Mamdani’s campaign. Fernando
      told Truthout, “With an electorate as large as New York City’s, paid media like
      TV advertisements and mailers can get a campaign pretty far. And after [Kamala]
      Harris lost every swing state [in 2024] despite a gigantic field operation, many
      people declared that canvassing had become obsolete. But that’s the wrong message
      to take away.”


      The truth, Fernando says, is that while canvassing alone can’t win large-scale
      elections, it can reinforce the messaging a campaign puts out and allow voters
      to “make the connection between the information about the candidate they’ve been
      hearing [about] and the smiling canvasser at their front door.” Canvassing can
      also reach unique populations, Fernando says, “like the Muslim and South Asian
      uncles and aunties that powered Zohran’s victory.”


      “Make no mistake,” Fernando concluded. “Zohran’s operation of 50,000 volunteers
      and 1.5 million doors knocked — the end result of almost a decade of NYC-DSA’s
      trial-and-error on our campaigns — was the difference in this election.”


      In addition to the canvassing operation, Zohran Mamdani’s campaign maintained
      strong connections to left and progressive political organizations, such as the
      Working Families Party, the New York City chapter of DSA, and youth climate organizations,
      such as TREEage and the Sunrise Movement. Many of these organizations endorsed
      early and provided the volunteer muscle to share the campaigns’ message among
      diverse networks. The Mamdani campaign came out with its three key policies —
      free child care, buses, and rent freezes — but developed other policy platforms
      through collaboration with policy experts and grassroots organizations, many of
      which are grassroots Black and immigrant community-based.


      Mamdani’s dedication to openness, collaboration, and shared goals permeated his
      campaign. “A profound democratic sensibility extended through every aspect of
      the Zohran campaign — from the platform that focused on the issues that keep millions
      of working New Yorkers up at night; to the role played by millions of canvassing
      conversations with strangers about how to change our city; to the way that everyday
      people who had never been involved in politics before could get involved, build
      their skills, develop the campaign’s strategy together, and become leaders,” Mamdani
      campaign volunteer Jeremy Cohan told Truthout.


      “It’s no wonder the establishment completely dismissed it, because it is totally
      foreign to how they operate, which is fundamentally based on treating working
      people as passive consumers to whom experts try to sell a political product dreamed
      up in a boardroom with millionaire and billionaire donors,” Cohan said. “Rather
      than catering to big donors, corporate consultants, and bloviating pundits, [the
      campaign] starts from the basic belief that most people in our society are made
      to feel powerless, that this is the basis of tremendous suffering — not to mention
      of fascist reaction — and that democracy must enfranchise and involve ordinary
      people on a deep level in taking control of their lives, their society, and their
      future.”


      This message of hope and empowering everyday people, whether in their interactions
      with the mayoral candidate or through conversations with volunteers, created a
      stark contrast with the politics of fear and distrust that characterized the Cuomo
      campaign.


      But perhaps the characteristic of the Mamdani campaign that is least understood
      by both professional pundits and Democratic leadership alike is the radical model
      of governance that informed Mamdani’s tenure as an assemblymember, which has also
      been present in his campaign thus far. As part of the Socialist in Office co-governance
      committee, Mamdani, together with other socialist state legislators and city council
      members, has taken a social movement approach to governing, building power through
      mobilizing and empowering regular people to push for solutions at all levels of
      government. A 2022 article from The Nation noted how Mamdani helped constituents
      organize to solve municipal-level problems like requesting a traffic light at
      a busy intersection, even though he is a state-level legislator, because he treated
      constituent services as a way to build power and democratize local government.
      Even though the theory of change behind this co-governance model was clearly laid
      out in the article, somehow this grassroots-oriented model of political power
      remains incomprehensible to most political observers.


      Mamdani was constantly dinged on only passing “three bills” during his time in
      the legislature and he never defended this record. Instead, he continued to stress
      his social movement, grassroots orientation to prove his effectiveness as an elected
      official, pointing out his organizing with indebted taxi drivers and their advocacy
      group, in which he engaged in a 15-day hunger strike to negotiate for city debt
      relief for taxi drivers. While not carrying any bills on eviction protections,
      working with housing activists, he was arrested for protesting the end of the
      COVID-era eviction moratorium in 2021. This broader movement helped pass historic
      “Good Cause” eviction protection in New York State in 2024. In collaboration with
      the Public Power campaign and DSA Ecosocialists, Mamdani and other DSA electeds
      rallied, marched, and organized to fight for New York’s Build Public Renewables
      Act in 2023, touted as the country’s biggest climate law. The legislation allowed
      for the building of publicly owned renewable energy infrastructure, although Mamdani
      was not listed as the bill’s main sponsor. This is a non-comprehensive list that
      only scratches the surface of the grassroots governance that characterized Mamdani’s
      time in the New York State Assembly. Rather than see himself as a politician at
      the top, this theory of governance sees electeds as playing an inside-outside
      strategy, clearly embedded in grassroots and social movements.


      Mamdani’s fellow socialist in office, New York State Assembly member and housing
      activist Marcela Mitaynes, told Truthout that the goal of the campaigns and socialists
      in office is to build movements and organizers, not just one-time voters and constituents.
      “[Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams] said, ‘Oh you can’t have free buses,
      you can’t tax the rich. That’s on the state level.’ But he doesn’t understand
      how [our project] works. We are building the political community. …We are teaching
      people to do more and go beyond the typical political script,” Mitaynes said.


      “In this next stage of the campaign, we’ll be able to build that and that talk
      about governance and how it works, and then we’ll be able to pass this legislation.
      This grassroots organizing means we can push people — city council members, state
      legislators — to pass the laws we want,” Mitaynes said. “To [most politicians],
      everything is transactional. You either have the political capital to do it or
      you don’t. But we’re building it, by building up this movement. No politician
      can do this by themselves. We need to join forces with the people. We can never
      beat the money thrown at us. That’s why [we] focus on grassroots, bringing [in]
      people affected the most.”

    paragraph_summary: Zohran Mamdani's recent victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo
      in the New York City primary for mayor has been attributed to his grassroots campaign,
      clear progressive messaging focused on affordability, and effective use of social
      media and volunteer mobilization. Despite skepticism from political commentators
      regarding the feasibility of his policies, such as free child care and rent freezes,
      Mamdani's campaign resonated with voters through direct engagement and conversations
      about their economic concerns. His approach, which emphasizes collaboration with

      norms and highlighting the importance of grassroots activism in shaping policy
      and community engagement.

      By William D. Hartung / TomDispatch


      The Senate is on the verge of passing the distinctly misnamed “big beautiful bill.”
      It is, in fact, one of the ugliest pieces of legislation to come out of Congress
      in living memory. The version that passed the House recently would cut $1.7 trillion,
      mostly in domestic spending, while providing the top 5% of taxpayers with roughly
      $1.5 trillion in tax breaks.


      Over the next few years, the same bill will add another $150 billion to a Pentagon
      budget already soaring towards a record $1 trillion. In short, as of now, in the
      battle between welfare and warfare, the militarists are carrying the day.


      Pentagon Pork and the People It Harms


      The bill, passed by the House of Representatives and at present under consideration
      in the Senate, would allocate tens of billions of dollars to pursue President
      Trump’s cherished but hopeless Golden Dome project, which Laura Grego of the Union
      of Concerned Scientists has described as “a fantasy.” She explained exactly why
      the Golden Dome, which would supposedly protect the United States against nuclear
      attack, is a pipe dream:


      “Over the last 60 years, the United States has spent more than $350 billion on
      efforts to develop a defense against nuclear-armed ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic
      missiles]. This effort has been plagued by false starts and failures, and none
      have yet been demonstrated to be effective against a real-world threat… Missile
      defenses are not a useful or long-term strategy for keeping the U.S. safe from
      nuclear weapons.”


      The bill also includes billions more for shipbuilding, heavy new investments in
      artillery and ammunition, and funding for next-generation combat aircraft like
      the F-47.


      Oh, and after all of those weapons programs get their staggering cut of that future
      Pentagon budget, somewhere way down at the bottom of that list is a line item
      for improving the quality of life for active-duty military personnel. But the
      share aimed at the well-being of soldiers, sailors, and airmen (and women) is
      less than 6% of the $150 billion that Congress is now poised to add to that department’s
      already humongous budget. And that’s true despite the way Pentagon budget hawks
      invariably claim that the enormous sums they routinely plan on shoveling into
      it — and the overflowing coffers of the contractors it funds — are “for the troops.”


      Much of the funding in the bill will flow into the districts of key members of
      Congress (to their considerable political benefit). For example, the Golden Dome
      project will send billions of dollars to companies based in Huntsville, Alabama,
      which calls itself “Rocket City” because of the dense network of outfits there
      working on both offensive missiles and missile defense systems. And that, of course,
      is music to the ears of Representative Mike Rogers (R-AL), the current chair of
      the House Armed Services Committee, who just happens to come from Alabama.


      The shipbuilding funds will help prop up arms makers like HII Corporation (formerly
      Huntington Ingalls), which runs a shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the home
      state of Senate Armed Services Committee chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss). The funds
      will also find their way to shipyards in Maine, Connecticut, and Virginia.


      Those funds will benefit the co-chairs of the House Shipbuilding Caucus, Representative
      Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Representative Rob Wittman (R-VA). Connecticut hosts General
      Dynamics’ Electric Boat plant, which makes submarines that carry ballistic missiles,
      while Virginia is home to HII Corporation’s Newport News Shipbuilding facility,
      which makes both aircraft carriers and attack submarines.


      The Golden Dome missile defense project, on which President Trump has promised
      to spend $175 billion over the next three years, will benefit contractors big
      and small. Those include companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon
      (now RTX) that build current generation missile defense systems, as well as emerging
      military tech firms like Elon Musk’s Space X and Palmer Luckey’s Anduril, both
      of which are rumored to have a shot at playing a leading role in the development
      of the new anti-missile system.


      And just in case you thought this country was only planning to invest in defense
      against a nuclear strike, a sharp upsurge in spending on new nuclear warheads
      under the auspices of the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Agency
      (NNSA) has been proposed for fiscal year 2026. Thirty billion dollars, to be exact,
      which would represent a 58% hike from the prior year’s budget. Meanwhile, within
      that agency, nonproliferation, cleanup, and renewable energy programs are set
      to face significant cuts, leaving 80% of NNSA’s proposed funding to be spent on
      — yes! — nuclear weapons alone. Those funds will flow to companies like Honeywell,
      Bechtel, Jacobs Engineering, and Fluor that help run nuclear labs and nuclear
      production sites, as well as educational institutions like the University of Tennessee,
      Texas A&M, and the University of California at Berkeley, which help manage nuclear
      weapons labs or nuclear production sites.


      Weakening the Social Safety Net — and America


      And while weapons contractors will gorge on a huge new infusion of cash, military
      personnel, past and present, are clearly going to be neglected. As a start, the
      Veterans Administration is on the block for deep cuts, including possible layoffs
      of up to 80,000 employees — a move that would undoubtedly slow down the processing
      of benefits for those who have served in America’s past wars. Research on ailments
      that disproportionately impact veterans will also be cut, which should be considered
      an outrage.


      Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of veterans from this country’s disastrous wars
      in Afghanistan and Iraq will continue to suffer from physical and psychological
      wounds, including traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Cutting research that might find more effective solutions to such problems
      should be considered a national disgrace. In the meantime, active-duty personnel
      who are getting a tiny fraction of the potential Pentagon add-on of $150 billion
      are similarly in need.


      Worse yet, turn away from the Pentagon for a moment, and the cuts in the rest
      of that “big beautiful bill” will likely have an impact on a majority of Americans
      — Democrats, independents, and MAGA Republicans alike. Their full effects may
      not be felt for months until the spending reductions contained in it start hitting
      home. However, enacting policies that take food off people’s tables and deny them
      medical care will not only cause unnecessary suffering but cost lives.


      As President (and former general) Dwight D. Eisenhower, a very different kind
      of Republican, said more than 70 years ago, the ultimate security of a nation
      lies not in how many weapons it can pile up, but in the health, education, and
      resilience of its people. The big beautiful bill and the divisive politics surrounding
      it threaten those foundations of our national strength.


      Clash of the Contractors?


      As budget cuts threaten to make the population weaker, distorted spending priorities
      are making arms producers stronger. The Big Five — Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing,
      General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman — produce most of the current big-ticket
      weapon systems, from submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles to tanks,
      combat aircraft, and missile-defense systems. Meanwhile, emerging tech firms like
      Palantir, Anduril, and Space X are cashing in on contracts for unpiloted vehicles,
      advanced communications systems, new-age goggles for the Army, anti-drone systems,
      and so much more.


      But even as weapons spending hits near-record or record levels, there may still
      be a fight between the Big Five and the emerging tech firms over who gets the
      biggest share of that budget. One front in the coming battle between the Big Five
      and the Silicon Valley militarists could be the Army Transformation Initiative
      (ATI). According to Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, one of the goals of ATI
      is to “eliminate obsolete systems.”


      Driscoll is a harsh critic of the way members of Congress put money in the budget
      — a process known as “pork barrel politics” — for items the military services
      haven’t even asked for (and they ask for plenty), simply because those systems
      might bring more jobs and revenue to their states or districts. He has, in fact,
      committed himself to an approach that’s incompatible with the current, parochial
      process of putting together the Pentagon budget. “Lobbyists and bureaucrats have
      overtaken the army’s ability to prioritize soldiers and war fighting,” he insisted.


      Driscoll is talking a tough game when it comes to taking on the existing big contractors.
      He’s evidently ready to push for “reform,” even if it means that some of them
      go out of business. In fact, he seems to welcome it: “I will measure it as success
      if, in the next two years, one of the primes is no longer in business.” (“Primes”
      are the big contractors like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that take the
      lead on major programs and get the bulk of the funding, a significant portion
      of which they dole out to subcontractors all over the country and the world.)


      Ending pork-barrel politics in favor of an approach in which the Pentagon only
      buys systems that align with the country’s actual defense strategy, as Driscoll
      is suggesting, might seem like a significant step forward. But be careful what
      you wish for. Any funds freed up by stopping congressional representatives from
      treating the Pentagon budget as a piggy bank to buy loyalty from their constituents
      will almost certainly go to emerging tech firms ready to build next-generation
      systems like swarms of drones, weapons that can take out a hypersonic missile,
      or pilotless land vehicles, aircraft, and ships. Driscoll is a major tech enthusiast,
      as is his friend and Yale law school classmate J.D. Vance, who was first employed
      by Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, who then backed his successful run for the
      Senate from Ohio.


      Since the tech firms don’t have the equivalent of the Big Five’s extensive production
      networks in key congressional districts, they need to find other ways to persuade
      Congress to fund their weapons programs. Fortunately, the Silicon Valley militarists
      have a significant number of former employees or financial backers in the Trump
      administration who can plead their case.


      In addition, military-tech-focused venture capital firms have hired at least 50
      former Pentagon and military officials, all of whom can help them exert influence
      over both the Trump administration and Congress. The biggest “catch” was Palantir’s
      hiring of former Wisconsin Congressman Mike Gallagher, who had run the hawkish
      Congressional special committee on Communist China.


      Some journalists and policy analysts have wondered whether the feud between Donald
      Trump and Elon Musk will hurt the military tech sector. Well, stop fretting. Even
      if Trump were to follow through on his threat to cut the government funding of
      Musk’s firms, the tasks they’re carrying out — from launching military satellites
      to developing more secure Internet access for deployed military personnel — would
      still proceed, just under the auspices of different companies. There would be
      some friction involved, simply because it’s hard to shift suppliers on a dime
      without slowing down production. And the transition, should it occur, would also
      add cost to already exceedingly expensive programs.


      But Trump’s threat to cancel Space X’s contracts may just be more grist for his
      verbal combat with Musk rather than anything his administration plans to follow
      through on. Even if Musk and his president never reconcile, the DOGE cuts to international
      diplomacy and domestic social services that Musk spearheaded will still do serious
      damage for years to come.


      Money Can’t Buy Security


      A shift toward emerging military tech firms and away from the Big Five will be
      about more than money and technology. Key figures among the growing cohort of
      Silicon Valley militarists like Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, see building weapons
      as more than just a necessary pillar of national defense. They see it as a measure
      of national character.


      Karp’s new book, The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the
      Future of the West, mixes the Cold War ideology of the 1950s with the emerging
      technology of the twenty-first century. He decries the lack of unifying concepts
      like “the West” and sees too many Americans as slackers with no sense of national
      pride or patriotism. His solution, a supposedly unifying national mission, is
      — wait for it! — a modern Manhattan project for the development of the military
      applications of artificial intelligence. To say that this is an impoverished version
      of what this country’s mission should be is putting it mildly. Many other possibilities
      come to mind, from addressing climate change to preventing pandemics to upgrading
      our educational system to building a society where everyone’s basic needs are
      met, leaving room for creative pursuits of all kinds.


      The techno-optimists are also obsessed with preparing for a war with China, which
      Palmer Luckey, the 32-year-old founder of the military tech firm Anduril, believes
      will happen by 2027. And many in his circle, including Marc Andreessen of the
      venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, are convinced that any potential risks
      from the development of AI pale in comparison to the need to “beat China,” not
      just in getting to sophisticated military applications first, but in winning a
      future war with Beijing, if it comes to that. Talk of diplomacy to head off a
      war over Taiwan or cooperation on global issues like climate change, outbreaks
      of disease, and building a more inclusive, less unequal global economy rarely
      come up in discussions among the hardcore militarist faction in Silicon Valley.
      Instead, that group is spending inordinate amounts of time and money seeking to
      influence the future of U.S. foreign and military policy, a dangerous development
      indeed.


      Whether the emerging tech firms can build cheaper weapons with superior capabilities
      will be irrelevant if such developments are tied to an aggressive strategy that
      makes a devastating conflict with China more likely. While the fight between the
      Big Five and the tech leaders may prove interesting to observe, it is also ominous
      in terms of this country’s future economic and foreign policies, not to speak
      of the shape and size of our national budget.


      The rest of us, who aren’t billionaires and don’t draw $20 million in annual compensation
      packages like the CEOs of the big weapons firms (directly or indirectly funded
      by our tax dollars), should play a leading role in rethinking and revising this
      country’s global role and our policies at home. If we don’t rise to that challenge,
      this country could end up swapping one form of militarism, led by the Big Five,
      for another, spearheaded by hawkish, self-important tech leaders who care more
      about making money and spawning devastating new technologies than they do about
      democracy or the quality of life of the average American.

      On one hand, you have the White House, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Dan
      Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, insisting and insisting again — insisting too
      much, methinks — that those B–2 bombers that flew over Iran two Sundays back,
      June 22, obliterated the nation’s nuclear program just as President Trump hastily
      claimed as soon as the operation was completed.


      Hegseth at a news conference with Caine four days later: “U.S. attacks have effectively
      destroyed Iran’s centrifuge enrichment program …. You want to call it destroyed,
      you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated, choose your word.
      This was an historically successful attack, and we should celebrate it as Americans.”


      Trump, at a news conference the next day: “The place was bombed to hell …. The
      last thing they’re thinking about now is nuclear weapons.”


      And in the background you have the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central
      Intelligence Agency performing Difficulty 5 back flips as they repudiate initial
      assessments of limited damage to the Iranian nuclear program so as to conform
      to the Trump regime’s “obliterated, destroyed, defeated” narrative.


      On the other hand, you have reports that the Iranians, warned in advance the “bunker
      busters” would fall on the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites, removed their
      400–kilograms of enriched uranium, not quite 900 pounds, to secret locations.
      Immediately after the bombs fell, Amwaj.media, a British-based digital publication
      that covers West Asia in English, Arabic and Farsi, reported this, citing “a high-ranking
      Iranian political source [who] also confirmed that the targeted sites were evacuated,
      with ‘most’ of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium kept in secure locations.”


      “How can you tell,” Reuters asked in a June 29 report, “if enriched uranium stocks,
      some of them near weapons grade, were buried beneath the rubble or secretly hidden
      away?”


      You cannot, it seems to me. Neither can President Trump or any of his adjutants.


      Then you have the granular analysis of reputable technologists such as Ted Postol,
      the gentlemanly scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has
      over many years exploded more false flags, propaganda ops, and other such ruses
      than you’ve had hot dinners.


      There is satellite imagery showing 16 tractor trailers lined up at Fordow in the
      days before the B–2s flew. Trump insists they were pouring concrete, a peculiar
      use of a truck of that sort, I have to say. It is magnitudes more plausible they
      were there to load the steel drums in which enriched uranium is commonly stored
      and shipped.


      Postol gave the heavy-on-the-science interview to Daniel Davis, an Army veteran
      who now podcasts as a respected military analyst, after the Hegseth–Caine press
      conference. In the course of it, the joint chiefs chairman went full monty with
      slides, diagrams, satellite images, and graphics to show (or is snow my word?)
      the assembled reporters just how true the obliterated-destroyed-defeated story
      is.


      “What it clearly shows is that the bottom of the shaft [formed by the bombs] is
      still sealed,” Postol said of Caine’s presentation. “Caine is probably a good
      soldier, but he doesn’t know much science. You cannot succeed with this kind of
      attack. It was destined to fail.”


      Postol also proves astute as to the political dynamics of the administration’s
      shape-shifting accounts of the Iranian mission: “This is a circus, a political
      circus to try to minimize the embarrassment to President Trump for having spoken
      without any knowledge.”


      Where are we, then? As Postol points out during his exchange with Davis, “You
      can’t trust the media and you can’t trust the intelligence community.” What happened
      and what is going to happen next? These are the questions we are left to consider
      more or less on our own.


      Strange as it may seem, I find it easier to anticipate the future than to conclude
      with certainty what it is that those B–2s and their 30,000–pound bombs actually
      got done.


      It may be that we are doomed never to know the extent of the damage the Air Force’s
      aerial operation caused. But, staying short of convictions as we must, I put my
      stock in those reports that the Iranians had advance notice that the B–2s were
      coming. I have heard no official denial on this point. And so much of contemporary
      warfare is weirdly choreographed, after all. In this case, telling Tehran the
      battle plan would serve to reduce the danger — danger the International Atomic
      Energy Agency warned of prior to the operation — of a catastrophic release of
      radioactive material into the atmosphere.


      And there is the science, such as unscientific minds, mine among them, can understand
      it. I have found Ted Postol a careful, persuasive witness ever since he discredited
      those false-flag chemical weapons incidents in Syria at the height of the Western-run
      operation to bring down the Assad regime. Take a look at the video of his talk
      with Daniel Davis. He did the same thing this time: Here are the physics, here
      the thermodynamics, this is what would have to have happened if the obliteration
      story was true, and here is how we know it did not happen.


      As to what is likely to come next, we can usefully read events as mirrors of intentions.


      I think it is true that Hegseth, Caine and others among Trump’s sycophantic appointees
      are protecting the president from ignominy — or more ignominy, better to say —
      as they flood the zone with pseudoscience and, in Hegseth’s case, shrill exhortations
      to print and broadcast media to stop with the reporting and get with the patriotic
      propaganda. (Read the transcript linked above for the full taste of these crude
      harangues.)


      But there is more to President Trump than his obvious concern for appearances.
      In my view he is very eager to avoid any circumstance that would require another
      American air campaign in Iranian airspace. He wants neither the risk nor the responsibility.
      This is how, paradoxically, I read his warning the other day that he will bomb
      again if Iran resumes its enrichment processes. When Trump drops threats like
      granite boulders we can read in them what he actually wants. In this case it is
      another way of saying, “Please stay with the ceasefire and short of the nuclear
      stuff.”


      With Trump, it is as it was with Joe Biden and numerous of their predecessors.
      One can never tell the extent to which Trump , is willing to restrain the Israelis
      as they advance their aggressions — which any American regime could do in very
      short order — and the extent to which he pretends to be willing to restrain the
      Israelis but has no intention of doing so because of the Israel lobbies.


      The New York Times ran a report Monday, June 29, under the headline, “Israel’s
      Military Appears Poised to Expand Into Gaza City Amid Cease-Fire Calls.” While
      Trump and his national-security people press for a ceasefire in Gaza — with what
      degree of vigor we do not know — the Zionist state just ordered Palestinians to
      evacuate the Strip’s main city after not operating here for many months. So they
      seem to be going in yet again. “There has been no advancement in the ceasefire
      talks,” The Times, quoting two Israeli officials and another unnamed source, reported.


      This development has nothing and everything to do with Israel’s current posture
      toward Iran, as I interpret it. Israel has as little intention of ceasing its
      operations against Iran, now that they are finally underway, as it does to end
      its genocidal ethnic-cleansing of the Palestinians of Gaza. These aggressions
      are both fronts in what the Israelis call their “seven-front war” across West
      Asia, and we must not lose sight of this. We witness a thematically unified campaign
      of terror. There is no place in it for ceasefires, peaceful coexistence or anything
      else short of total victory.


      As in Gaza, so in the West Bank, and as in Gaza and the West Bank, so in Lebanon,
      and as in these three, so in Iran. I see no chance whatsoever that the Israelis
      consider themselves done with the Islamic Republic. Destroying the nation’s nuclear
      program, wrecking the economy and essential infrastructure, creating a state of
      political chaos, assassinating or otherwise decapitating the leadership: All this
      appears to be under discussion among Israel’s war planners.


      It is merely a matter of time before the Zionist state resumes its aggressions.
      Then there will be more questions, chief among them what the United States and
      the rest of the West will do as more barbarities unfold before the world’s eyes.

      By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News


      By actively partnering with the U.S. government to smuggle communications hardware
      into Iran, Elon Musk is once again aiding Washington’s attempts at regime change.
      This fits into a long pattern of both American efforts to dislodge the government
      in Tehran and Musk’s close collaboration with the U.S. national security state,
      helping it to achieve its objectives around the world.


      For decades, Washington has sought to overthrow the government in Tehran. Today,
      its most important ally in that effort may not be in the CIA or Pentagon, but
      in Silicon Valley.


      Elon Musk, through his Starlink satellite system, is now helping to smuggle thousands
      of communication terminals into Iran, enabling opposition networks to evade government
      restrictions and coordinate in secret. His partnership with the U.S. national
      security state has made him a central figure in one of the most ambitious regime
      change campaigns in modern times.


      Targeting Tehran


      It is no secret that Iran is in Washington’s crosshairs. And Elon Musk is aiding
      the attempt to depose the government in Tehran. In response to a post by a member
      of President Trump’s Homeland Security Advisory Council, Mark Levin, asking him
      to “put the final nail in the coffin of the Iranian regime by providing Starlink
      internet to the Iranian people,” the billionaire tech mogul recently announced
      that “the beams are on.”


      After the Israeli bombardment began, Iran’s Communication Ministry placed heavy
      restrictions on online communication. This had the effect of hampering the ability
      of American and Israeli assets inside the country from communicating.


      Starlink is an internet service allowing those with terminals to directly connect
      to thousands of SpaceX satellites in low Earth orbit. Terminals are, in effect,
      small, portable satellite dishes that can be set up anywhere and used by those
      in the near vicinity to skirt government restrictions on communication.


      This is not the first time that Musk has used Starlink to sow chaos in Iran. In
      2023, at the height of a U.S.-backed protest movement, the South African-born
      plutocrat responded to a statement to Secretary of State Antony Blinken announcing
      that the United States was taking action “to advance internet freedom and the
      free flow of information for the Iranian people…to counter the Iranian government’s
      censorship.”


      “Activating Starlink,” Musk said. A few weeks after this pronouncement, Musk revealed
      that he was helping to smuggle hundreds of Starlinks into the country. “Approaching
      100 Starlinks active in Iran,” he later noted.


      The scale of the operation has been substantial, as only 18 months later, an estimated
      20,000 clandestine Starlink devices are operating inside the country, helping
      a vast network of activists, spies, and other anti-government forces coordinate
      and communicate.


      Keeping Ukraine Fighting


      This is far from the only country where Starlink has been used to promote Washington’s
      interests.


      After Russia hit its communications grid, the U.S. government rushed thousands
      of Starlinks into Ukraine, where they provide the backbone of the country’s communications
      system. Most of the high-tech weaponry sent by NATO countries to Ukraine is useless
      without online targeting systems, and Starlink keeps the Ukrainian military in
      the field, allowing it to target Russian positions. Indeed, one official told
      The Times of London that he “must” use Starlink to target enemy forces via thermal
      imaging.


      There are an estimated 42,000 Starlinks in Ukraine, keeping their government ministries,
      hospitals, and military online. “Starlink is what changed the war in Ukraine’s
      favor. Russia went out of its way to blow up all our comms. Now they can’t. Starlink
      operates under Katyusha fire and artillery fire. It even works in Mariupol,” one
      Ukrainian soldier told journalist David Patrikarakos, referencing the deep underground
      mines where Ukrainian forces were dug in.


      The Pentagon’s Man


      As can be seen, then, Musk and his companies enjoy a very close relationship with
      the U.S. national security state. SpaceX – the manufacturer of Starlink – has
      signed a myriad of lucrative contracts with various American intelligence agencies.


      In 2021, the firm won a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance
      Office to build a network of hundreds of spy satellites. It was also chosen to
      blast a $500 million Lockheed Martin spy system into orbit, and to deliver an
      Air Force command satellite into space.


      The spying agency that has worked most intimately with Musk and SpaceX, however,
      is the Central Intelligence Agency. Midwifing the birth of SpaceX was Mike Griffin,
      then the head of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capitalist wing. In-Q-Tel identifies
      and funds cutting-edge tech firms whose technologies and products will give the
      CIA an advantage over its rivals.


      Griffin was with Musk from day one, even accompanying him to Moscow in 2002, where
      the pair attempted to kickstart SpaceX by purchasing cut-price Russian intercontinental
      ballistic missiles. Musk believed that by sourcing missiles at a lower cost from
      around the world, he could significantly undercut competitors like Lockheed Martin
      and secure defense contracts.


      The attempt failed, but the trip cemented a lifelong partnership that remains
      to this day. Griffin became Musk’s primary backer within the intelligence community,
      labelling him the “Henry Ford” of the rocket industry, and constantly promoting
      his name within the halls of power.


      Griffin would later become the head of NASA, hold a senior position at the Pentagon,
      and save SpaceX on multiple occasions from bankruptcy by handing the company gigantic
      contracts.


      Perhaps no other figure has impacted Musk’s life more than Griffin, who now serves
      as a senior advisor to Castelion, a SpaceX spin-off organization dealing with
      missile defense systems. Musk called his oldest child Griffin, and went on to
      name his subsequent child X Æ A-12, after a CIA bomber jet.


      Rocketman


      Castelion was formed in 2022 to help the Pentagon win a nuclear war. For decades,
      war planners in Washington have been determined to find a way to block foreign
      nuclear missiles from reaching the United States. To that end, they recruited
      Musk in an effort to build an enormous “American Iron Dome” of modified SpaceX
      satellites that could shoot down incoming rockets, making the United States impervious
      to attack.


      While this technology might appear defensive on the surface, it would, in effect,
      give the United States free rein to attack any nation at any time, safe in the
      knowledge that there would be no possible retaliation. The Mutually Assured Destruction
      doctrine that has held together a fragile peace since the late 1940s would be
      shattered, and the United States—the only country to use nuclear weapons against
      another nation—would be invincible.


      Internal documents have shown for decades that it is precisely and only this threat
      of consequences from Russian, Chinese, or North Korean intercontinental ballistic
      missiles that has stayed the hand of Washington.


      Musk has repeatedly downplayed the consequences of a nuclear winter, and even
      suggested firing more than 10,000 nuclear warheads at Mars, in a quixotic attempt
      to trigger a rapid greenhouse effect, warming the planet sufficiently for human
      habitation.


      Few scientists believe that the plan could work, and many have strongly denounced
      the idea. Dmitry Rogozin, then-head of the Russian state space agency Roscosmos,
      for instance, warned that Musk’s gambit was nothing more than a cover to fill
      space with thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at Russia, China, and any other
      nation drawing the U.S.’s ire.


      Overthrowing Governments Around the World


      While Iran is currently in the crosshairs, it is far from the only country Musk
      has interfered in. The tech magnate also led an attempt to overturn last year’s
      presidential elections in Venezuela, claiming that far-right opposition candidate
      Edmundo Gonzalez had won.


      Musk shared fake videos purporting to show massive election fraud, suspended the
      Twitter account of President Nicolas Maduro, and even threatened to drag the Venezuelan
      leader to the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison. Given Musk’s past statements, these
      are not taken lightly in Latin America.


      The billionaire admitted to working with the U.S. government to overthrow Bolivian
      President Evo Morales in 2019. Bolivia is home to the world’s largest easily extractable
      lithium reserves, an element crucial in the production of electric-vehicle batteries.
      Morales had refused to open the country up to foreign corporations eager to exploit
      Bolivia for profit. Instead, he proposed developing sovereign technology to keep
      both the jobs and profits inside the country.


      A U.S.-backed far-right insurrection overthrew him in November 2019. The new government
      quickly invited Musk for talks. When directly accused of his complicity, the tycoon
      stated bluntly, “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.” Inside Bolivia,
      the affair is often described as “the Lithium Coup.”


      More recently, Musk has interfered in German politics, strongly backing the far-right
      AfD Party, telling voters that they should not be ashamed of their past (i.e.,
      fascism). In Britain, Musk funds and promotes far-right racist agitator Tommy
      Robinson. And in Canada, he attempted to swing this year’s election towards the
      right-wing conservative candidate, Pierre Poilievre.


      The attempted backfired spectacularly, however, as his perceived arrogance (he
      repeatedly called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “governor”, implying Canada was
      not a sovereign nation, but the 51st state of the U.S.) rallied Canadians around
      Liberal candidate Mark Carney. It was a similar story in Wisconsin this April,
      where Musk spent tens of millions of dollars attempting (and failing) to buy an
      election.


      Nevertheless, despite his recent failures, it is doubtful that Musk has given
      up on national and international politics. Nor is it likely that this will be
      the last time that Washington openly plans for regime change in Tehran.


      Ever since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that deposed a U.S.-backed dictator,
      Iran has been a top concern for members of the American national security state.
      Thankfully for them, they can rely on help from tech CEOs such as Elon Musk, who
      appear only too happy to ally themselves with those in power to serve the agenda
      of the U.S. empire.

  - title: Will Zohran Mamdani Empower or Betray the Working Class? (w/ Kshama Sawant)

      This interview is also available on podcast platforms and Rumble.


      Zohran Mamdani’s emphatic victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary
      has shaken the core of American politics. A self-described democratic socialist,
      Mamdani ran a campaign centered around affordability as well as relentless denunciation
      of the genocide in Gaza. Mamdani drew the ire of Zionists, right-wingers and the
      billionaire class not only in New York City but across the country, including
      calls for his deportation by Congressman Andy Ogles and subsequent slander by
      President Donald Trump.


      Former Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, who is now running for Washington
      state’s 9th congressional district, weighs in on her fellow democratic socialist’s
      journey on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report.


      Sawant has been a standout figure for working class representation, winning a
      $15 an hour minimum wage in Seattle during her city council tenure as well as
      the Amazon Tax, which helped fund affordable housing. She says Mamdani’s victory
      should be celebrated, especially because it shows the Zionist lobby can be defeated
      not just in the U.S. but in a state home to the largest Jewish population outside
      of Israel.


      Despite this encouraging repudiation of the billionaire class in the wealthiest
      city in America, Sawant emphasizes the need to continue the fight and make sure
      Mamdani sticks to his original promises.


      “If you don’t understand that careerism is one of the death knells of winning
      anything substantial for the working class, then you will sell out even with those
      good intentions because you will make it about yourself and you will immediately
      get the memo that in order to fight for working people, you will need to be in
      battle mode every single day when you enter City Hall,” she says.


      Mamdani’s alignment with the Democratic Party is concerning, according to Sawant,
      pointing to a pattern in which groundbreaking campaigns, like those of Alexandria
      Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, have fallen short of delivering promises for
      working class people once in office.


      “At the end of the day, the Democratic Party is a party of capitalism itself,”
      Sawant asserts. “The working class loses out more and more and is subjected to
      more and more misery with every passing decade that you’re not going to stand
      up for working people.”


      So far, Mamdani’s campaign has made strides to inspire the American working class.
      “It’s a real boost of confidence for working class people nationally to see that
      yes, working people will fight alongside you if you put forward demands that make
      a huge difference in their lives and which reflect their anger, their just anger
      at the Wall Street billionaires,” Sawant says.

      Transcript


      Chris Hedges


      Hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman, enraged by Zohran Mamdani’s securing an overwhelming
      majority to become the Democratic Party’s nominee to run for mayor of New York
      City, said he and his wealthy associates will pour “hundreds of millions of dollars”
      into the candidacy of anyone willing to run against Mamdani in the general election.
      Ackman, who supports Donald Trump, added that he has an unnamed candidate he is
      ready to bankroll.


      Major Democratic donors — who poured tens of millions of dollars into a Super
      PAC to support former governor Andrew Cuomo in his run for mayor — are also meeting
      to decide if they will fund an independent run by Cuomo in November, or back the
      unpopular incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent.


      Mamdani’s grassroots campaign – Cuomo’s campaign outspent him 20 to 1 – centered
      around raising the minimum wage, tax hikes on businesses and the rich, creating
      city-owned grocery stores, making city bus service free and imposing a rent freeze
      for stabilized tenants.


      The victory by the self-described Democratic socialist, who was mercilessly smeared
      for his denunciation of the genocide in Gaza and promise to honor the arrest warrant
      issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he appeared in New York
      City, has sent shock waves through the ruling billionaire class and the Democratic
      Party establishment that supported Cuomo. While Mamdani was endorsed by Alexandria
      Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez who serve in the state’s congressional delegation,
      as well as Bernie Sanders, they were the singular exceptions. The hierarchy of
      the party has either remained silent since Mamdani’s victory or been openly antagonistic.


      New York Senator Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leaders of
      the Senate and the House, refuse to back Mamdani’s candidacy. New York Rep. Laura
      Gillen, speaking for many in the party, called Mamdani the “absolute wrong choice
      for New York.”


      Democrats, along with their major donors, can be counted on to attempt to sabotage
      Mamdani’s campaign, just as it did the campaign of Bernie Sanders when he sought
      the presidential nomination. It remains, it seems, impervious to reform.


      What does this election portend? What does it mean for the future of the Democratic
      Party? Is Mamdani’s victory a sign that there are growing cracks in the edifice
      of the party? Or will it drive the party further to the right and see it destroy
      the candidacies of those who seek to address the domination of our political system
      by the billionaire class and the punishing social inequality?


      Joining me to discuss Mamdani’s victory and what it portends, as well as her own
      campaign to be elected as a democratic socialist to Congress in Washington state,
      is Kshama Sawant. Kshama is a leader for Workers Strike Back and Revolutionary
      Workers. And as a city council member, she battled against the established Democratic
      Party leadership and the city’s oligarchs who poured millions into campaigns to
      defeat her including an unsuccessful effort to oust her in a recall vote. Amazon
      alone spent over $3 million to defeat her run for office in 2019.


      Sawant helped lead the fight in 2014 that made Seattle the first major American
      city to mandate a $15 dollar an hour minimum wage. Following a three-year struggle
      against one of the richest men in the world – Jeff Bezos – and his political establishment,
      she and her allies pushed through a tax on big business that increased city revenues
      by an estimated $210 to $240 million a year.


      She was part of the movement that led to Seattle’s successful ban on school-year
      evictions of schoolchildren, their families and school employees. She was one
      of sponsors of a bill that protects tenants from being evicted at the end of their
      “term leases,” requiring landlords to provide tenants with the right to renew
      their leases and prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants for non-payment of
      rent if the rent was due during the COVID civil emergency and the renter could
      not pay due to financial hardship. You can find her at KshamaSawant.org.


      Okay, so let’s begin with Mamdani’s victory, what you think it means, and the
      Democratic Party’s response. And I just want to add, you yourself, when you were
      on the city council, spent most of your time battling the Democratic Party establishment,
      or much of the time.


      Kshama Sawant


      All the time, actually. The Democrats on the city council here in Seattle opposed
      every single progressive measure that my office fought for. But yeah, Mamdani’s
      primary election victory in the Democratic Party in New York City for the mayoral
      election is first and foremost a stinging rebuke of the Zionist lobby.


      It shows that it is possible to defeat the Zionist lobby and it is possible to
      win. In fact, you mentioned in your introduction that I’m running for Congress
      right now against, and I’m running against this genocidal warmongering Democrat,
      Adam Smith, who has voted for the genocide repeatedly to send tens of billions
      of dollars to the Israeli state for the genocide. He also voted for the war in
      Iraq back in 2002, and he also voted to create ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].


      And he was bankrolled by the Zionist lobby. In last year’s election, AIPAC was
      his top contributor. He’s also backed by dystopian corporations like Palantir,
      which profit from war and mass slaughter. And so this primary victory of Mamdani
      actually has injected huge confidence in the thousands of people who are supporting
      our campaign here.


      So many people have messaged me personally saying, I’m so excited about this victory
      because it shows that you can defeat the Zionist lobby. So I think, first and
      foremost, we have to recognize what a huge victory that is. It’s also, given how
      relentlessly Mamdani has campaigned using his working class demands, it’s also
      a real boost of confidence for working class people nationally to see that yes,
      working people will fight alongside you if you put forward demands that make a
      huge difference in their lives and which reflect their anger, their just anger
      at the Wall Street billionaires.


      I mean, Mamdani’s campaign has called for a $30 an hour minimum wage, for a rent
      freeze, for free transit, for fully funded childcare. And so these are things
      that working people need. And so if a campaign can succeed on that basis, it shows
      that working people are willing to push forward on those demands.


      And it’s also, I have to say, a resounding rebuke to the union leaders, not the
      rank and file, but the union leaders who endorsed Cuomo in the primary. I mean,
      can you imagine what kind of union leader do you have to be to endorse somebody
      who’s so discredited that he’s even too much of a hot potato for most of the Democrats
      to maintain their own credibility? They don’t want to touch him because he has
      15,000 COVID deaths on his hands.


      He has all kinds of other corruption charges. He also has been accused by at least
      a dozen, probably 13 women of sexual harassment. And so it’s just mind boggling,
      although not surprising. It’s just incredible that the leaders of UFCW [United
      Food and Commercial Workers], of RWDSU [Retail, Wholesale and Department Store
      Union], of the Teamsters, of SEIU [Service Employees International Union], all
      these major unions, the Carpenters, all of them supporting Cuomo.


      So I think they have really been put to shame. And it is important to see that,
      for example, SEIU leaders have already now said they’re endorsing Mamdani. But
      it really exposes the unholy ties of the labor leadership with the Democratic
      establishment. And so I think the question is not, is this a real confirmation
      of the kind of political demands we need to put forward and that the opposition
      to the genocide and the demand to end the genocide, should that be front and center
      of election campaigns in the coming year?


      No, that’s not the question. This has shown that it actually, that’s exactly what
      we should be doing. The outstanding question here is what will it take to win
      any of these demands? And that’s where I think we have to conduct a lot of examination.
      I mean, I think the experience that we had on the Seattle City Council, we, my
      fellow socialists and we, I had the city council office for a decade in Seattle.


      And what it took for us to win the historic victories, many of which you enumerated,
      it took what I would call a fighting strategy. And what does a fighting strategy
      mean? A fighting strategy, first and foremost, means that you understand that
      capitalism is a zero-sum game and that you cannot hope to win any substantial
      victories. I’m not talking about crumbs, but substantial reforms in the interest
      of the working class by thinking that you are going to sweet talk the billionaires
      into agreement with you.


      It also requires understanding that the Democrats and Republicans, despite their
      differences, they both represent the interests of the billionaires of capitalism.
      And so you’re not going to sweet talk them either. And you don’t go into the halls
      of office by thinking that they are your colleagues and that you’re going to have
      good conversations with them and reach some sort of agreement with them. No, you
      have to understand that this is posed as an adversarial task by definition. Working
      people didn’t make it adversarial, capitalism is adversarial towards the working
      class. The only question is, are we gonna fight back or are we going to roll over
      and die?


      And so, again and again and again, what we saw in Seattle was a Democratic Party
      carrying water for the big business entities, for big corporations like Amazon
      and Starbucks, for the Chamber of Commerce, for corporate landlords. And for us
      to win any of these victories that we won, I, first and foremost, had to be clear,
      and all working people alongside me had to be clear that this is class war and
      that the way we win is by using my office to build mass movements and mass movements
      not just to come to city hall and beg the Democrats to do the right thing, but
      mass movements that are defiant in character, that demand that unless you do this,
      we are going to vote you out of office. We’re going to throw you out of office.


      So that adversarial character is fundamental to winning something big. Like, for
      example, the victory that we won on minimum wage, that is the highest wage in
      the nation because part of the battle we waged when we fought for $15 an hour
      was to win inflation increases. The Democrats fought us viciously on that. We
      were still able to prevail. Why? Because I launched the 15 Now Movement in Seattle
      and it mobilized Seattle’s working class in the thousands and so many of them
      were involved in our action conferences.


      It was a democratically organized movement where the rank and file of the movement
      had the say in strategic decisions. We literally had debates and voting. It took
      that strength of the mass of the working class to win not only the nation’s first
      $15 an hour minimum wage, but also inflation increases. And that’s why today Seattle’s
      minimum wage is the highest in the nation at $20.76. So I would just say that
      for the working class to win in New York City will take this similar approach.


      The question is not can Mamdani win through a strategy of playing nice with the
      billionaires? No, that’s not the question because you can’t win that way. All
      of history shows that. The question is, will he do what we did in Seattle, in
      order to win similar victories in New York City?


      Chris Hedges


      Well, that is a break with you. I mean, there’s one strong similarity between
      the campaigns that you ran and the campaigns that he ran. And that is that you
      appealed to disaffected voters on the right or people who just didn’t vote at
      all on these basic economic issues. I find that a kind of parallel.


      But I think the difference, which you just enunciated, is that you always took
      an adversarial position and he has talked about making New York a wonderful place
      for everybody, including billionaires. And I think you’re saying that’s a big
      mistake.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, because in a deeply divided situation like capitalism is, you cannot lose
      sight of the fact of, as I said earlier, that capitalism is a zero sum game. What
      does that mean? It means that when we won the $15 minimum wage, for example, and
      now that it’s gone even higher because of inflation increases being built into
      it, that money is making the lives of the least paid workers, the poorest of the
      working class, much better because even a few dollars extra an hour makes a life
      difference.


      It makes the difference between being able to pay your rent or being evicted and
      then being forced to couch surf again and again, which many families, in fact,
      even families with children are forced to do. But that money comes from the profits
      of the billionaires, the big business entities, the multimillionaires.


      And so it is inevitable that if you fight for something substantial, like a major
      increase in minimum wage, that will create a political clash with big businesses.
      And that’s it’s no surprise that, what’s his name, Bill Ackman, the Trump supporting
      billionaire who is apoplectic about Mamdani’s primary victory, that’s no surprise.
      That is him representing the interests of the billionaire class.


      And so the working class cannot afford to blur the class lines. When I was asked
      repeatedly by reporters, you speak so combatively, but as an elected official,
      aren’t you running to represent all your constituents? They’d asked me that repeatedly.
      You would never catch me saying that I am representing everyone.


      In fact, I reminded them, you know, one of the constituents of my Seattle city
      council district when I was on the city council for 10 years was, and it still
      is, I assume, the billionaire former CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, extremely
      anti-worker, absolutely viciously anti-union, union-busting CEO billionaire. And
      I said, Howard Schultz lives in my district. I don’t represent him and he doesn’t
      agree with me.


      I mean, these are class lines and blurring the lines does not help the working
      class. It actually helps the ruling class. I mean, it sort of signals to the ruling,
      if you say that you’re going to represent everyone, it signals to the ruling class
      that you’re open for conversation. You’re open to discussion with them. And that
      discussion means only one thing, which is that they will push you, put pressure
      on you, and they will use the carrot and the stick to put pressure on you to sell
      out.


      And I’ve experienced all of that. When I first entered City Hall, I’ve experienced
      both the carrot and the stick. There were city council members and also others
      in the Democratic Party who tried to flatter me, make this about me. They said
      things like, well, you are such a superstar, but you need to dissociate yourself
      from this socialist ideology because that’s not going to be good for your political
      career.


      Therein lies the problem, is that no matter how well intentioned you are, and
      let’s assume that new people are well intentioned, no matter how well intentioned
      you are, if you don’t understand that careerism is one of the death knells of
      winning anything substantial for the working class, then you will sell out even
      with those good intentions because you will make it about yourself and you will
      immediately get the memo that in order to fight for working people, you will need
      to be in battle mode every single day when you enter City Hall or the halls of
      Congress because the only other option is for you to sell out because there’s
      no option that you will convince them into agreeing with you.


      Why? Because at the end of the day, the Democratic Party is a party of capitalism
      itself. And yes, there are differences with the Republican Party, but it’s like
      Chomsky said, that there’s a smart way to keep people passive and obedient, and
      that is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively
      debate within that spectrum.


      And so what that means is that in the case of the Democratic and Republican parties
      is that, there are differences between them, but if you don’t understand that
      they both represent the billionaire class and they’re there and their differences
      are there so that the working class can perennially be dangled this, you know,
      you either support Democrats or Republicans. But at end of the day the working
      class loses out more and more and is subjected to more and more misery with every
      passing decade that you’re not going to stand up for working people.


      Chris Hedges


      I think also the mistake is that you complicate this, the billionaire class, which
      Mamdani seems, at least rhetorically, to be saying he can do.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, and in fact, he’s saying that in many concrete ways. For example, in his
      recent MSNBC interview, I think it was just today or yesterday, they played a
      clip of, you know he’s been calling for taxes on the rich, which of course, I
      strongly support. I strongly support all the demands that he’s running on in terms
      of the minimum wage increase, rent freeze, and taxes on the rich, and child care
      funding, and all of that.


      They played a clip of Governor Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, very clearly
      saying she’s not going to be for taxing the rich. She’s very clearly declaring
      that that is absolutely not something that she wants to do. But his response to
      that was again, along those lines of I’m excited to work with her on this. What
      does that mean? I don’t understand what that means.


      I mean, you have to use your interview appearances to speak not to that MSNBC
      journalist who is representing the ruling class line or Governor Kathy Hochul,
      who is an arch-corporate Democrat. She represents a billionaire class. Your interview
      appearances, if you’re a socialist and fighting for working people, has to be
      to speak to the working class audience that’s not in front of you, but millions
      who are watching out there. And your message needs to be, first of all, truthful.


      And being truthful means you cannot send an illusion to the working class that
      somehow Kathy Hochul can be talked into taxing the rich, somehow Bill Ackman can
      be convinced that rent freezes are also in his interest. It will improve his quality
      of life as well. It’s something that Mamdani has said as well, that, if we do
      these progressive things, it will improve the quality of life not only of working
      people, but also of the billionaires.


      That’s simply not true in the sense that the billionaires don’t want to part with
      the billions of dollars that they have. I mean, the $15 minimum wage that we won,
      that meant $3 billion of profits from big business taken away to fund workers.
      And you have to declare that proudly in the sense that you don’t represent the
      billionaire class. As much wealth you can take from them, that’s a good thing.
      That’s a moral thing. That is a just thing. And that is an honorable thing to
      fight for.


      And it is actually disarming working class movements to send them, as I said,
      an illusion that somehow the class lines can be blurred, that somehow you can
      make agreement with the ruling class. And I think that if we want, if Mamdani
      wants to, I don’t know that he doesn’t, I’ll talk about his previous record, but
      if he does want to build movements, and you know, I absolutely want him to do
      it. I absolutely want him to build the movements, and if he’s going to build the
      movements after he’s elected, if he’s elected, I will personally be there wanting
      to rally with him.


      I will personally help the movement to win a $30 minimum wage in New York City
      because if they win, that would be an Earth shattering victory. It would be an
      enormous call to action nationally and it would put a lot of pressure on the Democratic
      Party to push for a $25 an hour minimum wage federally. All of that would be a
      fantastic thing. And like I said, I am pledging here and now that I will be right
      there in New York City pounding the pavement to win any of these victories.


      The question is, will he do what is needed in order to actually win this? And
      in terms of his previous record, the reason I’m expressing skepticism is not that
      I don’t want him to do it. As I said, I really hope that he does it. But it’s
      also my responsibility, I am also representing working people. And it is my obligation,
      my political and moral obligation, to use my platform to speak the truth. Again,
      not to send out illusions, but speak the truth.


      And even if not everybody agrees with me at this moment. But if you look at the
      record that Mamdani has, Mamdani is not new to politics. He won his first state
      assembly, New York state assembly election in 2020. And he has been on the New
      York state legislature for four years and in fact since that time the New York
      DSA which he’s part of, the Democratic Socialist of America, they’ve had eight
      elected officials in the New York state legislature and they have certainly won
      some things but to be honest whatever they have won is far far from commensurate
      to having eight elected positions.


      I mean can you imagine what we would do with eight elected positions? To imagine
      that, look at what we did with one elected position. You know, we, like I said,
      we experienced both the carrot and the stick. So I experienced a lot of flattery,
      but I also experienced a stick. And the stick never goes away. Once the ruling
      class and their parties, the Democrats and Republicans, are clear that you are
      not going to be bought, that you are not going to sell out, then come all the
      vicious attacks, which never relent.


      And so for working people to succeed, we need leadership. And it’s not just about
      elected representatives. It’s also in city hall or Congress. It’s also elected
      leaders in the labor movement, unelected leaders in social movements. We need
      leadership in all of these avenues that are clear that that is what it takes,
      that in order to win for working people, it takes you as the leader to take those
      body blows.


      Because if you don’t, then you’re selling out working class people. That’s what
      you owe. It’s your duty and you should consider it your honor. It’s an honor to
      be able to play this role. But as far as what the New York DSA did in the several
      years that they have had positions, they have not won any victories commensurate
      with having eight elected positions.


      And in fact, it’s really telling that Mamdani himself, he had his two re-elections.
      He was first elected in 2020, then he had his re-elections in 2022, and then last
      year, 2024. And he ran unopposed both years, which means neither the Democrats
      contested him in the primaries, nor did the Republicans run any candidate against
      him in the general election.


      Such a thing does not happen if you are fighting for working class people. Because
      if you are fighting for working class people, you are going to become enemy number
      one to the Democrats and Republicans. There is absolutely no universe where you
      will not have a fight on your hands and let alone run unopposed.


      I mean, in our case, I won all of my four elections on the city council, but every
      subsequent election, the ruling class, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, corporate landlords,
      the Democratic Party, they fought more viciously than they did against me in the
      previous election. In 2019, the most prominent progressive, quote unquote, progressive
      Democrats, they, Latina women, progressive Democrats, they ran, openly ran a candidate
      against me saying, Oh, we agree with her, but she’s just not nice. We need a nice
      guy or whatever. And we defeated them. We defeated Amazon that year.


      And then again, in 2021, my last election, that was not even a scheduled election.
      It was a recall attempt against me by corporate landlords, by Trumpian billionaires,
      and the Democratic Party, and we defeated them also. So it doesn’t reveal everything,
      but it is a rule of thumb. It’s a barometer.


      If your every subsequent election is not a bigger fight than before, then you
      haven’t become a threat to the ruling class. And if you haven’t become a threat
      to the ruling class, then you’re not winning for the working class. You may be
      winning your own elections, but not for the working class.


      Chris Hedges


      Well, they’re clearly going to go after him. I mean, look what they did to you
      as a city council member. He’s running for the mayor of New York [City]. And I
      want to talk about maybe the three entities that will try and take him down. Let’s
      begin first with the Zionists. They aren’t going to take this lightly. He has
      been very courageous about standing with the Palestinians.


      Then let’s talk about the Democratic Party and then let’s talk about the billionaire
      class. These are formidable opponents and the money that will pour into any campaign
      to bring him down will be staggering. It already was, I mean, I think Como got
      $22 million or $25 million. I think Mamdani raised about a million. But those
      numbers will, in terms of funding opposition, will jump exponentially.


      Let’s first start with the Zionists because I did see his victory as essentially
      puncturing that monolithic, especially in New York City, that monolithic power
      that the Zionists have.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, absolutely. I mean, this is a devastating blow actually to the Zionist lobby.
      And the specific thing, I like the choice of words that you said, you said puncturing.
      I think that is an important thing to note because for a long time, it has seemed
      to everyone that it is impossible to defeat the Zionist lobby. We saw what happened
      with Jamaal Bowman, where it was in the Democratic primary that the Zionist lobby
      and AIPAC specifically, poured just unprecedented millions and millions of dollars
      to defeat him.


      And there’s been this idea, they’ve sort of fueled this idea that the Zionist
      lobby and AIPAC and other organizations like that, that they are impervious to
      any opposition from the anti-war movement and that you just have to accept it.
      You just have to accept it. And especially in the Democratic and Republican parties,
      I mean, obviously the Republican party is openly anti-worker, pro-war, they don’t
      even make any bones about it.


      The main challenge as far as working class consciousness is concerned is exposing
      what the Democratic party actually stands for. And the Democratic party is much
      more exposed now than it was before. I mean, the approval ratings are in the toilet.
      The genocide started under Biden. You know, this was a genocidal president with
      a genocidal vice president. So both the candidates in the Democratic primary last
      year were, or from the Democratic party were genocidal candidates running against
      Trump, who’s also warmongering and genocidal.


      So that was the choice, false choice between genocidal and genocidal. That’s the
      kind of realm that we have been operating in. We also saw AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]
      go to the DNC floor and lie through her teeth saying that Kamala Harris was working
      tirelessly for a ceasefire, which we know is complete fabrication.


      Chris Hedges


      I just want to interrupt you when you talked about the disease of careerism. She’s
      kind of the poster child.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, AOC is a poster child for careerism that’s absolutely accurate and that is
      why it is important for us to talk about, you know, have a serious conversation
      about what will it take to win any of these victories in New York City, let alone
      ending the genocide, which is a far harder thing to do.


      Ending the genocide will take ending all US military funding to the Israeli state,
      which if you think about that demand, this is the demand that we are calling for
      in our congressional campaign, that demand pits you directly, directly against
      all of US and Western imperialism. I mean, these are powerful, powerful dystopian
      forces.


      It pits you against multi-billionaires like [Palantir CEO] Alexander Karp, who,
      if you’ve heard him speak, they delight, they positively delight in the mass slaughter
      of Palestinians. I mean, this is happening at another level. In fact, what’s happening
      right now in the Israeli state is at another level.


      So there is a feeling that, for ordinary people, I’m against a genocide, but I
      don’t know what to do because these are just too powerful of an entities, group
      of entities to go up against. So I think that puncturing that idea has been crucial.
      And then I think in order to actually push forward on these demands, then it is
      going to be really that’s where the rubber hits the road, so to say.


      Because from now until the general election of the mayoral election, it’s a question,
      which way will Mamdani move? And I would say that, you know, one thing he has
      going for him is that the Republican opponent is really weak from what I understand.
      Curtis Sliwa, I mean, he’s not like, he’s some credible opponent.


      Chris Hedges


      No, he’s not a credible opponent. They’ll fund Adams, they’ll fund Cuomo, or Ackman
      says he has an unnamed candidate he wants to fund, although, I wonder if an Ackman
      puppet is going to do particularly well. I don’t know.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yeah, I mean, of course, in war and elections, it is foolish to say the last word
      on predictions, as you and I both know. However, I think it is important to note
      that one thing that Mamdani has going for him is that both these Democratic Party
      [candidates] are now, they’re going to run as not Democrats, as whatever, something
      else.


      But regardless, Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, both figures of the Democratic Party
      are so deeply discredited that the chances for Mamdani to actually win are pretty
      strong. The question will be what he does between now and the general election.
      If he not only does not relent on his demands, which he doesn’t seem to be doing,
      I mean, even now he’s relentlessly going for his demands, which is actually a
      very positive thing that I really appreciate that he is making, he’s not shying
      away from the demands for even a second. And he is relentless about them.


      So he needs to keep doing that but in addition to that, I think he needs to, which
      I don’t expect that he will, but I’m just saying what he needs to do in order
      to win, not so much to win the election. That’s my point. I’m trying to disentangle
      the question between winning the election for himself and winning the demands
      that he’s running on.


      Those are two separate questions to some degree because there’s just a favorable
      electoral calculus right now that he’s facing where he could possibly win even
      if he started sliding on his demands, maybe, I don’t know. But it’s certainly
      not the kind of difficult situation that we were facing. But as far as setting
      the stage, as far as using his election campaign for setting the stage to win
      any of these demands, that’s the most paramount question.


      And for that, I’m strongly convinced that he needs to move away from this talking
      point of Oh, billionaires will also love a city with a rent freeze and I’m looking
      forward to working with Kathy Hochul. Moving away from that to saying, look, the
      Democratic Party establishment itself, the Democratic Party itself is opposed
      to the things that I’m calling for. And that’s why I need working people to join
      me, rather than continually bringing up this idea that it’s all about discussions
      and meetings with the powers that be, and I’ll talk to the governor, and I’ll
      talk to the billionaire.


      All this emphasis on the halls of power, instead his talking point should be,
      and we’re calling for a rally on such and such date. I want working people to
      show up. I want Black, white, Latino, Asian, all of you to show up because working
      class people need to fight together. Let’s call for a march for $30 an hour. Let’s
      march around city hall, know, that type of thing, or march outside Bill Ackman’s
      house, I mean, presumably he lives somewhere in Manhattan, something like that.
      March outside Trump Tower. Let’s call big rallies again in Trump Tower.


      And it’s not only that, it’s also for him to say openly, you know, Governor Kathy
      Hochul, she’s selling out workers. She said she does not want any taxes on the
      rich. Do you agree? You know, telling working people, don’t put any faith in Kathy
      Hochul. Don’t put any faith in any of these Democrats.


      Chuck Schumer, he has blood on his hands. Chuck Schumer has blood on his hands.
      Hakeem Jeffries has blood on his hands. Ritchie Torres has blood on his hands.
      That’s the kind of language, I mean, we don’t use this language as Marxists incidentally
      just because, Oh emotions are running high. It’s not like that. It’s about clarifying
      to the working class what is the character of capitalism and its warmongering
      representatives, warmongering anti-worker, anti-union representatives and how
      do you fight against them.


      Those are two very key tasks for revolutionaries. And I think that’s a difference
      between how most what I would call reformist candidates or reformist leaders act
      and how a revolutionary socialist like myself acts where we start by clarifying
      the nature of capitalism itself that is part of revolutionary politics. But ironically,
      Chris, revolutionary politics also makes you the best fighter to win the biggest
      possible reforms because once you understand the class nature of capitalism and
      you understand how working people need to be mobilized, that is what empowers
      your side to go up against all of these forces.


      And that’s what will be needed. For example, like you said, we started with the
      Zionists. You correctly said the Zionists are not going to rest on this. They’re
      not going to say, we give up, he won the primary. No, they’re going to do everything
      in their power to try and defeat him. It’s important that he doesn’t waffle on
      the things that he has already said, Mamdani, and also he needs to go much farther
      along the lines of whatever’s saying.


      Chris Hedges


      Well, he needs to take a lesson from Jeremy Corbyn. These are not people who,
      number one, can be placated or, number two, will not, no matter what you say,
      viciously attempt to bring you down. I want you to talk about what he can expect.
      You experienced constant campaigns to deceit you from the city council.


      He’s running for a much more powerful position. What can he expect from the Zionists?
      What can he expect from the Democratic Party hierarchy and what can you expect
      from the billionaire class? They’ve already announced war, in essence.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, they have declared war against him, and that is why he needs to declare war
      back at them, not try to hug them to death. Part of what we experienced here was
      obviously, if you look at the talking points that big business had against our
      15 Now movement and against the Amazon tax movement, which also you mentioned,
      which raises hundreds of millions of dollars every year for affordable housing,
      including a specific chunk of that money reserved for Black working class and
      poor housing in this historically black neighborhood, which I live in actually,
      which has been denuded of its Black population because of the skyrocketing rents.


      One of the things that they did to discredit all of these demands was to just
      pound the working class on network TV with all kinds of economic falsehoods like,
      like this is just going to be economic apocalypse, you know, $15 an hour will
      shut down all businesses, all of that. So I think the first thing we had to do
      to combat that was relentless political education about how all of this is absolutely
      false.


      What we said was two things. One is we said that all of the studies on minimum
      wage increases have shown and even big minimum wage increases have shown is that
      there’s no business that has actually been shut down because of that. Small businesses
      shut down because of other reasons, the pattern reason being that commercial rent
      is so high that most storefront businesses can’t afford in big cities like Seattle
      and New York City.


      But we also said that if indeed that were true, if indeed they were right, that
      the system is so fragile that by lifting 100,000 workers in Seattle out of poverty,
      just lifting them above, it’s nothing lavish, it’s lifting them above absolute
      dire conditions, is going to collapse the system, then why on Earth are we even
      defending the system in the first place? See, that’s how we posed it. And that
      really helped people understand that, one, that they are completely lying to you,
      but also secondly, even if they weren’t, we still need to fight for better conditions
      because why on Earth are we defending a system that can’t let us have even a modicum
      of dignity in our living standards?


      I mean, that’s part of what they will face. The other thing that will come very
      likely is the kind of red baiting and identity politics that we experienced here.
      So a very, very important example of this is when we were fighting for the Amazon
      tax. We launched the Tax Amazon movement alongside my inauguration after my 2019
      reelection. And it was really important strategic timing because like I said before,
      the 2019 election was a complete pushback against Jeff Bezos and Amazon because
      Amazon specifically and very openly spent millions of dollars trying to defeat
      me and also other progressives, but mainly me because they knew our office was
      the driving force of the whole left wing and working class political agenda.


      And they knew that if I was out, the Democrats wouldn’t do crap for the working
      class. And so in 2020, January, when I was being inaugurated, I turned my inauguration
      into the launch of the Tax Amazon movement. And then you remember that was 2020.
      So a few months later, COVID happened, and then the George Floyd rebellion began.
      At that time, the Democratic Party unleashed this whole group of Black what I
      would call misleaders, Black misleaders, to go around at these protests saying,
      you should not support Kshama Sawant, you should not support the Amazon tax because
      that’s not a Black issue.


      They tried to disrupt many of the rallies that we were holding in solidarity with
      the Black Lives Matter movement saying, you should be talking about Black issues
      and furthermore, you’re not Black so you don’t get to have this platform. And
      we refused to accept that gatekeeping.


      There were many other leaders in who were supporting the tax Amazon movement,
      who immediately barked at that and said, we should not even have our table here
      at this protest because we’re just white allies, we don’t have the right to speak,
      only Black people have the right to speak.


      We absolutely refused to bend to this just corrosiveness of identity politics.
      And we insisted on looking at things from a class lens. And we said that actually,
      these Black misleaders should be utterly ashamed of themselves because by obstructing
      the tax Amazon movement, they are actually hostile to the interests of Black working
      class and poor people because if there’s anybody who needs affordable housing
      the most, it is the Black working class. And the Amazon tax has disproportionately
      benefited the Black working class and poor people.


      So rather than accepting their just destructive gatekeeping, we said, we’re going
      to go directly to Black working people at the protest. And it was phenomenal.
      The support we got for the Amazon tax demand was sky high. The clipboards were
      practically flying out of our hands with people saying, fuck yeah, I want to tax
      Amazon. I’m going to sign that. And it’s hundreds, thousands of people showing
      up to our democratically organized Tax Amazon action conferences. That is what
      put pressure on the Democratic party.


      You know, first they were vicious towards it. And then I suddenly started getting
      friendly phone calls from these progressive Latina Democrats saying you know that
      thing you were talking about you know I’m very interested in that and then we
      won. That is what it takes. I think that in terms of how it plays out in New York
      City, I think it will very much depend on what kind of approach Mamdani takes.
      I mean how much they attack his demands will depend on how much he’s willing to
      fight for it and being willing to fight for it means mobilizing working class
      people. So I think that will be crucial.


      Chris Hedges


      What does this mean in the age of Trump? Trump, of course, immediately went after
      him. I think you and I, for many, many years, have argued that a party or a political
      movement that is focused on social inequality and the betrayal of the working
      class by the Democratic Party could succeed. Is this the rise of a kind of counterweight
      to Trumpian authoritarianism and proto-fascism or not?


      Kshama Sawant


      I think the, and as you said, you alluded to our past discussions, we’ve talked
      about what it will take to defeat Trumpism and right-wing populism, and it’s not
      only Trump, it’s the Trumpism phenomenon. And it will take working class solidarity
      around class-based demands to defeat the ideas of the right-wing, and it will
      take us to recognizing where the origin of any traction, any credence to right-wing
      ideas.


      And that comes from the complete failure of and betrayals by the Democratic Party.
      But it’s not only the Democratic Party. We have to talk about the labor leadership
      as well, which has betrayed the interests of the working class, obviously their
      own members, by being tied at the hip to the Democratic Party, even in the face
      of a genocide. That needs to be mentioned as well.


      The question is if genocide is not a line you’re not willing to cross as a working-class
      leader, then there is no line you’re not willing to cross as a working-class leader.
      I think that point needs to be made. So many of these unions, their leaderships
      have passed ceasefire resolutions, but those ceasefire resolutions mean little
      if then the leaderships turn around and support the parties of genocide themselves.


      I mean, Shawn Fain famously went on the DNC floor, Shawn Fain being the president
      of UAW [United Auto Workers], which is one of the unions that has supported Mamdani
      to its credit and also has passed a ceasefire resolution. But at the end of the
      day, how much does that amount to if you’re then turning around and still supporting
      the candidates and the parties of genocide? And I think that it is also revealing
      who Mamdani holds as his role models. I think you talked about how AOC is the
      poster child for careerism. I think that’s very important to note because, and
      Bernie Sanders was not exactly like her, I think he’s well-intentioned, it’s just
      his political analysis is extremely flawed.


      And he thinks that now completely capitulating to the Democratic Party and to
      the genocide and to attacks on workers like the Democrats blocking and breaking
      the railroad workers strike in 2022, which AOC was part of, that that’s the best
      that the working class can get.


      But regardless of their individual differences, the truth about AOC and Bernie
      Sanders is that both of them have campaigned, I mean, Bernie Sanders much more
      relentlessly, but AOC did initially campaign on Medicare for All, $15 an hour
      minimum wage and a Green New Deal.


      And like I said, I commend Mamdani for being relentless about those demands. But
      Bernie Sanders has also been relentless about those demands. He still is talking
      about, I mean, he’s less relentless than before because he doesn’t want to embarrass
      the Democrats, which is itself rotten. However, the point is that they both have
      campaigned on these demands. And not a thing, not a thing has been won for the
      working class.


      The metric cannot be, are they talking about those demands? The metric has to
      be, what have they won? In the last five, six years, what have they done? And
      what has happened to working class agendas in that interim? Bernie Sanders’ two
      campaigns were completely destroyed by the Democratic Party.


      And last year, the Democratic Party showed that they would much rather allow somebody
      who they call a fascist and an existential threat, allow that person to be elected
      than allow even a shadow of working-class agenda to enter their purview. Like
      they did not even want Kamala Harris to even lie. I mean just fucking lie that
      okay I’m going to do something about the genocide or maybe I’ll talk about 15
      [dollars minimum wage]. If she had done a little bit of murmuring towards the
      working class and she would have tipped the scales very likely. They were not
      even willing to do that. Why?


      Because they don’t want to create expectations among working class people that
      they will do anything at all for them. Because they want to hold the line. They
      are the billionaire class representatives, just like the Republicans are. And
      they don’t want to create any such idea that, Oh, the working class can expect
      anything from them. So what they want to do is they want the working class to
      be permanently attached to them and keep voting them in.


      But they want to do it on the basis of not doing anything for the working class.
      And that contradiction, that conundrum is what has led them to this sorry state
      where they have the lowest approval ratings historically. But at the same time,
      if we don’t provide an alternative to them, then they’re probably going to make
      gains in the midterm elections because people are also angry at Trump. And Trump
      is no alternative either.


      And so for defeating the right wing, we will need a break from the Democratic
      Party. And that might sound like a contradiction in terms of that. That’s precisely
      what we need because it is the Democratic Party that has given you Donald Trump.
      The Democratic Party are the best builders of Trumpism. And in order to destroy
      Trumpism, you need to destroy the Democratic Party. And that comes first with
      breaking your ties with the Democratic Party.


      And here’s what I have to say whom Mamdani has listed as his role models is a
      very telling story to me. Mamdani has said that he is very inspired by, I mean,
      I’m not quoting him. I’m paraphrasing what he said. He’s very inspired by Boston
      governor Michelle Wu. Michelle Wu ran on housing demands. She also brought them
      up relentlessly. She talked about rent control relentlessly. What has she done
      after she got into office? Completely betray working class renters. I mean, just
      completely.


      He has also said that former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was the best in
      his, Mamdani’s, lifetime. You know what? Among other attacks on unions and workers,
      Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo together in 2018 upheld the Taylor Law
      of New York, which has a draconian strike ban on public sector unions. According
      to an article in DSA-aligned publication, Jacobin, this New York strike ban, this
      is a quote, makes red state anti-strike laws look like pieces of fluff.


      And keep in mind, 2018 was the year of the historic public school teacher strikes
      in red states, starting with West Virginia. The Jacobin article also says, the
      next time a new Republican governor works up the nerve to enforce anti-strike
      laws against public workers, they’ll have the satisfaction of piggybacking on
      those Democratic friends of labor — Cuomo and de Blasio.


      So, I mean, so he has stated AOC, Bernie Sanders, Michelle Wu, and de Blasio all
      as his inspirations, and they all have a record of selling out working class people.
      One last thing that he has said, he has also repeatedly cited and effusively praised
      former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a Republican mayor who
      was supported at the time in 1941, during the war, he was running for reelection
      and he was supported by the rotten Stalinists.


      And they supported him against Trotskyist James Cannon. He was a Trotskyist at
      the time, who ran on a pro-worker anti-war platform. And one of the things LaGuardia
      did was brutally go after striking transport workers, basically telling them that
      the country is at war. So municipal workers don’t have the right to go on strike.
      So your viewers can reach their own conclusions about what it means when somebody
      ties themselves so closely to a whole string of people who have a track record
      of having sold out workers.


      Chris Hedges


      Let’s just close by talking about your own campaign. Where are you? What are you
      up against? You mentioned at the beginning of the interview a little bit about
      who you’re running against.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, we’re running for US Congress from Washington state’s ninth congressional
      district, which includes a part of Seattle and also many other neighboring cities
      where there are lots of rich people. There’s lots of billionaires, but there’s
      also lots of working class people, lots of refugees. It’s a majority minority
      district. The district has a lot of people who have personally faced losses, family
      losses in Gaza through the genocide.


      There are many East African and East Asian and South Asian working class people
      who live here, many of whom are struggling to get by. And we are running against
      Adam Smith, who has been in Congress for nearly 30 years. And he, as I said before,
      has repeatedly voted to send tens of billions of dollars of funding to the Israeli
      military throughout the genocide.


      That’s not the first time, he has voted to send money to Israel over and over
      during his nearly 30 year career. But especially notable is that he has repeatedly
      voted to fund the genocide. And he is, not surprisingly, he is a favorite of the
      military contractors. We know that both Democratic and Republican parties are
      warmongering parties. They have been purveyors of endless brutal war throughout
      their history and Adam Smith is one of the generals among the warhawks.


      He is not a foot soldier. He has never met a war that he didn’t like. He has demonized
      anti-genocide activists as totalitarian, as extremists, as left-wing fascists.
      He has called for them to be arrested. He also holds the shameful distinction
      of being one of only five sitting Democratic Congress members who voted for the
      Iraq war, as I said, in 2002.


      He supported the wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and the
      current bloody inter-imperialist proxy war in Ukraine. He has been bankrolled
      for three decades by weapons industry profiteers, such as Lockheed Martin, General
      Dynamics, and Palantir, as I mentioned earlier. And he’s a darling of AIPAC and
      the Zionist lobby.


      As I said, AIPAC was his biggest funder last year. Just to contrast between our
      campaign and him, in the summer of 2014, that was my second year on the city council,
      I used my city council position not only to attend protests against Israel’s indiscriminate
      bombardment of Gaza at the time, but also to draft a public letter calling for
      an end to all US military aid to Israel and the brutal settlements in Palestinian
      territories and the occupation.


      During that same time that I was doing that, Adam Smith was enthusiastically backing
      Israel’s Iron Dome system, which as we know is one of the key components in enabling
      the Israeli state slaughter apparatus against the Palestinian people. And in the
      final days of my decade in City Hall in October and November of 2023, I was fighting
      to win.


      And we did win, despite the opposition of the Democrats, the second at the time
      and the strongest city council resolution calling for a ceasefire and an end to
      all US military aid to Israel. At that same moment, Smith was part of Biden’s
      cabal that was monstrously insisting on over $100 billion of military funding
      for not just Israel, but also for Ukraine, instead of funding the needs of the
      cost of living crisis here, faced by working people here.


      And he’s also just one of the most thoroughly corporate, pro-corporate politicians.
      And in fact, our race against Adam Smith goes to your other question as well,
      is what will it take to defeat the right wing? It will take destroying the Democratic
      Party, and that begins also, as I said, defeating Congress members like Adam Smith
      because during the George W. Bush presidency, when the nation was, of course,
      going rightward because of the rightward push by the Bush presidency, Smith, instead
      of advising that the Democrats should be more pro-working class, less pro-war,
      his advice to Democrats was to reduce the contrast between themselves and the
      Republicans.


      And at that time, he said the Democratic Party should consider privatizing Medicare.
      So it’s no surprise there that notorious corporations like UnitedHealthcare, which
      ferociously oppose Medicare for All, have also donated to Smith’s campaign. He
      also voted in favor of the bailout of big banks in 2008 while ordinary people
      were left to rot. So this is his track record.


      We have our track record from the city council, from the decade on the city council,
      having won historic victories for the working class. This congressional campaign,
      just like all of our election campaigns, is not in service of my personal political
      career. It is a vehicle to build movements and the movements we are specifically
      focusing on through our congressional campaign is to end the genocide, end the
      US military funding, end the occupation.


      And we’re also calling for stop stopping all the deportations and shutting down
      the detention centers. And we are also fighting for free health care for all funded
      by taxing the rich and for rent control nationally. In fact, we are pairing the
      congressional campaign with a Seattle citywide ballot initiative campaign for
      free healthcare for all, funded by increasing the Amazon tax that we’ve already
      won, increasing it to $5 billion.


      So this is a campaign for all working people who want to win big victories for
      ourselves, send a stinging message to the ruling class, to the Zionist lobby.
      So nationally, whoever is listening, whoever is watching this, you need to get
      involved in this campaign. We actually, you know something exciting is that we
      had a target of raising 100,000 working class donations within the first month
      of our campaign.


      We smashed that target in the first three weeks. And within the first month of
      our campaign, we have more than a thousand separate donors. That is more donors
      than Adam Smith had last year in his entire election. He needs fewer donors because
      he has all this warmongering and pro-billionaire PACs that are funding his campaigns.

    paragraph_summary: Zohran Mamdani's recent victory in the New York City Democratic
      mayoral primary has sent shockwaves through American politics, particularly due
      to his self-identification as a democratic socialist and his strong stance against
      the genocide in Gaza. His campaign, which focused on affordability and working-class
      demands, has drawn significant backlash from the billionaire class and political
      elites, including calls for his deportation from some prominent figures. Kshama
      Sawant, a former Seattle city councilmember and current congressional candidate,
      commended Mamdani's win as a sign that the Zionist lobby can be challenged and
      that working-class movements can thrive. However, she cautioned that Mamdani must
      remain committed to his promises and adopt a combative stance against the entrenched
      interests of the Democratic Party, which she argues ultimately serves capitalist
      interests. Sawant emphasized the importance of maintaining an adversarial approach
      to achieve substantial reforms for the working class, drawing on her own experiences
      in Seattle, where she successfully fought for significant labor rights and social

      The damage assessment in Israel from Iran’s counterattack against Tel Aviv’s unprovoked
      aggression against Iran last month is coming in.


      Despite strenuous efforts by Israeli authorities to suppress news from bomb sites,
      the extent of the destruction suffered by Israel is now being revealed.


      The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Monday that the vaunted Israeli air defense
      system, headlined by the so-called Iron Dome, failed to prevent a significant
      inundation of Iranian ordnance.


      Some single ballistic missiles landing on Israeli streets damaged a wide area
      of surrounding buildings purely from the vibrations of the impact, the newspaper
      reported.


      “Throughout Israel, between the shock waves and the direct impact of the heavy
      Iranian missiles, the destruction spread out over hundreds of meters,” Haaretz
      said. “Thousands of houses and buildings have been damaged, some severely, with
      exterior and interior walls collapsing.”


      “The common denominator is the person uprooted from his or her home, who will
      feel the shock for years,” the paper said. It further reported:


      “In Tel Aviv, 480 buildings have been damaged, many of them badly, at five separate
      sites. In Ramat Gan, it’s 237 buildings at three sites, about 10 badly. In another
      Tel Aviv suburb, Bat Yam, 78 buildings were damaged by one hit; 22 will have to
      be razed. The Israel Tax Authority has received applications for financial assistance
      for nearly 33,000 damaged structures. Another 4,450 files have been opened for
      the loss of belongings and equipment, and another 4,119 for damaged vehicles”.


      The Iranian attacks killed 29 Israeli civilians and, according to a Haaretz map,
      96 buildings were severely damaged.


      By contrast, in the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 42 Scud missiles at Tel Aviv and
      Haifa, killing two Israelis and damaging 4,100 buildings, destroying 28.


      The Haaretz report deals only with civilian buildings. Iran also hit a number
      of Israeli military bases, including Kirya and Camp Moshe Dayan in Tel Aviv; as
      well as the BAZAN oil refinery in Haifa, causing significant damage; and the Weizmann
      Institute of Science in Rehovot, destroying two buildings.

      As the dust settles on the “12 Day War”, it is ever-clearer that the conflict
      was a crushing defeat for Israel and the US. In retrospect, the Zionist entity’s
      sole success was a wave of assassinations in the conflict’s first hours. A fawning
      June 19th Financial Times report hinted cutting-edge technology drawing together
      diverse data and intelligence sources was responsible. This raises the obvious
      question of whether Tel Aviv was assisted in its murderous spree by notorious
      private spying giant Palantir.


      An avowedly pro-Israel tech giant founded by Donald Trump confidante and ardent
      Zionist Peter Thiel, which reportedly provides artificial intelligence tech supporting
      Tel Aviv’s genocide in Gaza, Palantir’s tendrils extend typically unseen into
      almost every conceivable sphere of public and private life across the West. Moreover,
      the firm – launched with seed funding from CIA venture capital wing In-Q-Tel –
      has long-played a pivotal but barely acknowledged role in the International Atomic
      Energy Agency’s monitoring of Tehran’s nuclear research.


      The interpretation Palantir was one way or another involved in Israel’s illegal
      “preemptive” war of aggression against Tehran is amply reinforced by the release
      of sensitive Israeli documents by Iran’s intelligence ministry. These files indicate
      the IAEA previously provided Israeli intelligence with the names of several Iranian
      nuclear scientists, who were subsequently assassinated. Additionally, current
      Association chief Rafael Grossi enjoys a close, long-running, clandestine relationship
      with Israeli officials. Subsequent disclosures could expose the IAEA’s dark alliance
      with Palantir.


      ‘Fishing Expedition’


      In July 2015, the Obama administration inked the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
      with Tehran. Under its auspices, in return for sanctions relief, the IAEA was
      granted unimpeded access to Iran’s nuclear facilities, to ensure the Islamic Republic
      was not developing nuclear weapons. Vast amounts of information on and within
      the sites, including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents
      were collected along the way. The Association consistently found Iran was stringently
      adhering to the JCPOA’s terms.


      Following Trump’s first inauguration however, the JCPOA began to come apart at
      the seams. In October 2017, he refused to certify Iran’s compliance with its obligations
      on bogus grounds, and began threatening to tear up the agreement outright and
      reimpose sanctions. The next March, then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano sounded
      alarm over this prospect, claiming the JCPOA had produced “the world’s most robust
      [nuclear] verification regime” in Iran, and its cessation would represent a “great
      loss”. He went on to boast of how Association inspectors:


      “Now spend 3,000 calendar days per year on the ground in Iran. We have installed
      some 2,000 tamper-proof seals on nuclear material and equipment. We have carried
      out more than 60 complementary accesses [unannounced inspections] and visited
      more than 190 buildings…We collect and analyse hundreds of thousands of images
      captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras…about half of the total
      number of such images that we collect throughout the world. We collect over one
      million pieces of open source information each month.”


      Amano added IAEA activities in Tehran were “supported by state-of-the-art technology,
      including data collecting and processing systems.” Unmentioned was that these
      innovative resources were provided by Palantir. The company’s central role in
      scrutinizing Iran’s nuclear compliance and intimate handshake with the IAEA was
      revealed two months later by Bloomberg, mere days before the Trump administration
      shredded the Agreement and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.
      Former US energy secretary Ernest Moniz effusively praised Palantir’s contribution:


      “We have a completely unique and unparalleled intrusive verification regime that
      was not there before the agreement.”


      A tool dubbed Mosaic served as “the analytical core” and “platform of choice”
      for the IAEA’s verification mission in Iran. The software helped the Association
      “plan and justify unscheduled probes”, collating and processing data from around
      400 million “digital objects” globally, “including social media feeds and satellite
      photographs.” Mosaic was also charged with examining en-masse documents not only
      collected by the IAEA, but tens of thousands of sensitive files stolen by Mossad
      from Tehran.


      Bloomberg quoted Ali Vaez, International Crisis Group’s Iran Project director,
      as expressing concern about Mosaic analysing “dirty” data obtained by Mossad,
      “which prides itself on deception.” After all, “even a small amount of false information
      could trigger a flurry of unnecessary snap inspections and derail an agreement
      that took years to reach.” The broader the terms of Palantir’s work with the IAEA,
      the more the mission “appears as a fishing expedition,” Vaez fretted, suggesting
      Iran could become less willing “to open its doors to inspectors.”


      Vaez’s comments were eerily prophetic. Recent disclosures of intensive collusion
      between the IAEA and Zionist entity authorities, and the resultant prospect Association
      inspections assisted Israeli and US attacks on Tehran, prompted Iranian lawmakers
      to unanimously pass legislation indefinitely suspending cooperation with the Association
      on June 25th. It is unlikely IAEA inspectors will ever be permitted to tread on
      the Islamic Republic’s territory again. But Bloomberg highlighted a number of
      other anxieties that have only gained in gravity in light of recent events.


      ‘False Assumption’


      For one, the outlet recorded how Palantir’s IAEA role granted the company “access
      to information that governments don’t,” while questioning whether “an international
      agency known for its independence” could truly remain neutral and objective given
      “Thiel’s close personal ties to Trump.” Furthermore, Bloomberg noted the Association’s
      Palantir-provided “enhanced investigative abilities” had “raised concern that
      the IAEA may overstep the boundary between nuclear monitoring and intelligence-gathering,”
      transforming its inspectors into unwitting “potential cyber sleuths.”


      Such fears were only exacerbated by Mosaic being based upon Palantir’s highly
      controversial “predictive-policing software”. For the IAEA, this capability turned
      “databases of classified information into maps” helping “inspectors visualize
      ties between the people, places and material involved in nuclear activities” in
      Tehran. The risk of innocent Iranian civilians being made targets for surveillance,
      harassment, or even assassination created by erroneous data being fed into and/or
      pumped out by Mosaic is gargantuan.


      Bloomberg quoted a representative of a British company “that advises governments
      on verification issues” as saying “predictive-analysis” systems were extremely
      vulnerable to such corruption, “either by accident or design.” He noted, “you
      will generate a false return if you add a false assumption into the system…[and]
      end up convincing yourself that shadows are real.” Of course, a dangerous “false
      assumption” lay at the very core of the IAEA’s inspection mission in Iran – namely,
      that Tehran was developing nukes in the first place.


      The Islamic Republic has for decades consistently denied any suggestion it harbours
      ambitions to possess nuclear weapons. Her denials were corroborated by a November
      2007 US National Intelligence Estimate expressing “high confidence that in fall
      2003, Tehran halted” any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment
      remained unchanged for several years, and was reportedly shared by Mossad. As
      Bloomberg recorded, come May 2018 the IAEA had “certified Iran’s work 10 times.”


      In March 2025, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified to Congress
      that Iran had not restarted the nuclear weapons program it halted in 2003. On
      June 17th, with the 12 Day War well-underway, IAEA chief Grossi declared “we did
      not have any proof of a systematic effort” by Tehran “to move into a nuclear weapon.”
      Yet, Israel justified its attacks based on an intelligence dossier that concluded
      the Islamic Republic had in fact reached the “point of no return” in acquiring
      nukes.


      That dodgy dossier depended in no small part on the findings of a May IAEA report.
      The document provided no new information – its dubious charges related “to activities
      dating back decades” at three sites where purportedly, until the early 2000s,
      “undeclared nuclear material” was handled. If this report was analysed by Palantir’s
      “predictive-analysis” systems, it is all but inevitable false results and connections
      would’ve been created, in turn influencing the Zionist entity’s targets and strategy.


      One of the “predictive policing” tools innovated by Palantir guiding Mosaic’s
      operations is Gotham, which is used by an uncertain number of Western law enforcement
      agencies. Leaked documents on the resource show it collects an extraordinary volume
      of data on entire populations – whether they are law-abiding, suspected of having
      committed a crime, or simply connected to individuals accused of wrongdoing. This
      includes sex, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots,
      surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, and identifying
      features such as tattoos.


      Slide from leaked Gotham training presentation


      In October 2024, a major Norwegian asset manager divested from Palantir due to
      the company offering “AI-based predictive policing systems”, aiding the Zionist
      entity’s mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. These systems
      are designed “to identify individuals who are likely to launch ‘lone wolf terrorist’
      attacks, facilitating their arrests preemptively before the strikes that it is
      projected they would carry out.” Their deployment results in countless Palestinians
      languishing in Israeli dungeons without charge or trial.


      If Mosaic informed the Zionist entity’s strategy during the 12 Day War, that may
      account for why individuals with no connection whatsoever to Iran’s civilian nuclear
      program were directly targeted for assassination. This includes Majid Tajan Jari,
      a prominent professor in the field of AI locally, slain in an Israeli strike on
      a residential building in Tehran on June 16th. Yet, reliance on faulty or false
      information collated by Mosaic would simultaneously explain the conflict ending
      in embarrassing defeat for Israel, and victory for Tehran.

      The private jet lobby is pushing hard for a massive tax break for billionaires
      and centi-millionaires that use the most polluting form of transportation on the
      planet.


      Legislation rapidly moving through Congress, the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”
      — really a Big Ugly Grift (BUG) — includes a massive tax subsidy for private jet
      buyers. Instead of corporations deducting the purchase of their jets over several
      years of their useful life, the BUG includes 100 percent “bonus depreciation”
      in the year of purchase.


      For example, a corporation purchasing a $50 million private jet could potentially
      deduct the entire $50 million from their taxes in the year of the purchase, rather
      than spreading the deduction over many years. This amounts to a massive taxpayer
      subsidy, as ordinary taxpayers pick up the tab for the private jet industry and
      billionaire high flyers.


      From our IPS research on private jets, we know that regular taxpayers and commercial
      air travelers subsidize the high-flying excess of private jet owners. In the U.S.
      private jets use seven percent of the airspace but only contribute 0.6 percent
      of the cost of using it.


      As wealth has concentrated into the vaults of the ultra-wealthy, the demand for
      private jets is surging. Every billionaire appears to need one or two. As a result,
      private jets are one of the largest and fastest growing sources of air and climate
      pollution. In 2023, private jets emitted 19.5 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG)
      emissions, a 25 percent increase over 2013 levels.


      A new study, from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), analyzed
      global private jet pollution and emissions for 2023. They found that private jets,
      which account for about four percent of all global aviation, together emitted
      more GHG than all flights departing from Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport
      in Europe.


      ICCT, the researchers best known for uncovering the Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal,
      have developed the first global mapping of private jet air and climate pollution,
      spatially locating more than 90 percent of private jet activity and emissions
      to airports and countries.


      The study found that private jet activity and emissions are overwhelmingly concentrated
      in the U.S. In 2023, private jets departing U.S. airports accounted for 65 percent
      of flights and 55 percent of all private jet GHG emissions globally. Eighteen
      of the twenty most polluting airports are based in the U.S. That includes Hanscom
      Field outside of Boston, the locus of a huge campaign to block private jet hangar
      expansion.


      Private jet travel originating in Florida and Texas generated more private jet
      operations and emissions than the entire European Union combined, according to
      the ICCT study. A private jet emits about 810 tons of GHGs in a typical year,
      equivalent to 177 passenger cars or nine Class 8 heavy-duty trucks.


      Many private jet flights are short hops, less than 560 miles and two hours, and
      the majority are for recreational purposes, not for business meetings. In France,
      there are proposals to ban short hop flights, especially when other transportation
      options exist.


      Instead of subsidizing private jets through the tax code, we should tax private
      jet fuels to ensure they reflect their real environmental costs. “As wealth inequality
      explodes globally, policymakers have begun to ask why private jet taxes are so
      low,” said Dan Rutherford, co-author of the ICCT report. “Given the slow pace
      of technological progress, it’s reasonable to charge ultrawealthy travelers more
      for their pollution.”


      A tax on jet fuel could generate substantial revenue for high-speed rail and other
      decarbonization priorities. A global private jet fuel tax, modeled after Senator
      Ed Markey’s U.S. private jet fuel tax, could generate $3 trillion a year to offset
      the harms of private jet excess.


      Subsidizing more private jets on a warming planet is reckless and indefensible.
      As Rutherford observes, “Private jets are like the canary in the coal mine here
      for a hyper unequal warming world.” Including tax breaks in the new tax bill reveals
      the pro-billionaire bias of Congress.

      By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost


      War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese,
      Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations
      and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet
      Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc.,
      Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with
      banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities,
      which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation
      and the genocide of Palestinians.


      The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate
      with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be
      held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption”
      as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant
      supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors
      and private and public institutions profit freely.”


      The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation
      Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility
      of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This
      new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice
      place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and
      unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement
      with Palestinians enables their self-determination.”


      “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable
      for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities,
      including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses
      and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited
      Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and
      even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of
      genocide.”


      In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to
      test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now
      are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.”


      You can see my interview with Albanese here.


      The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery
      required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship,
      livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.”


      The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of
      Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and
      water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by
      “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural
      resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods
      and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.”


      “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at
      least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes.


      Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance
      into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities —
      centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology
      underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked
      or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have
      obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.”


      Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate
      targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously
      used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in
      the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza,
      preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.”


      The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for
      cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools
      powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United
      States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’”


      Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its
      two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel
      Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships
      with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United
      States-based Lockheed Martin.”


      “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet,
      which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and
      domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets
      have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to
      drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure
      more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.”


      “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines
      in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied
      by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter
      jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past
      two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions
      such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired
      automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.”


      Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery
      for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.”


      “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components,
      parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied
      military equipment post-October 2023.”


      There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024
      – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated
      a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially
      producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.”


      At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing
      dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while
      profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the
      occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services,
      from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced
      tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing,
      artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.”


      “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the
      report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus
      spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian
      activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights
      defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance
      technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.”


      IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of
      punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics,
      train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner
      in this current genocide.


      It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military
      and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine
      operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with
      counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance.


      “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the
      Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental
      use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit
      regime of Israel,” the report notes.


      Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police,
      universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating
      its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring
      Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.”


      “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing
      volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report
      reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a
      $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense
      expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.”


      Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access
      to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing,
      decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.”


      The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence
      systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate
      lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature
      of artificial intelligence.”


      There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology
      Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive
      policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction
      and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform,
      which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.”


      Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians
      in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.”


      “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial
      occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment
      from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land,
      demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure.
      Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying
      70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.”


      Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment
      used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive
      wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie.


      “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded
      core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity
      since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing
      Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire
      dollar contract with Israel.”


      “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the
      Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been
      linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through
      exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads.


      “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in
      the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what
      replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading
      materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies
      as if to a regular holiday destination.”


      “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded
      with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population
      in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes.


      These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators
      and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials
      AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from
      the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.”
      The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport
      infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting
      them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.”


      Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli
      and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty
      LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee
      KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller
      Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly
      sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments
      in colonies.”


      Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel
      rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food
      conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank.


      In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy
      (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas
      from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million
      in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per
      cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership
      of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime
      territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.”


      BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude
      oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the
      Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil
      fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil
      between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian
      oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel.
      Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.”


      “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing
      to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation
      and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report
      reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has
      serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration
      of Gaza. ”


      International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through
      the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds.


      “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have
      played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads.
      “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3
      per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel
      funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion
      in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic
      new shekel market.”


      The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas
      and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international
      and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium,
      despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68
      million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO
      ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased
      them.”


      Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects,
      including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions
      abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads.


      “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion
      and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms
      such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries
      for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends
      of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent
      over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including
      some that train extremist settlers.”


      The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and
      institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research
      funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm
      control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023
      — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.”


      You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between
      the university Israeli military here.


      Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel
      could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem.
      These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians
      and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units
      decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held
      accountable.

      By Jessica Corbett / Common Dreams


      Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani made clear on Tuesday
      that he would not be intimidated by Republican U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat
      to arrest him.


      A journalist who falsely described Mamdani—a democratic socialist—as a “communist”
      asked Trump about the candidate’s pledge not to cooperate with U.S. Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents are working to carry out the president’s
      promised mass deportations.


      “Well then, we’ll have to arrest him,” said Trump, a former New Yorker who has
      taken aim at Mamdani since his victory in last Tuesday’s Democratic primary. “Look,
      we don’t need a communist in this country.”


      Q: You message to communist Zohran Mamdani?




      TRUMP: Well then, we''ll have to arrest him pic.twitter.com/3YbylPK2MS — Aaron
      Rupar (@atrupar) July 1, 2025


      Mamdani, who currently serves in the New York State Assembly, was born in Uganda
      to Indian parents and moved to NYC as a child. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen
      in 2018. Throughout his campaign, the 33-year-old has faced numerous Islamophobic
      attacks, and after his primary win, Congressman Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) urged the
      Trump administration to target him with “denaturalization proceedings,” in line
      with a broader effort at the Department of Justice (DOJ).


      Trump said Tuesday that his administration would be watching Mamdani “very carefully.”
      The president, a well-documented liar, added that “a lot of people are saying
      he’s here illegally—you know, we’re gonna look at everything… and ideally he’s
      gonna turn out to be much less than a communist, but right now he’s a communist,
      that’s not a socialist.”


      Trump also blasted Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a supporter
      of Mamdani, and praised the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams, who is seeking another
      term as an Independent. After Trump returned to office in January, the DOJ instructed
      prosecutors to drop federal corruption charges against Adams, triggering widespread
      outrage over the attempted “illegal quid pro quo,” as some critics called it.


      Trump falsely suggests @ZohranKMamdani is in the country "illegally" calls him
      a communist (he''s a Dem socialist) and then then goes on to call @ericadamsfornyc
      a "very good person" who he "helped out a little bit." pic.twitter.com/7tOoULgPek
      — Gloria Pazmino (@GloriaPazmino) July 1, 2025


      Responding to Trump’s remarks in a lengthy statement, Mamdani said Tuesday that
      “the president of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped
      of my citizenship, put in a detention camp, and deported. Not because I have broken
      any law, but because I will refuse to let ICE terrorize our city.”


      “His statements don’t just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt
      to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: If you
      speak up, they will come for you,” Mamdani continued. “We will not accept this
      intimidation.”


      “That Trump included praise for Eric Adams in his authoritarian threats is unsurprising,
      but highlights the urgency of bringing an end to this mayor’s time in City Hall,”
      he asserted, directing attention to the GOP budget bill advanced by the U.S. Senate
      on Tuesday.


      Mamdani said that “at this very moment, when MAGA Republicans are attempting to
      destroy the social safety net, kick millions of New Yorkers off of healthcare,
      and enrich their billionaire donors at the expense of working families, it is
      a scandal that Eric Adams echoes this president’s division, distraction, and hatred.
      Voters will resoundingly reject it in November.”


      In addition to Mamdani and Adams, the general election candidates are Republican
      Curtis Sliwa, Independent Jim Walden, and disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew
      Cuomo, who is now running as an Independent after losing the Democratic primary.
      According to results released Tuesday, Mamdani got 56% of the vote compared to
      Cuomo’s 44%.

      socialist and current New York State Assembly member, condemned Trump's remarks
      as an attack on democracy and a message of intimidation aimed at those who oppose
      the administration's policies. He emphasized the need to stand against such threats,
      particularly in light of ongoing efforts by MAGA Republicans to undermine social
      safety nets and healthcare for working families. Mamdani recently won the Democratic
      primary with 56% of the vote, positioning him against a field that includes former
      Governor Andrew Cuomo and current Mayor Eric Adams, who has been criticized for
      his ties to Trump.

      The Trump administration has approved a new arms deal for Israel that will provide
      the country with $510 million worth of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMS),
      kits that turn bombs into precision-guided weapons, as the US continues to provide
      military aid to support the genocidal war in Gaza.


      According to the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the State
      Department notified Congress of the sale of 3,845 JDAMS for 2,000-pound BLU-109
      bombs and 3,280 JDAMS for 500-pound MK 82 bombs. The deal also includes US “government
      and contractor engineering, logistics, and technical support services; and other
      related elements of logistics and program support.”


      The DSCA said Boeing is the principal contractor for the deal. The notification
      of the potential deal begins a time period when US lawmakers could potentially
      block the sale, but there’s little opposition to US military support for Israel
      within Congress, despite the many war crimes the US is implicated in by providing
      Israel with weapons.


      Fragments of bombs with US-provided JDAM kits have been found at the scene of
      Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that have massacred many civilians. In 2023, Human
      Rights Watch said it identified JDAM fragments that were found in two airstrikes
      on homes in central Gaza that killed 43 civilians, including 19 children, and
      14 women.


      It’s unclear at this point how the deal will be financed, but many arms sales
      to Israel are funded by US military aid, and US assistance to Israel has significantly
      increased since October 7, 2023. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in
      that time, US funding has covered an estimated 70% of Israel’s war-related military
      spending.

      By Norman Solomon / Z Network


      The Supreme Court’s first chief justice, John Jay, would have empathized with
      the billionaires who’ve been freaking out ever since Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic
      primary for mayor of New York last Tuesday. “Those who own the country ought to
      govern it,” Jay insisted. But now, oligarchs accustomed to such governance are
      furious that the nation’s capital of capitalism is in danger of serving people
      instead of megaprofits.


      Meanwhile, among progressives, euphoria is especially fitting because the Mamdani
      campaign’s win was truly a people-powered victory, thanks to active efforts of
      40,000 volunteers. In a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans
      six-to-one, the Democratic nomination would ordinarily be a virtual guarantee
      of winning the general election. But the forces of oligarchy now mobilizing could
      disprove a claim that “Mamdani’s widespread appeal represents the total collapse
      of a Democratic Party establishment.”


      Such a collapse is very far from certain.


      On the surface, Andrew Cuomo’s decision to stay on the fall ballot as an “independent,”
      while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams does likewise, seems to foreshadow splitting
      the anti-Mamdani vote. But Cuomo still has a substantial electoral following.
      And the corrupt Adams – who cut a deal with President Trump to viciously betray
      immigrants and got his criminal indictment thrown out by Trump’s Justice Department
      – has no better ethics than the disgraced former governor Cuomo. Bankrolled by
      wealthy donors, the pair might make some kind of pact, with one of them telling
      his followers to unify behind the other before voting begins this fall.


      In any case, a key context of the upcoming election battle is that hell hath no
      fury like corporate power scorned.


      A social-media screed by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman (net worth: upward of
      $9 billion) was damn near apoplectic that activists and voters had so terribly
      transgressed. Ackman described himself as “a supporter of President Trump” while
      expressing a fervent desire “to save the Democratic Party from itself.” Mamdani’s
      policies, Ackman wrote late Wednesday night, “would be disastrous for NYC. Socialism
      has no place in the economic capital of our country.”


      But Ackman held out hope that those owning the city of New York could continue
      to govern it: “Importantly, there are hundreds of million of dollars of capital
      available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight …
      so that a great alternative candidate won’t spend any time raising funds. So,
      if the right candidate would raise his or her hand tomorrow, the funds will pour
      in. I am sure that Mike Bloomberg will share his how-to-win-the-mayoralty IP [intellectual
      property] and deliver his entire election apparatus and system to the aspiring
      candidate so that the candidate can focus all of his or her energy on the campaign.”


      Another aggrieved hedge-fund multibillionaire, Daniel Loeb, opted to be concise:
      “It’s officially hot commie summer.” Many other moguls have also sounded alarms.
      But beneath all the froth and bombast, extremely wealthy individuals are busy
      gauging how to prevail against the threat of democracy and social justice.


      In the Empire State, there are many ways for the empire to strike back. The constellation
      of forces now regrouping with a vengeance includes titans of Wall Street, enormous
      real estate interests, pro-Israel groups, corporate media, the anti-progressive
      rich and assorted smear artists.


      In recent weeks, the completely false charge of antisemitism has escalated against
      Mamdani. He has taken a principled and consistent stand on behalf of human rights
      for all – in the process, denouncing Israel’s war on Palestinian civilians in
      Gaza – while at the same time opposing rapacious corporate power. So, it’s no
      surprise that New York’s most powerful Democrat, Senate minority leader Chuck
      Schumer, has been dodging the question of whether he’ll endorse Mamdani in the
      general election.


      For decades, Schumer’s campaign coffers have bulged while he has been hugely compensated
      by Wall Street. He has also remained a staunch supporter of Israel, despite its
      systematic ethnic cleaning and genocide against Palestinian people. A few months
      ago, Schumer declared: “My job is to keep the left pro-Israel.”


      What happened in the state’s second-largest city in 2021 is important to understand.
      Democratic socialist India Walton was the candidate of a grassroots campaign that
      stunned the party establishment in the Democratic primary when she defeated Buffalo’s
      corporate mayor, four-term incumbent Byron Brown. As the Democratic nominee, she
      seemed set to win the general election in the blue city. But a coalition of furious
      Democratic power brokers and deep-pocketed Republicans, including racists and
      vehement haters of the left, aided by much of the city’s mass media, teamed up
      to smear her and ending up getting Brown elected as a write-in candidate.


      Last weekend, I asked India (now a colleague at RootsAction, where she is senior
      strategist) how she saw the Mamdani campaign. “Watching the New York City mayoral
      primary from Buffalo last Tuesday gave me a familiar feeling,” she said. “As I
      watched the results come in, I felt a flutter in my gut and a sense of pensiveness.
      A feeling of overwhelming joy and a fear that it would be snatched away despite
      my attempts to cling to it. I imagine that as Zohran watched, he also felt a sense
      of familiarity. In 2021, Zohran Mamdani supported my run for Buffalo mayor; I
      was a first-time unknown candidate challenging a 16-year incumbent, and conventional
      wisdom said it was an impossible race to win. Now, in 2025, Zohran has once again
      toppled the establishment. I’m starting to think that populist policies that focus
      on working people are a winning strategy.”


      That strategy is now striking fear into the hard hearts of insatiably greedy billionaires.

      By Kit Klarenberg / MintPress News


      On June 13, 2025, Tel Aviv launched what many international observers and Iranian
      officials have described as an unprovoked military strike on Iran. Israeli jets
      bombed military and nuclear sites, while Mossad-run sleeper cells carried out
      sabotage missions against air and missile defense systems from within Iran, and
      drones smuggled into Tehran were launched against local missile launch bases.


      Dozens—perhaps more—of nuclear scientists and top military commanders were murdered
      with surgical precision, often in the presence of innocent family members, who
      were themselves frequently killed. A climate of chaos and uncertainty seemed to
      engulf everything.


      These early results so exhilarated Israeli officials that they talked a big game
      on where their operation would lead, making several incendiary claims along the
      way. They boasted of operating in Iranian airspace without hindrance, invited
      the U.S. to get formally involved with the “elimination” of Tehran’s nuclear weapons
      program, and anonymously briefed the media that “a multi-faceted misinformation
      campaign”—in which Donald Trump was an “active participant”—had been conducted
      “to convince Iran that a strike on its nuclear facilities was not imminent.”


      Internationally-wanted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu forecast on June 15 that
      Israel’s war on Iran “could certainly” produce regime change, as the government
      was “very weak,” and that “80% of the people would throw these theological thugs
      out.”


      A hard-hitting response to Netanyahu’s premonitions and Tel Aviv’s military strike
      quickly arrived from Tehran in the form of a wave of missile attacks. Wreaking
      unprecedented damage on Tel Aviv and Haifa. The impact on Israeli military installations
      is difficult to assess due to its strict policy of internal censorship.


      Visibly, though, Iran’s bombardments sent Israelis scurrying for shelter, while
      many others fled the country outright. Such was the exodus, from a country that
      has already suffered mass depopulation since October 7, 2023—the Israeli government
      has since scrambled to implement legally questionable bans on its citizens leaving.


      By June 19, officials in Tel Aviv had dropped the braggadocio, and Western media
      were publishing explainer guides to explain why Israel’s much-vaunted Iron Dome
      air defense system had failed to repel Iranian strikes.


      Iran’s unmolested battering of Israel continued apace until June 22, when the
      U.S. officially entered the war. Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan, and
      Natanz were targeted, allegedly using heavy-duty B-2 bombers that dropped earth-shattering
      bunker busters.


      Trump boasted that Iran’s nuclear program was “obliterated,” and Tehran struck
      an unmanned U.S. base in Qatar in response. Iran and Israel then traded missile
      barrages, which inflicted significantly greater damage on the latter, for two
      more days, before begrudgingly agreeing to a ceasefire.


      So far, the ceasefire holds. In the meantime, U.S. claims of having damaged, let
      alone destroyed, Iran’s nuclear facilities have quickly unraveled, as have Israeli
      allegations that the June 13 strike was an urgent necessity conducted as Iran
      was on the imminent verge of acquiring nukes.


      As the dust settles, it is becoming increasingly clear that the so-called “12
      Day War” was long in the making, and an unmitigated disaster for Tel Aviv and
      Washington, with wide-ranging ramifications for the region and beyond.


      “Netanyahu wanted to incite regime change in Tehran, while drawing the U.S. into
      a wider war. He failed on both counts, and now Iran is stronger, its citizens
      more united with one another, and behind their government,” Ali Abunimah, Electronic
      Intifada cofounder, tells MintPress News.


      This has enormous implications for West Asia and the world. Israel proved itself
      more vulnerable than ever. Tehran, while still facing enormous dangers from determined
      enemies, proved itself far more resilient than its adversaries expected.”


      ‘Burning Through’


      “Meanwhile, as many Iranian commentators note,” Abunimah says, another deleterious
      upshot of the fiasco is “Western-oriented segments of Iranian society have been
      left disillusioned—even discredited—by Washington’s brazen deceit.”


      Bragging about how Trump’s nuclear negotiations were a ruse “means not only Iran
      but many other countries globally will never again trust U.S. diplomacy.” Still,
      he believes Washington and Tel Aviv’s “efforts to destroy” Iran shouldn’t cease,
      and could intensify.


      For the time being, Tehran has made clear it will observe the ceasefire and only
      strike back if it is attacked again. As Abunimah puts it, “Some have criticized
      Iran for not linking a ceasefire to Israel ending the Gaza genocide.” However,
      he believes “such a demand could’ve triggered serious U.S. aggression, rather
      than the meaningless strikes that happened, and civilians could’ve ended up in
      the firing line.”


      Tehran has never envisaged direct defeat via a single blow, but wearing Israel
      down. The Resistance, including Iran, is the weaker side in an asymmetrical war,
      facing the full might of the U.S.-led Western empire. Ironically, although Israel
      started this war, it advanced the Resistance’s objective. Israel appears weak,
      unstable, and unsafe, while totally reliant on foreign support in a world where
      it is more hated than ever after nearly two years of its livestreamed genocide
      in Gaza.”


      Tyler Weaver, a U.S. military veteran who runs a popular X account publishing
      military analysis and commentary, echoes Abunimah’s analysis. “Iran demonstrated
      a consistent capability to pierce Israeli missile defenses and damage or destroy
      Israeli infrastructure and combat systems – several IDF air defense missile batteries
      were struck and destroyed,” he observes.


      And while Iran may not have secured an outright victory against its attackers,
      “Israel sure lost” the 12-Day War. “This was their ‘big show’ against Iran, and
      its results did not meet the effort expended. The most effective weapon the Israelis
      had wasn’t their vaunted Air Force, but instead an elaborately constructed attack
      network inside Iran courtesy of Mossad, which is now gone, and likely cannot be
      reconstructed.”


      “Infrastructure can be repaired, weaponry can be replaced, but they’re not going
      to be able to rebuild anything like that network again,” Weaver warns.


      Furthermore, Israel’s high-risk bid to overpower Iran consumed enormous amounts
      of munitions and came at great financial expense. A former financial adviser to
      the IDF chief of staff estimates that just the first 48 hours of Tel Aviv’s botched
      campaign cost $1.45 billion, with almost $1 billion spent on defensive measures
      alone. Meanwhile, government economists estimated the daily cost of military operations
      at $725 million.


      Tel Aviv was reportedly running perilously low on missile interceptors within
      five days, despite the U.S. having been aware of “capacity problems” for months
      prior, and spending intervening months “augmenting Israel’s defenses with systems
      on the ground, at sea and in the air.” This, in turn, has created “concern about
      the U.S. burning through its own interceptors” within the Pentagon. As a July
      2024 report by the Department of Defense-funded RAND concluded, Washington cannot
      replenish its stockpile of those munitions at any pace or scale.


      Haaretz estimates that the civilian and economic toll of the 12-Day War on Israel
      could reach into the billions of dollars. Thousands of residents have been displaced,
      with reconstruction costs projected in the hundreds of millions. Most industries
      were brought to a halt during the conflict, deepening the strain on Tel Aviv’s
      already fragile economy.


      Taken together, Israel’s ability to sustain a longer or more intense confrontation
      with Iran—militarily or financially—and the U.S. capacity to provide continued
      support appear increasingly uncertain.


      ‘Idiotic Decision’


      Reports suggest Trump was motivated by fears of a drawn-out war and saw military
      strikes on Iran as the most direct path to a ceasefire. This interpretation is
      greatly reinforced by a high-ranking Iranian official claiming the White House
      gave Tehran advance notice of the bombings, insisting they were intended as a
      “one-off,” opening the door for a “symbolic” Iranian counterattack, and cessation
      of hostilities.


      Media reports suggest that the strikes were part of a broader effort by the President
      to de-escalate the conflict by offering a negotiated off-ramp for all parties
      involved. Despite these disclosures, Trump has repeatedly avowed in his typically
      brash style that the June 22 attack on Iran was decisive, and “one of the most
      successful military strikes in history.”


      The New York Times later cited a senior U.S. official who said Iran’s nuclear
      sites were not destroyed but targeted in a way that temporarily took them “off
      the table,” contradicting the president’s more emphatic characterization.


      Even that more modest assessment was further challenged on June 25, when CNN reported
      on the findings of a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency analysis. The report concluded
      that U.S. strikes on Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz had not destroyed the core components
      of Iran’s nuclear program and had likely only delayed it by months. These conclusions
      were echoed by multiple informed sources, who noted that Iran’s stockpile of enriched
      uranium had been relocated prior to the attack, and that the facilities’ centrifuges
      remained largely intact.


      Weaver, who has studied photo and video evidence of the 12-Day War extensively,
      concurs “there’s little indication” the Iranian nuclear sites were “meaningfully
      damaged.” What can be detected from satellite imagery on the ground “is simply
      inconsistent with the use of earthquake bombs as claimed by Trump and the Pentagon.”


      Weaver points to several inconsistencies in mainstream reporting and White House
      statements regarding both the execution and outcomes of the attack. He notes that
      the strike “passed entirely under the radar of the usual nightly exchange of fire
      between Iran and Israel,” and was not acknowledged by either side until Trump
      announced it.


      For the official account to hold, he argues, B-2 bombers—aircraft the U.S. had
      previously avoided using in Yemen—would have had to penetrate deep into Iranian
      territory, strike heavily fortified sites with gravity bombs, and return across
      hundreds of miles of monitored airspace without being detected, all while Iran’s
      air defense systems remained operational.


      I think Trump tried to rescue Netanyahu from the consequences of his idiotic decision
      to start a war with Iran he manifestly wasn’t capable of finishing, and do so
      in a manner the Iranians weren’t going to be provoked into responding to in a
      major way. As an American taxpayer and former DoD employee, I would hope this
      wasn’t the most impressive attack the U.S. military could put together on a week’s
      notice, and it reflects deliberate restraint rather than a lack of capability.”


      Despite extensive planning reportedly dating back to the Biden administration,
      including war-game scenarios focused on Iran’s nuclear program, analysts have
      questioned the limited impact of Israel’s strike. Furthermore, it has been revealed
      that senior Israeli officials had been preparing for the June 13 attack since
      March, and sought to strike before Iran “rebuilt its air defenses by the latter
      half of the year.”


      ‘Polite Fiction’


      CNN’s report on the leaked DIA assessment was quickly met with coordinated responses
      from across the U.S. government disputing its conclusions.


      First, a dedicated article was published on the White House website, “Iran’s Nuclear
      Facilities Have Been Obliterated — and Suggestions Otherwise are Fake News.” The
      article collated quotes from numerous high-ranking administration officials, including
      the President, and Israeli government and military apparatchiks, testifying to
      the attack’s triumph. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fulminated, “Anyone who says
      the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the
      successful mission.”


      Simultaneously, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence
      Tulsi Gabbard separately issued statements declaring “new intelligence” indicated
      Iran’s nuclear facilities had in fact been “destroyed” by U.S. airstrikes. Neither
      provided any evidence to support this bold conclusion. Later that day, Politico
      revealed that the aggressive flurry of disavowal was a determined “blitz” by the
      administration, “to counter media reports…the strikes had not significantly set
      back Iran’s nuclear program.”


      The DIA leak reportedly provoked an angry response from Trump, leading to federal
      investigations into the breach. Like many administrations, the White House and
      U.S. agencies have typically resisted admitting to failures in military operations.
      Nonetheless, the determination of so many officials to push back against any suggestions
      that the strike wasn’t a historically ruinous cataclysm could point to a different
      motive than covering for Trump, or being forced to admit that Washington’s once-vaunted
      military machine isn’t what it once was.


      The assertion that Iran’s nuclear program has been eliminated offers a convenient
      rationale for ending discussions that, even before the conflict, had reached an
      impasse and now appear permanently derailed. In the wake of Tel Aviv’s strike,
      Iran canceled nuclear talks with the U.S. that had been scheduled for June 21
      in Oman, citing what it called Israel’s “barbarous” actions, backed by Washington,
      as rendering the summit “meaningless.”


      If, as some analysts have suggested, the negotiations were never intended to succeed
      and successive U.S. administrations were aware of Israel’s plans in advance, then
      Tehran has little reason to resume talks. In addition, Iranian officials have
      stated that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors will no longer
      be permitted entry to nuclear sites on Iranian soil.


      On June 12, Press TV published documents exposing how the Association previously
      provided Israeli intelligence with the names of several Iranian nuclear scientists
      who were subsequently assassinated, and its chief, Rafael Grossi, enjoys a close,
      clandestine relationship with Israeli officials.


      Documents released by Iran show that IAEA chief Grossi has been completely coordinated
      with Israel and has been carrying out Israel''s orders.




      Iran recently managed to obtain a wealth of secret documents from the Israeli
      regime. pic.twitter.com/iVz2V0oNh5 — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) June 12, 2025


      Under the terms of Tehran’s July 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)
      deal with the Obama administration, the IAEA was granted unimpeded access to Iran’s
      nuclear complexes to ensure the country was not using the facilities to develop
      weapons. Its inspectors collected a wealth of information on and in the sites,
      including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents.


      It is an open question whether this intelligence bonanza was shared with the U.S.
      and Israel, and played any role in the 12-Day War. Iranian lawmakers aren’t waiting
      for proof, and on June 25, they unanimously passed legislation to suspend cooperation
      with the Association indefinitely.


      Exiting the Non-Proliferation Treaty is being openly debated in the Islamic Republic
      as well. Maintaining the narrative that Iran’s nuclear program has been eliminated
      may serve a strategic purpose for Washington, allowing it to argue against further
      diplomatic engagement. “The polite fiction that Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were
      destroyed is helpful to keep the peace,” says Tyler Weaver.


      ‘Beyond Themselves’


      The question of what happens next is likewise an open one. Alex McKay, of the
      Marx Engels Lenin Institute and Decline & Fall, notes that while “this latest
      regime change attempt is over, plots against Iran by the Anglo-American empire,
      and its Israeli proxy, will continue,” as “the imperialist powers cannot countenance
      Iran being a sovereign, independent nation.”


      However, he believes the “total failure” of the recent operation against the Islamic
      Republic cannot be understated, and left U.S.-Israeli weakness and vulnerability
      writ unambiguously large.


      “Once it became clear the hoped-for palace coup or color revolution wouldn’t materialize,
      the U.S. was left without many options, and a number of unpalatable choices, McKay
      tells MintPress News.


      To actually destroy the Islamic Republic would take a long-term military campaign,
      possibly including a ground invasion. The U.S. has avoided wars as dangerous as
      this would be ever since their defeat in Vietnam. Imperialist powers of the world
      prefer to wage their wars via air power, terrorist acts, proxy armies, espionage
      and cultural subversion.”


      A large-scale air war against Iran “also carried enormous risks,” such as the
      Iranians closing the Strait of Hormuz or targeting oil infrastructure across the
      Gulf states hosting U.S. bases. Either approach would “lead to a spike in oil
      prices, and plunge the economies of imperialist nations into a deep recession,”
      McKay observes. As it was, the 12-Day War led to a brief surge in oil prices,
      which reversed once the ceasefire commenced. Meanwhile, vessels traversing Hormuz
      are subject to “intense levels of GPS jamming.”


      Such moves suggest that while Tehran’s missile onslaught may be over, it is under
      no illusions that it effectively remains at war with Israel and Tel Aviv’s Western
      puppetmasters, and must remain ever-vigilant as a result.


      It is evident that this perspective is widely shared among Iranian citizens. Far
      from destabilizing and fracturing the country and triggering the revolutionary
      government’s collapse, the population is more united than ever against Western
      powers. As one patriotic Iranian celebrated on ‘X’:


      We are now aware of our shortcomings more than ever and in dire need of some changes.
      Iran’s biggest achievement or gift wasn’t on the battlefield but at home amongst
      the people, becoming as one. Younger generations who had not experienced…the Revolution
      or the [war with Iraq] now tasted something beyond themselves. It gave them the
      identity they were longing for.”


      Should Israel again attempt to foment all-out war with Iran, it will be up against
      an adversary far more prepared than this time round, with nigh-universal domestic
      support for total victory, which may mean Tel Aviv’s final destruction, and the
      vanquishing of U.S. bases across West Asia. Tehran is also likely to emerge better
      armed, given that on June 26, China convened an emergency meeting with Iran and
      Russia’s defense ministers. It is now up to Netanyahu to make the next move, which
      may be his very last.

      against Iran, targeting military and nuclear sites, which resulted in significant

      Iran, which launched missile attacks on Israeli cities, causing widespread panic
      and damage. As the conflict escalated, the U.S. intervened, conducting airstrikes
      on Iranian nuclear facilities, but these strikes ultimately failed to achieve
      their intended goals, leading to a ceasefire by June 22. Analysts suggest that
      the conflict, termed the "12 Day War," exposed Israel's vulnerabilities and strengthened
      Iran's resolve and unity against foreign aggression. The aftermath has left both
      Israel and the U.S. questioning their military capabilities and strategies, while
      Iran has signaled its intent to remain vigilant and prepared for future confrontations.
      The war has also led to a significant shift in public sentiment within Iran, fostering
      a sense of national identity and resilience against Western powers.

      By Jonathan Cook


      U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed predictable outrage at the weekend
      that the BBC had inadvertently broadcast punk band Bob Vylan leading crowds at
      Glastonbury in a chant of “Death to the IDF” – the “Israel Defence Forces” that
      have been responsible for slaughtering many tens of thousands of Palestinians
      in Gaza over the past 21 months.


      He called the chant “appalling hate speech” — apparently unaware that there are
      far worse crimes than hating soldiers carrying out the mass slaughter of children.
      Those worse things, of course, include slaughtering children en masse.


      The BBC apologised, calling the band’s comments “deeply offensive” – more offensive,
      apparently, than Israel bombing and starving the children of Gaza.

      (@aldnmarki) June 30, 2025


      Glastonbury’s organisers condemned the chant, saying there was no space for “hate
      speech or antisemitism” — apparently assuming, wrongly, that all Jews identify
      not just with the state of Israel but with an Israeli military widely accused
      by genocide experts of committing genocidal violence in Gaza.


      I’m a British Jew in England




      I didn’t interpret #DeathToTheIDF as a call for people to kill me because




      1. I’m not in the IDF




      2. It doesn’t call for the death of individuals – the clue is in “The IDF”

      Police are investigating Bob Vylan, a musical duo, to see whether they have committed
      a criminal offence, or possibly a terrorist one. As far as we know, the same police
      are doing nothing to investigate some 10 British citizens known to have travelled
      abroad to join the Israeli military, the IDF, committing the Gaza genocide.


      [On Monday, the U.S. State Department cancelled the group’s visas ahead of a U.S.
      tour scheduled to begin in the fall and United Talent Agency dropped the duo,
      according to The Hollywood Reporter.]


      On Sunday, the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire grilled Starmer’s health secretary, Wes
      Streeting, on remarks from the Israeli embassy in London condemning what it termed
      “the normalisation of extremist language” and the “glorification of violence”
      at Glastonbury.


      Unexpectedly, Streeting avoided jumping whole-heartedly on the media outrage band-wagon,
      led by the Mail on Sunday, whose front page demanded the arrest of the two band
      members for what the paper wrongly described as a chant demanding “Death to Israelis”.


      The Mail, apparently, believes that all Israelis, presumably including the country’s
      children, are currently serving in the Israeli military.


      "I''d say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order"




      Health Secretary Wes Streeting responds to Israel''s claims on Glastonbury''s
      "glorification of violence", saying "Israeli settler terrorists" carried out "unwanton
      acts of violence"#BBCLauraK https://t.co/v2HwddQuYE pic.twitter.com/DRoqBMrVM6
      — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) June 29, 2025


      There are four important points to make about the interview between Derbyshire
      and Streeting:


      1. The Israeli embassy in London, like the Israeli government it represents, has
      precisely no concerns about the “glorification of violence” when Israel is doing
      either the glorifying or the violence.


      Israel is currently celebrating its “success” in slaughtering and maiming hundreds
      of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, including huge numbers of children; attacks
      by its soldiers and state-backed Jewish settler militias on Palestinian civilians
      in the West Bank; its eradication of whole communities in Lebanon; and its bombing
      of residential tower blocks across Tehran, killing many hundreds.


      Violence has been Israel’s signature policy for the past 21 months — and long
      before that. Israel has revelled in the carnage it has inflicted on populations
      across the region.


      In a post on social media, the Israeli embassy additionally argued of Bob Vylan’s
      chant:


      “When speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing,
      it must be called out — especially when amplified by public figures on prominent
      platforms.”


      And yet public figures from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Starmer
      have incited against the Palestinians, with Netanyahu comparing them to “Amalek”,
      a people the Israelites were commanded by God to exterminate, and Starmer terming
      the wholesale starvation of the people of Gaza an act by Israel of “self-defence”.


      Israeli officials from Netanyahu down have advocated the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.
      And, even more seriously, Israel has not just threatened but repeatedly carried
      out the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under its belligerent rule.


      2. It is beyond ridiculous for the BBC to echo the Israeli government in prioritising
      a harsh crackdown on words at Glastonbury “glorifying violence” towards Israeli
      soldiers ahead of the actual violence of genocide being committed by those Israel
      soldiers.


      The BBC has avoided criticising the Israeli government for its actual violence
      — its bombing and active starvation of Palestinian civilians — and the Starmer
      government for colluding in that violence, or what the International Court of
      Justice termed more than a year ago a “plausible” genocide by Israel.


      As a recent report by the Centre for Media Monitoring confirmed, the BBC has dramatically
      skewed its language to present Israel, the aggressor, in a more favourable light
      than the victim, the Palestinians of Gaza. The BBC’s own whistleblowing journalists
      have warned that the state broadcaster has all but banned the use of the word
      “genocide”, even by experts on the matter.


      [See: Jonathan Cook: The BBC’s Complicity in Genocide]


      By arming Israel, by organising spy flights over Gaza from RAF base Akrotiri on
      Cyprus, and by providing diplomatic cover, Starmer has effectively glorified Israel’s
      slaughter of Palestinian children in the enclave.


      Bob Vylan’s chants of “Death to the IDF” have a far more dangerous counterpart
      in Starmer’s recital of Israel’s “right to defend itself” when that “defence”
      involves Israel mercilessly starving Gaza’s population of food, water and power.


      Bob Vylan are a punk band; Starmer is the British prime minister, the man who
      directs Britain’s foreign policy and directs its army.


      No one, least of all the BBC, has held Israeli or British officials accountable
      not just for glorifying violence but for actually carrying it out on an industrial
      scale for nearly two years.


      But the BBC is suddenly interested in holding to account two punk musicians for
      leading a chant — one that made a symbolic, hypothetical threat of violence —
      against an Israeli military carrying out the ultimate form of violence, an actual
      genocide.


      In a serious media, Israel’s supposed “concerns” about the glorification of violence
      and extremist language would be laughed off the stage rather than respectfully
      aired.


      3. Streeting is being congratulated and condemned in equal measure on social media
      for refusing to be drawn into the Mail and BBC’s confected outrage. “I’d say to
      the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order,” he responded to Derbyshire.
      But hang on a minute. Streeting’s resistance to Derbyshire’s line of questioning
      was perhaps unexpected. But it also, let us not forget, serves the interests of
      both the Starmer and Israeli governments.


      Streeting’s insistence that Israel “get its house in order” had, as he made clear,
      nothing to do with its 21-month slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. Starmer is
      still defining the Gaza genocide as Israel’s supposed “right to defend itself.”


      In responding to Derbyshire, Streeting expressed concern only at what he called
      violent “settler attacks” in the West Bank. He said the Israeli embassy needed
      to “get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and
      the settlers in the West Bank.”


      This was intended purely as deflection, designed to serve Starmer and Israel,
      the West’s key client state in the oil-rich Middle East. It benefits the U.K.
      government to make an issue of West Bank settler attacks — and present them as
      disorganised, random violence by individual extremists that the Israeli government
      is not responsible for but needs to get a firmer grip on.


      By highlighting problems in the West Bank, the Starmer government can avoid addressing
      the genocide in Gaza and the Israeli state’s clear responsibility for that genocide.
      Which is precisely why in recent weeks Britain has made so much noise about imposing
      feeble penalties on a handful of extremist settlers and two fascist ministers
      in Netanyahu’s government that represent those settlers.


      Starmer and Streeting’s prioritising of Israel’s West Bank violence over Israel’s
      Gaza violence is a switch and bait twice over.


      Most of the violence in the West Bank is not coming from settler extremists, even
      though they are the ones being punished by the U.K. It is coming from the Israeli
      military, which has bulldozed thousands of homes there over the past year, driving
      40,000 Palestinians off their lands.


      Further, settler violence is not random. It is coordinated with Israeli field
      commanders, many of them settlers themselves, to uproot Palestinians so that Israel
      can move in Jewish settlers to colonise the land — or, in the words of successive
      Israeli governments, “Judaise” it.


      None of this is new either. Israel has engineered and imposed a violent, apartheid
      system on Palestinians for decades to make life unbearable and encourage them
      to leave their homeland.


      Second, Glastonbury’s anger-fuelled chant against the IDF was not primarily motivated
      by Israel’s violent actions in the West Bank. It was against the Israeli military
      for committing a genocide in Gaza, which the British government has been supporting.


      Streeting’s aim was to drag the debate on to safer territory for him and Starmer:
      that Britain needs to deal not with a genocide in Gaza but with a handful of violent
      loons in the West Bank.


      Even in criticising the Israeli government for not doing enough to tackle settler
      violence, Streeting is still operating within the confines of a public discourse
      dictated by Israel, which prefers any criticism to be directed at individuals
      not at the Israeli state behind those individuals.


      4. The BBC, the Starmer government and the Israel lobby are all delighted to play
      their part in this game of deflection and deception because these kinds of moral
      panics obscure the real issue: that all these parties are actively colluding in
      Israel’s genocide in Gaza.


      While the media and government can now have a long backwards and forwards about
      whether criticism of Israel’s genocidal army needs to be defined in law as a criminal
      offence or “terrorism”, Israel will get a free pass to continue with the real
      terrorism: a genocide in Gaza.


      Famously, the black civil rights fighter Malcolm X observed of the role of the
      media:


      “They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent,
      and that’s power. … If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating
      the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”


      Sixty years on, nothing has changed.

      By Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares / Other News


      The attack by Israel and the US on Iran had two significant effects. First, it
      once again exposed the root cause of turmoil in the region: Israel’s project to
      “reshape the Middle East” through regime-change, aimed at maintaining its dominance
      and blocking a Palestinian state. Second, it highlighted the futility and recklessness
      of this strategy. The only path to peace is a comprehensive agreement that addresses
      Palestine’s statehood, Israel’s security, Iran’s peaceful nuclear program, and
      the economic recovery of the region.


      Israel wants to topple the Iranian government because Iran has supported proxies
      and non-state actors aligned with the Palestinians. Israel has also consistently
      undermined US-Iran diplomacy regarding Iran’s nuclear program.


      Instead of endless wars, Israel’s security can be ensured by two key diplomatic
      steps –ending militancy by establishing a Palestinian state with UN Security Council
      guarantees, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful and verifiable
      nuclear program.


      The far-right Israeli government’s refusal to accept a Palestinian state is the
      root of the problem.


      When the British empire promised a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine in 1917,
      the Palestinian Arabs constituted 90% of the population and Jews less than 10%
      of the population. In 1947, with US intense lobbying, the UN General Assembly
      voted to grant 56% of Palestine to a new Zionist state, while the Jews were only
      33% of the population. Palestinians rejected this as a violation of their right
      to self-determination. After the 1948 war, Israel expanded to 78% of Palestine,
      and in 1967, occupied the remaining 22%—Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and
      the Golan Heights.


      Instead of returning occupied lands in exchange for peace, Israeli right-wing
      politicians insisted on permanent control of 100% of the land, with the Likud
      founding charter declaring in 1977 that there would be only Israeli sovereignty
      “between the Sea and Jordan”.


      Netanyahu represents this policy of domination – and has served as Prime Minister
      for a total of 17 years since 1996. When he came to power, he and his US neocon
      allies authored the “Clean Break” strategy to block the creation of a Palestinian
      state. Instead of pursuing land for peace, Israel aimed to reshape the Middle
      East by overthrowing governments that supported the Palestinian cause. The US
      would be the implementing partner of this strategy.


      This is exactly what happened after 9/11, as the US led or sponsored wars against
      Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon (U.S. funding and arming Israeli aggressions),
      Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (CIA operation during 2010’s), Sudan (supporting
      rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011), and Somalia (backing Ethiopia’s invasion
      in 2006).


      Contrary to the glib promises by Netanyahu to the US Congress in 2002 — that regime
      change in Iraq would bring a new day to the Middle East — the 2003 Iraq War augured
      the events that were to come across the region. Iraq descended into turmoil, and
      since then, each new war has brought death, destruction, and economic disarray.


      This month, Israel attacked Iran even as negotiations between Iran and the US
      were underway to ensure the peaceful use of Iran’s nuclear program – repeating
      the same WMD propaganda that Netanyahu used to justify the Iraq War.


      Israel has been claiming for more than 30 years that Iran is on the verge of acquiring
      nuclear weapons. However, on June 18, 2025, the IAEA Director General stated that
      there is “no proof of a systematic effort” by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.
      More to the point, Iran and the US were actively engaged in negotiations according
      to which the IAEA would monitor and verify the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear
      program.


      The attack on Iran proves yet again the futility and nihilism of Netanyahu’s approach.
      The Israeli and US attacks accomplished nothing positive. According to most analysts,
      Iran’s enriched uranium remains intact, but is now in a secret location rather
      than under IAEA monitoring. In the meantime, with Israel’s ongoing genocide in
      Gaza – neither peace nor security have been achieved.


      Israel has driven the region to a 4,000-km swash of violence from Libya to Iran
      through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately aimed
      at preventing a State of Palestine by “remaking” the Middle East.


      The solution is clear: it is time for the United States to recognize that its
      own strategic interests require a decisive break from partnering in Israel’s destructive
      strategy.


      Prioritizing genuine peace in the Middle East is not only a moral imperative,
      but a fundamental U.S. interest—one that can only be achieved through a comprehensive
      peace deal. The key pillar of this deal is for the US to lift its veto on a Palestinian
      State on the borders of 4 June 1967, and to do so at the start, not in some vague
      distant future that never actually arrives.


      For more than 20 years, Arab nations have backed a practical peace plan. So too
      has the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), with its 57 member countries,
      and the League of Arab States (LAS), with its 22 members. So too have almost all
      the nations in the UN General Assembly. So too has the International Court of
      Justice in its 2024 ruling that Israel’s occupation is illegal. Only Israel, with
      support from the US veto, has stood in the way.


      Here is a seven-point peace plan in which all parties would benefit. Israel would
      gain peace and security. Palestine would achieve statehood. Iran would win an
      end to economic sanctions. The US would win an end to costly and illegal wars
      fought on Israel’s behalf, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation if the
      current violence continues. The Middle East would win economic development, security
      and justice.


      – First,an immediate ceasefire would apply across the entire region – and the
      ceasefire would include an immediate release of all hostages and prisoners.


      – Second, the UN Security Council would vote upfront to welcome Palestine as the
      194th UN Member State on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
      Israel and Palestine could subsequently agree on mutually desired border adjustments.


      – Third,Israel would withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967. UN-mandated
      international forces would ensure a peaceful, orderly transition, a transfer of
      Palestinian territories to Palestinian authorities, and mutual security for both
      Israel and Palestine.


      – Fourth, the territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed for Lebanon,
      Syria, and all states in the region. All non-state armed groups would be demilitarized,
      and foreign troops would be withdrawn.


      – Fifth, the UN Security Council would adopt an updated nuclear agreement with
      Iran, including binding verification, and with all economic sanctions on Iran
      lifted alongside Iran’s verified compliance with the peaceful uses of its nuclear
      program.


      – Sixth, Israel and all Arab and Islamic states would establish full diplomatic
      relations following the admission of the State of Palestine as UN member state.


      – Seventh, the Middle East nations would establish an international fund for rebuilding
      the war-torn parts of Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, with contributions coming
      from within the region and from external sources.

    one_sentence_summary: The recent Israeli and US attack on Iran underscores the ongoing
      turmoil in the Middle East, driven by Israel's refusal to accept a Palestinian

      and economic recovery.
    paragraph_summary: The recent attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran has underscored
      the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, primarily driven by Israel's strategy
      to maintain dominance and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. This
      approach has proven futile, as it perpetuates violence and instability rather
      than achieving security for Israel or peace in the region. The authors argue that
      a comprehensive peace agreement addressing Palestinian statehood, Israel's security,
      Iran's nuclear program, and regional economic recovery is essential. They propose
      a seven-point peace plan that includes a ceasefire, recognition of Palestine as
      a UN member state, withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied territories, and
      lifting sanctions on Iran, emphasizing that genuine peace is not only a moral
      obligation but also a vital U.S. interest. The article calls for a shift away
      from destructive policies and a commitment to a diplomatic resolution that benefits
      all parties involved.

      Israeli forces ramped up their genocidal assault on the Gaza Strip Monday, killing
      at least 95 Palestinians in attacks including massacres at a seaside café and
      a humanitarian aid distribution center and bombings of five school shelters housing
      displaced families and a hospital where refugees were sheltering in tents.


      An Israeli strike targeted the al-Baqa Café in western Gaza City, one of the few
      operating businesses remaining after 633 days of Israel’s obliteration of the
      coastal strip and a popular gathering place for journalists, university students,
      artists, and others seeking reliable internet service and a respite from nearly
      21 months of near-relentless attacks.


      Medical sources said at least 33 civilians were killed and nearly 50 others wounded
      in the massacre, including footballer Mustafa Abu Amira, photojournalist Ismail
      Abu Hatab—who survived an earlier Israeli airstrike and is reportedly the 227th
      journalists killed by Israel since October 2023—and prominent artist Frans Al-Salmi,
      whose final painting depicting a young Palestinian woman killed by Israeli forces
      resembles photographs of its slain creator posted on social media after her killing.


      Warning: Photos shows image of death

      returned to his work as a journalist.

      Survivor Ali Abu Ateila toldThe Associated Press that the café was crowded with
      women and children at the time of the attack.


      “Without a warning, all of a sudden, a warplane hit the place, shaking it like
      an earthquake,” he said.


      Another survivor of the massacre told Britain’s Sky News: “All I see is blood…
      Unbelievable. People come here to take a break from what they see inside Gaza.
      They come westward to breathe.”


      Eyewitness Ahmed Al-Nayrab toldAgence France-Presse that a “huge explosion shook
      the area.”


      “I saw body parts flying everywhere, and bodies cut and burned,” he said. “It
      was a scene that made your skin crawl.”


      Witnesses and officials said Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) troops opened fire on
      Palestinians seeking food and other humanitarian aid from a U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation distribution point in southern Gaza, killing 15 people amid near-daily
      massacres of aid-seekers.


      “We were targeted by artillery,” survivor Monzer Hisham Ismail told The Associated
      Press. Another survivor, Yousef Mahmoud Mokheimar, told the AP that Israeli troops
      “fired at us indiscriminately.” Mokheimar was shot in the leg, another man who
      tried to rescue him was also shot.


      IDF troops have killed nearly 600 Palestinian aid-seekers and wounded more than
      4,000 others over the past month, with Israeli military officers and soldiers
      saying they were ordered to deliberately fire on civilians in search of food and
      other necessities amid Israel’s weaponized starvation of Gaza.


      Another 13 people were reportedly killed Monday when IDF warplanes bombed an aid
      warehouse in the Zeitoun quarter of southern Gaza City, according to al-Ahli Baptist
      Hospital officials cited by The Palestine Chronicle. IDF warplanes also reportedly
      bombed five schools housing displaced families, three of them in Zeitoun. Israeli
      forces also bombed the courtyard of al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central
      Gaza, where thousands of forcibly displaced Palestinian families are sheltering
      in tents. It was reportedly the 12th time the hospital has been bombed since the
      start of the war.


      The World Health Organization has documented more than 700 attacks on Gaza healthcare
      facilities since October 2023. Most of Gaza’s hospitals are out of service due
      to Israeli attacks, some of which have been called genocidal by United Nations
      experts.

      aftermath, he said Israel had given them no warning. pic.twitter.com/vlJnyxNxty

      Israel’s overall behavior in the war is the subject of an ongoing International
      Court of Justice genocide case, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and crimes
      against humanity in Gaza, including murder and using starvation as a weapon of
      war.


      Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed or wounded more than 204,000 Palestinians
      in Gaza, including over 14,000 people who are missing and presumed dead and buried
      under rubble, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, whose casualty figures have
      been found to be generally accurate and even a likely undercount by peer-reviewed
      studies.


      The intensified IDF attacks follow Israel’s issuance of new forced evacuation
      orders amid the ongoing Operation Gideon’s Chariots, an ongoing offensive which
      aims to conquer and indefinitely occupy all of Gaza and ethnically cleanse much
      of its population, possibly to make way for Jewish recolonization as advocated
      by many right-wing Israelis.

      amid accusations of genocide and war crimes against Israeli leadership. The situation
      continues to deteriorate as forced evacuations and military operations aim to
      further control and occupy Gaza, raising international concerns about human rights
      violations and humanitarian crises in the region.
