summary: |
  The ongoing crisis in Gaza and its international reverberations continue to dominate geopolitical discourse. As the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsens, Western governments are increasingly pressured by their own citizens to reconsider support for Israel, even as military aid persists. **Chris Hedges** notes that Israel faces a mounting public relations challenge, with Western leaders “forced to justify their complicity in the face of mounting civilian deaths and starvation in Gaza.”
  
  In the United States, the political establishment remains steadfast in its support for Israel, despite widespread outrage over the humanitarian toll. President Trump has not only reaffirmed his backing for Israeli actions but, according to **Chris Hedges**, has encouraged further escalation against Hamas following the collapse of ceasefire negotiations. This stance is mirrored in American media, where nearly half of major opinion pieces supported Trump’s recent strikes on Iran, and only a minority offered critical perspectives. **Hedges** highlights this as indicative of a broader “disparity in media coverage regarding the legality and morality of the strikes,” underscoring the limited space for dissent in mainstream discourse.
  
  Domestically, the fallout from the conflict is influencing policy and civil liberties. Columbia University’s recent settlement with the federal government, which includes over $200 million in payments and new restrictions on campus demonstrations, exemplifies the tightening of speech and protest rights. The adoption of the IHRA antisemitism framework and expanded arrest powers for campus security, as reported by **Chris Hedges**, reflect a growing trend to conflate criticism of Israeli policy with antisemitism, raising concerns about the erosion of free speech.
  
  Looking ahead, the majority of analysts, including **Chris Hedges**, predict that unless there is a significant shift in U.S. policy or a major public mobilization, the current trajectory will persist: Israel will continue its military operations in Gaza with U.S. backing, Western governments will struggle to balance public opinion with strategic alliances, and domestic policies will further restrict dissent. There is a high chance that humanitarian conditions in Gaza will deteriorate further, and it is quite likely that protest movements and legal challenges over free speech will intensify in the U.S. and Europe.

      the public relations war is proving to be a lot more difficult for Israel than
      the genocide against the Palestinian people. As the conscience of Western publics
      pushes their governments to stop supporting Israel’s historic crimes, U.S. and
      European governments are forced to make displays of scolding Israel. But that
      act is getting old. The money and guns keep flowing as the killing and starvation
      keeps growing. Western allies want Israel to make a gesture that it still has
      a shred of humanity left. At various junctures during the slaughter, U.S. and
      European governments have disingenuously leveled  criticism of Israel’s treatment
      of Palestinian civilians to keep their own populations at bay. For instance, during
      the last U.S. presidential campaign, with a large number of Democrats condemning
      Israel for their actions, Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris had to issue criticism
      of Israel while insincerely repeating that they were working “tirelessly” for
      a ceasefire. This was fake because if the Biden or now Trump administrations really
      want to stop the killing they can do it almost immediately: tell Israel no more
      guns and money if the killing doesn’t stop. The German authorities, who seem to
      relish the opportunity to enforce a new genocide, could do the same, as Germany
      is Israel’s second largest arms supplier after the U.S. Brave German police beating
      a defenseless woman on the street.  Germany''s finest. When descendants of the
      victims of your forebearers'' genocide say it''s okay to join in a new one and
      brutally suppress those who object. Germany, you seem to jump at the opportunity.

      Whenever Western governments start feeling the heat they tell Israel to cool it
      for a while and stage some kind of show of humanitarian aid. Israel usually complies
      because they are fighting two wars: one of ethnic cleansing and/or extermination
      of the Palestinians, and the other a public relations war with the Western public,
      particularly its youth. As Consortium News reported last week, Israel is inviting
      over 500 delegations of social media influencers to tour Israel and learn the
      right message to spread to their millions of followers because Israel realizes
      it is losing the PR war. The daily Haaretz reported : “Foreign Ministry officials
      say the tour delivers significant media, advocacy, and diplomatic benefits – and
      represents a strategic shift, as traditional outreach is no longer sufficient
      to shape public opinion. … We’re working with influencers, sometimes with delegations
      of influencers. Their networks have huge followings, and their messages are more
      effective than if they came directly from the ministry.” On Friday, Britain, France
      and Germany issued a joint statement saying the Gaza “humanitarian catastrophe
      must end now.” They said Israel must “immediately lift restrictions on the flow
      of aid.” “The humanitarian catastrophe that we are witnessing in Gaza must end
      now,” the joint statement says. “Withholding essential humanitarian assistance
      to the civilian population is unacceptable.” Italy separately said, “We can no
      longer accept carnage and famine.”  Barack Obama chimed in too, also on Friday.
      On Monday, Donald Trump said : “There is real starvation in Gaza — you can’t fake
      that.” France said it would recognize the State of Palestine,  a step too far
      for Britain, Germany and Italy, and which the U.S. condemned. These leaders’ consciences
      would be shocked if they indeed have a conscience. They’ve seen reports like this
      one from the BBC confirming that desperately starving people have been shot and
      killed as they try to reach the only food aid distribution points by the Israeli
      forces and private U.S. contractors. This is the best ever true news BBC ever
      made about Israel, 4 minutes but every minute is extremely important pic.twitter.com/ZnSEpPvusb
      — Furkan Gözükara (@GozukaraFurkan) July 26, 2025 And yet they keep sending 2,000
      lbs. bombs and F-35 spare parts. Nevertheless, Israel realizes it must win the
      PR war fought not against the Western leaders who back them, but against the Western
      public. (Western leaders are engaged in their own PR war with their people.) Thus
      on Sunday Israel announced it would begin an airlift of food into Gaza. It’s surely
      part of a genocidal plan to occasionally respond to this criticism, hold some
      fire and make a big show of letting in aid before resuming the gruesome task.
      It sure makes finishing a genocide more difficult. The Hard Part For Israel this
      is the hard part: completing a genocide while making it look like you are not
      completing a genocide.  In an age of mobile telephone cameras and wireless transmission
      of images from virtually anywhere by anyone, genocide while few are looking is
      a thing of the past. One way to mislead the public is to kill at a pace intended
      to fool them into thinking there is more or less routine combat going on in Gaza
      and an unfortunate number of civilians are just being killed in the crossfire.
      (There was an uproar over the Australian Broadcasting Corporation last week ignorantly
      reporting the deliberate murder of unarmed, starving civilians at the aid distribution
      points as having died in “the crossfire.”) So Israel needs to keep the official
      daily death toll in Gaza to around 100. Don’t start wiping out entire encampments,
      killing thousands a day. Make it look more or less like a normal war. Leave doubt
      in people’s minds. Netanyahu did say this would take a very long time . Israeli
      Defense Minister Israel Katz openly says the plan is to concentrate the entire
      2 million plus population of Gaza in a camp in the south to ready them for expulsion.
      And if Egypt and others refuse to take them?  The rate of killing in this concentration
      camp may well explode if Western governments keep tolerating this evil. But for
      now, the rate of killing allows a propagandist like Bret Stephens to argue in
      The New York Times that it can’t be genocide because the killing is too slow. 
      He actually wrote this: “If the Israeli government’s intentions and actions are
      truly genocidal — if it is so malevolent that it is committed to the annihilation
      of Gazans — why hasn’t it been more methodical and vastly more deadly? Why not,
      say, hundreds of thousands of deaths, as opposed to the nearly 60,000 that Gaza’s
      Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatant and civilian
      deaths, has cited so far in nearly two years of war? It’s not that Israel lacks
      the capacity to have meted vastly greater destruction than what it has inflicted
      so far.” Quick, somebody show the Genocide Convention to Stephens. It defines
      genocide in black and white: “In the present Convention, genocide means any of
      the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
      ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group;
      (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately
      inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical
      destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births
      within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”
      Stephens falls prey to a common misconception of genocide, namely that it depends
      on the number of people killed. Acts must be “committed with intent to destroy,
      in whole or in part .” The hardest part of proving genocide is intent. Israeli
      leaders have provided folders full of statements of genocidal intent. It was then
      followed by actions that systematically destroyed the conditions of life for the
      Palestinians of Gaza. One by one they wiped out the infrastructure of Palestinian
      culture and civilization: schools, universities, mosques, churches, museums, theaters,
      libraries , hospitals and incalculable residential buildings, while people were
      still living in them. There has been a wholesale assassination of journalists,
      artists, academics and doctors — and an imposed starvation. This is textbook genocide.
      The Big Lie sent out from Israel, parroted almost word-for-word by the likes of
      Stephens and Alan Dershowitz, Israel-defender supremo, and by an Israeli zealot
      who appeared on Piers Morgan’s show last, week with piercing, fanatical eyes is
      this: This is war, unfortunately civilians get killed and there is no army in
      the world that takes greater care to avoid civilian casualties than Israel’s,
      none. The zealot with Morgan went a step further to say he was “proud” of the
      conduct of the IDF in Gaza, to which Haaretz columnist Gideon Levy, also on the
      panel, said, “I’m sorry, only Nazis spoke like that.” Israeli journalist and writer

      of whom were expelled or suspended for two years. In response to these actions,
      Jewish Voice for Peace stated , “This is the latest in a series of recent moves
      by Columbia University that flagrantly — and falsely — invoke Jewish safety in
      an effort to appease authoritarian forces.” While Columbia has repeatedly shown
      itself willing to punish its students, suppress speech, and side with a repressive
      federal government, these latest actions are the most sweeping, and in essence
      hand over the keys to the university to an increasingly authoritarian executive.
      Columbia’s actions come at a time in which Israel has manufactured mass starvation
      in Gaza . At least 115 Palestinians have died by starvation due to Israel’s siege
      of Gaza and near-total blockade of humanitarian aid. In addition, more than 1,050
      Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks trying to access food from the militarized
      Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. These brutal killings of people desperate for food
      are part of Israel’s more than 22-month military assault on Gaza, in which nearly
      60,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 17,000 children. The
      federal government has used protests over Israel’s nearly two-year genocide of
      Palestinians in Gaza as an excuse to weaponize claims of antisemitism, all in
      a bid to pressure universities across the country to capitulate to its demands.
      It’s worth noting that this is a federal government with more ties to actual antisemitic
      extremists than any in recent history, and that this same government has been
      using authoritarian tactics to punish and extract ideological concessions from
      a wide range of institutions. While all of Columbia’s actions this week are troubling,
      its adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism is of particular concern because
      it is the most likely to be taken up at campuses across the U.S., and perhaps
      least likely to receive the kind of attention we have seen since Columbia’s deal
      was announced. The IHRA definition has faced considerable criticism since its
      inception and growing adoption for equating varying critiques of Israel as forms
      of antisemitism . Of the 11 examples of antisemitism included in the definition,
      seven are related to Israel. A wide range of scholars and activists, including
      me, argue that this definition weaponizes antisemitism, misusing it to repress
      legitimate debate about and critiques of the state of Israel and Zionism. Like
      those who celebrated Columbia’s “deal,” advocates of the IHRA definition say it
      is necessary for Jewish safety. Yet, in practice, that definition is being used
      as a political instrument to suppress speech, punish those who support Palestinian
      human rights, and as one of many tools to attack and dismantle higher education.
      Columbia’s adoption of IHRA not only threatens what can be studied, debated, and
      fought for on its campus; it is yet another canary in the coal mine when it comes
      to the future of free speech and activism on campuses across the country. Maligning
      Calls for Justice Undermines Safety for All If you have been on a college campus
      in the U.S. since October 7, it’s likely that you experienced, witnessed, or were
      indirectly impacted by the chilling effects of the Palestine exception to free
      speech , a term used to describe the pattern of suppression, punishment, and censorship
      related to speech in support for Palestine that would should be protected by the
      First Amendment. While the Palestine exception existed long before October 7,
      repression of Palestinian advocacy reached a fever pitch and was met with unprecedented
      state violence in the spring of 2024. On April 17, 2024, students at Columbia
      launched the first encampment in support of Palestine demanding the university
      divest from companies with ties to Israel, igniting student activism across the
      U.S. and globally leading to more than 120 other encampments. The students were
      drawing on the campus’ rich history of student activism, from the 1968 protests
      against the war in Vietnam to the 1985 protests against apartheid in South Africa.
      Like their peers of the past, students at Columbia played an important role in
      raising consciousness about the genocide in Palestine. Now, the adoption of the
      IHRA framework threatens to codify these protests as categorically antisemitic,
      further cementing the Palestine exception, and giving even greater power to university
      administrators to crack down on students and social movements. This new anti-discrimination
      policy allows administrators to falsely and formally label those supporting Palestine
      as antisemites, increasing the chilling effect of the Palestine exception by expanding
      the material consequences for anyone daring to speak out, including more frequent
      suspensions and expulsions, and defaming students and faculty as to frighten or
      at least to raise questions from peers and any future employers. The institutional
      chilling of speech on Palestine has already undermined the ability of many universities
      to respond to the Trump administration’s attacks, including its sweeping assault
      on diversity, equity, and inclusion, university governance, and the targeting
      and of immigrant students for deportation. This silence not only creates a climate
      of repression for anyone speaking up against genocide; those who focus on Palestine
      specifically – often who themselves are Palestinian – are left even more vulnerable
      to punishment. Notably, the lead drafter of the definition, Kenneth Stern, insisted
      that it wasn’t intended to stifle free speech, rather it was created to support
      governments in collecting data. Nor does he agree that antizionism should be equated
      with antisemitism . Importantly, the IHRA definition limits the ability of universities
      to actually address antisemitism on their campuses. This is because IHRA framework
      positions Jewish safety as necessarily in conflict with the safety of other minoritized
      groups, Palestinians in particular. The Diaspora Alliance writes that repressive
      forces “ claim to protect Jews while dangerously endorsing an antagonism between
      the human rights and safety of Jewish people, on the one hand, and the human rights
      and safety of other minoritized groups, on the other .” While scholars have debated
      the utility of definitions in addressing all forms of racism, including against
      Jews, there are other definitions and frameworks for developing a shared understanding
      of antisemitism. These include the Jerusalem Declaration , which has been the
      subject of some critique itself, the Oxford English Dictionary Definition , and
      the Diaspora Alliance’s explainer on antisemitism , each of which in varying degrees
      open more possibilities for solidarity, and shared struggle for collective safety.
      There are so many actions universities can take to address antisemitism; but adopting
      the IHRA definition is not one of them, and instead interrupts movement toward
      solidarity while handing over more power to authoritarians. A Green Light for
      Authoritarianism Columbia became the second university this year to adopt the
      IHRA framework, following Harvard, which adopted the definition in January. While
      the IHRA’s usage has been debated on campuses across the U.S., its adoption at
      Columbia and Harvard are significant because of the IHRA’s incorporation into
      anti-discrimination policy, and the circumstances under which they occurred. Both
      campuses have faced attacks from the federal government since the spring of 2024
      under the pretense of their alleged failure to address antisemitism. The attacks
      only increased following the election of Donald Trump, who leveraged hundreds
      of millions of dollars of federal funding in an attempt to force universities
      to capitulate to his demands. Columbia caved to the pressure early on. But while
      Harvard is notably fighting the Trump administration’s withdrawal of federal funds
      in court, they nonetheless adopted the IHRA definition as part of the settlement
      agreements of separate lawsuits. Both universities have also begun partnerships
      with the Anti-Defamation League, a fervent supporter of Israel, Zionism and the
      IHRA definition of antisemitism. The organization has played a significant role
      in attempts to repress speech and activism for Palestinian human rights, including
      on college campuses. Historian and McCarthyism scholar Ellen Schrecker argues
      that the repression of today is much worse than that of the McCarthyist period
      because it “ the repression that’s coming out of Washington, D.C., attacks everything
      that happens on American campuses .” During the McCarthy era, roughly 100 professors
      were targeted for being affiliated with the Communist Party or even having progressive
      political leanings. Today, faculty and staff have been targeted and fired for
      supporting Palestine, and students have been abducted by ICE, threatened with
      deportation, arrested, suspended, and expelled from their campuses for their expressed
      beliefs. Notably, universities are not alone in their increasing capitulation
      to the federal government, as prominent law firms, news outlets, and social media
      organizations have also caved in to the administration. The attempts to limit
      debate and critique of Israel and of Zionism alone warrant alarm, and in the context
      of an ongoing genocide, should be understood as complicity. But the willingness
      of institutions to bend and manipulate the definition of antisemitism has even
      more far-reaching implications. By turning discrimination on its head to protect
      only certain political identities, these institutions are giving a green light
      to an authoritarian executive to set the limits of political debate and inquiry.

      July 23 that it had accepted an unprecedented “deal” with the federal government
      to settle claims brought by the Trump administration that it had discriminated
      against Jewish students. While the settlement did not include an admission of
      wrongdoing by the university, Columbia has agreed to meet a wide range of demands,
      which include paying more than $200 million to the federal government, new restrictions
      on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures, and the approval of public safety
      officers with the power to arrest people on campus. Columbia also agreed to take
      on unprecedented university oversight of the Middle Eastern Studies Department,
      including reviewing its curriculum, and to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance
      Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism into its anti-discrimination policy,
      expanding the university’s ability to punish students and faculty who criticize
      Israel and Zionism. The $200 million payout was made public one day after Columbia

      For decades, countless U.S. officials have proclaimed that the bonds between the
      United States and Israel are unbreakable. Now, the ties that bind are laced with
      genocide . The two countries function as accomplices while methodical killing
      continues in Gaza, with both societies directly – and differently – making it
      all possible. The policies of Israel’s government are aligned with the attitudes
      of most Jewish Israelis. In a recent survey, three-quarters of them (and 64 percent
      of all Israelis) said they largely agreed with the statement that “there are no
      innocent people in Gaza” – nearly half of whom are children. “There is no more
      ‘permitted’ and ‘forbidden’ with regard to Israel’s evilness toward the Palestinians,”
      dissident columnist Gideon Levy wrote three months ago in the Israeli newspaper
      Haaretz . “It is permitted to kill dozens of captive detainees and to starve to
      death an entire people.” The biggest Israeli media outlets echo and amplify sociopathic
      voices. “Genocide talk has spread into all TV studios as legitimate talk. Former
      colonels, past members of the defense establishment, sit on panels and call for
      genocide without batting an eye.” Last week, Levy provided an update : “The weapon
      of deliberate starvation is working. The Gaza ‘Humanitarian’ Foundation, in turn,
      has become a tragic success. Not only have hundreds of Gazans been shot to death
      while waiting in line for packages distributed by the GHF, but there are others
      who don’t manage to reach the distribution points, dying of hunger. Most of these
      are children and babies…. They lie on hospital floors, on bare beds, or carried
      on donkey carts. These are pictures from hell. In Israel, many people reject these
      photos, doubting their veracity. Others express their joy and pride on seeing
      starving babies.” Unimpeded, a daily process continues to exterminate more and
      more of the 2.1 million Palestinian people who remain in Gaza – bombing and shooting
      civilians while blocking all but a pittance of the food and medicine needed to
      sustain life. After destroying Gaza’s hospitals, Israel is still targeting healthcare
      workers (killing at least 70 in May and June), as well as first responders and
      journalists . The barbarism is in sync with the belief that “no innocent people”
      are in Gaza. A relevant observation came from Aldous Huxley in 1936, the same
      year that the swastika went onto Germany’s flag: “The propagandist’s purpose is
      to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human.”
      Kristallnacht happened two years later. Renowned genocide scholar Omer Bartov
      explained during an interview on Democracy Now! in mid-July that genocide is “the
      attempt to destroy not simply people in large numbers, but to destroy them as
      members of a group. The intent is to destroy the group itself. And it doesn’t
      mean that you have to kill everyone. It means that the group will be destroyed
      and that it will not be able to reconstitute itself as a group. And to my mind,
      this is precisely what Israel is trying to do.” Bartov, who is Jewish and spent
      the first half of his life in Israel, said: “What I see in the Israeli public
      is an extraordinary indifference by large parts of the public to what Israel is
      doing and what it’s done in the name of Israeli citizens in Gaza. In part, it
      has to do with the fact that the Israeli media has decided not to report on the
      horrors that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is perpetrating in Gaza. You simply
      will not see it on Israeli television. If some pictures happen to come in, they
      are presented only as material that might be used by foreign propaganda against
      Israel. Now, Israeli citizens can, of course, use other media resources. We can
      all do that. But most of them prefer not to. And I would say that while about
      30 percent of the population in Israel is completely in favor of what is happening,
      and, in fact, is egging the government and the army on, I think the vast majority
      of the population simply does not want to know about it.” In Israel, “compassion
      for Palestinians is taboo except among a fringe of radical activists,” Adam Shatz
      wrote last month in the London Review of Books . At the same time, “the catastrophe
      of the last two years far exceeds that of the Nakba .” The consequences “are already
      being felt well beyond Gaza: in the West Bank, where Israeli soldiers and settlers
      have presided over an accelerated campaign of displacement and killing (more than
      a thousand West Bank Palestinians have been killed since 7 October); inside Israel,
      where Palestinian citizens are subject to increasing levels of ostracism and intimidation;
      in the wider region, where Israel has established itself as a new Sparta; and
      in the rest of the world, where the inability of Western powers to condemn Israel’s
      conduct – much less bring it to an end – has made a mockery of the rules-based
      order that they claim to uphold.” The loudest preaching for a “rules-based order”
      has come from the U.S. government, which makes and breaks international rules
      at will. During this century, in the Middle East, the U.S.-Israel duo has vastly
      outdone all other entities combined in the categories of killing, maiming, and
      terrorizing. In addition to the joint project of genocide in Gaza, and the USA’s
      long war on Iraq, the United States and Israel have often exercised an assumed
      prerogative to attack Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iran, along with encore U.S.
      missile strikes on Iraq as recently as last year. Israel’s grisly performance
      as “a new Sparta” in the region is coproduced by the Pentagon, with the military
      and intelligence operations of the two nations intricately entangled. The Israeli
      military has been able to turn Gaza into a genocide zone with at least 70 percent
      of its arsenal coming from the United States. While writing an afterword about
      the war on Gaza for the paperback edition of War Made Invisible , I mulled over
      the relevance of my book’s subtitle: “How America Hides the Human Toll of Its
      Military Machine.” As the carnage in Gaza worsened, the reality became clearer
      that the Orwellian-named Israel Defense Forces and U.S. Defense Department are
      essentially part of the same military machine. Their command structures are different,
      but they are part of the same geopolitical Goliath. “The new era in which Israel,
      backed by the U.S., dominates the Middle East is likely to see even more violence
      and instability than in the past,” longtime war correspondent Patrick Cockburn
      wrote this month. The lethal violence from Israeli-American teamwork is of such
      magnitude that it epitomizes international state terrorism. The genocide in Gaza
      shows the lengths to which the alliance is willing and able to go. While public
      opinion is very different in Israel and the United States, the genocidal results
      of the governments’ policies are indistinguishable. American public opinion about
      arming Israel is measurable. As early as June 2024, a CBS News poll found that
      61 percent of the public said that the U.S. should not “send weapons and supplies
      to Israel.” Since then, support for Israel has continued to erode . In sharp contrast,
      on Capitol Hill, the support for arming Israel is measurably high. When Bernie
      Sanders’s bills to cut off some military aid to Israel came to a vote last November,
      just 19 out of 100 senators voted yes. Very few of his colleagues voice anywhere
      near the extent of Sanders’s moral outrage as he keeps speaking out on the Senate
      floor. In the House, only 26 out of 435 members have chosen to become cosponsors
      of H.R.3565 , a bill introduced more than two months ago by Rep. Delia Ramirez
      that would prevent the U.S. government from sending certain bombs to Israel. “Israel
      is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War
      II,” the Congressional Research Service reports . During just the first 12 months
      after the war on Gaza began in October 2023, Brown University’s Costs of War project
      found, the “U.S. spending on Israel’s military operations and related U.S operations
      in the region” added up to $23 billion . The resulting profit bonanza for U.S.
      military contractors is notable. So is the fact that the U.S.-Israel partnership
      exerts great American leverage in the Middle East – where two-thirds of the world’s
      oil reserves are located. The politics of genocide in the United States involves
      papering over the big gap between the opinions of the electorate and the actions
      of the U.S. government. While the partnership between the governments of Israel
      and the United States has never been stronger, the partnership between the people
      of Israel and the United States has never been weaker. But in the USA, consent
      of the governed has not been necessary to continue the axis of genocide. Norman

      For decades, countless U.S. officials have proclaimed that the bonds between the
      United States and Israel are unbreakable. Now, the ties that bind are laced with
      genocide . The two countries function as accomplices while methodical killing
      continues in Gaza, with both societies directly – and differently – making it
      all possible. The policies of Israel’s government are aligned with the attitudes
      of most Jewish Israelis. In a recent survey, three-quarters of them (and 64 percent
      of all Israelis) said they largely agreed with the statement that “there are no
      innocent people in Gaza” – nearly half of whom are children. “There is no more
      ‘permitted’ and ‘forbidden’ with regard to Israel’s evilness toward the Palestinians,”
      dissident columnist Gideon Levy wrote three months ago in the Israeli newspaper
      Haaretz . “It is permitted to kill dozens of captive detainees and to starve to
      death an entire people.” The biggest Israeli media outlets echo and amplify sociopathic
      voices. “Genocide talk has spread into all TV studios as legitimate talk. Former
      colonels, past members of the defense establishment, sit on panels and call for
      genocide without batting an eye.” Last week, Levy provided an update : “The weapon
      of deliberate starvation is working. The Gaza ‘Humanitarian’ Foundation, in turn,
      has become a tragic success. Not only have hundreds of Gazans been shot to death
      while waiting in line for packages distributed by the GHF, but there are others
      who don’t manage to reach the distribution points, dying of hunger. Most of these
      are children and babies…. They lie on hospital floors, on bare beds, or carried
      on donkey carts. These are pictures from hell. In Israel, many people reject these
      photos, doubting their veracity. Others express their joy and pride on seeing
      starving babies.” Unimpeded, a daily process continues to exterminate more and
      more of the 2.1 million Palestinian people who remain in Gaza – bombing and shooting
      civilians while blocking all but a pittance of the food and medicine needed to
      sustain life. After destroying Gaza’s hospitals, Israel is still targeting healthcare
      workers (killing at least 70 in May and June), as well as first responders and
      journalists . The barbarism is in sync with the belief that “no innocent people”
      are in Gaza. A relevant observation came from Aldous Huxley in 1936, the same
      year that the swastika went onto Germany’s flag: “The propagandist’s purpose is
      to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human.”
      Kristallnacht happened two years later. Renowned genocide scholar Omer Bartov
      explained during an interview on Democracy Now! in mid-July that genocide is “the
      attempt to destroy not simply people in large numbers, but to destroy them as
      members of a group. The intent is to destroy the group itself. And it doesn’t
      mean that you have to kill everyone. It means that the group will be destroyed
      and that it will not be able to reconstitute itself as a group. And to my mind,
      this is precisely what Israel is trying to do.” Bartov, who is Jewish and spent
      the first half of his life in Israel, said: “What I see in the Israeli public
      is an extraordinary indifference by large parts of the public to what Israel is
      doing and what it’s done in the name of Israeli citizens in Gaza. In part, it

      that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider
      a tax-deductible donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost I testified
      at the New Jersey state capital in Trenton last week against Bill A3558 , which
      would adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition
      of antisemitism, which conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism. “This is a dangerous
      assault on free speech by seeking to criminalize legitimate criticism of Israeli
      policies,” I said. “The Trump administration’s campaign to ostensibly root out
      antisemitism on college campuses is clearly a trope to shut down free speech and
      deport non-citizens, even if they are here legally. This bill falsely conflates
      ethnicity with a political state. And let’s be clear, the brunt of repression
      on college campuses is directed against students and faculty who oppose the genocide
      in Gaza, 3,000 of whom were arrested and hundreds of whom were censored, suspended
      or expelled. Many of these students are Jewish. What about their rights? What
      about their constitutional protections?” “I have had numerous relationships with
      Israeli journalists and political leaders,” I went on. “I knew, for example, former
      Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin who negotiated the Oslo peace agreement.
      Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli ultranationalist who opposed the
      peace accord. Rabin stated bluntly on numerous occasions that the occupation was
      harmful to Israel. Israeli colleagues frequently criticize Israeli policies in
      the Israeli press in language that would be defined as antisemitic by this bill.”
      “For example,” I continued, “the Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, who served in
      the Israeli army and writes for the newspaper Haaretz, has called for sanctions
      to be imposed on Israel to stop the slaughter in Gaza, saying ‘Do to Israel what
      you did to South Africa.’” “Omer Bartov, who served as an Israeli company commander
      in the 1973 war, is Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Brown University,”
      I said. “He stated in an article on July 15 in The New York Times that his ‘inescapable
      conclusion has become that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian
      people.’” “These kinds of statements, and many more I can quote from Israeli colleagues
      and friends, would see them under this bill criminalized as antisemites,” I added.
      Committee chairman Robert Karabinchak , a Democrat, muted my microphone, banged
      his hammer for me to stop and allowed gaggles of Zionists, who openly harassed
      and insulted Muslims in the room, to jeer and shout me down. There I was arguing
      that this bill would curtail my free speech, at the same time I was being denied
      free speech. You can see my full testimony here . This cognitive dissonance defines
      the United States and Israel. The committee chairman also muted Raz Segal , the
      Israeli historian and genocide scholar and, in an especially callous move, chastised
      Mehdi Rabee, whose 14-year-old brother Amer was killed by Israeli soldiers in
      April 2025. “My 14-year-old brother who was from Saddlebrook, New Jersey, was
      murdered by the IDF,” Mehdi, his voice shaking with emotion, told the committee.
      “All he was doing was picking olives from an olive tree with his friends, which
      we have been doing as Palestinians for thousands of years. My brother, whom I
      will never see again, my brother who my parents will never watch graduate from
      high school or college. Assemblywoman Swain, my father and the Palestinian-American
      Community Center tried reaching out to you over and over. And all that we were
      met with was nothing but silence. Given your silence, you should not have the
      right to even consider voting for this bill until you meet with my family, who
      are under your district.” “I am going to ask you to stick to the bill,” Karabinchak
      interrupted. “This bill puts at risk my First Amendment right to criticize Israel
      for what they have done to my brother,” he went on. “I have a right to call Israel
      whatever I want to call it. When their policies mirror that of the Nazis, I have
      a right to call it as it is. I call on you to vote no in remembrance of my brother.”
      You can see Mehdi’s statement here . Karabinchak, angered that supporters gave
      Rabee a standing ovation, reduced all testimonies critical of the bill from three
      minutes to one minute. “Time is down to one minute,” he told the crowd of about
      400 in the committee and four overflow rooms. “I’m going to ask everybody now
      to speak, who wants to speak, is going to say ‘I oppose the bill’ or ‘I support
      the bill.’” He paused. “Let’s have some more claps,” he said, his voice dripping
      with sarcasm. “Let’s be happy now, right? I didn’t throw you out like I said I
      was going to. So now you just stifled the other people who have a right to speak.
      That’s what you just did! Understand what you did! Okay? One minute. One minute.
      That’s it. And I’m not going to be nice and say let’s rap it up. I’m going to
      shut the mic off. ” Our sin was that we dared to mention the unmentionable – the
      genocide in Gaza. The Zionists in the room were verbally and physically abusive
      to the Muslims who had come to oppose the bill. One Zionist repeatedly shoved
      himself into the bodies of those outside the state capital holding a rally against
      the bill. You can see his harassment here . Amy Gallatin , who is on the commission
      of the West Orange Human Relations Commission, “established by municipal ordinance
      in 1992 in order to create and foster values of diversity, equity and inclusion
      among groups in the community,” pulled up pictures on her iPad in one of the overflow
      rooms and said to those seated around her “Look, it’s Mohammed!” You can see her
      Islamophobic hate speech here . When Rabbi Yitzchok Deutsch made an emotional
      plea to save the people of Gaza Lisa Swain of District 38 and Assemblyman Avi
      Schnall of District 30, both Democrats, snickered and laughed as he spoke. You
      can see their reactions to Rabbi Deutsch here . Zionists, who painted lurid pictures
      of Jews living under harassment and in fear for their lives, and of Nazism supposedly
      running amok on the streets of New Jersey, were not muted, although their statements
      were hyperbolic to the extreme and often a product of over-active imaginations.
      They openly salivated at the adoption of the bill, which they said would give
      law enforcement the tools to criminalize those who engage in hate speech, which,
      if you read the “contemporary examples of antisemitism,” that accompany the IHRA,
      include speech that criticizes Israeli policies. The IHRA has been adopted by
      35 states, the District of Columbia and universities such as Harvard and Columbia
      . “The IHRA working definition of antisemitism includes protected criticism of
      Israel and its policies,” writes the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “For
      example, the definition declares that ‘denying the Jewish people their right to
      self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel
      is a racist endeavor,’ ‘drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to
      that of the Nazis,’ and ‘applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a
      behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation’ are all examples
      of antisemitism.” “If the Department of Education were to adopt this definition,
      and investigate universities for Title VI complaints based on it, college and
      university administrators would likely silence a range of protected speech including
      criticism of the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians, analogies likening
      Israeli policies to those of Nazi Germany, or sharing differing beliefs about
      the right to a Jewish state,” the ACLU continues. “People may disagree about whether
      such speech is antisemitic, but that debate is irrelevant to the First Amendment,
      which prohibits the government from censoring or penalizing core political speech.”
      U.S. attorney Kenneth S. Stern — a self-professed Zionist and the lead drafter
      of what became the IHRA definition of antisemitism — laments that the IHRA has
      been “grossly abused” to “restrict academic freedom and punish political speech,”
      including “pro-Palestinian speech.” The five committee members, who had clearly
      made up their minds before they entered the packed hearing room, unanimously passed
      the measure, which will go to the floor of the State Assembly for a vote. They
      will, like all politicians who bow before the dictates of the Israel lobby , no
      doubt, be compensated for their perfidy. America, like Israel, exists in a parallel
      reality. It denies the stark and incontrovertible reality of the live-streamed
      genocide. It slanders anyone, including Israeli holocaust scholars such as Professor
      Segal, as antisemites. I know, sadly, where this goes. I witnessed it in the many
      dictatorships I covered as a foreign correspondent for two decades in Latin America,
      the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans. Those of us who fight for an open society
      are silenced, attacked as traitors and criminals. We are blacklisted, censored
      and at times, locked up. If we can escape in time, we are forced into exile. As
      we are silenced, the sycophants, grifters, Christian fascists, billionaires, Zionists
      and thugs, elevated to the highest positions in the federal government by the
      Trump White House, are rewarded with absolute power, luxury and debauchery. Our
      corporate-indentured ruling class has no genuine political ideology. Political
      parties are a farce, a species of entertainment to beguile the population in our
      pretend democracy. Liberalism, and the values it claims to represent, is a spent
      and bankrupt force. The burlesque in the committee room in Trenton was another
      depressing reminder that there is little now that will halt our path towards an
      authoritarian state, not the press , not the universities , not the courts , which
      cannot enforce the few rulings made by courageous judges, not the political class
      , including the Democratic Party , and not the electoral process. We must resist,
      if only to assert our integrity and dignity, if only to stand in solidarity with
      the oppressed, if only to slow the consolidation of tyranny, if only to revel
      in the small pyrrhic victories that resistance alone makes possible. But we should
      not be fooled. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is now no way

    one_sentence_summary: Chris Hedges argues against New Jersey's Bill A3558, which
      he believes threatens free speech by conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism,
      and criticizes the broader implications of such measures on legitimate criticism
      of Israeli policies.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent testimony at the New Jersey state capital, Chris
      Hedges opposed Bill A3558, which seeks to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance
      Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, arguing that it dangerously equates
      anti-Zionism with antisemitism and threatens free speech. Hedges emphasized that
      this bill could criminalize legitimate criticism of Israeli policies, particularly
      in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza, where many students and faculty
      opposing the violence have faced repression. He highlighted the hypocrisy of the
      bill by noting that even Israeli journalists, such as Gideon Levy, who critique
      their own government's actions, could be labeled as antisemitic under this definition.
      Hedges called for recognition of the rights of those who dissent, including Jewish
      individuals, and criticized the conflation of ethnicity with political statehood.

    text: 'The Final, Final Solution – by Mr. Fish In one of the scariest moments in
      modern history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies
      that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider
      a tax-deductible donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost I testified
      at the New Jersey state capital in Trenton last week against Bill A3558 , which
      would adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition
      of antisemitism, which conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism. “This is a dangerous
      assault on free speech by seeking to criminalize legitimate criticism of Israeli
      policies,” I said. “The Trump administration’s campaign to ostensibly root out
      antisemitism on college campuses is clearly a trope to shut down free speech and
      deport non-citizens, even if they are here legally. This bill falsely conflates
      ethnicity with a political state. And let’s be clear, the brunt of repression
      on college campuses is directed against students and faculty who oppose the genocide
      in Gaza, 3,000 of whom were arrested and hundreds of whom were censored, suspended
      or expelled. Many of these students are Jewish. What about their rights? What
      about their constitutional protections?” “I have had numerous relationships with
      Israeli journalists and political leaders,” I went on. “I knew, for example, former
      Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin who negotiated the Oslo peace agreement.
      Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli ultranationalist who opposed the
      peace accord. Rabin stated bluntly on numerous occasions that the occupation was
      harmful to Israel. Israeli colleagues frequently criticize Israeli policies in
      the Israeli press in language that would be defined as antisemitic by this bill.”
      “For example,” I continued, “the Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, who served in
      the Israeli army and writes for the newspaper Haaretz, has called for sanctions
      to be imposed on Israel to stop the slaughter in Gaza, saying ‘Do to Israel what
      you did to South Africa.’” “Omer Bartov, who served as an Israeli company commander
      in the 1973 war, is Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Brown University,”
      I said. “He stated in an article on July 15 in The New York Times that his ‘inescapable
      conclusion has become that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian
      people.’” “These kinds of statements, and many more I can quote from Israeli colleagues
      and friends, would see them under this bill criminalized as antisemites,” I added.
      Committee chairman Robert Karabinchak , a Democrat, muted my microphone, banged
      his hammer for me to stop and allowed gaggles of Zionists, who openly harassed
      and insulted Muslims in the room, to jeer and shout me down. There I was arguing
      that this bill would curtail my free speech, at the same time I was being denied
      free speech. You can see my full testimony here . This cognitive dissonance defines
      the United States and Israel. The committee chairman also muted Raz Segal , the
      Israeli historian and genocide scholar and, in an especially callous move, chastised
      Mehdi Rabee, whose 14-year-old brother Amer was killed by Israeli soldiers in
      April 2025. “My 14-year-old brother who was from Saddlebrook, New Jersey, was
      murdered by the IDF,” Mehdi, his voice shaking with emotion, told the committee.
      “All he was doing was picking olives from an olive tree with his friends, which
      we have been doing as Palestinians for thousands of years. My brother, whom I
      will never see again, my brother who my parents will never watch graduate from
      high school or college. Assemblywoman Swain, my father and the Palestinian-American
      Community Center tried reaching out to you over and over. And all that we were
      met with was nothing but silence. Given your silence, you should not have the
      right to even consider voting for this bill until you meet with my family, who
      are under your district.” “I am going to ask you to stick to the bill,” Karabinchak
      interrupted. “This bill puts at risk my First Amendment right to criticize Israel
      for what they have done to my brother,” he went on. “I have a right to call Israel
      whatever I want to call it. When their policies mirror that of the Nazis, I have
      a right to call it as it is. I call on you to vote no in remembrance of my brother.”
      You can see Mehdi’s statement here . Karabinchak, angered that supporters gave
      Rabee a standing ovation, reduced all testimonies critical of the bill from three
      minutes to one minute. “Time is down to one minute,” he told the crowd of about
      400 in the committee and four overflow rooms. “I’m going to ask everybody now
      to speak, who wants to speak, is going to say ‘I oppose the bill’ or ‘I support
      the bill.’” He paused. “Let’s have some more claps,” he said, his voice dripping
      with sarcasm. “Let’s be happy now, right? I didn’t throw you out like I said I
      was going to. So now you just stifled the other people who have a right to speak.
      That’s what you just did! Understand what you did! Okay? One minute. One minute.
      That’s it. And I’m not going to be nice and say let’s rap it up. I’m going to
      shut the mic off. ” Our sin was that we dared to mention the unmentionable – the
      genocide in Gaza. The Zionists in the room were verbally and physically abusive
      to the Muslims who had come to oppose the bill. One Zionist repeatedly shoved
      himself into the bodies of those outside the state capital holding a rally against
      the bill. You can see his harassment here . Amy Gallatin , who is on the commission
      of the West Orange Human Relations Commission, “established by municipal ordinance
      in 1992 in order to create and foster values of diversity, equity and inclusion
      among groups in the community,” pulled up pictures on her iPad in one of the overflow
      rooms and said to those seated around her “Look, it’s Mohammed!” You can see her
      Islamophobic hate speech here . When Rabbi Yitzchok Deutsch made an emotional
      plea to save the people of Gaza Lisa Swain of District 38 and Assemblyman Avi
      Schnall of District 30, both Democrats, snickered and laughed as he spoke. You
      can see their reactions to Rabbi Deutsch here . Zionists, who painted lurid pictures
      of Jews living under harassment and in fear for their lives, and of Nazism supposedly
      running amok on the streets of New Jersey, were not muted, although their statements
      were hyperbolic to the extreme and often a product of over-active imaginations.
      They openly salivated at the adoption of the bill, which they said would give
      law enforcement the tools to criminalize those who engage in hate speech, which,
      if you read the “contemporary examples of antisemitism,” that accompany the IHRA,
      include speech that criticizes Israeli policies. The IHRA has been adopted by
      35 states, the District of Columbia and universities such as Harvard and Columbia
      . “The IHRA working definition of antisemitism includes protected criticism of
      Israel and its policies,” writes the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). “For
      example, the definition declares that ‘denying the Jewish people their right to
      self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel
      is a racist endeavor,’ ‘drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to
      that of the Nazis,’ and ‘applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a
      behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation’ are all examples
      of antisemitism.” “If the Department of Education were to adopt this definition,
      and investigate universities for Title VI complaints based on it, college and
      university administrators would likely silence a range of protected speech including
      criticism of the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians, analogies likening
      Israeli policies to those of Nazi Germany, or sharing differing beliefs about
      the right to a Jewish state,” the ACLU continues. “People may disagree about whether
      such speech is antisemitic, but that debate is irrelevant to the First Amendment,
      which prohibits the government from censoring or penalizing core political speech.”
      U.S. attorney Kenneth S. Stern — a self-professed Zionist and the lead drafter
      of what became the IHRA definition of antisemitism — laments that the IHRA has
      been “grossly abused” to “restrict academic freedom and punish political speech,”

      In Reporting (FAIR) In the four days of coverage after President Donald Trump
      ordered strikes on Iran (6/21–24/25), the New York Times , USA Today , Wall Street
      Journal and Washington Post responded with 36 opinion pieces and editorials. Almost
      half of these, 17, explicitly supported the illegal bombing, while only 7 (19%)
      took an overall critical view of the strikes—none of them in the Journal or the
      Post . Of the critical pieces, only three (one in the Times and two in USA Today
      ) opposed the idea on legal or moral grounds, challenging the idea that the United
      States has a right to attack a country that had not attacked it. This opposition
      rate of less than a fifth is in stark contrast to US public opinion on the matter,
      which showed that 56% of Americans opposed Trump’s bombing . Why wasn’t this reflected
      in the range of opinions presented by America’s top press outlets? These numbers
      highlight just how poorly represented the views of the public are in elite media.
      ‘Trump’s courageous and correct decision’ FAIR looked at all opinion pieces in
      the four papers that addressed Trump’s strikes on Iran, from June 21 through June
      24. Forty-seven percent (17) explicitly praised Trump’s unauthorized act of war.
      Many of these cheered the aggressive assertion of US power. The New York Times
      ’ Bret Stephens ( 6/22/25 ) lauded “Trump’s Courageous and Correct Decision,”
      which “deserves respect, no matter how one feels about this president and the
      rest of his policies.” At the Washington Post , David Ignatius ( 6/22/25 ) offered
      similar praise under the headline, “Trump’s Iran Strike Was Clear and Bold,” and
      the Wall Street Journal ’s editorial board ( 6/22/25 ) declared, “Trump Meets
      the Moment on Iran.” USA Today ( 6/22/25 ) published columnist Nicole Russell’s
      “Trump Warned Iran. Then He Acted Boldly to Protect America.” The headline was
      later changed to an even more laudatory: “Trump Was Right to Bomb Iran. Even Democrats
      Will Be Safer Because of It.”  In a Wall Street Journal guest column ( 6/24/25
      ), Karen Elliott House celebrated the “restor[ation] of US deterrence and credibility.”
      Some directly attempted to defend the strikes’ legality. In a Post guest column
      ( 6/23/25 ), Geoffrey Corn, Claire Finkelstein and Orde Kittrie claimed to explain
      “Why Trump Didn’t Have to Ask Congress Before Striking Iran.” The piece relied
      extensively on the playground rhetorical tool of if they did it, why can’t I?,
      confidently listing earlier US presidents’ attacks that defied constitutional
      law, as if past violations justify the current one. They asserted that “the operation
      also derives support from international law as an exercise of collective self-defense
      in defense of Israel,” ignoring the fact that international law does not allow
      you to “defend” yourself against a country that hasn’t attacked you—let alone
      the illogical formulation of the US engaging in “self-defense” on behalf of another
      country. USA Today columnist Dace Potas ( 6/22/25 ), who called the attacks “strategically
      the right move and a just action,” also defended the constitutionality of Trump’s
      strikes, attacking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s call to impeach Trump over
      the strikes: If the president is not able to respond to a hostile regime building
      weapons that could destroy entire American cities, then I’m not sure what else,
      short of an actual invasion of the homeland, would allow for him to act. That’s
      the thing about self-defense, though—it’s supposed to involve an attack . Journal
      columnist Gerard Baker ( 6/23/25 ), who called the attack “judicious and pragmatic,”
      likewise pointed to Iran’s nuclear program, claiming that “no one seriously doubts
      the Iran nuclear threat”—despite both US intelligence and the International Agency
      for Atomic Energy concluding otherwise. Yet another angle came from Times columnist
      Thomas Friedman ( 6/22/25 ), who argued that the “Attacks on Iran Are Part of
      a Much Bigger Global Struggle”—between the forces of “inclusion,” who believe
      in “more decent, if not democratic, governance,” and the forces of “resistance,”
      who “thrive on resisting those trends because conflict enables them to keep their
      people down.” Friedman called Trump’s strikes “necessary” for the right side to
      “triumph” in this good-vs-evil struggle. Questions without criticism Of the remaining
      opinion pieces, ten accepted the strikes as a fait accompli and offered analysis
      that mostly speculated about the future and offered no anti-bombing pushback.
      For instance, the Wall Street Journal published a commentary ( 6/23/25 ) asking
      “Can Iran Strike Back Effectively?” A New York Times op-ed ( 6/22/25 ) by security
      consultant Colin P. Clarke speculated about “How Iran Might Strike Back.” The
      Times also published columnist W.J. Hennigan’s piece ( 6/22/25 ) that warned that
      “We Have No Idea Where This War Will Go.” Hennigan speculated: “It’s almost certain
      we haven’t seen the end of US military action in this war,” but he did not indicate
      whether this might be a good or bad thing. Others were slightly more wary, such
      as a Times op-ed ( 6/23/25 ) headlined “What Bombs Can’t Do In Iran.” The Carnegie
      Endowment for International Peace’s Karim Sadjadpour asked, “Will this extraordinary
      act of war strengthen Tehran’s authoritarians or hasten their demise?” Sadjadpour
      tells readers that “while military strikes may expose an authoritarian regime’s
      weaknesses, they rarely create the conditions necessary for lasting democratic
      change”—yet he offers support for both possible outcomes. Similarly, the Washington
      Post ( 6/22/25 ) published a triple-bylined opinion piece debating the question:
      “Will the US/Iran Conflict Spin Out of Control?” Participant Jason Rezaian did
      not criticize the bombing itself, only the lack of strategy around it, judging
      that Trump’s idea of “decimating Iran’s defenses and then letting them stay in
      power to terrorize their citizens, dissidents and opponents around the world would
      be a massive failure” and concluding, “my concern is that there is no plan to
      speak of.” Attacking Trump, supporting war Of the seven articles that criticized
      Trump’s actions, more were critical of Trump and his personality or disregard
      of procedure than were opposed to the illegal and aggressive actions of an empire.
      Three of these came from USA Today ’s Rex Huppke . His first column ( 6/21/25
      ) argued that “Trump may have just hurled America into war because he was mad
      nobody liked his recent military parade.” His second piece ( 6/22/25 ) accused
      Trump of starting the war based on “vibes,” and rightly attacked the credibility
      of the administration, citing the numerous contradictory or false statements from
      US and Israeli officials. However, that column made it clear that Huppke hoped
      for a successful strike on Iran, even as he acknowledged it could end in “disaster”:
      If Trump’s bombing of Iran proves successful—and I, of course, hope it does—it’ll
      be dumb luck. But if it leads to disaster, it’ll be exactly what anyone paying
      attention to these reckless hucksters predicted. At the New York Times , former
      Biden Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote a guest column ( 6/24/25 ) under
      the headline: “Trump’s Iran Strike Was a Mistake. I Hope It Succeeds.” Blinken’s
      primary issue with Trump’s attack was that Blinken deemed it ineffective; his
      secondary concern was that his own State Department achievements were being overlooked:
      “Mr. Trump’s actions were possible only because of the work of the Obama and Biden
      administrations.” ‘International authoritarianism’ Of the 36 editorials and opinion
      pieces published by the top papers on the Iran bombing, only three (8%) explicitly
      opposed the bombing on legal or moral grounds. The New York Times and USA Today
      ran opinions grounded in legal arguments. USA Today also published human rights
      attorney Yasmin Z. Vafa on the human toll of this war on the citizens of Iran.
      In her Times op-ed ( 6/23/25 ), Yale Law School professor Oona A. Hathaway points
      out that the attacks were not only unconstitutional, but in violation of international
      law, as Trump did not seek approval from either Congress or the UN Security Council.
      Hathaway was the sole opinion writer to describe Trump’s illegal actions with
      the same diction usually reserved for America’s enemies: The seeming rise of authoritarianism
      at home is precipitating a kind of international authoritarianism, in which the
      American president can unleash the most powerful military the world has ever known
      on a whim. USA Today ‘s Chris Brennan ( 6/24/25 ) also emphasized Trump’s lack
      of congressional approval under the headline: “There’s a Legal Way to Go to War.
      Trump Flouting the Constitution Isn’t It.” The same day in USA Today ( 6/24/25
      ), Vafa—an Iranian refugee herself—brought a human angle to this conflict that
      is unfortunately hard to come by in the top papers’ pages. She wrote: “This kind
      of violence doesn’t happen in theory. It happens in living rooms. In kitchens.
      In schoolyards and in hospitals.” Vafa not only raised the US’s history of destabilization
      in the Middle East, she also contextualized these kinds of attacks’ role in creating
      the refugee crises that right-wingers then use to create moral panics. “We are
      here because you were there,” she wrote. The people speak The New York Times (
      6/22/25 ) did publish a series of letters to the editor from their readers on
      “The Consequences of US Strikes in Iran.” Unlike the professional columnists,
      many of these readers were explicitly against the bombing. One letter began: “Once
      again our government has launched a war against a nation that has not attacked
      the United States.” Another writer wrote: Whether President Trump’s bombing of
      Iran’s nuclear facilities has postponed one danger or not, it has surely destroyed
      the effort to limit nuclear proliferation. The damage is incalculable. Another
      wrote: “By crossing the line and attacking Iran, the United States should not
      be under the misconception that it has made a step toward peace.” In fact, the
      only pro-bombing letter the Times published in the package was not written by
      an average citizen, but by Aviva Klompas, identified by the Times as “a former
      speechwriter for Israel.” The Big Lie this time Every big US aggression is sold
      by a Big Lie, told over and over again by policy makers and repeated ad nauseam
      in the press. US interventions in Iraq , Afghanistan , Syria , Libya and Ukraine
      have all been sold to the public based on Big Lies. This time for US newspaper
      columnists, the Big Lie is twofold: firstly, that Iran was rejecting negotiations
      in favor of building a bomb; secondly, that Iran wants to build a bomb to destroy
      Israel. These lies rely not only on ignorance, but also on a media apparatus that
      repeats them until they’re accepted as an uncontested premise for all discussion.
      As FAIR ( 10/17/17 , 6/23/25 ) has described in the past, these claims have no
      basis in fact. Iran, which has long been in favor of a nuclear weapons–free Middle
      East, has  attempted to negotiate a stable deal with the West for over a decade.
      Hindering this are Israel’s insistence on its undeclared nuclear arsenal, as well
      as both Trump and Biden’s rejection of the deal negotiated under Obama. Even if
      that weren’t the case, there’s no indication whatsoever that Iran, should it produce
      a nuclear bomb, would commit national suicide by attacking Israel with it. These
      misrepresentations are made all the more egregious by the fact that there is a
      Mideastern country that has rejected the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which
      occupies neighboring lands under military dictatorship, regularly attacks and
      violates treaties with its neighbors, has proven repeatedly to be a bad-faith
      negotiator, is currently committing an internationally recognized genocide, and
      does all this in the name of rights given to them by God. That country is Israel.
      If the columnists at leading US newspapers had any consistency, they would be
      calling for Trump to launch a surprise attack on Israel’s nuclear facilities and
      stockpiles. But they don’t do this, because they either don’t know or don’t care
      about the relevant history. They’re all willing to uncritically manufacture consent
      for the US empire. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of

      In Reporting (FAIR) In the four days of coverage after President Donald Trump
      ordered strikes on Iran (6/21–24/25), the New York Times , USA Today , Wall Street
      Journal and Washington Post responded with 36 opinion pieces and editorials. Almost
      half of these, 17, explicitly supported the illegal bombing, while only 7 (19%)
      took an overall critical view of the strikes—none of them in the Journal or the
      Post . Of the critical pieces, only three (one in the Times and two in USA Today
      ) opposed the idea on legal or moral grounds, challenging the idea that the United
      States has a right to attack a country that had not attacked it. This opposition
      rate of less than a fifth is in stark contrast to US public opinion on the matter,
      which showed that 56% of Americans opposed Trump’s bombing . Why wasn’t this reflected
      in the range of opinions presented by America’s top press outlets? These numbers
      highlight just how poorly represented the views of the public are in elite media.
      ‘Trump’s courageous and correct decision’ FAIR looked at all opinion pieces in
      the four papers that addressed Trump’s strikes on Iran, from June 21 through June
      24. Forty-seven percent (17) explicitly praised Trump’s unauthorized act of war.
      Many of these cheered the aggressive assertion of US power. The New York Times
      ’ Bret Stephens ( 6/22/25 ) lauded “Trump’s Courageous and Correct Decision,”
      which “deserves respect, no matter how one feels about this president and the
      rest of his policies.” At the Washington Post , David Ignatius ( 6/22/25 ) offered
      similar praise under the headline, “Trump’s Iran Strike Was Clear and Bold,” and
      the Wall Street Journal ’s editorial board ( 6/22/25 ) declared, “Trump Meets
      the Moment on Iran.” USA Today ( 6/22/25 ) published columnist Nicole Russell’s
      “Trump Warned Iran. Then He Acted Boldly to Protect America.” The headline was
      later changed to an even more laudatory: “Trump Was Right to Bomb Iran. Even Democrats
      Will Be Safer Because of It.”  In a Wall Street Journal guest column ( 6/24/25
      ), Karen Elliott House celebrated the “restor[ation] of US deterrence and credibility.”
      Some directly attempted to defend the strikes’ legality. In a Post guest column
      ( 6/23/25 ), Geoffrey Corn, Claire Finkelstein and Orde Kittrie claimed to explain
      “Why Trump Didn’t Have to Ask Congress Before Striking Iran.” The piece relied
      extensively on the playground rhetorical tool of if they did it, why can’t I?,
      confidently listing earlier US presidents’ attacks that defied constitutional
      law, as if past violations justify the current one. They asserted that “the operation
      also derives support from international law as an exercise of collective self-defense
      in defense of Israel,” ignoring the fact that international law does not allow
      you to “defend” yourself against a country that hasn’t attacked you—let alone
      the illogical formulation of the US engaging in “self-defense” on behalf of another
      country. USA Today columnist Dace Potas ( 6/22/25 ), who called the attacks “strategically
      the right move and a just action,” also defended the constitutionality of Trump’s
      strikes, attacking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s call to impeach Trump over
      the strikes: If the president is not able to respond to a hostile regime building
      weapons that could destroy entire American cities, then I’m not sure what else,
      short of an actual invasion of the homeland, would allow for him to act. That’s
      the thing about self-defense, though—it’s supposed to involve an attack . Journal
      columnist Gerard Baker ( 6/23/25 ), who called the attack “judicious and pragmatic,”
      likewise pointed to Iran’s nuclear program, claiming that “no one seriously doubts
      the Iran nuclear threat”—despite both US intelligence and the International Agency
      for Atomic Energy concluding otherwise. Yet another angle came from Times columnist
      Thomas Friedman ( 6/22/25 ), who argued that the “Attacks on Iran Are Part of
      a Much Bigger Global Struggle”—between the forces of “inclusion,” who believe
      in “more decent, if not democratic, governance,” and the forces of “resistance,”
      who “thrive on resisting those trends because conflict enables them to keep their
      people down.” Friedman called Trump’s strikes “necessary” for the right side to
      “triumph” in this good-vs-evil struggle. Questions without criticism Of the remaining
      opinion pieces, ten accepted the strikes as a fait accompli and offered analysis
      that mostly speculated about the future and offered no anti-bombing pushback.
      For instance, the Wall Street Journal published a commentary ( 6/23/25 ) asking
      “Can Iran Strike Back Effectively?” A New York Times op-ed ( 6/22/25 ) by security
      consultant Colin P. Clarke speculated about “How Iran Might Strike Back.” The
      Times also published columnist W.J. Hennigan’s piece ( 6/22/25 ) that warned that
      “We Have No Idea Where This War Will Go.” Hennigan speculated: “It’s almost certain
      we haven’t seen the end of US military action in this war,” but he did not indicate
      whether this might be a good or bad thing. Others were slightly more wary, such
      as a Times op-ed ( 6/23/25 ) headlined “What Bombs Can’t Do In Iran.” The Carnegie
      Endowment for International Peace’s Karim Sadjadpour asked, “Will this extraordinary
      act of war strengthen Tehran’s authoritarians or hasten their demise?” Sadjadpour
      tells readers that “while military strikes may expose an authoritarian regime’s
      weaknesses, they rarely create the conditions necessary for lasting democratic
      change”—yet he offers support for both possible outcomes. Similarly, the Washington
      Post ( 6/22/25 ) published a triple-bylined opinion piece debating the question:
      “Will the US/Iran Conflict Spin Out of Control?” Participant Jason Rezaian did
      not criticize the bombing itself, only the lack of strategy around it, judging
      that Trump’s idea of “decimating Iran’s defenses and then letting them stay in
      power to terrorize their citizens, dissidents and opponents around the world would
      be a massive failure” and concluding, “my concern is that there is no plan to
      speak of.” Attacking Trump, supporting war Of the seven articles that criticized
      Trump’s actions, more were critical of Trump and his personality or disregard

      Economy Report The Donald Trump administration has launched many frontal attacks
      on multilateral organizations and international law. However, these clear violations
      of international law are nothing new for US presidents. Opposition to multilateralism
      has been a bipartisan feature of US politics for many decades. In February, Trump
      withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), repeating
      an action he had done back in 2018, during his first term. The Trump administration
      also attacked the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
      East (UNRWA), and announced that he had cut US funding for both UNRWA and the
      UNHRC. Then, in July, Trump withdrew the United States from UNESCO, the United
      Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The US State Department
      complained that “UNESCO’s decision to admit the ‘State of Palestine’ as a Member
      State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation
      of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization”. During his first term, back
      in 2017, Trump had also withdrawn the US from UNESCO . In superficial contrast
      to Trump, the Joe Biden administration cynically employed rhetoric about multilateralism.
      But it was just marketing, because Washington still acted in an aggressive, unilateral
      manner. In 2021, Biden had the US rejoin the UNHRC . His Secretary of State Antony
      Blinken insisted that Washington was upholding the so-called “ rules-based international
      order ”. In 2023, the Biden administration even rejoined UNESCO — although this
      was the same year that the US government sponsored a genocide in Gaza , flooded
      Israel with $18 billion in military aid , and unilaterally vetoed numerous UN
      Security Council resolutions that called for a ceasefire. In fact, Trump took
      credit in 2025 for suspending US funding for UNRWA, the UN Palestine refugees
      agency, but Reuters published a fact check noting that it had already been halted
      by the Biden administration in 2024 . Again, opposition to international law is
      bipartisan in Washington. Democratic critics have depicted Trump as a unique threat
      over his flagrant opposition to international law. The corporate media has often
      repeated this deceptive trope , spinning the narrative that the US government
      supported multilateralism and international law until Trump came along and blew
      it all up. This is completely false, ahistorical, and absurd. One does not need
      to go back far in history to see the myriad examples of Washington blatantly attacking
      international law. George W. Bush signed the Hague Invasion Act in 2002, threatening
      military intervention if the Hague ever tried US officials or their allies. That
      same year, he also “unsigned” the treaty establishing the International Criminal
      Court (ICC). When the Trump White House imposed sanctions on the ICC in February
      2025, it cited the Bush-era Hague Invasion Act (officially called the American
      Servicemembers’ Protection Act) to justify the aggressive action. Bush similarly
      withdrew from a major international treaty on climate change in 2001. Trump later
      did the same, pulling out of the Paris Agreement, which is a legally binding international
      treaty under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Then,
      of course, Bush invaded Iraq in a criminal war of aggression, which UN Secretary
      General Kofi Annan said clearly violated international law . A million Iraqis
      died due to this illegal imperial war. It is not just Republicans who wage these
      political wars on international law; Democrats do as well. You know who helped
      establish the precedent for attacking UNESCO? Barack Obama. He cut US funding
      for UNESCO in 2011 , after the UN body voted to admit Palestine. Obama then went
      on, in 2016, to sign the biggest deal for US military aid to the Israeli colonial
      regime in history, at a neat $38 billion. Likewise, Obama waged wars on Syria,
      Libya, and Yemen, not to mention his drone wars in Pakistan and Somalia and his
      continuation of the US military occupation of Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan had a
      lot of similarities with Donald Trump, too. In 1983-84, decades before Trump came
      to power, Reagan withdrew the US from UNESCO . The Reagan administration complained
      that the UN body was “collectivist”, discussed disarmament (read: peace) proposals,
      and considered the New International Economic Order that was demanded by the formerly
      colonized countries of the Global South. A US State Department official under
      Reagan also attacked the International Labor Organization (ILO), United Nations
      environmental program, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International
      Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and International Telecommunications Union, the New
      York Times reported at the time. In the 1980s, Reagan spat in the face of international
      law by waging numerous criminal wars of aggression. In 1983, the US invaded the
      small Caribbean nation of Grenada , to violently overthrow its revolutionary anti-imperialist
      government. The Reagan administration also launched a bloody war against Nicaragua
      , resorting to terrorist tactics and far-right death squads in a desperate attempt
      to overthrow its leftist Sandinista government. Nicaragua filed a lawsuit against
      the United States in 1984 at the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ). The
      US regime lost this case, but Washington refused to pay reparations to Nicaragua
      , which are still legally owed to this day. In short, what Donald Trump is doing
      today — withdrawing the US from UN bodies, tearing up climate change treaties,
      and attacking multilateral organizations — is exactly what the US empire has done
      for decades, regardless of who the president of the regime is. Trump himself is
      not the sole problem; he is a symptom of the deep structural rot. The problem
      is US imperialism, and it is thoroughly bipartisan. Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      Economy Report The Donald Trump administration has launched many frontal attacks
      on multilateral organizations and international law. However, these clear violations
      of international law are nothing new for US presidents. Opposition to multilateralism
      has been a bipartisan feature of US politics for many decades. In February, Trump
      withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), repeating
      an action he had done back in 2018, during his first term. The Trump administration
      also attacked the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
      East (UNRWA), and announced that he had cut US funding for both UNRWA and the
      UNHRC. Then, in July, Trump withdrew the United States from UNESCO, the United
      Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. The US State Department
      complained that “UNESCO’s decision to admit the ‘State of Palestine’ as a Member
      State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation
      of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization”. During his first term, back
      in 2017, Trump had also withdrawn the US from UNESCO . In superficial contrast
      to Trump, the Joe Biden administration cynically employed rhetoric about multilateralism.
      But it was just marketing, because Washington still acted in an aggressive, unilateral
      manner. In 2021, Biden had the US rejoin the UNHRC . His Secretary of State Antony
      Blinken insisted that Washington was upholding the so-called “ rules-based international
      order ”. In 2023, the Biden administration even rejoined UNESCO — although this
      was the same year that the US government sponsored a genocide in Gaza , flooded
      Israel with $18 billion in military aid , and unilaterally vetoed numerous UN
      Security Council resolutions that called for a ceasefire. In fact, Trump took
      credit in 2025 for suspending US funding for UNRWA, the UN Palestine refugees
      agency, but Reuters published a fact check noting that it had already been halted
      by the Biden administration in 2024 . Again, opposition to international law is
      bipartisan in Washington. Democratic critics have depicted Trump as a unique threat
      over his flagrant opposition to international law. The corporate media has often
      repeated this deceptive trope , spinning the narrative that the US government
      supported multilateralism and international law until Trump came along and blew
      it all up. This is completely false, ahistorical, and absurd. One does not need
      to go back far in history to see the myriad examples of Washington blatantly attacking
      international law. George W. Bush signed the Hague Invasion Act in 2002, threatening
      military intervention if the Hague ever tried US officials or their allies. That
      same year, he also “unsigned” the treaty establishing the International Criminal
      Court (ICC). When the Trump White House imposed sanctions on the ICC in February
      2025, it cited the Bush-era Hague Invasion Act (officially called the American
      Servicemembers’ Protection Act) to justify the aggressive action. Bush similarly
      withdrew from a major international treaty on climate change in 2001. Trump later
      did the same, pulling out of the Paris Agreement, which is a legally binding international
      treaty under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Then,
      of course, Bush invaded Iraq in a criminal war of aggression, which UN Secretary
      General Kofi Annan said clearly violated international law . A million Iraqis
      died due to this illegal imperial war. It is not just Republicans who wage these
      political wars on international law; Democrats do as well. You know who helped
      establish the precedent for attacking UNESCO? Barack Obama. He cut US funding
      for UNESCO in 2011 , after the UN body voted to admit Palestine. Obama then went
      on, in 2016, to sign the biggest deal for US military aid to the Israeli colonial

      Libya, and Yemen, not to mention his drone wars in Pakistan and Somalia and his
      continuation of the US military occupation of Afghanistan. Ronald Reagan had a

      Antiwar.com At least 20 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza over the past
      three days due to the US-backed Israeli blockade, according to daily press releases
      from Gaza’s Health Ministry. In its latest release on Sunday, the Health Ministry
      said it recorded six malnutrition deaths over the past 24 hours, including two
      children. The ministry said that the total number of starvation deaths has reached
      133, including 37 children. Medics and experts told The Washington Post that the
      number of starvation deaths listed by the Health Ministry is likely a significant
      undercount since malnutrition is rarely listed as the primary cause of death,
      and that once mass hunger sets in, fatalities may rise exponentially. The starvation
      deaths in Gaza have led to an increase in international pressure on Israel to
      ease its blockade and restrictions on aid deliveries. For days, Israel, with help
      from the US , was claiming that it was the UN’s fault that more aid wasn’t being
      delivered. But on Sunday, Israel announced that it would take steps to facilitate
      more aid deliveries, making it clear that Israeli restrictions were the impediment.
      The IDF announced that it would open additional humanitarian corridors and initiate
      “tactical pauses” in certain areas of Gaza to facilitate aid deliveries. However,
      heavy Israeli attacks continued in Gaza on Sunday, including in areas where “pauses”
      were supposed to take place, killing at least 53 people across the Strip. There’s
      no sign yet that the steps from Israel will bring any real relief for Gaza’s starving
      population. According to the Post , an internal UN memo said that Israel only
      guaranteed that there would be “tactical pauses” and an increase in aid deliveries
      for one week. Later on Sunday, the UN’s aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said that some
      progress had been made in getting more aid to starving Palestinians but added
      that “vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health
      crisis.” On top of the deaths due to Israeli-imposed starvation, Israeli forces
      continue to gun down desperate Palestinians seeking aid. According to the Health
      Ministry, at least 11 aid seekers were killed and 36 were injured over the previous
      24-hour period, bringing the total number of Palestinians killed while attempting
      to get food since the end of May to 1,132 and the number of wounded to 7,521.
      The majority of aid seekers were killed near distribution sites run by the US
      and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which helped Israel’s propaganda
      efforts by blaming the starvation in Gaza on the UN. Please share this story and

      By Dave DeCamp / Antiwar.com President Trump has shown strong support for Israel
      in recent days, while much of the world has been outraged over the images of Palestinians
      who are starving to death due to the US-backed Israeli siege on Gaza. After the
      US and Israel quit ceasefire talks, Trump blamed the lack of progress on Hamas
      and suggested it was time for Israel to “finish the job” in Gaza. “I think they
      want to die, and it’s very, very bad,” Trump said on Friday, referring to Hamas.
      For its part, Hamas has said that it was surprised by the US and Israel quitting
      the truce talks and that it was committed to continuing the process until a deal
      was reached. In recent weeks, Trump has been claiming that a ceasefire deal was
      close, but now he is appearing to suggest that Israel should escalate its genocidal
      war. “They’re gonna have to fight, and they’re gonna have to clean it up. You’re
      gonna have to get rid of [Hamas],” he said. Israeli officials told Axios that
      they weren’t sure if Trump’s comments were a negotiating tactic or a “green light”
      for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to use even more extreme military
      measures. The report said the Trump administration was rethinking its Gaza strategy,
      but there’s no sign it’s considering putting pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire.
      Israeli officials also told Axios that Trump has applied virtually no pressure
      on Netanyahu to end the slaughter in Gaza in recent months. “In most calls and
      meetings, Trump told Bibi, ‘Do what you have to do in Gaza.’ In some cases, he
      even encouraged Netanyahu to go harder on Hamas,” one official said. While meeting
      with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland on Sunday,
      Trump was asked about the images of starving children in Gaza . The president
      said people were “stealing the food,” a reference to Israel’s unfounded claims
      that Hamas has been stealing massive amounts of aid, then quickly pivoted to different
      topics. In other comments, Trump said the issue of food shortages in Gaza was
      an “international problem,” not a “US problem.” But Israel is reliant on US military
      aid to sustain its military operations in Gaza, and Trump has the power to end
      the genocidal war by leveraging that support. Please share this story and help

      officials are uncertain if Trump's remarks signal a negotiating strategy or a
      directive for more aggressive military measures. Reports indicate that Trump has
      not pressured Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to cease hostilities, instead encouraging
      him to take a harder stance against Hamas. When questioned about the plight of
      children in Gaza, Trump dismissed the severity of the situation, attributing food
      shortages to alleged theft by Hamas.

      Cole / Informed Comment Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – Extreme-right Israeli Prime
      Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has managed to turn Israel into a 21st century version
      of the Flying Dutchman. Britannica tells us that Europe produced the legend of
      the “Flying Dutchman,” a ghostly vessel that is fated to sail forever. When sailors
      descry it in the distance, they know a catastrophe looms. One common version of
      the tale concerns a Captain Vanderdecken, who wagers his immortal soul, vowing
      to round the Cape of Good Hope amid a tempest. He and his ship end up being doomed
      to ply those same waters forevermore. The legend forms the subject matter of Richard
      Wagner’s opera, Der fliegende Holländer [The Flying Dutchman] (1843). Samuel Taylor
      Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient Mariner” also refers to the story: “The naked
      hulk alongside came, And the twain were casting dice; ‘The game is done! I’ve
      won! I’ve won!’ Quoth she, and whistles thrice. The Sun’s rim dips; the stars
      rush out; At one stride comes the dark; With far-heard whisper, o’er the sea,
      Off shot the spectre-bark.” Tuesday morning last week the Crown Iris cruise ship
      full of Israeli tourists tried to stop off at Syros island just south of Athens.
      They were blocked by a massive popular demonstration at the Ermoupolis harbor,
      conducted despite a curfew issued by the municipal authorities for local residents,
      forbidding traffic and circulation at the port in hopes of allowing the Israeli
      tourists to get off. People ignored the traffic ban to assemble anyway. In the
      end the cruiser had to cast off its moorings and depart without unloading any
      of its 1600 passengers. The protest that blocked the disembarkation was staged
      by trade unionists and civil society groups, whose members flew large Palestinian
      flags and raised a banner emblazoned with the logo, “Stop the Genocide!” Despite
      the attempt of Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to get Greek Foreign Minister
      George Gerapetritis to intervene, the protesters proved victorious. The center-right
      Greek government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis condemned the actions of
      the protesters. The Crown Iris did manage to dock at Limassol in Cyprus, and then
      returned to Israel, before returning to Crete with the intention of going to the
      island of Rhodes. But the unions and civil society organizations in Rhodes are
      now mobilizing against the visit, with a demonstration set for Monday afternoon
      (i.e. tomorrow) at the Old Commercial Port half an hour before the Crown Iris
      is scheduled to dock. Organizers issued the following call: “On Monday, July 28,
      2025, in the afternoon (3:30 pm), the Israeli cruise ship Iris Crown will arrive
      at the port of Rhodes (old commercial port – customs office). This is the same
      ship that recently approached Syros, provoking the symbolic protest of the islanders
      against the genocidal policy implemented by the extreme-right [ακροδεξιά] Netanyahu
      government against the Palestinian people. Residents, together with visitors to
      the island, managed to prevent its docking at the port, necessitating that it
      turn around and leave… “The Municipal Employees’ Association of Rhodes calls on
      its members, as well as on those who refuse to compromise with the very idea of
      slaughtering civilians, of their extermination by enforced starvation, and of
      systematic genocide — but who at the same time seek a just and viable solution
      to the Palestine issue — to gather at the old commercial port/ customs office
      at 3:00 PM on Monday, July 28. “The message of our protest is clear: we resist
      the ongoing murderous policy of the extreme-right Netanyahu [ who they point out
      was indicted by the International Criminal Court as a war criminal] and his supporters
      — while we have nothing against those Israelis or Jews-by-religion who oppose
      the crime or do not participate in it.” Although Israeli propagandists lambaste
      the protests as antisemitic, the organizers, at least, deny that they are about
      Jews or Jewishness or even about Israelis. They are protests against the genocidal
      policies, they say, of a particular Israeli government, which they characterize
      with the same Greek word typically used to refer to neo-Nazi parties in Europe
      such as as Germany’s AfD. The episode, which has turned Israeli cruise ship passengers
      into the Flying Dutchmen of the Mediterranean, shows not rising anti-Jewish bigotry
      but the ways in which Benjamin Netanyahu, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich and
      a rogues gallery of war criminals at the top of the Israeli state have made Israel
      a pariah state. Their propaganda was always that Zionist state-making is crucial
      to Jewish safety, but their hard Right policies have boomeranged, making Israelis
      and Jews less safe. What would have made Israelis safe was an implementation of
      the Oslo Peace Accords, signed by Yitzhak Rabin in 1993, and which Netanyahu loudly
      and interminably boasts he destroyed. There have been lots of protests against
      Israeli cargo ships — in Oslo, Istanbul, and San Francisco — and Spain declines
      to let Israeli ships believed to be carrying arms shipments dock at Spanish ports.
      Alas, this is only the beginning. As images of the emaciated corpses of Gaza Palestinians,
      including children, emerge onto the world’s smartphone screens in the coming weeks
      — for all the world like the photographs taken by the American soldiers who liberated
      Nazi death camps such as Auschwitz — the pariah status of the Israeli state will
      be ever more solidly cemented. Personally, I don’t agree with boycotting individual
      Israelis. People should be judged by their deeds, not by their origins. But this
      crime of the 21st century will unfortunately and inevitably cast a long shadow.
      And nor should Americans, who are joined at the hip with Netanyahu and his millenarian
      crazies, think they will themselves escape this gathering global opprobrium. Please

      ship that recently approached Syros, provoking the symbolic protest of the islanders
      against the genocidal policy implemented by the extreme-right [ακροδεξιά] Netanyahu
      government against the Palestinian people. Residents, together with visitors to
      the island, managed to prevent its docking at the port, necessitating that it
      turn around and leave… “The Municipal Employees’ Association of Rhodes calls on
      its members, as well as on those who refuse to compromise with the very idea of
      slaughtering civilians, of their extermination by enforced starvation, and of
      systematic genocide — but who at the same time seek a just and viable solution
      to the Palestine issue — to gather at the old commercial port/ customs office
      at 3:00 PM on Monday, July 28. “The message of our protest is clear: we resist
      the ongoing murderous policy of the extreme-right Netanyahu [ who they point out
      was indicted by the International Criminal Court as a war criminal] and his supporters
      — while we have nothing against those Israelis or Jews-by-religion who oppose
      the crime or do not participate in it.” Although Israeli propagandists lambaste
      the protests as antisemitic, the organizers, at least, deny that they are about
      Jews or Jewishness or even about Israelis. They are protests against the genocidal
      policies, they say, of a particular Israeli government, which they characterize
      with the same Greek word typically used to refer to neo-Nazi parties in Europe
      such as as Germany’s AfD. The episode, which has turned Israeli cruise ship passengers
      into the Flying Dutchmen of the Mediterranean, shows not rising anti-Jewish bigotry
      but the ways in which Benjamin Netanyahu, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich and
      a rogues gallery of war criminals at the top of the Israeli state have made Israel
      a pariah state. Their propaganda was always that Zionist state-making is crucial
      to Jewish safety, but their hard Right policies have boomeranged, making Israelis
      and Jews less safe. What would have made Israelis safe was an implementation of
      the Oslo Peace Accords, signed by Yitzhak Rabin in 1993, and which Netanyahu loudly
      and interminably boasts he destroyed. There have been lots of protests against
      Israeli cargo ships — in Oslo, Istanbul, and San Francisco — and Spain declines
      to let Israeli ships believed to be carrying arms shipments dock at Spanish ports.
      Alas, this is only the beginning. As images of the emaciated corpses of Gaza Palestinians,
      including children, emerge onto the world’s smartphone screens in the coming weeks
      — for all the world like the photographs taken by the American soldiers who liberated
      Nazi death camps such as Auschwitz — the pariah status of the Israeli state will
      be ever more solidly cemented. Personally, I don’t agree with boycotting individual
      Israelis. People should be judged by their deeds, not by their origins. But this
      crime of the 21st century will unfortunately and inevitably cast a long shadow.
      And nor should Americans, who are joined at the hip with Netanyahu and his millenarian
      crazies, think they will themselves escape this gathering global opprobrium. Please

      TomDispatch When, in his 1961 farewell address, President Dwight D. Eisenhower
      warned of the dangers of the unwarranted influence wielded by a partnership between
      the military and a growing cohort of U.S. weapons contractors and came up with
      the ominous term “military-industrial complex,” he could never have imagined quite
      how large and powerful that complex would become.  In fact, in recent years, one
      firm — Lockheed Martin — has normally gotten more Pentagon funding than the entire
      U.S. State Department. And mind you, that was before the Trump administration
      moved to sharply slash spending on diplomacy and jack up the Pentagon budget to
      an astonishing $1 trillion per year. In a new study issued by the Quincy Institute
      for Responsible Statecraft and the Costs of War Project at Brown University, Stephen
      Semler and I lay out just how powerful those arms makers and their allies have
      become, as Pentagon budgets simply never stop rising. And consider this: in the
      five years from 2020 to 2024, 54% of the Pentagon’s $4.4 trillion in discretionary
      spending went to private firms and $791 billion went to just five companies: Lockheed
      Martin ($313 billion), RTX (formerly Raytheon, $145 billion), Boeing ($115 billion),
      General Dynamics ($116 billion), and Northrop Grumman ($81 billion). And mind
      you, that was before Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Budget bill landed on planet
      Earth, drastically slashing spending on diplomacy and domestic programs to make
      room for major tax cuts and near-record Pentagon outlays. In short, the “garrison
      state” Eisenhower warned of has arrived, with negative consequences for nearly
      everyone but the executives and shareholders of those giant weapons conglomerates
      and their competitors in the emerging military tech sector who are now hot on
      their trail. High-tech militarists like Peter Thiel of Palantir, Elon Musk of
      SpaceX, and Palmer Luckey of Anduril have promised a new, more affordable, more
      nimble, and supposedly more effective version of the military-industrial complex,
      as set out in Anduril’s “Rebooting the Arsenal of Democracy,” an ode to the supposed
      value of those emerging tech firms. Curiously enough, that Anduril essay is actually
      a remarkably apt critique of the Big Five contractors and their allies in Congress
      and the Pentagon, pointing out their unswerving penchant for cost overruns, delays
      in scheduling, and pork-barrel politics to preserve weapons systems that all too
      often no longer serve any useful military purpose. That document goes on to say
      that, while the Lockheed Martins of the world served a useful function in the
      ancient days of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, today they are incapable of
      building the next-generation of weaponry.  The reason: their archaic business
      model and their inability to master the software at the heart of a coming new
      generation of semi-autonomous, pilotless weapons driven by artificial intelligence
      (AI) and advanced computing.  For their part, the new titans of tech boldly claim
      that they can provide exactly such a futuristic generation of weaponry far more
      effectively and at far less cost, and that their weapons systems will preserve
      or even extend American global military dominance into the distant future by outpacing
      China in the development of next generation technologies. War and a Possible Coming
      Techno-Autocracy Could there indeed be a new, improved military-industrial complex
      just waiting in the wings, one aligned with this country’s actual defense needs
      that doesn’t gouge taxpayers in the process? Don’t count on it, not at least if
      it’s premised on the development of “miracle weapons” that will cost so much less
      and do so much more than current systems. Such a notion, it seems, arises in every
      generation, only to routinely fall flat . From the “electronic battlefield” that
      was supposed to pinpoint and destroy Viet Cong forces in the jungles of Southeast
      Asia in the Vietnam War years to Ronald Reagan’s failed vision of an impenetrable
      “Star Wars” missile shield, to the failure of precision-guided munitions and networked
      warfare to bring victory in Iraq and Afghanistan during this country’s Global
      War on Terror, the notion that superior military technology is the key to winning
      America’s wars and expanding U.S. power and influence has been routinely marked
      by failure. And that’s been true even if the weapons work as advertised (which
      all too often they don’t). And while you’re at it, don’t forget, for example,
      that, nearly 30 years later, the highly touted, high-tech F-35 combat aircraft
      — once hailed as a technological marvel-in-the-making that would usher in a revolution
      in both warfare and military procurement — still isn’t ready for prime time .
      Designed for multiple war-fighting tasks, including winning aerial dogfights,
      supporting troops on the ground, and bombing enemy targets, the F-35 has turned
      out to be able to do none of those things particularly well. And to add insult
      to injury, the plane is so complex that it spends almost as much time being maintained
      or repaired as being ready to do battle. That history of technological hubris
      and strategic failure should be kept in mind when listening to the — so far unproven
      — claims of the leaders of this country’s military-tech sector about the value
      of their latest gadgets. For one thing, everything they propose to build — from
      swarms of drones to unpiloted aircraft, land vehicles, and ships — will rely on
      extremely complex software that is bound to fail somewhere along the way. And
      even if, by some miracle, their systems, including artificial intelligence, work
      as advertised, they may not only not prove decisive in the wars of the future
      but make wars of aggression that much more likely. After all, countries that master
      new technologies are tempted to go on the attack, putting fewer of their own people
      at immediate risk while doing devastating harm to targeted populations. The use
      of Palantir’s technology by the Israeli Defense Forces to increase the number
      of targets devastated in a given time frame in their campaign of mass slaughter
      in Gaza could foreshadow the new age of warfare if emerging military technologies
      aren’t brought under some system of control and accountability. A further risk
      posed by AI-driven warfare is the possibility that the new weapons could choose
      their targets without human intervention.  Current Pentagon policy promises to
      keep a human “in the loop” in the use of such systems, but military logic runs
      counter to such claims. As Anduril President and Chief Strategy Officer Christian
      Brose has written in his seminal book Kill Chain , the high-tech wars of the future
      will hinge on which side can identify and destroy its targets most quickly — an
      imperative that would ensure slow-moving humans were left out of the process.
      In short, two possibilities arise if the U.S. military transitions to the “new
      improved” military-industrial complex espoused by the denizens of Silicon Valley:
      complex systems that don’t perform as advertised, or new capabilities that may
      make war both more likely and more deadly. And such dystopian outcomes will only
      be reinforced by the ideology of the new Silicon Valley militarists. They see
      themselves as both the “ founders ” of a new form of warfare and “the new patriots”
      poised to restore American greatness without the need for a democratic government
      in the war-making mix. Their ideal, in fact, would be to ensure that the government
      got out of the way and let them solve the myriad problems we face alone. Ayn Rand
      would be proud. Such a techno-autocracy would be far more likely to serve the
      interests of a relatively small elite than aid the average American in any way. From
      Peter Thiel’s quest for a way to live forever to Elon Musk’s desire to enable
      the mass colonization of space, it’s not at all clear that, if such goals could
      even be achieved, they would be generally available. It’s more likely that such
      opportunities would be restricted to the species of superior beings that the techno-militarists
      see themselves as being. The Ultimate Brawl Between the Big Five and the Emerging
      Tech Firms? Still, the techno-militarists face serious obstacles in their quest
      to reach the top rungs of power and influence, not least among them, the continued
      clout of old-school weapons makers. After all, they still receive the vast bulk
      of Pentagon weapons spending, based in part on their millions of dollars in lobbying
      and campaign expenditures and their ability to spread jobs to almost every state
      and district in the country. These tools of influence give the Big Five far deeper
      roots in and influence over Congress than the new tech firms. These large, legacy
      companies also influence government policy through their funding of hawkish think
      tanks that help shape government policies designed to regulate their conduct,
      and so much more. Of course, one way to prevent the ultimate brawl between the
      Big Five and the emerging tech firms would be to feed them both with ample funding
      — but that would require a Pentagon budget that would soar well beyond the present
      trillion-dollar mark. There are, of course, some projects that could benefit both
      factions, ranging from Donald Trump’s pet Golden Dome missile defense scheme,
      which could incorporate hardware from the Big Five with software from the emerging
      tech firms, to Boeing’s new F-47 combat aircraft program, which calls for unpiloted
      “wing men” likely to be produced by Anduril or another military tech firm. So,
      the question of confrontation versus cooperation between the new and old guard
      in the military sector has yet to be settled.  If the rival firms end up turning
      their lobbying resources against each other and going for each other’s proverbial
      throats, it could weaken their grip on the rest of us and perhaps reveal useful
      information that might undermine the authority and credibility of both sides.
      But count on one thing: neither sector has the best interests of the public in
      mind, so we need to prepare to fight back ourselves regardless of how their battle
      plays out. Okay, then, what could we possibly do to head off the nightmare scenario
      of a world run by Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and crew? First, we’ll need the kind
      of “alert and knowledgeable” citizenry that Dwight D. Eisenhower pointed to so
      long ago as the only antidote to an ever more militarized society. That would
      mean concerted efforts by both the public and the government (which would, of
      course, have to be run by someone unlike Donald J. Trump — already a project in
      itself!). At the moment, the tech sector is indeed increasingly embedded in the
      Trump administration and he owes a number of them a distinct debt of gratitude
      for helping him over the top in the 2024 election. Despite his very public and
      bitter falling out with fellow narcissist Elon Musk, the influence of the tech
      sector within his administration remains all too strong, starting with Vice President
      J.D. Vance, who owes his career to the employment, mentoring, and financial support
      of Silicon Valley militarist Peter Thiel. And don’t forget that a substantial
      cohort of former employees of Palantir and Anduril have already been given key
      posts in this administration. Creating a counterweight to those new-age militarists
      will require a full-scale societal effort, including educators, scientists, and
      technologists, the labor movement, non-tech business leaders, and activists of
      all stripes. Silicon Valley workers did, in fact, organize a number of protests
      against the militarization of their handiwork before being beaten back. Now, a
      new wave of such activism is all too desperately needed. Just as many of the scientists
      who helped build the atomic bomb spent their post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki lives
      trying to rein in or abolish nuclear weapons, a cohort of scientists and engineers
      in the tech sector needs to play a leading role in beginning to craft guardrails
      to limit the military uses of the technologies they helped develop. Meanwhile,
      the student movement against the use of U.S. weapons in Gaza has begun to expand
      its horizons to target the militarization of universities writ large. In addition,
      environmentalists need to double down on criticisms of the immense energy requirements
      needed to power AI and crypto, while labor leaders need to reckon with the consequences
      of AI destroying jobs in the military and civilian sectors alike. And all of this
      has to happen in the context of a far greater technological literacy, including
      among congressional representatives and workers in government agencies charged
      with regulating the suppliers of new military technologies. None of that is, of
      course, likely to happen except in the context of a resurgence of democracy and
      a committed effort to fulfill the unmet rhetorical promises that undergird the
      myth of the American dream. And speaking of contexts, here’s one that anybody
      preparing to protest the further militarization of this society should take into
      account: contrary to the belief of many key figures from the Pentagon to Wall
      Street to Main Street, the peak of American military and economic power has indeed
      passed, never to return. The only rational course is to craft policies that maintain
      American influence in the context of a world where power has been defused and
      cooperation is all too essential. Such a view, of course, is the polar opposite
      of the bombastic, bullying approach of the Trump administration, which, if it
      persists, will only accelerate American decline. And in that context, the key
      question is whether the widespread harm inherent in the new budget bill — which
      will only continue to wildly enrich the Pentagon and big arms firms of both kinds,
      while hitting the rest of us across the political spectrum — could prompt a new
      surge of public engagement and a genuine debate about what kind of world we want
      to live in and how this country could play a constructive (rather than destructive)
      role in bringing it about. Please share this story and help us grow our network!

      of their latest gadgets. For one thing, everything they propose to build — from
      swarms of drones to unpiloted aircraft, land vehicles, and ships — will rely on
      extremely complex software that is bound to fail somewhere along the way. And
      even if, by some miracle, their systems, including artificial intelligence, work
      as advertised, they may not only not prove decisive in the wars of the future
      but make wars of aggression that much more likely. After all, countries that master
      new technologies are tempted to go on the attack, putting fewer of their own people
      at immediate risk while doing devastating harm to targeted populations. The use
      of Palantir’s technology by the Israeli Defense Forces to increase the number
      of targets devastated in a given time frame in their campaign of mass slaughter
      in Gaza could foreshadow the new age of warfare if emerging military technologies
      aren’t brought under some system of control and accountability. A further risk
      posed by AI-driven warfare is the possibility that the new weapons could choose
      their targets without human intervention.  Current Pentagon policy promises to
      keep a human “in the loop” in the use of such systems, but military logic runs
      counter to such claims. As Anduril President and Chief Strategy Officer Christian
      Brose has written in his seminal book Kill Chain , the high-tech wars of the future
      will hinge on which side can identify and destroy its targets most quickly — an
      imperative that would ensure slow-moving humans were left out of the process.
      In short, two possibilities arise if the U.S. military transitions to the “new
      improved” military-industrial complex espoused by the denizens of Silicon Valley:
      complex systems that don’t perform as advertised, or new capabilities that may
      make war both more likely and more deadly. And such dystopian outcomes will only
      be reinforced by the ideology of the new Silicon Valley militarists. They see
      themselves as both the “ founders ” of a new form of warfare and “the new patriots”
      poised to restore American greatness without the need for a democratic government
      in the war-making mix. Their ideal, in fact, would be to ensure that the government
      got out of the way and let them solve the myriad problems we face alone. Ayn Rand
      would be proud. Such a techno-autocracy would be far more likely to serve the
      interests of a relatively small elite than aid the average American in any way. From
      Peter Thiel’s quest for a way to live forever to Elon Musk’s desire to enable
      the mass colonization of space, it’s not at all clear that, if such goals could
      even be achieved, they would be generally available. It’s more likely that such
      opportunities would be restricted to the species of superior beings that the techno-militarists
      see themselves as being. The Ultimate Brawl Between the Big Five and the Emerging
      Tech Firms? Still, the techno-militarists face serious obstacles in their quest
      to reach the top rungs of power and influence, not least among them, the continued
      clout of old-school weapons makers. After all, they still receive the vast bulk
      of Pentagon weapons spending, based in part on their millions of dollars in lobbying
      and campaign expenditures and their ability to spread jobs to almost every state
      and district in the country. These tools of influence give the Big Five far deeper
      roots in and influence over Congress than the new tech firms. These large, legacy
      companies also influence government policy through their funding of hawkish think
      tanks that help shape government policies designed to regulate their conduct,
      and so much more. Of course, one way to prevent the ultimate brawl between the
      Big Five and the emerging tech firms would be to feed them both with ample funding
      — but that would require a Pentagon budget that would soar well beyond the present
      trillion-dollar mark. There are, of course, some projects that could benefit both
      factions, ranging from Donald Trump’s pet Golden Dome missile defense scheme,
      which could incorporate hardware from the Big Five with software from the emerging
      tech firms, to Boeing’s new F-47 combat aircraft program, which calls for unpiloted
      “wing men” likely to be produced by Anduril or another military tech firm. So,
      the question of confrontation versus cooperation between the new and old guard
      in the military sector has yet to be settled.  If the rival firms end up turning
      their lobbying resources against each other and going for each other’s proverbial
      throats, it could weaken their grip on the rest of us and perhaps reveal useful
      information that might undermine the authority and credibility of both sides.
      But count on one thing: neither sector has the best interests of the public in
      mind, so we need to prepare to fight back ourselves regardless of how their battle
      plays out. Okay, then, what could we possibly do to head off the nightmare scenario
      of a world run by Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and crew? First, we’ll need the kind
      of “alert and knowledgeable” citizenry that Dwight D. Eisenhower pointed to so
      long ago as the only antidote to an ever more militarized society. That would
      mean concerted efforts by both the public and the government (which would, of
      course, have to be run by someone unlike Donald J. Trump — already a project in
      itself!). At the moment, the tech sector is indeed increasingly embedded in the
      Trump administration and he owes a number of them a distinct debt of gratitude
      for helping him over the top in the 2024 election. Despite his very public and
      bitter falling out with fellow narcissist Elon Musk, the influence of the tech
      sector within his administration remains all too strong, starting with Vice President
      J.D. Vance, who owes his career to the employment, mentoring, and financial support
      of Silicon Valley militarist Peter Thiel. And don’t forget that a substantial
      cohort of former employees of Palantir and Anduril have already been given key
      posts in this administration. Creating a counterweight to those new-age militarists
      will require a full-scale societal effort, including educators, scientists, and
      technologists, the labor movement, non-tech business leaders, and activists of
      all stripes. Silicon Valley workers did, in fact, organize a number of protests
      against the militarization of their handiwork before being beaten back. Now, a
      new wave of such activism is all too desperately needed. Just as many of the scientists
      who helped build the atomic bomb spent their post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki lives
      trying to rein in or abolish nuclear weapons, a cohort of scientists and engineers
      in the tech sector needs to play a leading role in beginning to craft guardrails
      to limit the military uses of the technologies they helped develop. Meanwhile,
      the student movement against the use of U.S. weapons in Gaza has begun to expand
      its horizons to target the militarization of universities writ large. In addition,
      environmentalists need to double down on criticisms of the immense energy requirements
      needed to power AI and crypto, while labor leaders need to reckon with the consequences
      of AI destroying jobs in the military and civilian sectors alike. And all of this
      has to happen in the context of a far greater technological literacy, including
      among congressional representatives and workers in government agencies charged
      with regulating the suppliers of new military technologies. None of that is, of
      course, likely to happen except in the context of a resurgence of democracy and
      a committed effort to fulfill the unmet rhetorical promises that undergird the
      myth of the American dream. And speaking of contexts, here’s one that anybody
      preparing to protest the further militarization of this society should take into
      account: contrary to the belief of many key figures from the Pentagon to Wall
      Street to Main Street, the peak of American military and economic power has indeed
      passed, never to return. The only rational course is to craft policies that maintain
      American influence in the context of a world where power has been defused and
      cooperation is all too essential. Such a view, of course, is the polar opposite
      of the bombastic, bullying approach of the Trump administration, which, if it
      persists, will only accelerate American decline. And in that context, the key
      question is whether the widespread harm inherent in the new budget bill — which
      will only continue to wildly enrich the Pentagon and big arms firms of both kinds,
      while hitting the rest of us across the political spectrum — could prompt a new
      surge of public engagement and a genuine debate about what kind of world we want
      to live in and how this country could play a constructive (rather than destructive)
      role in bringing it about. Please share this story and help us grow our network!

      budgets have reached unprecedented levels, with a significant portion allocated
      to private firms. A study from the Quincy Institute and Brown University reveals
      that from 2020 to 2024, over half of the Pentagon's discretionary spending will
      go to private companies, with billions earmarked for just five major contractors.
      The article also critiques the Trump administration's budget priorities, which
      favored military spending while cutting funds for diplomacy and domestic programs.

      intercepted and seized the Gaza Freedom Flotilla vessel The Handala late Saturday
      night local time as it attempted to deliver desperately needed humanitarian aid
      to the besieged people of Gaza. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition reported that Israeli
      forces cut the cameras on board the ship at 11:43 pm local time, when it was around
      40 nautical miles from Gaza. “The unarmed boat was carrying lifesaving supplies
      when it was boarded by Israeli forces, its passengers abducted, and its cargo
      seized,” the coalition wrote . “The interception occurred in international waters
      outside Palestinian territorial waters off Gaza, in violation of international
      maritime law.” Israel’s Foreign Ministry confirmed that its navy had intercepted
      the ship, as Al Jazeera reported . “The vessel is safely making its way to the
      shores of Israel ,” the ministry said in a statement. “All passengers are safe.”
      The Handala set sail for Gaza on July 20 from Gallipoli, Italy. It is the second
      attempt by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition to break the siege on Gaza in under
      two months. An earlier attempt in June was also intercepted by the Israeli military
      and its crew members arrested and deported. There are 21 crew members onboard
      The Handala from 12 countries: 19 human rights defenders and two journalists.
      The crew includes seven U.S. citizens, among them labor leader Christian Smalls.
      The crew had promised to begin a hunger strike as soon as they were intercepted
      by the Israeli military. “In captivity they can give their sandwiches and water
      to the starving people of Gaza,” Smalls wrote on social media. Another U.S. crew
      member, the Palestinian-American lawyer and activist Huwaida Arraf, rebuked the
      Israeli Navy as they boarded the ship, according to a video obtained by Al Jazeera:
      “Let me give you a lesson in international law,” Arraf said, adding: Any blockade
      that deliberately starves a civilian population is a violation of international
      law. It is not only that—it is a war crime. You have no legal authority to enforce
      an unlawful blockade. And as such, you have no authority to use force to enforce
      an unlawful blockade. Therefore, we demand that you stand down. You are responsible
      for the well-being of every civilian on board this vessel. As an occupying power
      in Gaza, you are responsible for the health and well-being of the civilian population
      there. Not only have you disregarded that obligation, but you are actively exterminating
      the people. You have engineered a famine. You are deliberately starving civilians
      and children before the eyes of the world. Our vessel does not constitute any
      threat to you. We carry only humanitarian aid, and therefore, you have no authority
      to intercept or otherwise attack our vessel. We demand again that you stand down.
      The Handala ‘s interception came at the close of a day that saw 71 people killed
      in Gaza due to Israeli attacks and five perish from hunger. This brings the total
      number of deaths from starvation in Gaza to over 127, among them more than 85
      children. After 658 days of a U.S.-backed Israeli siege, more than 85% of Palestinians
      in Gaza are now in the most dangerous Stage 5 of the Integrated Food Security
      Phase Classification to measure famine. One five-month-old child who died on Friday
      due to lack of baby formula weighed less at death than she did at birth, as The
      Associated Press reported . A growing number of human rights experts and advocates
      have characterized Israel’s war and siege on Gaza as a genocide. The ship was
      carrying diapers, baby formula, food, and medicine. According to the Gaza Freedom
      Flotilla Coalition, Saturday’s interception was the “third violent act by Israeli
      forces against Freedom Flotilla missions this year alone.” “It follows the drone
      bombing of the civilian aid ship Conscience in European waters in May, which injured
      four people and disabled the vessel, and the illegal seizure of The Madleen in
      June, where Israeli forces abducted 12 civilians, including a member of the European
      Parliament,” the group wrote. Ann Wright , a member of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla
      Coalition steering committee, called on the governments of the 21 crew members
      to advocate for their citizens. “Protect innocent international people who are
      merely accompanying a small amount of aid—medical and food—as a symbol of the
      international outrage at what Israel is doing,” she told Al Jazeera. Editor’s

      Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research A horrifying statistic
      hovers over the poorer nations: 3.4 billion people now live in countries that
      spend more on interest payments for public debt than on education or health. In
      2024, according to a new report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and
      Development (UNCTAD), global public debt reached $102 trillion – a third of which
      is held by developing countries. The impact on these countries is especially severe:
      credit markets charge poorer nations far higher interest rates than they do richer
      nations, making debt servicing payments proportionately higher for the Global
      South. The United States, for instance, pays interest rates that are, on average,
      two to four times lower than those faced by poorer nations. In 2023, according
      to the UNCTAD analysis, the poorer nations ‘paid $25 billion more to their external
      creditors in debt servicing than they received in fresh disbursements, resulting
      in a negative net resource transfer’. In more popular language: the social wealth
      of developing countries is being drained by wealthy creditors – mostly located
      in the Global North. The theft of social wealth from South to North has framed
      the work of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research for the past decade.
      Following the Second Dilemmas of Humanity Conference (held in Brazil in 2015),
      our institute was founded to provide intellectual support to political and social
      movements and accompany them in the fight for emancipation. In the years since,
      our work has focused on four key areas: Highlighting the work of movements, as
      in our 2024 dossier The Political Organisation of Brazil’s Landless Workers’ Movement
      (MST) . Elaborating critiques of the current system from the standpoint of the
      movements themselves, as in our 2023 notebook The World in Economic Depression:
      A Marxist Analysis of Crisis , which examines the continuing fallout of the Third
      Great Depression triggered by the US mortgage crisis in 2008. Building an alternative
      framework for development that goes beyond the IMF’s debt-austerity regime, as
      introduced in our 2025 dossier Towards a New Development Theory for the Global
      South . Providing clear, accessible analysis of global developments and political
      struggles through our newsletters – published from Asia , Africa , Latin America
      , and Europe – which aim to stimulate debate, sharpen political clarity, and strengthen
      internationalist consciousness. To mark our ten-year anniversary, we produced
      dossier no. 90, How the World Looks from Tricontinental (July 2025), which presents
      our general view of the current conjuncture. Our assessment builds on five main
      arguments: Globalisation and neoliberalism enabled the capitalist class in the
      Global North to withdraw from productive investment in their own countries, leading
      to stagnation and austerity. This dynamic was cemented with the onset of the Third
      Great Depression. The realisation that the Global North would no longer be the
      buyer of last resort led many of the larger Global South countries to revive the
      idea of South-South cooperation for trade and development, culminating in the
      creation of the BRICS group in 2009, which has since expanded to BRICS+. The global
      economic centre of gravity has shifted from the North Atlantic to East and Southeast
      Asia, where the main centres of manufacturing and technological innovation are
      now located. The Global North faces growing difficulties in asserting political
      control over the international system due to its relative economic decline, even
      as it continues to dominate militarily and in communications infrastructure. Rather
      than compete economically with the rising Asian economies (led by China), the
      Global North, led by the United States, is pushing a New Cold War against China,
      using military and economic pressure to contain its technological and industrial
      advances. Our latest dossier concludes with a short note on the state of the class
      struggle amid these changes: More and more of the world is in motion, seeking
      to break from neoliberalism and imperialism and assert sovereign rule and paths
      of development. More and more people across the world seem to understand the futility
      of permanent austerity. But their projects are fragile and appear in ways that
      are not necessarily progressive. As of yet, the quantity of areas that seek to
      break from the current world order is not widespread or powerful enough to change
      the quality of the world order. But change is on the horizon. It is at the heart
      of the global class struggle. Something is bound to happen. The question of quantity
      and quality is key here. There are a vast number of protests erupting across the
      world, and there are sections of the world whose governments have the political
      will to break with the neocolonial order. However, the world system – still dominated
      by the US-led bloc – has not yet been fundamentally altered by this wave of rebellion.
      In the early 2010s, a wave of protests against the IMF-imposed debt-austerity
      regime swept across the Global South. At the time, it appeared as if no solution
      to the misery was possible. The protests themselves came to define the post-Great
      Depression era. But then, a shift began to take place: the emergence of a more
      confident South – what we call the ‘New Mood’ in the Global South. This new mood
      is not generated by the mass struggles of the working class and the peasantry
      but by increased assertions for political and economic sovereignty of Global South
      governments. The formation of BRICS was one signal of this new mood; another is
      the growing insistence on a new development theory and the building of alternative
      institutions that serve the interests of the Global South, such as the New Development
      Bank, established in 2014 by the BRICS countries. These moves have begun to shift
      us from a period of protest to one of construction. Can the poorer nations build
      a new architecture for development and sovereignty? Can this new architecture
      supplant the old? These are the questions of our time. As part of our contribution
      to this new architecture, I am pleased to announce that Tricontinental: Institute
      for Social Research has a new chief economist, Emiliano López, whose work on the
      Dependency Index and on the geopolitics of inequality has been groundbreaking.
      He will lead our team in shaping our contribution to the new development theory.
      There is no way to accurately predict whether the IMF approach will prevail or
      whether a new development theory – with a new development architecture – will
      establish itself. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of

      Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research A horrifying statistic
      hovers over the poorer nations: 3.4 billion people now live in countries that
      spend more on interest payments for public debt than on education or health. In
      2024, according to a new report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and
      Development (UNCTAD), global public debt reached $102 trillion – a third of which
      is held by developing countries. The impact on these countries is especially severe:
      credit markets charge poorer nations far higher interest rates than they do richer
      nations, making debt servicing payments proportionately higher for the Global
      South. The United States, for instance, pays interest rates that are, on average,
      two to four times lower than those faced by poorer nations. In 2023, according
      to the UNCTAD analysis, the poorer nations ‘paid $25 billion more to their external
      creditors in debt servicing than they received in fresh disbursements, resulting
      in a negative net resource transfer’. In more popular language: the social wealth
      of developing countries is being drained by wealthy creditors – mostly located
      in the Global North. The theft of social wealth from South to North has framed
      the work of Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research for the past decade.
      Following the Second Dilemmas of Humanity Conference (held in Brazil in 2015),
      our institute was founded to provide intellectual support to political and social
      movements and accompany them in the fight for emancipation. In the years since,
      our work has focused on four key areas: Highlighting the work of movements, as
      in our 2024 dossier The Political Organisation of Brazil’s Landless Workers’ Movement
      (MST) . Elaborating critiques of the current system from the standpoint of the
      movements themselves, as in our 2023 notebook The World in Economic Depression:
      A Marxist Analysis of Crisis , which examines the continuing fallout of the Third
      Great Depression triggered by the US mortgage crisis in 2008. Building an alternative
      framework for development that goes beyond the IMF’s debt-austerity regime, as
      introduced in our 2025 dossier Towards a New Development Theory for the Global
      South . Providing clear, accessible analysis of global developments and political
      struggles through our newsletters – published from Asia , Africa , Latin America
      , and Europe – which aim to stimulate debate, sharpen political clarity, and strengthen
      internationalist consciousness. To mark our ten-year anniversary, we produced
      dossier no. 90, How the World Looks from Tricontinental (July 2025), which presents
      our general view of the current conjuncture. Our assessment builds on five main
      arguments: Globalisation and neoliberalism enabled the capitalist class in the
      Global North to withdraw from productive investment in their own countries, leading
      to stagnation and austerity. This dynamic was cemented with the onset of the Third
      Great Depression. The realisation that the Global North would no longer be the
      buyer of last resort led many of the larger Global South countries to revive the
      idea of South-South cooperation for trade and development, culminating in the
      creation of the BRICS group in 2009, which has since expanded to BRICS+. The global
      economic centre of gravity has shifted from the North Atlantic to East and Southeast
      Asia, where the main centres of manufacturing and technological innovation are
      now located. The Global North faces growing difficulties in asserting political

      Israelis do not see the images of skeletal corpses of Palestinian children who
      they have starved to death as a curse. They do not see the slain families they
      gun down at food hubs — designed not to deliver aid but lure starving Palestinians
      into a massive concentration camp in the south of Gaza in preparation for deportation
      — as a war crime. Israelis do not look at the savage bombing and shelling that
      kill or wound dozens of Palestinian civilians, where an average of 28 children
      die daily , as anything extraordinary. They do not see the wasteland of Gaza,
      pulverized by bombs and methodically being torn down by bulldozers and excavators,
      leaving virtually the entire population of Gaza homeless, as barbaric. They do
      not see the destruction of water purification plants, decimation of hospitals
      and clinics, where doctors and medical staff are often unable to work because
      they are weak from malnutrition , as savage. They do not blink at the assassinations
      of doctors as well as journalists , 232 of whom have been murdered for trying
      to document the horror. Israelis have blinded themselves morally and intellectually.
      They view the genocide through the lens of a bankrupt media and political class
      that tells them only what they want to hear and shows them only what they want
      to see. They are intoxicated by the power of their industrial weapons and license
      to kill with impunity. They are drunk on self-adulation and the fantasy that they
      are the vanguard of civilization. They believe that the extermination of a people,
      including children, condemned as human contaminants, makes the world, especially
      their world, a happier and safer place. They are the heirs of Pol Pot , the killers
      that carried out the genocides in East Timor , Rwanda and Bosnia and, yes, the
      Nazis. Israel, like all genocidal states — no population since World War II has
      been dispossessed and starved with such speed and ruthlessness – has a final solution
      that would have earned the stamp of approval from Adolf Eichmann . Starvation
      was always the plan, the preordained final chapter of the genocide. Israel methodically
      set out from the beginning of the genocide to destroy sources of food, bombing
      bakeries and blocking food shipments into Gaza, something it has accelerated since
      March, when it severed nearly all food supplies. It targeted the United Nations
      Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) — on which
      most Palestinians depended on for food — for destruction, accusing its employees,
      without providing evidence, of being involved in the attacks of Oct. 7. This accusation
      was used to give funders such as the United States, which provided $422 million
      to the agency in 2023, the excuse to halt financial support. Israel then banned
      UNRWA. Over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and U.S. mercenaries
      in the chaotic scramble to get one of the few food packages distributed during
      the brief blocks of time, usually an hour, at the four aid sites set up by the
      Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , according to the U.N. Human Rights
      Office. Once Gaza was turned into a moonscape after 21 months of saturation bombing,
      once Palestinians were forced to live in tents, under crude tarps or in the open
      air, once clean water, food and medical aid became nearly impossible to find,
      once civil society was obliterated, Israel began its grim campaign to starve the
      Palestinians out of Gaza. One in three people in Gaza are going multiple days
      without eating, according to the U.N. Starvation is not a pretty sight. I covered
      the famine in Sudan in 1988 that took an estimated 250,000 lives. There are streaks
      in my lungs — scars from standing amid hundreds of Sudanese who were dying of
      tuberculosis. I was strong and healthy and fought off the contagion. They were
      weak and emaciated and did not. I watched hundreds of skeletal figures, ghosts
      of human beings, trudge at a glacial pace across the barren Sudanese landscape.
      Hyenas, accustomed to eating human flesh, routinely picked off small children.
      I stood over clusters of bleached human bones on the outskirts of villages where
      dozens of people, too weak to walk, had laid down in a group and never got up.
      Many were the remains of entire families. The starved lack enough calories to
      sustain themselves. They eat anything to survive — animal feed, grass, leaves,
      insects, rodents, even dirt. They suffer from constant diarrhea. They have trouble
      breathing because of respiratory infections. They rip up tiny bits of food, often
      spoiled, and ration it in a vain attempt to hold off the gnawing hunger pains.
      Starvation reduces the iron needed to produce hemoglobin, a protein in red blood
      cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body, and myoglobin, a protein
      that provides oxygen to muscles, coupled with a lack of vitamin B1, which affects
      heart and brain function . Anemia sets in . The body, in essence, feeds on itself.
      Tissue and muscle waste away. It is impossible to regulate body temperature. Kidneys
      shut down. Immune systems crash. Vital organs atrophy. Blood circulation slows.
      The volume of blood decreases. Infectious diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis
      and cholera become an epidemic, killing people by the thousands. It is impossible
      to concentrate. Emaciated victims succumb to mental and emotional withdrawal and
      apathy. They do not want to be touched or moved. The heart muscle is weakened.
      Victims, even at rest, are in a state of virtual heart failure. Wounds do not
      heal. Vision is impaired with cataracts, even among the young. Finally, wracked
      by convulsions and hallucinations, the heart stops. This process can last up to
      40 days for an adult. Children, the elderly and the sick expire at faster rates.This
      is the future Israel has preordained for the two million people in Gaza. But it
      is not the future Israelis see. They see paradise. They see an ethno-nationalist
      Jewish state where Palestinians, whose land they stole and occupied and whose
      people they have subjugated and forced into an apartheid existence, do not exist.
      They see cafes and hotels rising up where thousands, perhaps tens of thousands,
      of bodies lie buried under the rubble. They see tourists frolicking on the Gaza
      beachfront, a vision enhanced by an Artificial Intelligence-generated video uploaded
      to social media by Israeli Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, Gila
      Gamliel. It is what a Gaza devoid of Palestinians would look like, echoing the
      absurdist AI video posted by Donald Trump. In the new video, carefree Israelis
      eat at seaside restaurants. Anchored in the sparkling Mediterranean are luxury
      yachts. Gleaming hotels and office high rises, including a Trump Tower, dot the
      beachfront. Attractive residential neighborhoods stand where now there are broken,
      jagged mounds of concrete. The video shows Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara,
      as well as Trump and Melania, strolling along the seaside. Gamliel, like other
      Israeli leaders and Trump, cynically uses the term “voluntary emigration” to describe
      the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. This omits the stark choice Israel actually offers
      the Palestinians — leave or die . Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called
      for a “security annexation” of the northern Gaza Strip and vowed that Gaza will
      become an “inseparable part of the State of Israel.” He made the remarks at a
      Knesset conference called “The Gaza Riviera — from vision to reality,” which presented
      proposals for the building of Jewish colonies in Gaza. Smotrich said Israel would
      “relocate Gazans to other countries,” and that Trump endorsed the plan. Israeli
      Minister of Heritage Amichai Eliyahu, who once proposed dropping a nuclear bomb
      on Gaza, declared that “All Gaza will be Jewish.” The Israeli government “is racing
      ahead for Gaza to be wiped out,” Eliyahu said. He described Palestinians as Nazis.
      “Thank God, we are wiping out this evil. We are pushing this population that has
      been educated on ‘ Mein Kampf .’” Genocidal killers embrace fantasies of eradicating
      a native population and expanding their ethnonationalist state. The Nazis carried
      out their genocidal assault, which included mass starvation, on Slavs, Eastern
      European Jews and other indigenous people, dismissed as Untermenschen , or subhumans.
      Colonists were then to be shipped to Central and Eastern Europe to Germanize the
      occupied territory. These killers do not reckon with the darkness they unleash.
      The upscale beachfront properties dreamt of by Israel will never appear, just
      as the modern, exclusively Serb capital, with its golden domed cathedral, imposing
      presidency building, 15-story clock tower, state-of-the-art medical center and
      national theater with a 72-foot revolving stage was never built on the ruins of
      Bosnia. Rather, there will be ugly apartment blocks, populated by the usual miscreants,
      proto-fascists, racists and mediocrities who live in the Jewish colonies in the
      West Bank. These ultranationalists , who have formed rogue militias to seize Palestinian
      land and joined the Israeli army in murdering over 1,000 Palestinians in the West
      Bank since Oct. 7, will define Israel. They are the Israeli version of the 3-million-strong
      Pancasila Youth — Indonesia’s equivalent of the Brown Shirts or the Hitler Youth
      — that in 1965 helped carry out the genocidal mayhem that left half a million
      to one million dead. These rogue militias, equipped with automatic weapons provided
      by the Israeli government, lynched Saifullah Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American,
      who was attempting to protect his family’s land two weeks ago. He is the fifth
      U.S. citizen killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. Once these Israeli goons and
      thugs are done with the Palestinians, they will turn on each other. The genocide
      in Gaza signals the abolition, for Israelis as well as Palestinians, of the rule
      of law. It marks the obliteration of even the pretense of an ethical code. Israelis
      are the barbarians they condemn. If there is any warped justice in this genocide
      it is that Israelis, once they finish with the Palestinians, will be forced to
      live together in moral squalor. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES:

      Israelis do not see the images of skeletal corpses of Palestinian children who
      they have starved to death as a curse. They do not see the slain families they
      gun down at food hubs — designed not to deliver aid but lure starving Palestinians
      into a massive concentration camp in the south of Gaza in preparation for deportation
      — as a war crime. Israelis do not look at the savage bombing and shelling that
      kill or wound dozens of Palestinian civilians, where an average of 28 children
      die daily , as anything extraordinary. They do not see the wasteland of Gaza,
      pulverized by bombs and methodically being torn down by bulldozers and excavators,
      leaving virtually the entire population of Gaza homeless, as barbaric. They do
      not see the destruction of water purification plants, decimation of hospitals
      and clinics, where doctors and medical staff are often unable to work because
      they are weak from malnutrition , as savage. They do not blink at the assassinations
      of doctors as well as journalists , 232 of whom have been murdered for trying
      to document the horror. Israelis have blinded themselves morally and intellectually.
      They view the genocide through the lens of a bankrupt media and political class
      that tells them only what they want to hear and shows them only what they want
      to see. They are intoxicated by the power of their industrial weapons and license
      to kill with impunity. They are drunk on self-adulation and the fantasy that they
      are the vanguard of civilization. They believe that the extermination of a people,
      including children, condemned as human contaminants, makes the world, especially
      their world, a happier and safer place. They are the heirs of Pol Pot , the killers
      that carried out the genocides in East Timor , Rwanda and Bosnia and, yes, the
      Nazis. Israel, like all genocidal states — no population since World War II has
      been dispossessed and starved with such speed and ruthlessness – has a final solution
      that would have earned the stamp of approval from Adolf Eichmann . Starvation
      was always the plan, the preordained final chapter of the genocide. Israel methodically
      set out from the beginning of the genocide to destroy sources of food, bombing
      bakeries and blocking food shipments into Gaza, something it has accelerated since
      March, when it severed nearly all food supplies. It targeted the United Nations
      Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) — on which
      most Palestinians depended on for food — for destruction, accusing its employees,
      without providing evidence, of being involved in the attacks of Oct. 7. This accusation
      was used to give funders such as the United States, which provided $422 million
      to the agency in 2023, the excuse to halt financial support. Israel then banned
      UNRWA. Over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and U.S. mercenaries
      in the chaotic scramble to get one of the few food packages distributed during
      the brief blocks of time, usually an hour, at the four aid sites set up by the
      Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation , according to the U.N. Human Rights
      Office. Once Gaza was turned into a moonscape after 21 months of saturation bombing,
      once Palestinians were forced to live in tents, under crude tarps or in the open
      air, once clean water, food and medical aid became nearly impossible to find,
      once civil society was obliterated, Israel began its grim campaign to starve the
      Palestinians out of Gaza. One in three people in Gaza are going multiple days
      without eating, according to the U.N. Starvation is not a pretty sight. I covered
      the famine in Sudan in 1988 that took an estimated 250,000 lives. There are streaks
      in my lungs — scars from standing amid hundreds of Sudanese who were dying of
      tuberculosis. I was strong and healthy and fought off the contagion. They were
      weak and emaciated and did not. I watched hundreds of skeletal figures, ghosts
      of human beings, trudge at a glacial pace across the barren Sudanese landscape.
      Hyenas, accustomed to eating human flesh, routinely picked off small children.
      I stood over clusters of bleached human bones on the outskirts of villages where
      dozens of people, too weak to walk, had laid down in a group and never got up.
      Many were the remains of entire families. The starved lack enough calories to
      sustain themselves. They eat anything to survive — animal feed, grass, leaves,
      insects, rodents, even dirt. They suffer from constant diarrhea. They have trouble
      breathing because of respiratory infections. They rip up tiny bits of food, often
      spoiled, and ration it in a vain attempt to hold off the gnawing hunger pains.
      Starvation reduces the iron needed to produce hemoglobin, a protein in red blood
      cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body, and myoglobin, a protein
      that provides oxygen to muscles, coupled with a lack of vitamin B1, which affects
      heart and brain function . Anemia sets in . The body, in essence, feeds on itself.
      Tissue and muscle waste away. It is impossible to regulate body temperature. Kidneys
      shut down. Immune systems crash. Vital organs atrophy. Blood circulation slows.
      The volume of blood decreases. Infectious diseases such as typhoid, tuberculosis
      and cholera become an epidemic, killing people by the thousands. It is impossible
      to concentrate. Emaciated victims succumb to mental and emotional withdrawal and
      apathy. They do not want to be touched or moved. The heart muscle is weakened.
      Victims, even at rest, are in a state of virtual heart failure. Wounds do not
      heal. Vision is impaired with cataracts, even among the young. Finally, wracked
      by convulsions and hallucinations, the heart stops. This process can last up to
      40 days for an adult. Children, the elderly and the sick expire at faster rates.This
      is the future Israel has preordained for the two million people in Gaza. But it
      is not the future Israelis see. They see paradise. They see an ethno-nationalist
      Jewish state where Palestinians, whose land they stole and occupied and whose
      people they have subjugated and forced into an apartheid existence, do not exist.
      They see cafes and hotels rising up where thousands, perhaps tens of thousands,
      of bodies lie buried under the rubble. They see tourists frolicking on the Gaza
      beachfront, a vision enhanced by an Artificial Intelligence-generated video uploaded
      to social media by Israeli Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology, Gila
      Gamliel. It is what a Gaza devoid of Palestinians would look like, echoing the
      absurdist AI video posted by Donald Trump. In the new video, carefree Israelis
      eat at seaside restaurants. Anchored in the sparkling Mediterranean are luxury
      yachts. Gleaming hotels and office high rises, including a Trump Tower, dot the
      beachfront. Attractive residential neighborhoods stand where now there are broken,
      jagged mounds of concrete. The video shows Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara,
      as well as Trump and Melania, strolling along the seaside. Gamliel, like other
      Israeli leaders and Trump, cynically uses the term “voluntary emigration” to describe
      the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. This omits the stark choice Israel actually offers
      the Palestinians — leave or die . Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called
      for a “security annexation” of the northern Gaza Strip and vowed that Gaza will
      become an “inseparable part of the State of Israel.” He made the remarks at a
      Knesset conference called “The Gaza Riviera — from vision to reality,” which presented
      proposals for the building of Jewish colonies in Gaza. Smotrich said Israel would
      “relocate Gazans to other countries,” and that Trump endorsed the plan. Israeli
      Minister of Heritage Amichai Eliyahu, who once proposed dropping a nuclear bomb
      on Gaza, declared that “All Gaza will be Jewish.” The Israeli government “is racing
      ahead for Gaza to be wiped out,” Eliyahu said. He described Palestinians as Nazis.
      “Thank God, we are wiping out this evil. We are pushing this population that has
      been educated on ‘ Mein Kampf .’” Genocidal killers embrace fantasies of eradicating
      a native population and expanding their ethnonationalist state. The Nazis carried
      out their genocidal assault, which included mass starvation, on Slavs, Eastern
      European Jews and other indigenous people, dismissed as Untermenschen , or subhumans.
      Colonists were then to be shipped to Central and Eastern Europe to Germanize the
      occupied territory. These killers do not reckon with the darkness they unleash.
      The upscale beachfront properties dreamt of by Israel will never appear, just
      as the modern, exclusively Serb capital, with its golden domed cathedral, imposing
      presidency building, 15-story clock tower, state-of-the-art medical center and
      national theater with a 72-foot revolving stage was never built on the ruins of
      Bosnia. Rather, there will be ugly apartment blocks, populated by the usual miscreants,
      proto-fascists, racists and mediocrities who live in the Jewish colonies in the
      West Bank. These ultranationalists , who have formed rogue militias to seize Palestinian
      land and joined the Israeli army in murdering over 1,000 Palestinians in the West
      Bank since Oct. 7, will define Israel. They are the Israeli version of the 3-million-strong
      Pancasila Youth — Indonesia’s equivalent of the Brown Shirts or the Hitler Youth
      — that in 1965 helped carry out the genocidal mayhem that left half a million
      to one million dead. These rogue militias, equipped with automatic weapons provided
      by the Israeli government, lynched Saifullah Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American,
      who was attempting to protect his family’s land two weeks ago. He is the fifth
      U.S. citizen killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. Once these Israeli goons and
      thugs are done with the Palestinians, they will turn on each other. The genocide
      in Gaza signals the abolition, for Israelis as well as Palestinians, of the rule
      of law. It marks the obliteration of even the pretense of an ethical code. Israelis
      are the barbarians they condemn. If there is any warped justice in this genocide
      it is that Israelis, once they finish with the Palestinians, will be forced to
      live together in moral squalor. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES:

      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report The United States has militarily intervened
      in practically every country in Latin America. The CIA has backed dozens of coups
      d’etat against democratically elected left-wing governments in Latin America,
      in an attempt to impose US imperial hegemony in the region and serve US corporate
      interests. Today, more and more US government officials , especially those in
      Donald Trump’s two administrations , have invoked the 200-year-old colonial Monroe
      Doctrine to claim that Latin America is supposedly Washington’s “backyard”, that
      the US empire should control it, and that China and Russia cannot have relations
      with the countries in the region. Given that the US government constantly violates
      the sovereignty of countries in Latin America, it makes perfect sense that several
      governments in the region have deepened their partnership with China and Russia
      , because they see that Beijing and Moscow actually respect their independence
      and have helped them to economically develop, while Washington has only sought
      to exploit them. History of US imperialism in Nicaragua A perfect case study of
      the devastating effects of US imperialism in Latin America is Nicaragua. The Central
      American nation has been invaded by the United States multiple times. The Nicaraguan
      people have endured relentless attacks by the US empire, not just for decades,
      but for centuries. Central America finally won its independence from Spanish colonialism
      in 1821, after hundreds of years of struggle. However, just a few decades later,
      the US empire replaced the Spanish empire. Washington tried to colonize the region
      to exploit its resources and geostrategic location to benefit the business interests
      of oligarchic US “robber barons” like Cornelius Vanderbilt, who sought to build
      an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua. In 1855, a multimillionaire US mercenary
      leader named William Walker invaded Nicaragua. Walker was an ardent colonialist
      who believed in the colonial doctrine of “Manifest Destiny”. Backed by his colonial
      mercenary army of “Filibusters”, Walker declared himself to be the unelected so-called
      “president” of Nicaragua. He then reinstated slavery in the territory he controlled
      through violence and corruption. Central America had abolished slavery in 1824.
      The so-called “enlightened”, “democratic” United States did not abolish slavery
      until 41 years later, in 1865, after years of bloodshed in a brutal civil war.
      Many US colonialists like Walker had profited from slavery, and wanted to expand
      the barbaric system into other parts of the world as they expanded the US empire.
      Walker was eventually defeated by the people of Nicaragua and he was expelled.
      But before he left the country, he burned down the major city Granada. Despite
      Walker’s defeat, the US empire still desperately sought to colonize Nicaragua.
      So in 1912, the US military invaded and occupied the country, turning it into
      an unofficial US colony. The people of Nicaragua rose up against the US empire.
      A revolutionary leader named Augusto César Sandino created a guerilla army to
      resist the colonial US military occupation. He called it the Army in Defense of
      the National Sovereignty of Nicaragua. Sandino led a revolutionary guerilla war
      against the US military occupiers for several years, and eventually defeated them
      in 1933, expelling the foreign colonialists. However, although the US military
      was defeated, Nicaragua was not able to regain its sovereignty, because a year
      later, in 1934, Sandino was betrayed and killed by a US puppet, Anastasio Somoza
      García, the leader of Nicaragua’s National Guard, which had been created by the
      US military to serve as a tool of Washington’s imperial power. Somoza was educated
      in the US and came from a very wealthy right-wing oligarchic family in Nicaragua,
      which collaborated with the US empire, and profited handsomely from this treachery.
      Somoza assumed power as dictator of Nicaragua. After his death at the hands of
      revolutionary Rigoberto López Pérez in 1956, his son Anastasio Somoza Debayle
      took over the dynastic dictatorship. The Somozas were obedient US puppets, and
      they brutally exploited working-class Nicaraguans on behalf of US corporate interests,
      terrorizing all political opposition. In the 1970s, the people of Nicaragua took
      up arms and waged a revolutionary struggle against the Somoza dictatorship. The
      socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) was inspired by Sandino’s
      revolutionary war against the US colonial occupation, and fought its own war against
      a neocolonial US puppet regime. The Sandinistas toppled Somoza and created a new
      revolutionary left-wing government on the 19th of July, 1979. Finally, Nicaragua
      was able to restore its sovereignty. But the US empire never sleeps. Washington
      immediately launched another neocolonial war on Nicaragua. The CIA created far-right
      death squads, known as the “Contras” (short for “counterrevolutionaries”). With
      staunch US government support, the Contra terrorists assassinated Nicaraguan government
      officials; blew up civilian infrastructure; raped, tortured, and killed civilians;
      and burned down schools and hospitals. To help fund their US proxy war on Nicaragua,
      the Contras also trafficked drugs — and many of those narcotics ended up in US
      neighborhoods, especially poor, majority Black neighborhoods, which fueled the
      crack epidemic in the 1980s. Journalist Gary Webb exposed the CIA’s role in this
      drug trafficking scheme, in his book Dark Alliance : The CIA, the Contras, and
      the Crack Cocaine Explosion . The US government punished him by destroying his
      career. Webb later died in very mysterious circumstances. In 1984, the government
      of Nicaragua filed a lawsuit against the United States at the International Court
      of Justice (ICJ), the top UN legal authority, located at the Hague. Nicaragua
      won this case in 1986 . The Hague found the US government guilty of carrying out
      horrific crimes, including bombing civilian infrastructure, putting mines in civilian
      ports, and overseeing other acts of terror. The ICJ ordered the US government
      not only to cease all of these crimes, but also to pay Nicaragua reparations.
      Washington showed itself to be a complete rogue state; it ignored the Hague’s
      ruling and continued to wage this criminal terrorist war. Still to this day, the
      US government has refused to pay Nicaragua the reparations that it is legally
      owed according to international law. A former commander of the CIA-backed Contras
      published a very revealing article in the New York Times in 1986, titled “ Terror
      Is the Most Effective Weapon of Nicaragua’s ‘Contras’ ”. This was written by Edgar
      Chamorro, who was a member of one of the most powerful and wealthiest oligarchic
      families in Nicaragua. Chamorro acknowledged that he had previously led the Contras,
      but he resigned because he said he didn’t want to be a “CIA puppet”. He wrote
      (all emphasis added): The ‘contras’ were, and are, a proxy army controlled by
      the U.S. Government . If U.S. support were terminated, they would not only be
      incapable of conducting any military activities against the Sandinistas, but would
      also immediately begin to disintegrate. I resigned rather than continue as a Central
      Intelligence Agency puppet . It is cynical to assert that the ”contras” respect
      human rights. During my four years as a ”contra” director, it was premeditated
      policy to terrorize civilian noncombatants to prevent them from cooperating with
      the Government . Hundreds of civilian murders, mutilations, tortures and rapes
      were committed in pursuit of this policy, of which the ”contra” leaders and their
      C.I.A. superiors were well aware. Chamorro also admitted that the Contras were
      being led by the former National Guard of the brutal Somoza dictatorship. Although
      Chamorro was very anti-Sandinista — again, he had served as a commander of the
      Contras — he reluctantly admitted the truth, writing: The Sandinistas , for all
      their faults, have made enormous advances in education, housing and health care,
      issues of vital importance to Nicaragua’s poor majority . Unfortunately, the ”contras”
      burn down schools, homes and health centers as fast as the Sandinistas build them.
      While Nicaragua’s economy is suffering – partly because of Sandinista mistakes,
      but more because of the war and the U.S. economic embargo – the Sandinistas must
      be credited with generating an atmosphere of genuine equality for the first time
      in Nicaragua’s history . By contrast, the ”contras” who were my colleagues talked
      mostly of recovering their lost wealth and privileged status. That article was
      published in 1986, but everything Chamorro said is still accurate today. In 2018,
      the US government sponsored another violent right-wing coup attempt in Nicaragua
      — once again, involving several family members from the oligarchic Chamorro dynasty.
      This coup was led by the same elite, wealthy right-wing forces in Nicaragua, which
      have been desperate to overthrow the Sandinistas, to reverse the revolution, to
      privatize the free public health care and education systems, to slash spending
      on the massive social programs that have helped poor and working-class Nicaraguans,
      and to obediently subordinate the country to Washington. The US State Department
      meets with the right-wing oligarchs who led the failed coup attempt in Nicaragua
      in 2018, including Juan Sebastián Chamorro and Félix Maradiaga China helps Nicaragua
      develop Meanwhile, as the United States has invaded, occupied, and terrorized
      Nicaragua not just for decades, but for centuries, China has been partnering with
      the country to help it to economically develop. China is helping Nicaragua to
      build the massive Punta Huete International Airport . China has sent Nicaragua
      hundreds of new state-of-the-art buses , to strengthen public transportation.
      China has helped Nicaragua to expand its ports , so it can deepen its trade with
      other countries, and reduce its economic dependence on the United States. China
      is helping Nicaragua build large solar plants , so it can have more renewable
      energy and be less dependent on oil imports. China has also been helping Nicaragua
      to build substantial social housing communities. In July 2025, they inaugurated
      the new neighborhood “Nuevas Victorias” , where 920 houses were built with funding
      provided by China in solidarity with the people of Nicaragua. An additional 720
      houses will be built in phase two, starting in September. These are just a few
      examples of how China is a much better partner for countries in Latin America,
      as it respects their sovereignty and helps to provide resources to develop according
      to the economic model they wish to pursue — unlike the US empire, which imposes
      its own exploitative neoliberal capitalist model on countries and denies them
      their independence. The 46th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution The Sandinistas
      have recognized that, in order to defend their country’s sovereignty, they must
      forge a new path. Nicaragua has played a key role in pushing for a more multipolar
      world , in opposition to US imperial hegemony. The 19th of July, 2025, marked
      the 46th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua. A massive celebration
      was held in the capital Managua. The ceremony featured diplomatic representatives
      from several other countries that have waged revolutionary anti-imperialist struggles
      of their own, including China, Russia, Palestine, Vietnam, Venezuela, Cuba, Honduras,
      Burkina Faso, Algeria, the DPRK, and Belarus. In her speech at the celebration
      , co-President Rosario Murillo emphasized that “Nicaragua has fought and defeated
      the imperialists of the planet”, and she stressed the sacred importance of maintaining
      “peace, which has cost us so much, and for which so many hundreds of thousands
      of Nicaraguans have given their lives”. The Sandinistas have waged “frontal combat
      against poverty in all of its forms”, declared co-President Murillo, while always
      seeking “dignity, independence, sovereignty, and, of course, well-being”. In his
      remarks at the 46th anniversary celebration, co-President Daniel Ortega discussed
      the role of Nicaragua in the international struggle against imperialism. He honored
      the brotherly revolutions in other countries that had inspired the Sandinistas.
      The key points made by co-President Ortega were the following: – Nicaragua offers
      its full support for Palestine, and unflinching opposition to the US-Israeli genocide
      in Gaza. – Nicaragua strongly supports Iran in its defense against US-Israeli
      aggression. – Fascism has its roots in European colonialism. The West talks about
      “democracy” and “human rights”, but the crimes committed by European empires —
      like the transatlantic slave trade of millions of Africans and the French empire’s
      mass atrocities in Algeria — were very similar to those committed by Nazi Germany.
      (Co-President Ortega praised the Algerian Revolution as an inspiration for Nicaragua.)
      – Haiti had the first victorious revolution in Latin America and the Caribbean.
      Haiti inspired Simón Bolívar, and militarily supported him, as he carried out
      his own anti-colonial revolution in South America. Nicaragua is inspired by Haiti’s
      example. – Immediately after Spanish colonialism was defeated in Latin America,
      US imperialism replaced it. The US invaded Nicaragua several times, and US imperialism
      remains the principal threat for Latin America and the world today. – Never forget
      the crimes the US committed in Nicaragua in the 1980s, when the CIA armed and
      trained the far-right Contra terrorists. Ortega recalled that the US-sponsored
      Contras also trafficked drugs, many of which ended up in US neighborhoods. – It
      was the Soviet Union and China that defeated fascism in World War Two. This year
      is the 80th anniversary of their heroic victory over Nazi Germany and the fascist
      Japanese empire. – “We in the [Sandinista] Front were inspired by the Russian
      Revolution and the Chinese Revolution”, Ortega said. He praised Mao Zedong as
      a “great leader who is always in our thoughts”. – Today, the People’s Republic
      of China and Russian Federation are friends of the Global South, helping Nicaragua
      and other countries to defend their sovereignty against Western imperialism, Ortega
      emphasized. – Capitalist Europe is now remilitarizing and massively increasing
      its military spending on weapons because it, along with the US, wants to prepare
      for war against Russia and China, he argued. – The United Nations has become a
      tool dominated by the Western imperialist powers, and the US uses its veto power
      to prevent the UN from taking any significant action (like stopping the genocide
      in Gaza). The UN needs a “refoundation”, Ortega said, to create a “new United
      Nations”. He recalled that Nicaragua’s former Foreign Minister Miguel D’Escoto
      served as president of the UN General Assembly in 2008, and tried to reform the
      body, but was ultimately unable to do so. Like Ortega, D’Escoto concluded that
      the UN should be “reinvented” , so the Global South (the Global Majority) has
      more representation. Co-President Ortega ended his speech warning that, although
      there is peace in Nicaragua today, “that does not mean that the enemy [the US
      empire] is resting. The enemy is always conspiring, always trying to provoke bloodshed,
      always trying to provoke pain in Nicaraguan families, because they believe they
      can defeat the revolution”. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted

      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report The United States has militarily intervened
      in practically every country in Latin America. The CIA has backed dozens of coups
      d’etat against democratically elected left-wing governments in Latin America,
      in an attempt to impose US imperial hegemony in the region and serve US corporate
      interests. Today, more and more US government officials , especially those in
      Donald Trump’s two administrations , have invoked the 200-year-old colonial Monroe
      Doctrine to claim that Latin America is supposedly Washington’s “backyard”, that
      the US empire should control it, and that China and Russia cannot have relations
      with the countries in the region. Given that the US government constantly violates
      the sovereignty of countries in Latin America, it makes perfect sense that several
      governments in the region have deepened their partnership with China and Russia
      , because they see that Beijing and Moscow actually respect their independence
      and have helped them to economically develop, while Washington has only sought
      to exploit them. History of US imperialism in Nicaragua A perfect case study of
      the devastating effects of US imperialism in Latin America is Nicaragua. The Central
      American nation has been invaded by the United States multiple times. The Nicaraguan
      people have endured relentless attacks by the US empire, not just for decades,
      but for centuries. Central America finally won its independence from Spanish colonialism
      in 1821, after hundreds of years of struggle. However, just a few decades later,
      the US empire replaced the Spanish empire. Washington tried to colonize the region
      to exploit its resources and geostrategic location to benefit the business interests
      of oligarchic US “robber barons” like Cornelius Vanderbilt, who sought to build
      an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua. In 1855, a multimillionaire US mercenary
      leader named William Walker invaded Nicaragua. Walker was an ardent colonialist
      who believed in the colonial doctrine of “Manifest Destiny”. Backed by his colonial
      mercenary army of “Filibusters”, Walker declared himself to be the unelected so-called
      “president” of Nicaragua. He then reinstated slavery in the territory he controlled
      through violence and corruption. Central America had abolished slavery in 1824.
      The so-called “enlightened”, “democratic” United States did not abolish slavery
      until 41 years later, in 1865, after years of bloodshed in a brutal civil war.
      Many US colonialists like Walker had profited from slavery, and wanted to expand
      the barbaric system into other parts of the world as they expanded the US empire.
      Walker was eventually defeated by the people of Nicaragua and he was expelled.
      But before he left the country, he burned down the major city Granada. Despite
      Walker’s defeat, the US empire still desperately sought to colonize Nicaragua.
      So in 1912, the US military invaded and occupied the country, turning it into
      an unofficial US colony. The people of Nicaragua rose up against the US empire.
      A revolutionary leader named Augusto César Sandino created a guerilla army to
      resist the colonial US military occupation. He called it the Army in Defense of
      the National Sovereignty of Nicaragua. Sandino led a revolutionary guerilla war
      against the US military occupiers for several years, and eventually defeated them
      in 1933, expelling the foreign colonialists. However, although the US military
      was defeated, Nicaragua was not able to regain its sovereignty, because a year
      later, in 1934, Sandino was betrayed and killed by a US puppet, Anastasio Somoza
      García, the leader of Nicaragua’s National Guard, which had been created by the
      US military to serve as a tool of Washington’s imperial power. Somoza was educated
      in the US and came from a very wealthy right-wing oligarchic family in Nicaragua,
      which collaborated with the US empire, and profited handsomely from this treachery.
      Somoza assumed power as dictator of Nicaragua. After his death at the hands of
      revolutionary Rigoberto López Pérez in 1956, his son Anastasio Somoza Debayle
      took over the dynastic dictatorship. The Somozas were obedient US puppets, and
      they brutally exploited working-class Nicaraguans on behalf of US corporate interests,
      terrorizing all political opposition. In the 1970s, the people of Nicaragua took
      up arms and waged a revolutionary struggle against the Somoza dictatorship. The
      socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) was inspired by Sandino’s
      revolutionary war against the US colonial occupation, and fought its own war against
      a neocolonial US puppet regime. The Sandinistas toppled Somoza and created a new
      revolutionary left-wing government on the 19th of July, 1979. Finally, Nicaragua
      was able to restore its sovereignty. But the US empire never sleeps. Washington
      immediately launched another neocolonial war on Nicaragua. The CIA created far-right
      death squads, known as the “Contras” (short for “counterrevolutionaries”). With
      staunch US government support, the Contra terrorists assassinated Nicaraguan government
      officials; blew up civilian infrastructure; raped, tortured, and killed civilians;
      and burned down schools and hospitals. To help fund their US proxy war on Nicaragua,
      the Contras also trafficked drugs — and many of those narcotics ended up in US
      neighborhoods, especially poor, majority Black neighborhoods, which fueled the
      crack epidemic in the 1980s. Journalist Gary Webb exposed the CIA’s role in this
      drug trafficking scheme, in his book Dark Alliance : The CIA, the Contras, and
      the Crack Cocaine Explosion . The US government punished him by destroying his
      career. Webb later died in very mysterious circumstances. In 1984, the government
      of Nicaragua filed a lawsuit against the United States at the International Court
      of Justice (ICJ), the top UN legal authority, located at the Hague. Nicaragua
      won this case in 1986 . The Hague found the US government guilty of carrying out
      horrific crimes, including bombing civilian infrastructure, putting mines in civilian
      ports, and overseeing other acts of terror. The ICJ ordered the US government
      not only to cease all of these crimes, but also to pay Nicaragua reparations.
      Washington showed itself to be a complete rogue state; it ignored the Hague’s
      ruling and continued to wage this criminal terrorist war. Still to this day, the
      US government has refused to pay Nicaragua the reparations that it is legally
      owed according to international law. A former commander of the CIA-backed Contras
      published a very revealing article in the New York Times in 1986, titled “ Terror
      Is the Most Effective Weapon of Nicaragua’s ‘Contras’ ”. This was written by Edgar
      Chamorro, who was a member of one of the most powerful and wealthiest oligarchic
      families in Nicaragua. Chamorro acknowledged that he had previously led the Contras,
      but he resigned because he said he didn’t want to be a “CIA puppet”. He wrote
      (all emphasis added): The ‘contras’ were, and are, a proxy army controlled by
      the U.S. Government . If U.S. support were terminated, they would not only be
      incapable of conducting any military activities against the Sandinistas, but would
      also immediately begin to disintegrate. I resigned rather than continue as a Central
      Intelligence Agency puppet . It is cynical to assert that the ”contras” respect
      human rights. During my four years as a ”contra” director, it was premeditated
      policy to terrorize civilian noncombatants to prevent them from cooperating with
      the Government . Hundreds of civilian murders, mutilations, tortures and rapes
      were committed in pursuit of this policy, of which the ”contra” leaders and their
      C.I.A. superiors were well aware. Chamorro also admitted that the Contras were
      being led by the former National Guard of the brutal Somoza dictatorship. Although
      Chamorro was very anti-Sandinista — again, he had served as a commander of the
      Contras — he reluctantly admitted the truth, writing: The Sandinistas , for all
      their faults, have made enormous advances in education, housing and health care,
      issues of vital importance to Nicaragua’s poor majority . Unfortunately, the ”contras”
      burn down schools, homes and health centers as fast as the Sandinistas build them.
      While Nicaragua’s economy is suffering – partly because of Sandinista mistakes,
      but more because of the war and the U.S. economic embargo – the Sandinistas must
      be credited with generating an atmosphere of genuine equality for the first time
      in Nicaragua’s history . By contrast, the ”contras” who were my colleagues talked
      mostly of recovering their lost wealth and privileged status. That article was
      published in 1986, but everything Chamorro said is still accurate today. In 2018,
      the US government sponsored another violent right-wing coup attempt in Nicaragua
      — once again, involving several family members from the oligarchic Chamorro dynasty.
      This coup was led by the same elite, wealthy right-wing forces in Nicaragua, which
      have been desperate to overthrow the Sandinistas, to reverse the revolution, to
      privatize the free public health care and education systems, to slash spending
      on the massive social programs that have helped poor and working-class Nicaraguans,
      and to obediently subordinate the country to Washington. The US State Department
      meets with the right-wing oligarchs who led the failed coup attempt in Nicaragua
      in 2018, including Juan Sebastián Chamorro and Félix Maradiaga China helps Nicaragua
      develop Meanwhile, as the United States has invaded, occupied, and terrorized
      Nicaragua not just for decades, but for centuries, China has been partnering with
      the country to help it to economically develop. China is helping Nicaragua to
      build the massive Punta Huete International Airport . China has sent Nicaragua
      hundreds of new state-of-the-art buses , to strengthen public transportation.
      China has helped Nicaragua to expand its ports , so it can deepen its trade with
      other countries, and reduce its economic dependence on the United States. China
      is helping Nicaragua build large solar plants , so it can have more renewable
      energy and be less dependent on oil imports. China has also been helping Nicaragua
      to build substantial social housing communities. In July 2025, they inaugurated
      the new neighborhood “Nuevas Victorias” , where 920 houses were built with funding
      provided by China in solidarity with the people of Nicaragua. An additional 720
      houses will be built in phase two, starting in September. These are just a few
      examples of how China is a much better partner for countries in Latin America,
      as it respects their sovereignty and helps to provide resources to develop according
      to the economic model they wish to pursue — unlike the US empire, which imposes
      its own exploitative neoliberal capitalist model on countries and denies them
      their independence. The 46th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution The Sandinistas
      have recognized that, in order to defend their country’s sovereignty, they must
      forge a new path. Nicaragua has played a key role in pushing for a more multipolar
      world , in opposition to US imperial hegemony. The 19th of July, 2025, marked
      the 46th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua. A massive celebration
      was held in the capital Managua. The ceremony featured diplomatic representatives
      from several other countries that have waged revolutionary anti-imperialist struggles
      of their own, including China, Russia, Palestine, Vietnam, Venezuela, Cuba, Honduras,
      Burkina Faso, Algeria, the DPRK, and Belarus. In her speech at the celebration
      , co-President Rosario Murillo emphasized that “Nicaragua has fought and defeated
      the imperialists of the planet”, and she stressed the sacred importance of maintaining
      “peace, which has cost us so much, and for which so many hundreds of thousands

      but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Kit Klarenberg / The Cradle On 19 July , the Mail on Sunday revealed
      that Inter-Mediate, a shadowy firm founded by Jonathan Powell, now National Security
      advisor to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, brokered the re-establishment
      of diplomatic relations between Damascus and London. This included a heavily publicized
      meeting between UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Syria’s self-appointed President
      Ahmad al-Sharaa, two weeks earlier. The outlet also exposed how the British state-
      funded Inter-Mediate operates a dedicated office in Syria’s Presidential Palace.
      Britain’s opposition Conservative party has demanded a formal inquiry into Powell’s
      use of Inter-Mediate “to run back channels to terrorist groups” and the conflict
      of interest created by his unelected role. As Starmer’s national security advisor
      – described as wielding “more influence over foreign policy than anyone in government
      after the prime minister himself” – Powell operates entirely outside parliamentary
      accountability. A Whitehall source told the Mail on Sunday : “These are essentially
      outsourced spies and spooks undertaking ‘back channel’ discussions with political
      leaders and armed groups to reach negotiated settlements.” Terrorists to technocrats
      Inter-Mediate’s central role in assisting former Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) leader
      Sharaa’s rise to power in Damascus was first revealed in May by Independent Arabia
      . This followed disclosures from former US ambassador to Syria Robert Ford (2011
      – 2014), that in 2023 a British “non-governmental organization” sought his personal
      assistance in transforming HTS – in particular Sharaa, who went by the nom de
      guerre Abu Mohammad Julani when he was an ISIS chief – from “terrorists” into
      politicians. While Ford did not name Inter-Mediate, Independent Arabia did – and
      mainstream media ignored it entirely. Now that Inter-Mediate’s embedment with
      Damascus’s post-Bashar al-Assad government has been confirmed, western media has
      belatedly begun describing Syria’s new rulers as comprised of barbarous extremists
      linked to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Yet few are willing to interrogate the far graver
      implications of a British intelligence-linked firm enjoying intimate access to
      Syria’s seat of power – and the extraordinary leverage that affords London over
      the HTS-led administration and its leadership. Compounding this is the deeply
      suspicious timing: Powell assumed his advisory role just days before HTS violently
      seized Damascus. Starmer immediately declared that Assad’s ouster heralded “a
      more active role” for Britain in West Asia and dispatched top diplomats to meet
      with HTS officials. The media acknowledged these summits were completely illegal
      , as HTS was a proscribed terror group under British law. Since taking office,
      Sharaa has announced Syria’s once-independent economy is fully open for western
      exploitation, ordered massacres of Alawites and other religious minorities, while
      seeking to normalize relations with Israel. Despite the occupation state routinely
      executing highly destructive airstrikes against government and military infrastructure
      since former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s fall, HTS appears undeterred.
      We are thus left to ponder whether the Al-Qaeda-rooted government’s brutal internal
      repression, and concerted inaction over Tel Aviv’s military bombardments and incursions
      into its territory, are ultimately directed by MI6. ‘Deny responsibility’ Inter-Mediate’s
      website offers few clues to its real agenda. It lists a cadre of former western
      diplomats and military officials as staff and board members , and vaguely claims
      to facilitate “backchannels with hard-to-reach conflict actors” where “direct
      negotiations are impossible or inadvisable.” It boasts of creating space for political
      solutions “in some of the world’s most intractable conflicts.” Syria was quite
      some “intractable conflict” – not least because Assad’s “ popular ” and sovereign
      government steadfastly refused to relinquish power to mass-murdering CIA and MI6-backed
      foreign elements that invaded the country in 2011. Leaked emails of former US
      secretary of state Hillary Clinton indicate Inter-Mediate was active in Damascus
      from the first stages of the foreign-fomented “crisis.” In March 2012 , Clinton’s
      senior aide Jake Sullivan contacted her, announcing Powell had “launched a new
      NGO that has already initiated some very interesting work below the radar.” An
      attached email from Powell noted Inter-Mediate had “[set] up secret channels between
      insurgents and governments” in several countries, was preparing to start work
      in Burma, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, and sought to pitch its services to senior
      US State Department officials. He added his firm “work[ed] closely” with the British
      Foreign Office, National Security Council, and MI6. At this time, it was well-understood
      in Washington that Syrian “insurgents” were affiliated with Al-Qaeda, among other
      ultra-extremist entities. The evidence suggests Inter-Mediate’s relationship with
      the forces that became HTS dates back over a decade, and that London’s project
      to replace Assad with a compliant Al-Qaeda-linked regime has been in motion ever
      since. Its operational office inside Syria’s palace is not a recent development,
      but the culmination of years of quiet penetration. Nor is Inter-Mediate the only
      British intelligence cutout embedded in West Asia’s corridors of power. As The
      Cradle has previously documented, Lebanon’s security and intelligence apparatus
      is heavily penetrated by the British, to the extent that Foreign Office contractor
      Torchlight maintains a dedicated office within Beirut’s Military Intelligence
      Directorate. Leaked documents related to this infiltration noted London’s presence
      was a highly effective means of “rapidly developing relationships of trust” with
      the agency’s high-ranking staff, and ensuring they were “unlikely to say ‘no’”
      to further involvement of British personnel and technology in the Directorate’s
      sensitive operations. Other leaked files related to the Westminster Foundation
      for Democracy (WFD), a British clone of the US CIA front the National Endowment
      for Democracy (NED), reveal the organization maintains offices in Lebanon’s parliament
      building. An official review of WFD’s activities explicitly states its “central
      rationale” is to conduct “controversial” projects overseas that London “could
      not or would not wish to undertake directly,” therefore limiting “damage to official
      government-to-government relationships,” while “avoiding the danger” of “British
      government presence [being] interpreted as foreign interference.” “[WFD’s] arm’s
      length relationship … provides the [Foreign Office] with the best safeguard …
      the less the [Foreign Office] seeks to exercise control the more it can deny responsibility
      … The Foundation provides a necessary and valuable instrument over and above those
      which the [Foreign Office] can provide for itself.” Powell’s warpath The Mail
      on Sunday’s editorial accompanying the Inter-Mediate exposé highlights another
      key concern: the outsized power wielded by former UK prime minister Tony Blair-era
      figures in Starmer’s government. Powell is not alone – Peter Mandelson, now the
      UK’s ambassador to Washington, is another. The editorial bluntly states that these
      Blairites “are the real forces in British diplomacy,” while Lammy plays “an effectively
      ceremonial role,” executing policies scripted by Powell and others behind the
      scenes. While the pair were said to maintain “formidable private networks they
      are able to mobilize” to influence British government action and policy, “some
      within Downing Street” were reportedly “growing increasingly wary about the influence
      of these smooth Blairites.” As one official put it, “at what point does ‘experience’
      and ‘guidance’ become ‘control’?” That question also applies to Inter-Mediate’s
      relationship with the new Syrian government. Is Powell, via his company and government
      position, finally realizing Blair’s long-standing dream of reshaping West Asia
      in Britain’s image? The former prime minister’s Institute for Global Change has
      openly called for regime change in Iran and boasts of nurturing anti-government
      networks across the region. Powell’s history is instructive. In September 2002
      , he pressed the UK’s Joint Intelligence Committee to exaggerate Iraq’s non-existent
      weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to justify the illegal Anglo-American invasion
      six months later. He believed it a “bit of a problem” that the assessment did
      not conclude Iraq posed an urgent, imminent military threat, insisting its wording
      be changed to ensure maximum impact on media reporting, and public perceptions.
      A recent profile of Powell suggests he remains committed to Blair’s mission: “The
      historical record shows [Powell] had doubts about Iraq’s WMDs, but thought Saddam
      Hussein had to go ‘because he was a ruthless dictator suppressing his people’.
      This was, as Blair named it, ‘liberal interventionism’, which called for the west
      to ‘get actively involved in other people’s conflicts’ … [Powell] has the same
      instincts today. After Iraq, and Afghanistan, he still wants to save the world.”
      If Starmer’s unelected security chief is indeed scripting foreign policy through
      Inter-Mediate, then Britain is no longer merely meddling in West Asia but is also
      governing it by proxy. And if Powell’s loyal Al-Qaeda client in Damascus is the
      new face of “liberal interventionism,” it is clear the colonial playbook has not
      just returned – it never left. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted

      donation . By Kit Klarenberg / The Cradle On 19 July , the Mail on Sunday revealed
      that Inter-Mediate, a shadowy firm founded by Jonathan Powell, now National Security
      advisor to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, brokered the re-establishment
      of diplomatic relations between Damascus and London. This included a heavily publicized
      meeting between UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Syria’s self-appointed President
      Ahmad al-Sharaa, two weeks earlier. The outlet also exposed how the British state-
      funded Inter-Mediate operates a dedicated office in Syria’s Presidential Palace.
      Britain’s opposition Conservative party has demanded a formal inquiry into Powell’s
      use of Inter-Mediate “to run back channels to terrorist groups” and the conflict
      of interest created by his unelected role. As Starmer’s national security advisor
      – described as wielding “more influence over foreign policy than anyone in government
      after the prime minister himself” – Powell operates entirely outside parliamentary
      accountability. A Whitehall source told the Mail on Sunday : “These are essentially
      outsourced spies and spooks undertaking ‘back channel’ discussions with political
      leaders and armed groups to reach negotiated settlements.” Terrorists to technocrats
      Inter-Mediate’s central role in assisting former Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) leader
      Sharaa’s rise to power in Damascus was first revealed in May by Independent Arabia
      . This followed disclosures from former US ambassador to Syria Robert Ford (2011
      – 2014), that in 2023 a British “non-governmental organization” sought his personal
      assistance in transforming HTS – in particular Sharaa, who went by the nom de
      guerre Abu Mohammad Julani when he was an ISIS chief – from “terrorists” into
      politicians. While Ford did not name Inter-Mediate, Independent Arabia did – and
      mainstream media ignored it entirely. Now that Inter-Mediate’s embedment with
      Damascus’s post-Bashar al-Assad government has been confirmed, western media has
      belatedly begun describing Syria’s new rulers as comprised of barbarous extremists
      linked to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Yet few are willing to interrogate the far graver
      implications of a British intelligence-linked firm enjoying intimate access to
      Syria’s seat of power – and the extraordinary leverage that affords London over
      the HTS-led administration and its leadership. Compounding this is the deeply
      suspicious timing: Powell assumed his advisory role just days before HTS violently
      seized Damascus. Starmer immediately declared that Assad’s ouster heralded “a
      more active role” for Britain in West Asia and dispatched top diplomats to meet
      with HTS officials. The media acknowledged these summits were completely illegal
      , as HTS was a proscribed terror group under British law. Since taking office,
      Sharaa has announced Syria’s once-independent economy is fully open for western
      exploitation, ordered massacres of Alawites and other religious minorities, while
      seeking to normalize relations with Israel. Despite the occupation state routinely
      executing highly destructive airstrikes against government and military infrastructure
      since former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s fall, HTS appears undeterred.
      We are thus left to ponder whether the Al-Qaeda-rooted government’s brutal internal
      repression, and concerted inaction over Tel Aviv’s military bombardments and incursions
      into its territory, are ultimately directed by MI6. ‘Deny responsibility’ Inter-Mediate’s
      website offers few clues to its real agenda. It lists a cadre of former western
      diplomats and military officials as staff and board members , and vaguely claims
      to facilitate “backchannels with hard-to-reach conflict actors” where “direct
      negotiations are impossible or inadvisable.” It boasts of creating space for political
      solutions “in some of the world’s most intractable conflicts.” Syria was quite
      some “intractable conflict” – not least because Assad’s “ popular ” and sovereign
      government steadfastly refused to relinquish power to mass-murdering CIA and MI6-backed

      a tax-deductible donation . By Stephen Prager / Common Dreams Free speech advocates
      are raising concerns that a new bipartisan bill would force social media companies
      to censor criticism of Israel on their platforms. Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.)
      and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) rolled out the bill, called the Stopping Terrorists Online
      Presence and Holding Accountable Tech Entities (STOP HATE) Act , at a press conference
      Wednesday, alongside Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League
      (ADL). The bill would mandate that social media companies work with the federal
      government to implement moderation policies that curb the speech of groups the
      government designates as “terrorists.” They’d be required to provide regular reports
      to the U.S. attorney general. Those that don’t comply would be fined $5 million
      each day they refuse. The lawmakers justified the measure by citing some recent
      examples of overt antisemitism and calls for violence on social media. “We’ve
      seen an explosion of disinformation and antisemitic hate online in America and
      around the world,” Gottheimer said. “After the shooting outside the Capital Jewish
      Museum, anti-Zionist extremists used social media to call for further violence,
      posting messages like ‘may all Zionists burn.’ Even AI platforms like Grok have
      posted deeply disturbing content, praising Adolf Hitler and Nazism.” Bacon said,
      “We want to be in a country that makes clear that antisemitism or any kind of
      racism is repugnant, unacceptable, not allowed in an online space, and that we
      have zero tolerance for it.” However, other statements from the lawmakers make
      clear that their definition of “antisemitism” goes far beyond expressions of hatred
      or calls for violence against Jewish people. As Matthew Petti wrote for the libertarian
      magazine Reason : “The specific idea that Bacon had in mind was antisemitism,
      and he made clear that it includes criticism of the State of Israel in his book.”
      At the press conference, Bacon explicitly referenced recent protests against Israel’s
      policy of starvation in Gaza . “I saw protests out here the last two days, they
      were vile, right?,” he said. “They were…you can see the antisemitism in their
      comments and how they were treating some of our members of Congress who are Jewish.
      I saw that firsthand.” Bacon did not specify what specific comments he was referring
      to. However, Petti noted : Protesters stormed the congressional cafeteria on July
      1 to call for food aid to Gaza, and interrupted Rep. Randy Fine (R–Fla.)—who has
      called for Palestinians to “ starve away” —during a hearing on campus antisemitism
      last week. Bacon also suggested that merely stating opposition to pro-Israel congresspeople,
      including himself, constitutes antisemitism. “I even saw an article today. It
      was about me, but talking about we have to oppose congressmen who are pro-Zionists,
      right?” said Bacon, who is notably not Jewish. “It’s all over our social media
      and it’s unacceptable.” Gottheimer, meanwhile, said the policy was not just about
      combating terrorism, but about halting a “massive disinformation campaign influencing
      us every day.” Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald—a critic of government efforts
      to regulate “misinformation”— suggested that the bill flies in the face of the
      right’s supposed commitments to free speech. “There was [a] full consensus on
      the Right for the last decade that Big Tech censorship was a great evil, especially
      if pressured and demanded by the U.S. government,” he said on X. “All that changed
      [when] it came time to censor for Israel.” In a statement released Friday, the
      American‑Arab Anti‑Discrimination Committee (ADC) likewise described the STOP
      HATE Act as part of “the continuous efforts by lawmakers to silence, censor, and
      chill freedom of speech and expression in this country at the behest of Israel.”
      They warned that the bill gives the government, in tandem with pro-Israel groups
      like the ADL, “unfettered powers to police private social media companies, attack
      lawful expression, and levy fines of up to five million dollars each day if companies
      fail to silence and censor users.” This is not the first time Gottheimer and Bacon
      have introduced the STOP HATE Act. A similar version, introduced in 2023, died
      in committee. When introducing that version of the bill, they were more explicit
      in their calls for government regulation of media—calling on the Department of
      Justice to require the news outlets Al Jazeera and its subsidiary AJ+, which are
      sponsored by the Qatari government,to register as foreign agents. The two congressmen
      were also at the forefront of calls for the U.S. government to ban TikTok, which
      Gottheimer said was being used by the Chinese Communist Party to “boost anti-Israel
      and pro-Hamas videos in the United States.” They have also introduced legislation
      that would criminalize efforts to boycott Israeli products. Greenblatt, who spoke
      alongside the two legislators on Wednesday, has explicitly said that “Anti-Zionism
      is antisemitism.” Though he’s faced criticism for this stance, including from
      members of the ADL itself, he has only continued to double down. In one infamous
      exchange during the outbreak of pro-Palestine protests on college campuses in
      2024, Greenblatt suggested that students wearing keffiyehs—a kind of scarf commonly
      worn by Palestinians—were doing the equivalent of wearing a swastika armband.
      More recently, he endorsed Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s warrantless abduction
      of pro-Palestine organizer Mahmoud Khalil, who he accused —along with other pro-Palestine
      demonstrators—of being an asset of foreign governments and likened to Middle Eastern
      terrorist groups. Wednesday’s press release from the legislators on the STOP HATE
      Act cites the ADL’s 2024 “Social Media Scorecard,” as evidence that “the five
      major social media platforms—Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and X—routinely
      failed to act on antisemitic hate reported to them.” That Scorecard page features
      a quote from Greenblatt, who said, “Social media platforms are still falling far
      too short when it comes to moderating antisemitic and anti-Israel content.” After
      the October 7, 2023 attacks led by Hamas, the ADL changed its methodology to categorize
      antisemitic incidents to not only include hate speech or threats directed at Jewish
      people, but also language expressing “opposition to Zionism.” The proposed STOP
      HATE Act comes at a time when American public opinion has dramatically shifted
      against Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza. According to a CNN poll conducted
      by SSRS, released last Friday: Only 23% of Americans say Israel’s actions have
      been fully justified, a 27-point drop from a[n] October 2023 poll taken shortly

      justified and 22% say that they have not been justified at all. In October 2023,
      just 8% said Israel’s actions were not justified at all. In recent weeks, Israeli
      leaders have openly called for the mass displacement of two million Palestinians
      to make room for Jewish settlers. Meanwhile, at least 115 Palestinians—including
      more than 80 children—have reportedly starved due to Israel’s restrictions on
      aid entering the Gaza Strip. Over 1,000 aid seekers have been killed, often by
      Israel Defense Forces soldiers, at aid sites jointly administered by the U.S.
      and Israel. “The First Amendment is supposed to be the cornerstone of American
      democracy—our shield against censorship and government overreach,” said Abed Ayoub,

      are raising concerns that a new bipartisan bill would force social media companies
      to censor criticism of Israel on their platforms. Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.)
      and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) rolled out the bill, called the Stopping Terrorists Online
      Presence and Holding Accountable Tech Entities (STOP HATE) Act , at a press conference
      Wednesday, alongside Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League
      (ADL). The bill would mandate that social media companies work with the federal
      government to implement moderation policies that curb the speech of groups the
      government designates as “terrorists.” They’d be required to provide regular reports
      to the U.S. attorney general. Those that don’t comply would be fined $5 million
      each day they refuse. The lawmakers justified the measure by citing some recent
      examples of overt antisemitism and calls for violence on social media. “We’ve
      seen an explosion of disinformation and antisemitic hate online in America and
      around the world,” Gottheimer said. “After the shooting outside the Capital Jewish
      Museum, anti-Zionist extremists used social media to call for further violence,
      posting messages like ‘may all Zionists burn.’ Even AI platforms like Grok have
      posted deeply disturbing content, praising Adolf Hitler and Nazism.” Bacon said,
      “We want to be in a country that makes clear that antisemitism or any kind of
      racism is repugnant, unacceptable, not allowed in an online space, and that we
      have zero tolerance for it.” However, other statements from the lawmakers make
      clear that their definition of “antisemitism” goes far beyond expressions of hatred
      or calls for violence against Jewish people. As Matthew Petti wrote for the libertarian
      magazine Reason : “The specific idea that Bacon had in mind was antisemitism,
      and he made clear that it includes criticism of the State of Israel in his book.”
      At the press conference, Bacon explicitly referenced recent protests against Israel’s
      policy of starvation in Gaza . “I saw protests out here the last two days, they
      were vile, right?,” he said. “They were…you can see the antisemitism in their
      comments and how they were treating some of our members of Congress who are Jewish.
      I saw that firsthand.” Bacon did not specify what specific comments he was referring
      to. However, Petti noted : Protesters stormed the congressional cafeteria on July
      1 to call for food aid to Gaza, and interrupted Rep. Randy Fine (R–Fla.)—who has
      called for Palestinians to “ starve away” —during a hearing on campus antisemitism
      last week. Bacon also suggested that merely stating opposition to pro-Israel congresspeople,
      including himself, constitutes antisemitism. “I even saw an article today. It
      was about me, but talking about we have to oppose congressmen who are pro-Zionists,
      right?” said Bacon, who is notably not Jewish. “It’s all over our social media
      and it’s unacceptable.” Gottheimer, meanwhile, said the policy was not just about
      combating terrorism, but about halting a “massive disinformation campaign influencing
      us every day.” Independent journalist Glenn Greenwald—a critic of government efforts
      to regulate “misinformation”— suggested that the bill flies in the face of the
      right’s supposed commitments to free speech. “There was [a] full consensus on
      the Right for the last decade that Big Tech censorship was a great evil, especially
      if pressured and demanded by the U.S. government,” he said on X. “All that changed
      [when] it came time to censor for Israel.” In a statement released Friday, the
      American‑Arab Anti‑Discrimination Committee (ADC) likewise described the STOP
      HATE Act as part of “the continuous efforts by lawmakers to silence, censor, and
      chill freedom of speech and expression in this country at the behest of Israel.”
      They warned that the bill gives the government, in tandem with pro-Israel groups
      like the ADL, “unfettered powers to police private social media companies, attack
      lawful expression, and levy fines of up to five million dollars each day if companies
      fail to silence and censor users.” This is not the first time Gottheimer and Bacon
      have introduced the STOP HATE Act. A similar version, introduced in 2023, died
      in committee. When introducing that version of the bill, they were more explicit
      in their calls for government regulation of media—calling on the Department of
      Justice to require the news outlets Al Jazeera and its subsidiary AJ+, which are
      sponsored by the Qatari government,to register as foreign agents. The two congressmen
      were also at the forefront of calls for the U.S. government to ban TikTok, which
      Gottheimer said was being used by the Chinese Communist Party to “boost anti-Israel
      and pro-Hamas videos in the United States.” They have also introduced legislation
      that would criminalize efforts to boycott Israeli products. Greenblatt, who spoke
      alongside the two legislators on Wednesday, has explicitly said that “Anti-Zionism
      is antisemitism.” Though he’s faced criticism for this stance, including from
      members of the ADL itself, he has only continued to double down. In one infamous
      exchange during the outbreak of pro-Palestine protests on college campuses in
      2024, Greenblatt suggested that students wearing keffiyehs—a kind of scarf commonly
      worn by Palestinians—were doing the equivalent of wearing a swastika armband.
      More recently, he endorsed Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s warrantless abduction
      of pro-Palestine organizer Mahmoud Khalil, who he accused —along with other pro-Palestine
      demonstrators—of being an asset of foreign governments and likened to Middle Eastern
      terrorist groups. Wednesday’s press release from the legislators on the STOP HATE
      Act cites the ADL’s 2024 “Social Media Scorecard,” as evidence that “the five
      major social media platforms—Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and X—routinely
      failed to act on antisemitic hate reported to them.” That Scorecard page features
      a quote from Greenblatt, who said, “Social media platforms are still falling far
      too short when it comes to moderating antisemitic and anti-Israel content.” After
      the October 7, 2023 attacks led by Hamas, the ADL changed its methodology to categorize
      antisemitic incidents to not only include hate speech or threats directed at Jewish
      people, but also language expressing “opposition to Zionism.” The proposed STOP
      HATE Act comes at a time when American public opinion has dramatically shifted
      against Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza. According to a CNN poll conducted
      by SSRS, released last Friday: Only 23% of Americans say Israel’s actions have
      been fully justified, a 27-point drop from a[n] October 2023 poll taken shortly
      after Hamas’ October 7 attacks. Another 27% now say those actions have been partially
      justified and 22% say that they have not been justified at all. In October 2023,
      just 8% said Israel’s actions were not justified at all. In recent weeks, Israeli
      leaders have openly called for the mass displacement of two million Palestinians
      to make room for Jewish settlers. Meanwhile, at least 115 Palestinians—including
      more than 80 children—have reportedly starved due to Israel’s restrictions on
      aid entering the Gaza Strip. Over 1,000 aid seekers have been killed, often by
      Israel Defense Forces soldiers, at aid sites jointly administered by the U.S.

      There’s been a significant development in hotly contested proceedings happening
      in northern Minnesota over whether Allete, owner of the region’s main electric
      utility, Minnesota Power, will be acquired by two new private equity owners, including
      the asset management behemoth BlackRock. After months of hearings, an administrative
      law judge published a report that unambiguously recommended state regulators deny
      approval of the deal, concluding that, based on the evidence from proceedings,
      Allete and the acquiring partners “have not met their burden of proof to show
      the transaction is consistent with the public interest.” Minnesota’s Public Utilities
      Commission had referred the case to the administrative law judge to independently
      analyze the facts and legal aspects and make a recommendation. While nonbinding,
      the report will inform the Public Utilities Commission’s upcoming decision on
      whether or not to approve a $6.2 billion deal struck in May 2024 that would see
      Allete, a publicly traded electric utility, taken private by Global Infrastructure
      Partners, which is owned by BlackRock and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
      Intervenors against the private equity acquisition of Allete — including ratepayer
      advocates, watchdog organizations, and climate groups — welcomed the administrative
      law judge’s report, even as the ultimate decision to approve the deal still resides
      with the Public Utilities Commission, which must determine whether it’s in the
      public interest. The drama in Minnesota has national repercussions as Wall Street
      firms are increasingly eying utilities as demand for electricity for data centers
      is booming. It also shows that private equity’s intensifying grab for basic infrastructure
      everyone depends on will face pushback. “This is coming, and people need to be
      prepared for it,” Maggie Schuppert, a Minnesota Power customer and director of
      strategic initiatives with CURE, a rural community advocacy group, told Truthout
      . Rejecting Private Equity A Truthout review of the administrative law judge report
      shows that the report sided with opponents of the acquisition on nearly every
      major point of contention, and that its findings of fact were largely consistent
      with the arguments offered by opponents of the acquisition. Critically, the report
      stated that Allete did not demonstrate its need to abandon public markets and
      turn to private equity to access the investment capital needed to comply with
      Minnesota’s law requiring 100 percent carbon-free electricity sources by 2040,
      which is Allete’s core justification for the deal. Allete “has not established
      that there is a significant risk that the public markets will be unable to meet
      its probable capital needs,” the report stated, noting that Allete’s “financial
      health is strong,” confirmed by the company’s own claims in recent Securities
      and Exchange Commission filings. More broadly, the report strongly sided with
      critics’ overarching argument that a private equity takeover of a vital local
      utility presents major risks for ratepayers, given private equity’s extractive
      business model and its checkered ownership history. Notably, the report found
      that the public statements made by the Petitioners (Global Infrastructure Partners,
      the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Allete/Minnesota Power) “do not
      comport” with their “agreements and private discussions” around the deal’s “true
      risks,” concluding that the “nonpublic evidence reveals the Partners’ [Global
      Infrastructure Partners’ and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s] intent
      to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public
      markets through company control.” This speaks to a big frustration that Brian
      Edstrom, a senior regulatory advocate with the nonprofit Citizens Utility Board
      of Minnesota, felt during the hearings regarding what he calls the “inconsistencies”
      between what Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
      Board say to the public versus what’s kept private and confidential. While Edstrom
      would not discuss confidential material from the hearings, he told Truthout that
      “it’s frustrating because it makes it harder for advocates like us to tell the
      full details around our concerns when so many of those details are hidden from
      public view.” For example, the administrative law judge’s report noted that BlackRock/Global
      Infrastructure Partners and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board expect an annual
      return, which was redacted, that “significantly exceeds the returns produced by
      publicly traded utilities,” and that they “are most likely to make up the difference
      between a plausible regulated return and the targeted return through financial
      engineering.” These findings align with concerns put forth by critics that the
      new owners of Allete, and thereby Minnesota Power, would, in common private equity
      fashion, seek higher investor returns that could destabilize the utility and hurt
      captive ratepayers. “A Straightforward Victory” Moreover, whereas Allete claimed
      the deal with Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
      Board was based on “ values ,” the report suggested a prime driver was, instead,
      the huge $1.5 billion acquisition premium that would flow to shareholders, including
      top executives, with the acquisition, noting that “the evidence shows the Partners
      were ultimately the only bidders for the company and were chosen based on their
      willingness to pay a stock premium.” The report also found that key “commitments”
      made by Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
      Board were nonbinding and unenforceable — all key arguments that critics sought
      to demonstrate during the hearings. Additionally, the report questioned the climate
      rationale behind the acquisition, finding “significant risks that the Partners
      will be unwilling or unable to provide ALLETE sufficient capital to transition
      its regulated operations in Minnesota from fossil fuels to renewable energy,”
      while noting that Allete was also “planning significant capital spending on fossil
      fuels,” including over “over 1,000 megawatts of new natural gas generating capacity.”
      All told, opponents of the deal see the report as a vindication of their criticism
      of the deal. “It’s really important that people understand this isn’t just one
      judge’s opinion, but rather the outcome of a full-on case,” said Schuppert. “We’re
      treating this as a straightforward victory in a longer process.” “An Especially
      Acute Threat” The administrative law judge report comes as private equity investors
      are increasingly eying utilities, whose steady returns appeal to Wall Street portfolios,
      especially as the data center boom increases the demand for energy. This is a
      story that is garnering national headlines. “Large Wall Street investment firms
      are moving to acquire U.S. utility companies in an effort to benefit from the
      rising demand for electricity from data centers,” noted The New York Times on
      July 17. Karlee Weinmann, a Minnesota-based researcher with the Energy and Policy
      Institute, a utility industry watchdog group, told Truthout that private equity
      takeover of utilities like Allete presents a “troubling prospect.” “Private equity
      has earned its reputation as one of the most extractive forces in the marketplace
      across industries, with private equity investment becoming synonymous with hollowing
      out acquired companies to maximize profits,” said Weinmann. “That is bad news
      in any sector, but when we’re talking about electric utilities, which are monopoly
      providers of an essential service, it’s an especially acute threat to people and
      communities,” she added. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is one
      of those Wall Street firms that is gunning for utilities. BlackRock has traditionally
      focused on public markets, buying up stock and bonds through its index funds,
      but in recent years it has turned toward private investment, especially in infrastructure
      . BlackRock’s billionaire founder and CEO Larry Fink recently gushed to CNBC about
      a “melding of public and private markets” and the “enormous” opportunity for BlackRock
      around investing in infrastructure, which he said was “just at the beginning of
      a golden age.” “We believe there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in
      infrastructure” related to power grids and AI, said Fink. “All of this is all
      part of a plan.” Fink emphasized the centrality of its 2024 acquisition of Global
      Infrastructure Partners as a key move in this “plan” for BlackRock, and he lauded
      Global Infrastructure Partners’ $25.5 billion Fund V — the fund that would hold
      a 40 percent ownership stake in Allete if the deal goes through. Edstrom emphasized
      that the ordinary utility customers could be stuck with footing the bill for Fink
      and other private equity firms’ growing appetite for utilities. “On the other
      end of that are captive customers that are paying for essential services, and
      that gets lost in the equation when you have New York asset managers who are not
      in the business of providing safe and reliable electric service, but rather in
      the business of making money for their clients,” Edstrom told Truthout . “If the
      acquisition is approved,” Edstrom added, “Minnesota Power will continue to be
      regulated by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, but the investors will
      have far more control over the utility’s operations than Allete’s current shareholders
      do. The investors’ primary interest will be maximizing a return on their investment.”
      “There’s a fundamental question here of whether captive utility customers, who
      have no choice in what utility they buy electricity from, should be subsidizing
      profits for private equity investors,” said Weinmann. “If you ask that question
      to just about anyone besides the private equity investors, you hear a resounding
      no.” New research by Weinmann also argues that a significant portion of the testimony
      during the hearings favoring the private equity acquisition “came from utility
      employees or others with financial ties to the company,” raising concerns over
      potential conflicts of interests. “An Organizing Opportunity” Truthout reached
      out to BlackRock for comment but did not receive a response. A representative
      from Allete shared a statement emphasizing that the company “strongly disagree[s]
      with the conclusions in this non-binding recommendation” and noted that the Minnesota
      Department of Commerce, which had previously opposed the acquisition, recently
      announced that it reached a settlement with the Partners that shifted its stance.
      The settlement “includes additional public protections and benefits for our customers,”
      Allete told Truthout . The administrative law judge’s report noted that she reviewed
      the settlement with the Department of Commerce and that “her concerns regarding
      the Acquisition have not been resolved and it does not change the Administrative
      Law Judge’s recommendation to disapprove the Acquisition.” Hudson Kingston, CURE’s
      legal director , told Truthout that the Commerce Department’s settlement was “somewhat
      shocking” in light of the administrative law judge report’s unreserved opposition
      to the deal. “You can’t make an inherently bad deal good by just adding a few
      conditions to it,” Kingston said. For Edstrom, the overarching takeaway from the
      report, and after months of testimony from all sides, is that the Allete deal
      “is not in the public interest and should be denied.” The administrative law judge
      decision “is really thorough, well-reasoned, and grounded in substantial evidence,”
      he said. “It almost completely agrees with the positions of the parties that have
      opposed the acquisition.” While the administrative law judge’s report is nonbinding,
      Weinmann says these recommendations “are always a very valuable resource to commissioners
      who then have the responsibility of making the final decision.” “In this case,”
      she added, “it’s evident that the judge took a very detailed look at the record
      and came to a very stark and clear conclusion about the potential risks to ratepayers
      if this transaction is allowed to proceed,” she said. Ultimately, the Minnesota
      Public Utilities Commission will decide, likely in the fall, whether to accept
      the report’s findings and reject the deal. Alternatively, it could approve the
      deal with added stipulations informed by the report, or just discount the report
      and approve the deal altogether. Critics of the deal that Truthout spoke with
      expressed feelings that ranged from nervous to optimistic about the ultimate outcome.
      “BlackRock is Goliath compared to anything,” said Kingston, adding that Minnesota
      regulators need to be the “David” that “really stands up for the people.” As giant
      asset managers like BlackRock increasingly look toward utilities and other infrastructure
      to rake in new returns, Schuppert thinks others around the U.S. should be paying
      attention to what’s happening in Northern Minnesota. “Minnesota is a test case,”
      she said. “We need to prepare for private equity coming after our entire utility
      sector.” “But,” she added, “it’s also an organizing opportunity for the public
      power movement.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      There’s been a significant development in hotly contested proceedings happening
      in northern Minnesota over whether Allete, owner of the region’s main electric
      utility, Minnesota Power, will be acquired by two new private equity owners, including
      the asset management behemoth BlackRock. After months of hearings, an administrative
      law judge published a report that unambiguously recommended state regulators deny
      approval of the deal, concluding that, based on the evidence from proceedings,
      Allete and the acquiring partners “have not met their burden of proof to show
      the transaction is consistent with the public interest.” Minnesota’s Public Utilities
      Commission had referred the case to the administrative law judge to independently
      analyze the facts and legal aspects and make a recommendation. While nonbinding,
      the report will inform the Public Utilities Commission’s upcoming decision on
      whether or not to approve a $6.2 billion deal struck in May 2024 that would see
      Allete, a publicly traded electric utility, taken private by Global Infrastructure
      Partners, which is owned by BlackRock and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
      Intervenors against the private equity acquisition of Allete — including ratepayer
      advocates, watchdog organizations, and climate groups — welcomed the administrative
      law judge’s report, even as the ultimate decision to approve the deal still resides
      with the Public Utilities Commission, which must determine whether it’s in the
      public interest. The drama in Minnesota has national repercussions as Wall Street
      firms are increasingly eying utilities as demand for electricity for data centers
      is booming. It also shows that private equity’s intensifying grab for basic infrastructure
      everyone depends on will face pushback. “This is coming, and people need to be
      prepared for it,” Maggie Schuppert, a Minnesota Power customer and director of
      strategic initiatives with CURE, a rural community advocacy group, told Truthout
      . Rejecting Private Equity A Truthout review of the administrative law judge report
      shows that the report sided with opponents of the acquisition on nearly every
      major point of contention, and that its findings of fact were largely consistent
      with the arguments offered by opponents of the acquisition. Critically, the report
      stated that Allete did not demonstrate its need to abandon public markets and
      turn to private equity to access the investment capital needed to comply with
      Minnesota’s law requiring 100 percent carbon-free electricity sources by 2040,
      which is Allete’s core justification for the deal. Allete “has not established
      that there is a significant risk that the public markets will be unable to meet
      its probable capital needs,” the report stated, noting that Allete’s “financial
      health is strong,” confirmed by the company’s own claims in recent Securities
      and Exchange Commission filings. More broadly, the report strongly sided with
      critics’ overarching argument that a private equity takeover of a vital local
      utility presents major risks for ratepayers, given private equity’s extractive
      business model and its checkered ownership history. Notably, the report found
      that the public statements made by the Petitioners (Global Infrastructure Partners,
      the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Allete/Minnesota Power) “do not
      comport” with their “agreements and private discussions” around the deal’s “true
      risks,” concluding that the “nonpublic evidence reveals the Partners’ [Global
      Infrastructure Partners’ and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s] intent
      to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public
      markets through company control.” This speaks to a big frustration that Brian
      Edstrom, a senior regulatory advocate with the nonprofit Citizens Utility Board
      of Minnesota, felt during the hearings regarding what he calls the “inconsistencies”
      between what Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
      Board say to the public versus what’s kept private and confidential. While Edstrom
      would not discuss confidential material from the hearings, he told Truthout that
      “it’s frustrating because it makes it harder for advocates like us to tell the
      full details around our concerns when so many of those details are hidden from
      public view.” For example, the administrative law judge’s report noted that BlackRock/Global
      Infrastructure Partners and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board expect an annual
      return, which was redacted, that “significantly exceeds the returns produced by
      publicly traded utilities,” and that they “are most likely to make up the difference
      between a plausible regulated return and the targeted return through financial
      engineering.” These findings align with concerns put forth by critics that the
      new owners of Allete, and thereby Minnesota Power, would, in common private equity
      fashion, seek higher investor returns that could destabilize the utility and hurt
      captive ratepayers. “A Straightforward Victory” Moreover, whereas Allete claimed
      the deal with Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
      Board was based on “ values ,” the report suggested a prime driver was, instead,
      the huge $1.5 billion acquisition premium that would flow to shareholders, including
      top executives, with the acquisition, noting that “the evidence shows the Partners
      were ultimately the only bidders for the company and were chosen based on their
      willingness to pay a stock premium.” The report also found that key “commitments”
      made by Global Infrastructure Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
      Board were nonbinding and unenforceable — all key arguments that critics sought
      to demonstrate during the hearings. Additionally, the report questioned the climate
      rationale behind the acquisition, finding “significant risks that the Partners
      will be unwilling or unable to provide ALLETE sufficient capital to transition
      its regulated operations in Minnesota from fossil fuels to renewable energy,”
      while noting that Allete was also “planning significant capital spending on fossil
      fuels,” including over “over 1,000 megawatts of new natural gas generating capacity.”
      All told, opponents of the deal see the report as a vindication of their criticism
      of the deal. “It’s really important that people understand this isn’t just one
      judge’s opinion, but rather the outcome of a full-on case,” said Schuppert. “We’re
      treating this as a straightforward victory in a longer process.” “An Especially
      Acute Threat” The administrative law judge report comes as private equity investors
      are increasingly eying utilities, whose steady returns appeal to Wall Street portfolios,
      especially as the data center boom increases the demand for energy. This is a
      story that is garnering national headlines. “Large Wall Street investment firms
      are moving to acquire U.S. utility companies in an effort to benefit from the
      rising demand for electricity from data centers,” noted The New York Times on
      July 17. Karlee Weinmann, a Minnesota-based researcher with the Energy and Policy
      Institute, a utility industry watchdog group, told Truthout that private equity
      takeover of utilities like Allete presents a “troubling prospect.” “Private equity
      has earned its reputation as one of the most extractive forces in the marketplace
      across industries, with private equity investment becoming synonymous with hollowing
      out acquired companies to maximize profits,” said Weinmann. “That is bad news
      in any sector, but when we’re talking about electric utilities, which are monopoly
      providers of an essential service, it’s an especially acute threat to people and
      communities,” she added. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is one
      of those Wall Street firms that is gunning for utilities. BlackRock has traditionally
      focused on public markets, buying up stock and bonds through its index funds,
      but in recent years it has turned toward private investment, especially in infrastructure
      . BlackRock’s billionaire founder and CEO Larry Fink recently gushed to CNBC about
      a “melding of public and private markets” and the “enormous” opportunity for BlackRock
      around investing in infrastructure, which he said was “just at the beginning of
      a golden age.” “We believe there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in
      infrastructure” related to power grids and AI, said Fink. “All of this is all
      part of a plan.” Fink emphasized the centrality of its 2024 acquisition of Global
      Infrastructure Partners as a key move in this “plan” for BlackRock, and he lauded
      Global Infrastructure Partners’ $25.5 billion Fund V — the fund that would hold
      a 40 percent ownership stake in Allete if the deal goes through. Edstrom emphasized
      that the ordinary utility customers could be stuck with footing the bill for Fink
      and other private equity firms’ growing appetite for utilities. “On the other
      end of that are captive customers that are paying for essential services, and
      that gets lost in the equation when you have New York asset managers who are not
      in the business of providing safe and reliable electric service, but rather in
      the business of making money for their clients,” Edstrom told Truthout . “If the
      acquisition is approved,” Edstrom added, “Minnesota Power will continue to be
      regulated by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, but the investors will
      have far more control over the utility’s operations than Allete’s current shareholders
      do. The investors’ primary interest will be maximizing a return on their investment.”
      “There’s a fundamental question here of whether captive utility customers, who
      have no choice in what utility they buy electricity from, should be subsidizing
      profits for private equity investors,” said Weinmann. “If you ask that question
      to just about anyone besides the private equity investors, you hear a resounding
      no.” New research by Weinmann also argues that a significant portion of the testimony
      during the hearings favoring the private equity acquisition “came from utility
      employees or others with financial ties to the company,” raising concerns over
      potential conflicts of interests. “An Organizing Opportunity” Truthout reached
      out to BlackRock for comment but did not receive a response. A representative
      from Allete shared a statement emphasizing that the company “strongly disagree[s]
      with the conclusions in this non-binding recommendation” and noted that the Minnesota
      Department of Commerce, which had previously opposed the acquisition, recently
      announced that it reached a settlement with the Partners that shifted its stance.
      The settlement “includes additional public protections and benefits for our customers,”
      Allete told Truthout . The administrative law judge’s report noted that she reviewed
      the settlement with the Department of Commerce and that “her concerns regarding
      the Acquisition have not been resolved and it does not change the Administrative
      Law Judge’s recommendation to disapprove the Acquisition.” Hudson Kingston, CURE’s
      legal director , told Truthout that the Commerce Department’s settlement was “somewhat
      shocking” in light of the administrative law judge report’s unreserved opposition
      to the deal. “You can’t make an inherently bad deal good by just adding a few
      conditions to it,” Kingston said. For Edstrom, the overarching takeaway from the
      report, and after months of testimony from all sides, is that the Allete deal
      “is not in the public interest and should be denied.” The administrative law judge
      decision “is really thorough, well-reasoned, and grounded in substantial evidence,”
      he said. “It almost completely agrees with the positions of the parties that have
      opposed the acquisition.” While the administrative law judge’s report is nonbinding,
      Weinmann says these recommendations “are always a very valuable resource to commissioners
      who then have the responsibility of making the final decision.” “In this case,”
      she added, “it’s evident that the judge took a very detailed look at the record
      and came to a very stark and clear conclusion about the potential risks to ratepayers
      if this transaction is allowed to proceed,” she said. Ultimately, the Minnesota
      Public Utilities Commission will decide, likely in the fall, whether to accept
      the report’s findings and reject the deal. Alternatively, it could approve the
      deal with added stipulations informed by the report, or just discount the report
      and approve the deal altogether. Critics of the deal that Truthout spoke with
      expressed feelings that ranged from nervous to optimistic about the ultimate outcome.
      “BlackRock is Goliath compared to anything,” said Kingston, adding that Minnesota
      regulators need to be the “David” that “really stands up for the people.” As giant
      asset managers like BlackRock increasingly look toward utilities and other infrastructure
      to rake in new returns, Schuppert thinks others around the U.S. should be paying
      attention to what’s happening in Northern Minnesota. “Minnesota is a test case,”
      she said. “We need to prepare for private equity coming after our entire utility
      sector.” “But,” she added, “it’s also an organizing opportunity for the public
      power movement.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      withdrawn negotiators from Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha, Qatar, dashing hopes
      for a breakthrough as the humanitarian situation in Gaza is as bad as ever, and
      Palestinians are starving to death due to the US-backed Israeli blockade. Israel
      announced it was bringing its negotiators home after Hamas presented its latest
      counter-proposal. The Israeli announcement was quickly followed up by a statement
      from US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Both the US and Israel are blaming Hamas
      for the collapse of the negotiations. However, Israel has maintained a hardline
      position throughout the talks and made clear that it would agree only to a temporary
      ceasefire since Israeli officials announced a plan to build a concentration camp
      in southern Gaza during the truce. One of Hamas’s conditions has been for a stronger
      guarantee that an initial 60-day ceasefire would lead to a permanent one. Hamas’s
      long-standing position is that it’s willing to release all remaining captives
      in exchange for a permanent ceasefire. But Israel has rejected this, and there’s
      no sign the Trump administration is willing to put pressure on Israel to change
      its position. “We have decided to bring our team home from Doha for consultations
      after the latest response from Hamas, which clearly shows a lack of desire to
      reach a ceasefire in Gaza. While the mediators have made a great effort, Hamas
      does not appear to be coordinated or acting in good faith,” Witkoff said in a
      post on X. “We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home
      and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza. It is a shame
      that Hamas has acted in this selfish way. We are resolute in seeking an end to
      this conflict and a permanent peace in Gaza,” he added. It’s unclear what sort
      of “alternative options” the US and Israel may be considering, but the collapse
      in negotiations comes as the Israeli military has launched a ground offensive
      in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, an area where Israelis believe many of the remaining
      captives may be held. In response to Witkoff’s statement, Hamas said that it has
      been flexible and that it was “committed to reaching an agreement that halts the
      aggression and ends the suffering of our people in the Gaza Strip.” Hamas said
      it presented its “final response” in consultations with other Palestinian factions
      and mediators. “We are surprised by the negative statements of US envoy Steve
      Witkoff regarding the Movement’s stance, especially when the mediators have expressed
      their welcome and satisfaction with this constructive and positive position, which
      opens the door to reaching a comprehensive agreement,” Hamas said. “The Movement
      reiterates its commitment to continuing negotiations and engaging in them to help
      overcome obstacles and reach a permanent ceasefire agreement,” the group added.
      According to Axios , Hamas had asked for more Palestinian prisoners to be released
      in exchange for Israeli captives, including 2,000 Palestinians who have been abducted
      in Gaza since October 7, 2023, instead of the 1,200 the US and Israel proposed.
      The two sides have also been at odds over the amount of territory Israel will
      occupy, as Israel is refusing to withdraw its forces back to the positions it
      held during the short-lived ceasefire deal that was signed in January 2025. Editor’s

      right to self-determination. “These developments are not something new to us,”
      Dr. Suhad Bishara, Legal Director of Adalah and lead author of the report, told
      Mondoweiss . “All eyes are on Gaza, justifiably so,” she said. “However… it is
      important to highlight the intensity of the structural changes that have taken
      place since the current government took over in December 2022.” “What is happening
      in the West Bank is dangerously fast-forwarding annexation policies in a blatant
      violation of international law,” Bishara said. “Israel is intensifying measures
      to change the status of the West Bank, the status of many Palestinians living
      in Area C who are subject to intensified displacement induced by settler violence
      and Israeli policies.” She said, “This is in addition to settler expansion and
      further restrictions on Palestinian development in the area.” Thoroughly researched
      and footnoted, the report documents how the current extremist government has built
      on what Adalah describes as “foundational mechanisms through which Israel has
      entrenched a land regime that facilitates territorial domination and racial segregation.”
      Area C comprises over 60 percent of the West Bank, and is under full Israeli military
      control. Here are the mechanisms of territorial domination Adalah examines in
      these areas. Civilian governance for Israeli settlers; military rule over Palestinians
      Beginning in the late 1970s, Israel abandoned its security-based justifications
      for approving settlements and adopted a policy based on civil, not military grounds.
      The report describes how, soon after, the Civil Administration — the Israeli body
      governing the West Bank — was established to formalize the division between military
      and civilian affairs . As a result, “Israel has steadily transferred governance
      over Israeli settlers in the West Bank from military to civilian control, entrenching
      permanent territorial dominance and greatly expanding the settlement enterprise,”
      according to the report. Most recently, structural reforms — such as the appointment
      of Bezalel Smotrich to serve as both Finance Minister and a Minister in the Defense
      Ministry — have resulted in increasing legal authority for the pro-settler civil
      servants working with Smotrich in the West Bank. These reforms have cemented the
      two distinct legal structures that govern life in Palestinian villages and Israeli
      settlements: the former, in which the military rules, and the latter, administered
      according to Israeli law. 1. Administration by local authorities Adalah’s report
      dives into the weeds as it describes one of the more concerning mechanisms that
      reveals Israel’s intent to annex the whole of the West Bank. Having transitioned
      the settlements from military administration to civilian rule — and having handed
      over significant legal and administrative decision-making to pro-settler civil
      servants — Israel can argue that the settlements operate now under Israeli sovereignty.
      But applying Israeli law in occupied territory, Adalah maintains, is a violation
      of international human rights law and constitutes “a measure of de facto annexation.”
      2. Financial incentives for settlements Readers of the report won’t be surprised
      to learn that, as Adalah writes, “Israeli settlements receive extensive financial
      benefits through direct government subsidies, preferential policies, and financial
      incentives… [covering] multiple sectors, including land allocation, housing, infrastructure,
      and agriculture.” Still, it is remarkable—as documented in the Adalah report—how
      in contravention of international law, Israel continues each year to pour billions
      of shekels into the development of settlements in the West Bank. Readers of the
      report will learn of “the legal mechanisms behind these incentives and how Israeli
      law facilitates their distribution.” 3. Declaring State land According to Adalah,
      Israel’s designation of State Land in the West Bank is “the primary legal mechanism
      through which Israeli authorities have taken possession of Palestinian land since
      the late 1970s.” Those already familiar with Israel’s use of this means of de
      facto annexation will be surprised by the extraordinary amount of Palestinian
      land so designated. The report includes information obtained by Peace Now through
      a Freedom of Information Act request that shows a shocking fact: in under a one-year
      period, Israel has designated more Palestinian land as State Land than it had
      in an 18-year period. From 1998 to 2016, just over 21,000 dunams were declared
      as State Land. But in just over nine months (from the end of February 2024 through
      early December 2024), over 24,200 dunams were declared as State Land. This acceleration
      is historically unprecedented. The planning system in Area C Adalah includes an
      entire section on the legal and structural framework in place in Area C to further
      expand Israel’s settlement project, fulfilling one of the Netanyahu government’s
      guiding principles shared the day before his swearing-in as Prime Minister in
      December 2022: “The Jewish people have an exclusive and inalienable right to all
      parts of the Land of Israel,” promising to expand settlements throughout “Judea
      and Samaria,” the Israeli term for the occupied West Bank. Paralleling the judgments
      of the ICJ, UN experts, and international, Palestinian, and Israeli human rights
      groups, the report ends by listing the five international crimes that Adalah finds
      Israel guilt of: violations of International Humanitarian Law; the deepening of
      the illegal mechanism of de facto annexation; the denial of Palestinian people’s
      right to self-determination; the deepening of the apartheid system in the occupied
      Palestinian territory; and the commission of war crimes and crimes of aggression
      on the part of Israel. The most recent newsletter from Ir Amim , an Israeli NGO,
      describes Israel’s expanding control over illegally annexed East Jerusalem. Asked
      to comment, Tess Miller, Public Outreach staff at Ir Amim (“City of Nations” or
      “City of Peoples” in Hebrew) told Mondoweiss that “the mechanisms of displacement
      that we monitor and advocate against within Jerusalem are not separate from the
      mechanisms seen today in Gaza and the West Bank.” “What we are witnessing,” Miller
      said, “time after time, place after place, is violent control granted to those
      willing to advance the state’s agenda of expanding Jewish presence and diminishing Palestinian
      presence.” Ir Amim’s newsletter documents home demolitions, evictions, and starkly
      discriminatory housing and land confiscation policies. “Together,” Miller said,
      “they all contribute to the accelerating erasure of the Palestinian people from
      their own cities, neighborhoods, and lands — enabled by the complicity of an increasingly
      radicalized Israeli public and the international community’s persistent refusal
      to take meaningful action.” According to Adalah’s Dr. Bishara, it is hoped that
      the Adalah report, read by advocates for Palestinian rights, stakeholders, and
      states alike, “will generate international pressure against these long-term changes
      in the West Bank that violate international law and threaten the right of the
      Palestinian people to self-determination.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

      By Jeff Wright / Mondoweiss Israel is accelerating its efforts to cement its permanent

      changes, according to a new report from Adalah , The Legal Center for Arab Minority
      Rights in Israel. The 87-page report, Legal Structures of Distinction, Separation,
      and Territorial Domination , describes the ways in which the Netanyahu government
      is rapidly building on a long-standing legal matrix that further threatens Palestinians’

      Illustrations by Olivier Kugler for ProPublica As the planet gets hotter and its
      reservoirs shrink and its glaciers melt, people have increasingly drilled into
      a largely ungoverned, invisible cache of fresh water: the vast, hidden pools found
      deep underground. Now, a new study that examines the world’s total supply of fresh
      water — accounting for its rivers and rain, ice and aquifers together — warns
      that Earth’s most essential resource is quickly disappearing, signaling what the
      paper’s authors describe as “a critical, emerging threat to humanity.” The landmasses
      of the planet are drying. In most places there is less precipitation even as moisture
      evaporates from the soil faster. More than anything, Earth is being slowly dehydrated
      by the unmitigated mining of groundwater, which underlies vast proportions of
      every continent. Nearly 6 billion people, or three quarters of humanity, live
      in the 101 countries that the study identified as confronting a net decline in
      water supply — portending enormous challenges for food production and a heightening
      risk of conflict and instability. The paper “provides a glimpse of what the future
      is going to be,” said Hrishikesh Chandanpurkar, an earth systems scientist working
      with Arizona State University and the lead author of the study. “We are already
      dipping from a trust fund. We don’t actually know how much the account has.” The
      research, published on Friday in the journal Science Advances, confirms not just
      that droughts and precipitation are growing more extreme but reports that drying
      regions are fast expanding. It also found that while parts of the planet are getting
      wetter, those areas are shrinking. The study, which excludes the ice sheets of
      Antarctica and Greenland, concludes not only that Earth is suffering a pandemic
      of “continental drying” in lower latitudes, but that it is the uninhibited pumping
      of groundwater by farmers, cities and corporations around the world that now accounts
      for 68% of the total loss of fresh water in those areas, which generally don’t
      have glaciers. Groundwater is ubiquitous across the globe, but its quality and
      depth vary, as does its potential to be replenished by rainfall. Major groundwater
      basins — the deep and often high-quality aquifers — underlie roughly one-third
      of the planet, including roughly half of Africa, Europe and South America. But
      many of those aquifers took millions of years to form and might take thousands
      of years to refill. Instead, a significant portion of the water taken from underground
      flows off the land through rivers and on to the oceans. The researchers were surprised
      to find that the loss of water on the continents has grown so dramatically that
      it has become one of the largest causes of global sea level rise. Moisture lost
      to evaporation and drought, plus runoff from pumped groundwater, now outpaces
      the melting of glaciers and the ice sheets of either Antarctica or Greenland as
      the largest contributor of water to the oceans. The study examines 22 years of
      observational data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE,
      satellites, which measure changes in the mass of the earth and have been applied
      to estimate its water content. The technique was groundbreaking two decades ago
      when the study’s co-author, Jay Famiglietti, who was then a professor at the University
      of California, at Irvine, used it to pinpoint where aquifers were in decline.
      Since then, he and others have published dozens of papers using GRACE data, but
      the question has always lingered: What does the groundwater loss mean in the context
      of all of the water available on the continents? So Famiglietti, now a professor
      at Arizona State University, set out to inventory all the land-based water contained
      in glaciers, rivers and aquifers and see what was changing. The answer: everything,
      and quickly. Since 2002, the GRACE sensors have detected a rapid shift in water
      loss patterns around the planet. Around 2014, though, the pace of drying appears
      to have accelerated, the authors found, and is now growing by an area twice the
      size of California each year. “It’s like this sort of creeping disaster that has
      taken over the continents in ways that no one was really anticipating,” Famiglietti
      said. (Six other researchers also contributed to the study.) The parts of the
      world drying most acutely are becoming interconnected, forming what the study’s
      authors describe as “mega” regions spreading across the earth’s mid-latitudes.
      One of those regions covers almost the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North
      Africa and parts of Asia. In the American Southwest and California, groundwater
      loss is a familiar story, but over the past two decades that hot spot has also
      spread dramatically. It now extends through Texas and up through the southern
      High Plains, where the Ogallala aquifer is depended on for agriculture, and it
      spreads south, stretching throughout Mexico and into Central America. These regions
      are connected not because they rely on the same water sources — in most cases
      they don’t — but because their populations will face the same perils of water
      stress: the most likely, a food crisis that could ultimately displace millions
      of people. “This has to serve as a wake-up call,” said Aaron Salzberg, a former
      fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center and the former director of the Water Institute
      at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved with the study. Research
      has long established that people take more water from underground when climate-driven
      heat and drought are at their worst. For example, during droughts when California
      has enforced restrictions on delivery of surface water to its farmers — which
      the state regulates — the enormous agriculture enterprises that dominate the Central
      Valley have drilled deeper and pumped harder, depleting the aquifer — which the
      state regulates less precisely — even more. For the most part, such withdrawals
      have remained invisible. Even with the GRACE data, scientists cannot measure the
      exact levels or know when an aquifer will be exhausted. But there is one foolproof
      sign that groundwater is disappearing: The earth above it collapses as the ground
      compresses like a drying sponge. The visible signs of such subsidence around the
      world appear to match what the GRACE data says. Mexico City is sinking as its
      groundwater aquifers are drained, as are large parts China, Indonesia, Spain and
      Iran, to name a few. A recent study by researchers at Virginia Tech in the journal
      Nature Cities found that 28 cities across the United States are sinking — New
      York, Houston and Denver, among them — threatening havoc for everything from building
      safety to transit. In the Central Valley, the ground surface is nearly 30 vertical
      feet lower than it was in the first part of the 20th century. When so much water
      is pumped, it has to drain somewhere. Just like rivers and streams fed by rainfall,
      much of the used groundwater makes its way into the ocean. The study pinpoints
      a remarkable shift: Groundwater drilled by people, used for agriculture or urban
      supplies and then discarded into drainages now contributes more water to the oceans
      than melting from each of the world’s largest ice caps. People aren’t just misusing
      groundwater, they are flooding their own coasts and cities in the process, Famiglietti
      warns. That means they are also imperiling some of the world’s most important
      food-producing lowlands in the Nile and Mekong deltas and cities from Shanghai
      to New York. Once in the oceans, of course, groundwater will never again be suitable
      for drinking and human use without expensive and energy-sucking treatment or through
      the natural cycle of evaporating and precipitating as rain. But even then, it
      may no longer fall where it is needed most. Groundwater “is an intergenerational
      resource that is being poorly managed, if managed at all,” the study states, “at
      tremendous and exceptionally undervalued cost to future generations.” That such
      rapid and substantial overuse of groundwater is also causing coastal flooding
      underscores the compounding threat of rising temperatures and aridity. It means
      that water scarcity and some of the most disruptive effects of climate change
      are now inextricably intertwined. And here, the study’s authors implore leaders
      to find a policy solution: Improve water management and reduce groundwater use
      now, and the world has a tool to slow the rate of sea level rise. Fail to adjust
      the governance and use of groundwater around the world, and humanity risks surrendering
      parts of its coastal cities while pouring out finite reserves it will sorely need
      as the other effects of climate change take hold. If the drying continues — and
      the researchers warn that it is now nearly impossible to reverse “on human timescales”
      — it heralds “potentially staggering” and cascading risks for global order. The
      majority of the earth’s population lives in the 101 countries that the study identified
      as losing fresh water, making up not just North America, Europe and North Africa
      but also much of Asia, the Middle East and South America. This suggests the middle
      band of Earth is becoming less habitable. It also correlates closely with the
      places that a separate body of climate research has already identified as a shrinking
      environmental niche that has suited civilization for the past 6,000 years. Combined,
      these findings all point to the likelihood of widespread famine, the migration
      of large numbers of people seeking a more stable environment and the carry-on
      impact of geopolitical disorder. Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and a member
      of the National Academy of Sciences, lauded the new report for confirming trends
      that were once theoretical. The ramifications, he said, could be profoundly destabilizing.
      “The massive overpumping of groundwater,” Gleick said, “poses enormous risk to
      food production.” And food, he pointed out, is the foundation for stability. The
      water science center he co-founded, the Pacific Institute, has tracked more than
      1,900 incidents in which water supplies were either the casualty of, a tool for
      or the cause of violence. In Syria, beginning in 2011, drought and groundwater
      depletion drove rural unrest that contributed to the civil war, which displaced
      millions of people. In Ghana, in 2017, protesters rioted as wells ran dry. And
      in Ukraine, whose wheat supports much of the world, water infrastructure has been
      a frequent target of Russian attacks. “Water is being used as a strategic and
      political tool,” said Salzberg, who spent nearly two decades analyzing water security
      issues as the special director for water resources at the State Department. “We
      should expect to see that more often as the water supply crisis is exacerbated.”
      India, for example, recently weaponized water against Pakistan. In April, following
      terrorist attacks in Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suspended his country’s
      participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, a river-sharing agreement between the
      two nuclear powers that was negotiated in 1960. The Indus system flows northwest
      out of Tibet into India, before turning southward into Pakistan. Pakistan has
      severely depleted its groundwater reserves — the region is facing one of the world’s
      most urgent water emergencies according to the Science Advances paper. The Indus
      has only become more essential as a supply of fresh water for its 252 million
      people. Allowing that water to cross the border would be “prejudicial to India’s
      interests,” Modi said. In this case, he wasn’t attempting to recoup water supply
      for his country, Salzberg said, but was leveraging its scarcity to win a strategic
      advantage over his country’s principal rival. What’s needed most is governance
      of water that recognizes it as a crucial resource that determines both sovereignty
      and progress, Salzberg added. Yet there is no international framework for water
      management, and only a handful of countries have national water policies of their
      own. The United States has taken stabs at regulating its groundwater use, but
      in some cases those attempts appear to be failing. In 2014, California passed
      what seemed to many a revolutionary groundwater management act that required communities
      to assess their total water supply and budget its long-term use. But the act doesn’t
      take full effect until 2040, which has allowed many groundwater districts to continue
      to draw heavily from aquifers even as they complete their plans to conserve those
      resources. Chandanpurkar and Famiglietti’s research underscores the consequences
      for such a slow approach. Arizona pioneered groundwater regulations in 1980, creating
      what it called active management areas where extraction would be limited and surface
      waters would be used to replenish aquifers. But it only chose to manage the water
      in metropolitan areas, leaving vast, unregulated swaths of the state where investors,
      farmers and industry have all pounced on the availability of free water for profit.
      In recent years, Saudi investors have pumped rural water to grow feed for cattle
      exported back to the Arabian Peninsula, and hedge funds are competing to pump
      and sell water to towns near Phoenix. Meanwhile, four out of the original five
      active management areas are failing to meet the state’s own targets. “They like
      to say, ‘Oh, the management’s doing well,’” Famiglietti said, but looking out
      over the next century, the trends suggest the aquifers will continue to empty
      out. “No one talks about that. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say it’s
      an existential issue for cities like Phoenix.” Both California and Arizona grow
      significant portions of America’s fruits and vegetables. Something has to give.
      “If you want to grow food in a place like California,” Famiglietti asked, “do
      you just bring in water? If we deplete that groundwater, I don’t think there’s
      enough water to really replace what we’re doing there.” The United States might
      not have much choice, he added, but to move California’s agriculture production
      somewhere far away and retire the land. Chandanpurkar, Famiglietti and the report’s
      other authors suggest there are ready solutions to the problems they have identified,
      because unlike so many aspects of the climate crisis, the human decisions that
      lead to the overuse of water can be speedily corrected. Agriculture, which uses
      the vast majority of the world’s fresh water, can deploy well-tested technologies
      like drip irrigation, as Israel has, that sharply cut use by as much as 50%. When
      California farms reduced their take of Colorado River water in 2023 and 2024,
      the water levels in Lake Mead, the nation’s largest reservoir, jumped by 16 vertical
      feet as some 390 billion gallons were saved by 2025. Individuals can reduce water
      waste by changing simple routines: shortening showers or removing lawns. And cities
      can look to recycle more of the water they use, as San Diego has. A national policy
      that establishes rules around water practices but also prioritizes the use of
      water resources for national security and a collective interest could counterbalance
      the forces of habit and special interests, Salzberg said. Every country needs
      such a policy, and if the United States were to lead, it might offer an advantage.
      But “the U.S. doesn’t have a national water strategy,” he said, referring to a
      disjointed patchwork of state and court oversight. “We don’t even have a national
      water institution. We haven’t thought as a country about how we would even protect
      our own water resources for our own national interests, and we’re a mess.” Correction

      Illustrations by Olivier Kugler for ProPublica As the planet gets hotter and its
      reservoirs shrink and its glaciers melt, people have increasingly drilled into
      a largely ungoverned, invisible cache of fresh water: the vast, hidden pools found
      deep underground. Now, a new study that examines the world’s total supply of fresh
      water — accounting for its rivers and rain, ice and aquifers together — warns
      that Earth’s most essential resource is quickly disappearing, signaling what the
      paper’s authors describe as “a critical, emerging threat to humanity.” The landmasses
      of the planet are drying. In most places there is less precipitation even as moisture
      evaporates from the soil faster. More than anything, Earth is being slowly dehydrated
      by the unmitigated mining of groundwater, which underlies vast proportions of
      every continent. Nearly 6 billion people, or three quarters of humanity, live
      in the 101 countries that the study identified as confronting a net decline in
      water supply — portending enormous challenges for food production and a heightening
      risk of conflict and instability. The paper “provides a glimpse of what the future
      is going to be,” said Hrishikesh Chandanpurkar, an earth systems scientist working
      with Arizona State University and the lead author of the study. “We are already
      dipping from a trust fund. We don’t actually know how much the account has.” The
      research, published on Friday in the journal Science Advances, confirms not just
      that droughts and precipitation are growing more extreme but reports that drying
      regions are fast expanding. It also found that while parts of the planet are getting
      wetter, those areas are shrinking. The study, which excludes the ice sheets of
      Antarctica and Greenland, concludes not only that Earth is suffering a pandemic
      of “continental drying” in lower latitudes, but that it is the uninhibited pumping
      of groundwater by farmers, cities and corporations around the world that now accounts
      for 68% of the total loss of fresh water in those areas, which generally don’t
      have glaciers. Groundwater is ubiquitous across the globe, but its quality and
      depth vary, as does its potential to be replenished by rainfall. Major groundwater
      basins — the deep and often high-quality aquifers — underlie roughly one-third
      of the planet, including roughly half of Africa, Europe and South America. But
      many of those aquifers took millions of years to form and might take thousands
      of years to refill. Instead, a significant portion of the water taken from underground
      flows off the land through rivers and on to the oceans. The researchers were surprised
      to find that the loss of water on the continents has grown so dramatically that
      it has become one of the largest causes of global sea level rise. Moisture lost
      to evaporation and drought, plus runoff from pumped groundwater, now outpaces
      the melting of glaciers and the ice sheets of either Antarctica or Greenland as
      the largest contributor of water to the oceans. The study examines 22 years of
      observational data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE,
      satellites, which measure changes in the mass of the earth and have been applied
      to estimate its water content. The technique was groundbreaking two decades ago
      when the study’s co-author, Jay Famiglietti, who was then a professor at the University
      of California, at Irvine, used it to pinpoint where aquifers were in decline.
      Since then, he and others have published dozens of papers using GRACE data, but
      the question has always lingered: What does the groundwater loss mean in the context
      of all of the water available on the continents? So Famiglietti, now a professor
      at Arizona State University, set out to inventory all the land-based water contained
      in glaciers, rivers and aquifers and see what was changing. The answer: everything,
      and quickly. Since 2002, the GRACE sensors have detected a rapid shift in water
      loss patterns around the planet. Around 2014, though, the pace of drying appears
      to have accelerated, the authors found, and is now growing by an area twice the
      size of California each year. “It’s like this sort of creeping disaster that has
      taken over the continents in ways that no one was really anticipating,” Famiglietti
      said. (Six other researchers also contributed to the study.) The parts of the
      world drying most acutely are becoming interconnected, forming what the study’s
      authors describe as “mega” regions spreading across the earth’s mid-latitudes.
      One of those regions covers almost the whole of Europe, the Middle East, North
      Africa and parts of Asia. In the American Southwest and California, groundwater
      loss is a familiar story, but over the past two decades that hot spot has also
      spread dramatically. It now extends through Texas and up through the southern
      High Plains, where the Ogallala aquifer is depended on for agriculture, and it
      spreads south, stretching throughout Mexico and into Central America. These regions
      are connected not because they rely on the same water sources — in most cases
      they don’t — but because their populations will face the same perils of water
      stress: the most likely, a food crisis that could ultimately displace millions
      of people. “This has to serve as a wake-up call,” said Aaron Salzberg, a former
      fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center and the former director of the Water Institute
      at the University of North Carolina, who was not involved with the study. Research
      has long established that people take more water from underground when climate-driven
      heat and drought are at their worst. For example, during droughts when California
      has enforced restrictions on delivery of surface water to its farmers — which
      the state regulates — the enormous agriculture enterprises that dominate the Central
      Valley have drilled deeper and pumped harder, depleting the aquifer — which the
      state regulates less precisely — even more. For the most part, such withdrawals
      have remained invisible. Even with the GRACE data, scientists cannot measure the
      exact levels or know when an aquifer will be exhausted. But there is one foolproof
      sign that groundwater is disappearing: The earth above it collapses as the ground
      compresses like a drying sponge. The visible signs of such subsidence around the
      world appear to match what the GRACE data says. Mexico City is sinking as its
      groundwater aquifers are drained, as are large parts China, Indonesia, Spain and
      Iran, to name a few. A recent study by researchers at Virginia Tech in the journal
      Nature Cities found that 28 cities across the United States are sinking — New
      York, Houston and Denver, among them — threatening havoc for everything from building
      safety to transit. In the Central Valley, the ground surface is nearly 30 vertical
      feet lower than it was in the first part of the 20th century. When so much water
      is pumped, it has to drain somewhere. Just like rivers and streams fed by rainfall,
      much of the used groundwater makes its way into the ocean. The study pinpoints
      a remarkable shift: Groundwater drilled by people, used for agriculture or urban
      supplies and then discarded into drainages now contributes more water to the oceans
      than melting from each of the world’s largest ice caps. People aren’t just misusing
      groundwater, they are flooding their own coasts and cities in the process, Famiglietti
      warns. That means they are also imperiling some of the world’s most important
      food-producing lowlands in the Nile and Mekong deltas and cities from Shanghai
      to New York. Once in the oceans, of course, groundwater will never again be suitable
      for drinking and human use without expensive and energy-sucking treatment or through
      the natural cycle of evaporating and precipitating as rain. But even then, it
      may no longer fall where it is needed most. Groundwater “is an intergenerational
      resource that is being poorly managed, if managed at all,” the study states, “at
      tremendous and exceptionally undervalued cost to future generations.” That such
      rapid and substantial overuse of groundwater is also causing coastal flooding
      underscores the compounding threat of rising temperatures and aridity. It means
      that water scarcity and some of the most disruptive effects of climate change
      are now inextricably intertwined. And here, the study’s authors implore leaders
      to find a policy solution: Improve water management and reduce groundwater use
      now, and the world has a tool to slow the rate of sea level rise. Fail to adjust
      the governance and use of groundwater around the world, and humanity risks surrendering
      parts of its coastal cities while pouring out finite reserves it will sorely need
      as the other effects of climate change take hold. If the drying continues — and
      the researchers warn that it is now nearly impossible to reverse “on human timescales”
      — it heralds “potentially staggering” and cascading risks for global order. The
      majority of the earth’s population lives in the 101 countries that the study identified
      as losing fresh water, making up not just North America, Europe and North Africa
      but also much of Asia, the Middle East and South America. This suggests the middle
      band of Earth is becoming less habitable. It also correlates closely with the
      places that a separate body of climate research has already identified as a shrinking
      environmental niche that has suited civilization for the past 6,000 years. Combined,

      donation . By Kit Klarenberg / MintPress News On July 1 , British Home Secretary
      Yvette Cooper announced that Palestine Action (PA), a crusading campaign effort,
      would be proscribed as a terrorist group. Describing the movement as “dangerous,”
      she charged that its “orchestration and enaction of aggressive and intimidatory
      attacks against businesses, institutions and the public” had “crossed the thresholds
      established in the Terrorism Act 2000.” As a result, PA is now the country’s first
      protest group to be formally branded a terrorist entity, placing it in the same
      league as al-Qaida and ISIS. Based on Cooper’s characterization, a typical consumer
      of mainstream media might conclude PA posed a grave threat to Britain’s public
      safety and national security. However, other comments by Cooper appeared to undermine
      her incendiary headline charges. In justifying PA’s proscription, the Home Secretary
      cited recent actions conducted by the movement. These included “attacks” on factories
      owned by defense contractors Thales in 2022 and Instro Precision in 2024, each
      causing more than £1 million in damages . As hundreds of lawyers and multiple
      U.N. experts argued in the week before the proscription took effect, the move
      set an extremely dangerous precedent not only in Britain but for Palestine solidarity
      efforts worldwide. The group did not engage in activities that could plausibly
      be categorized as “terrorism”—a highly contentious concept, popularized by Israel
      for political reasons —in other Western jurisdictions. Average citizens were not
      in Palestine Action’s crosshairs, and not once did the group’s activism harm a
      human being. Instead, PA engaged in multifaceted civil disobedience, targeting
      firms closely tied to Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians, most prominently the
      Israeli-owned defense giant Elbit Systems . Entities providing services to those
      targets—such as companies leasing commercial space to Elbit—were also in the group’s
      crosshairs. These actions proved devastatingly effective, hitting Elbit’s bottom
      line at home and abroad. PA’s disruption also brought unwelcome mainstream attention
      to Elbit’s operations, spotlighting the firm in ways it clearly sought to avoid.
      In proscribing Palestine Action, the British government may have been motivated,
      in part, by a desire to avoid awkward questions and inconvenient disclosures.
      In one of the group’s final actions, on June 19, several members broke into Royal
      Air Force base Brize Norton and defaced two military planes parked there. The
      site is a key hub for refueling and repairing British jets that have conducted
      hundreds of reconnaissance flights over Gaza since the genocide began in October
      2023. These routine surveillance flights are just one component of London’s active
      involvement in the genocide, which authorities systematically seek to conceal
      from public view. Another is the presence of the SAS conducting “counterterrorism”
      operations in Gaza, which has been covered up via direct state decree. However,
      the origins of Palestine Action’s proscription stretch back much further. The
      story behind the ban is a sordid and largely hidden one marked by long-running,
      opaque collusion between British and Israeli authorities and the global arms industry.
      The Legal and Political Fallout As a result of PA’s proscription, it is now a
      criminal offense to be a member of, or to express “support” for, the group, punishable
      by up to 14 years in prison. However, an Actionist who wishes to remain anonymous
      predicts many will deliberately breach the proscription order, knowing they’ll
      face legal consequences, to increase pressure on authorities. Already, dozens
      of British citizens — including an 83-year-old priest — have been arrested for
      peacefully displaying signs declaring, “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine
      Action.” This is like something from an Alan Moore comic. https://t.co/uVoqIGJlrA
      — Asa Winstanley (@AsaWinstanley) July 19, 2025 “Things are going to happen, without
      doubt. The group may be proscribed, but you can’t proscribe ideas, whether that’s
      opposition to the Holocaust in Gaza, sympathy with Israel’s innocent victims,
      or a desire to disrupt the network of genocide in Britain to which Elbit and its
      subsidiaries and suppliers are so central,” the Actionist tells MintPress News.
      “Still, the chilling effect on Palestine solidarity is obvious, and no doubt deliberate.”
      The mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators for simply expressing sympathy for Palestine
      Action highlights a deeply troubling aspect of British “counterterror” legislation.
      The term “support” isn’t even clearly defined, and according to legal precedents,
      can extend far beyond practical or tangible assistance, to “intellectual” support,
      including “agreement with and approval” or “speaking in favor” of a proscribed
      group. In December 2024, UN experts expressed immense disquiet over this “vague
      and overbroad” interpretation, warning that it could “unjustifiably criminalize
      legitimate expression.” “The proscription of Palestine Action is unprecedented.
      It’s the first time Britain has banned as ‘terrorist’ a protest group which has
      never used guns or bombs,” Asa Winstanley of Electronic Intifada tells MintPress
      News. “It seems like a massive overreach, and therefore it’s not surprising there’s
      been lots of civil disobedience in response.” Surprisingly, even The Times, typically
      a reliable megaphone for Britain’s intelligence, military and security apparatus,
      published an editorial on July 7 intensely critical of “the heavy-handed branding
      of Palestine Action as terrorists,” dubbing the proscription “absurd.” While describing
      the group as “a malign force” and “antisocial menace,” the outlet argued that
      activists’ damage to commercial and private property could be “prosecuted into
      submission” under existing criminal law and the use of “lighter-touch measures”
      given the level of threat posed by Palestine Action. Notably absent from The Times
      editorial was any consideration of the fact that criminal proceedings against
      Palestine Action frequently ended in failure. In several cases, Actionists who
      caused mass disruption or damage to Elbit sites walked free even on relatively
      minor charges, because the company declined to provide police or prosecutors with
      witnesses or other evidence. Elbit is extremely wary of advertising the central
      role its arsenal plays in the killing of Palestinians. The company’s marketing
      brochures typically omit mention of its Israeli ownership, instead emphasizing
      the supposed economic and social benefits its operations deliver to British communities.
      A January 2023 puff piece on UAV Systems, an Elbit subsidiary repeatedly targeted
      by Palestine Action, even referred to the company as a “little company making
      repurposed Norton motorbike engines.” In cases where Elbit did provide evidence,
      Actionists used the opportunity to turn the tables and place the company and the
      Israeli state on trial. In November 2022 , five of the group’s activists who vandalized
      Elbit’s London HQ were acquitted. In defending their actions, several of the accused
      testified to witnessing first-hand atrocities committed by Israeli occupation
      forces in Gaza and the West Bank. While Elbit argued Palestine Action’s buckets
      of red paint were “improvised weapons,” the jury was not persuaded. Judicial Battles
      and Public Defiance Fast forward to today, and the anonymous Actionist is under
      no illusions that the British legal system alone will be enough to reverse Palestine
      Action’s proscription. “It has to be fought amongst the public, on the streets
      and in the courts,” they tell MintPress News. The group has applied for a judicial
      review in an effort to overturn its ban. This follows an application for interim
      relief to delay the proscription, which was denied after Yvette Cooper’s announcement.
      Despite submitting an extensive witness statement outlining the serious implications
      that Actionists—and ordinary British citizens—could face if the ban took immediate
      effect, a panel of three judges took less than 90 minutes to reject the request
      . The justices acknowledged that there would be “serious consequences” from the
      government’s ban, including the risk that individuals could “unwittingly commit”
      criminal offenses and that those associated with the group might face “social
      stigma and other more serious consequences at university or at work.” Palestine
      Action had warned the ban would create confusion and chaos. Police responses to
      pro-PA protests across Britain have varied wildly . Some resulted in no arrests,
      while in Wales, protesters were not only arrested under terror legislation but
      also had their homes raided. Videos of interactions between Palestine solidarity
      protesters and police suggest officers themselves are unsure about what is now
      lawful. In Scotland, four people were arrested for wearing T-shirts that didn’t
      even mention the group. British Police Officers Say Holding A "Free Gaza" Poster

      News (@MintPressNews) July 15, 2025 Speaking to MintPress News, the anonymous
      Actionist expressed frustration over the court’s decision. “A UN Special Rapporteur
      supported us, warning the proscription breached international standards, but apparently
      British judges know better. It just shows how corrupt the entire system is. Every
      part of it is rotten,” they lament. “The government, almost unanimously supported
      by parliament, rammed through the conscription without warning or any public debate
      whatsoever, after falsely briefing the media we might be funded by Iran. Who will
      they target like this next?” As Declassified UK has documented , nearly every
      major British outlet ran with the Home Office’s Iran narrative, without offering
      PA a rebuttal. In a particularly revealing twist, the pro-Israel lobby group We
      Believe In Israel —which does not disclose its funding sources—openly took credit
      for the government’s decision. In an X post , the organization called the proscription
      its “victory,” claiming it was the direct result of months of “sustained research,
      strategic advocacy, and evidence-based reporting” contained in a report it had
      published earlier in the year. Collusion and Israeli Influence Again, the anonymous
      Actionist is unsurprised that British policy—if not legislation—is effectively
      being written by Israeli lobby groups. Yvette Cooper, Foreign Secretary David
      Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer were all named
      as supporters of Labour Friends of Israel, before the list was scrubbed from the
      internet ahead of the 2024 general election. LFI, which praised the proscription
      , maintains a close relationship with Tel Aviv’s London embassy, which is widely
      believed to be infested with Mossad agents—a connection the group works to obscure
      . In recent months, PA and independent journalists have uncovered compelling evidence
      that the Home Office has been in secret contact with Elbit representatives and
      Israel’s London embassy almost since the group’s founding in 2020. The full scope
      of this collusion is still unknown and may never come to light. However, documents
      released under Freedom of Information laws raise serious concerns about whether
      this concealed relationship influenced both the prosecution of Actionists and
      the decision to proscribe the group. For example, in March 2022, then-Home Secretary
      Priti Patel met privately with Elbit UK CEO Martin Fausset to reassure the firm—and,
      by extension, its Israeli handlers—that the British government was taking “criminal
      protest acts against Elbit Systems UK” seriously. At the time, officials acknowledged
      that Palestine Action’s activities did “not meet the threshold for proscription”
      under British law. Before that meeting, no PA members had been successfully prosecuted.
      In the months that followed, legal actions against the group escalated dramatically.
      Still, many Actionists continued to walk free. In December 2023 , six members—including
      co-founders Huda Ammori and Richard Barnard—were acquitted of nine charges by
      a jury. The following month, internal correspondence revealed Elbit UK’s security
      director wrote to British officials expressing concern that “a re-trial is not
      a certainty” and suggesting it was “very much in the public interest” for the
      trial to be reheard. Mere days later, a retrial was announced—for 2027 . That
      would mark six years since the alleged offenses took place. One Actionist called
      the drawn-out process a “form of psychological warfare on defendants,” saying
      it prevents them from making long-term plans or securing employment. Meanwhile,
      other PA members are imprisoned awaiting trial, some already incarcerated for
      extended periods. There are disturbing signs that their detention and prosecution
      are being coordinated with Israeli authorities. Among the most alarming revelations
      are heavily redacted emails showing that, in September 2024, the British Attorney
      General’s Office shared contact details for the Crown Prosecution Service and
      counterterrorism units with the Israeli embassy. The timing raises suspicions
      of Israeli interference in the prosecution of PA members who, earlier that month,
      broke into Elbit’s Filton factory and destroyed quadcopters— weapons routinely
      used to maim and kill Palestinians in Gaza. Source | Kit Klarenberg | The Grayzone
      In all, 18 Actionists involved are currently remanded in prison, their pre-trial
      detention period running to 182 days, well in excess of standard limits for non-terror-related
      cases. Their contact with the outside world has also been severely restricted,
      in violation of international legal norms. On July 15 , another five PA members
      were arrested and charged in connection with Filton. If the Israeli government
      played any role in these prosecutions, it would represent a flagrant breach of
      Crown Prosecution Service guidelines , which prohibit “undue pressure or influence
      from any source.” In May, British prosecutors announced they would consider “terrorism
      connections” in the case of 10 Actionists who targeted Instro Precision , an Elbit
      supplier, in June 2024. While the charges—aggravated burglary, criminal damage
      and violent disorder—do not qualify as terrorism under British law, prosecutors
      say those connections may factor into sentencing. If upheld, that designation
      could lead to significantly harsher penalties than standard criminal charges would
      normally carry. Legal Challenges Mount On July 21, London’s High Court heard arguments
      from lawyers representing Huda Ammori, seeking permission to challenge Palestine
      Action’s proscription. In addition to citing devastating figures related to the
      genocide in Gaza and Elbit’s direct involvement , the legal team also emphasized
      the legal uncertainty now faced by activists and journalists as a result of the
      ban. In response, government lawyers argued that the Proscribed Organisations
      Appeal Commission—not a judicial review—was the appropriate forum to challenge
      the designation. At the hearing’s conclusion , the judge stated a full ruling
      would be issued on July 30. Earlier, on June 24 , Jewish News revealed that British
      authorities had hesitated to proscribe PA out of concern that a judicial review
      “could overturn” the decision. That concern reportedly contributed to initial
      “reticence” from the Home Office. Even if the review is authorized, it could take
      months for a ruling to be reached. In the meantime, journalist and legal scholar
      Leila Hatoum offered a stark assessment of the situation. She told MintPress News
      that the British state’s targeting of the group “for standing against genocide
      and oppression” was “nothing short of tyranny.” She added that the ban not only
      threatens basic rights—particularly freedom of speech and freedom of the press—but
      also violates international law. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
      of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted by the UN in 1948, notes it is the
      duty of all nations and peoples to act to stop a genocide. By legally pursuing
      those who are seeking to prevent Israel’s ongoing apartheid, occupation and genocide
      against the Palestinians in Gaza, especially members and supporters of Palestine
      Action, the UK has positioned itself against the international law, and alongside
      the forces of darkness. The country has failed humanity.” A Legacy of Resistance
      Despite this bleak outlook—and the possibility that the group could remain proscribed
      regardless of any court challenge—Palestine Action’s example remains an inspiration
      to people across Britain and beyond. A volunteer group of ordinary citizens, spanning
      every age, ethnicity, faith and gender, without financial or institutional backing,
      posed such a threat to entrenched power that the British government, for the first
      time in history, resorted to a legal “nuclear option” to neutralize them. Civil
      disobedience aimed at disrupting military operations has a long and established
      history. Since the early 1980s, the Christian pacifist Plowshares movement has
      carried out sabotage against U.S. military bases and nuclear installations. In
      2003, five activists were prosecuted for damaging American bombers at a British
      base to prevent their use in the Iraq War. One of the defendants was represented
      by none other than Keir Starmer, who argued successfully that although their actions
      were technically illegal, they were justified as an effort to prevent war crimes.
      Palestine Action represents the first group to maintain this legacy during an
      active, ongoing genocide, but ever since its launch, it has achieved major victories.
      In January 2022, Elbit sold off one of its component factories, and a British
      government prosecutor acknowledged that PA’s sustained actions against the site
      “forced the closure.” Two additional Elbit sites targeted by the group have since
      been shut down. Governments around the world, including Brazil and even Britain
      , have canceled lucrative contracts with the company. Had the British state not
      acted so forcefully, it is likely that Palestine Action’s momentum would have
      continued building, possibly forcing Elbit out of the UK entirely. Yet despite
      the risk of arrest or prison, solidarity with Palestine and overt support for
      Palestine Action show no sign of fading. As Israel’s favorability plummets to
      historic lows across the West, there are countless individuals around the world
      ready to follow PA’s example, risking their liberty to stop the ongoing genocide.

    one_sentence_summary: The British government has designated Palestine Action, a
      protest group advocating for Palestinian rights, as a terrorist organization,
      marking it as the first of its kind to receive such a classification under the
      Terrorism Act 2000.
    paragraph_summary: On July 1, British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper declared Palestine
      Action (PA) a terrorist group, making it the first protest organization in the
      UK to receive such a designation under the Terrorism Act 2000. Cooper labeled
      PA as "dangerous" due to its alleged aggressive actions against businesses linked
      to defense contractors, claiming these actions posed a significant threat to public
      safety. However, her justification for the proscription, which included references
      to specific property damage rather than threats to life, raised concerns among
      legal experts and human rights advocates about the implications for Palestine
      solidarity movements globally. Critics argue that the classification of PA as
      a terrorist entity sets a troubling precedent that could stifle legitimate protest
      and dissent.

      given the level of threat posed by Palestine Action. Notably absent from The Times
      editorial was any consideration of the fact that criminal proceedings against
      Palestine Action frequently ended in failure. In several cases, Actionists who
      caused mass disruption or damage to Elbit sites walked free even on relatively
      minor charges, because the company declined to provide police or prosecutors with
      witnesses or other evidence. Elbit is extremely wary of advertising the central
      role its arsenal plays in the killing of Palestinians. The company’s marketing
      brochures typically omit mention of its Israeli ownership, instead emphasizing
      the supposed economic and social benefits its operations deliver to British communities.
      A January 2023 puff piece on UAV Systems, an Elbit subsidiary repeatedly targeted
      by Palestine Action, even referred to the company as a “little company making
      repurposed Norton motorbike engines.” In cases where Elbit did provide evidence,
      Actionists used the opportunity to turn the tables and place the company and the
      Israeli state on trial. In November 2022 , five of the group’s activists who vandalized
      Elbit’s London HQ were acquitted. In defending their actions, several of the accused
      testified to witnessing first-hand atrocities committed by Israeli occupation
      forces in Gaza and the West Bank. While Elbit argued Palestine Action’s buckets
      of red paint were “improvised weapons,” the jury was not persuaded. Judicial Battles
      and Public Defiance Fast forward to today, and the anonymous Actionist is under
      no illusions that the British legal system alone will be enough to reverse Palestine
      Action’s proscription. “It has to be fought amongst the public, on the streets
      and in the courts,” they tell MintPress News. The group has applied for a judicial
      review in an effort to overturn its ban. This follows an application for interim
      relief to delay the proscription, which was denied after Yvette Cooper’s announcement.
      Despite submitting an extensive witness statement outlining the serious implications
      that Actionists—and ordinary British citizens—could face if the ban took immediate
      effect, a panel of three judges took less than 90 minutes to reject the request
      . The justices acknowledged that there would be “serious consequences” from the
      government’s ban, including the risk that individuals could “unwittingly commit”
      criminal offenses and that those associated with the group might face “social
      stigma and other more serious consequences at university or at work.” Palestine
      Action had warned the ban would create confusion and chaos. Police responses to
      pro-PA protests across Britain have varied wildly . Some resulted in no arrests,
      while in Wales, protesters were not only arrested under terror legislation but
      also had their homes raided. Videos of interactions between Palestine solidarity
      protesters and police suggest officers themselves are unsure about what is now
      lawful. In Scotland, four people were arrested for wearing T-shirts that didn’t
      even mention the group. British Police Officers Say Holding A "Free Gaza" Poster

      News (@MintPressNews) July 15, 2025 Speaking to MintPress News, the anonymous
      Actionist expressed frustration over the court’s decision. “A UN Special Rapporteur
      supported us, warning the proscription breached international standards, but apparently
      British judges know better. It just shows how corrupt the entire system is. Every
      part of it is rotten,” they lament. “The government, almost unanimously supported
      by parliament, rammed through the conscription without warning or any public debate
      whatsoever, after falsely briefing the media we might be funded by Iran. Who will
      they target like this next?” As Declassified UK has documented , nearly every
      major British outlet ran with the Home Office’s Iran narrative, without offering
      PA a rebuttal. In a particularly revealing twist, the pro-Israel lobby group We
      Believe In Israel —which does not disclose its funding sources—openly took credit
      for the government’s decision. In an X post , the organization called the proscription
      its “victory,” claiming it was the direct result of months of “sustained research,
      strategic advocacy, and evidence-based reporting” contained in a report it had
      published earlier in the year. Collusion and Israeli Influence Again, the anonymous
      Actionist is unsurprised that British policy—if not legislation—is effectively
      being written by Israeli lobby groups. Yvette Cooper, Foreign Secretary David
      Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer were all named
      as supporters of Labour Friends of Israel, before the list was scrubbed from the
      internet ahead of the 2024 general election. LFI, which praised the proscription
      , maintains a close relationship with Tel Aviv’s London embassy, which is widely
      believed to be infested with Mossad agents—a connection the group works to obscure
      . In recent months, PA and independent journalists have uncovered compelling evidence
      that the Home Office has been in secret contact with Elbit representatives and
      Israel’s London embassy almost since the group’s founding in 2020. The full scope
      of this collusion is still unknown and may never come to light. However, documents
      released under Freedom of Information laws raise serious concerns about whether
      this concealed relationship influenced both the prosecution of Actionists and
      the decision to proscribe the group. For example, in March 2022, then-Home Secretary
      Priti Patel met privately with Elbit UK CEO Martin Fausset to reassure the firm—and,
      by extension, its Israeli handlers—that the British government was taking “criminal
      protest acts against Elbit Systems UK” seriously. At the time, officials acknowledged
      that Palestine Action’s activities did “not meet the threshold for proscription”
      under British law. Before that meeting, no PA members had been successfully prosecuted.
      In the months that followed, legal actions against the group escalated dramatically.
      Still, many Actionists continued to walk free. In December 2023 , six members—including
      co-founders Huda Ammori and Richard Barnard—were acquitted of nine charges by
      a jury. The following month, internal correspondence revealed Elbit UK’s security
      director wrote to British officials expressing concern that “a re-trial is not
      a certainty” and suggesting it was “very much in the public interest” for the
      trial to be reheard. Mere days later, a retrial was announced—for 2027 . That
      would mark six years since the alleged offenses took place. One Actionist called
      the drawn-out process a “form of psychological warfare on defendants,” saying
      it prevents them from making long-term plans or securing employment. Meanwhile,
      other PA members are imprisoned awaiting trial, some already incarcerated for
      extended periods. There are disturbing signs that their detention and prosecution
      are being coordinated with Israeli authorities. Among the most alarming revelations
      are heavily redacted emails showing that, in September 2024, the British Attorney
      General’s Office shared contact details for the Crown Prosecution Service and
      counterterrorism units with the Israeli embassy. The timing raises suspicions
      of Israeli interference in the prosecution of PA members who, earlier that month,
      broke into Elbit’s Filton factory and destroyed quadcopters— weapons routinely
      used to maim and kill Palestinians in Gaza. Source | Kit Klarenberg | The Grayzone
      In all, 18 Actionists involved are currently remanded in prison, their pre-trial
      detention period running to 182 days, well in excess of standard limits for non-terror-related
      cases. Their contact with the outside world has also been severely restricted,
      in violation of international legal norms. On July 15 , another five PA members
      were arrested and charged in connection with Filton. If the Israeli government
      played any role in these prosecutions, it would represent a flagrant breach of
      Crown Prosecution Service guidelines , which prohibit “undue pressure or influence
      from any source.” In May, British prosecutors announced they would consider “terrorism
      connections” in the case of 10 Actionists who targeted Instro Precision , an Elbit
      supplier, in June 2024. While the charges—aggravated burglary, criminal damage
      and violent disorder—do not qualify as terrorism under British law, prosecutors
      say those connections may factor into sentencing. If upheld, that designation
      could lead to significantly harsher penalties than standard criminal charges would
      normally carry. Legal Challenges Mount On July 21, London’s High Court heard arguments
      from lawyers representing Huda Ammori, seeking permission to challenge Palestine
      Action’s proscription. In addition to citing devastating figures related to the
      genocide in Gaza and Elbit’s direct involvement , the legal team also emphasized
      the legal uncertainty now faced by activists and journalists as a result of the
      ban. In response, government lawyers argued that the Proscribed Organisations
      Appeal Commission—not a judicial review—was the appropriate forum to challenge
      the designation. At the hearing’s conclusion , the judge stated a full ruling
      would be issued on July 30. Earlier, on June 24 , Jewish News revealed that British
      authorities had hesitated to proscribe PA out of concern that a judicial review
      “could overturn” the decision. That concern reportedly contributed to initial
      “reticence” from the Home Office. Even if the review is authorized, it could take
      months for a ruling to be reached. In the meantime, journalist and legal scholar
      Leila Hatoum offered a stark assessment of the situation. She told MintPress News
      that the British state’s targeting of the group “for standing against genocide
      and oppression” was “nothing short of tyranny.” She added that the ban not only
      threatens basic rights—particularly freedom of speech and freedom of the press—but
      also violates international law. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
      of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted by the UN in 1948, notes it is the
      duty of all nations and peoples to act to stop a genocide. By legally pursuing
      those who are seeking to prevent Israel’s ongoing apartheid, occupation and genocide
      against the Palestinians in Gaza, especially members and supporters of Palestine
      Action, the UK has positioned itself against the international law, and alongside
      the forces of darkness. The country has failed humanity.” A Legacy of Resistance
      Despite this bleak outlook—and the possibility that the group could remain proscribed
      regardless of any court challenge—Palestine Action’s example remains an inspiration
      to people across Britain and beyond. A volunteer group of ordinary citizens, spanning
      every age, ethnicity, faith and gender, without financial or institutional backing,
      posed such a threat to entrenched power that the British government, for the first
      time in history, resorted to a legal “nuclear option” to neutralize them. Civil
      disobedience aimed at disrupting military operations has a long and established
      history. Since the early 1980s, the Christian pacifist Plowshares movement has
      carried out sabotage against U.S. military bases and nuclear installations. In
      2003, five activists were prosecuted for damaging American bombers at a British
      base to prevent their use in the Iraq War. One of the defendants was represented
      by none other than Keir Starmer, who argued successfully that although their actions
      were technically illegal, they were justified as an effort to prevent war crimes.
      Palestine Action represents the first group to maintain this legacy during an
      active, ongoing genocide, but ever since its launch, it has achieved major victories.
      In January 2022, Elbit sold off one of its component factories, and a British
      government prosecutor acknowledged that PA’s sustained actions against the site
      “forced the closure.” Two additional Elbit sites targeted by the group have since
      been shut down. Governments around the world, including Brazil and even Britain
      , have canceled lucrative contracts with the company. Had the British state not
      acted so forcefully, it is likely that Palestine Action’s momentum would have
      continued building, possibly forcing Elbit out of the UK entirely. Yet despite
      the risk of arrest or prison, solidarity with Palestine and overt support for
      Palestine Action show no sign of fading. As Israel’s favorability plummets to
      historic lows across the West, there are countless individuals around the world
      ready to follow PA’s example, risking their liberty to stop the ongoing genocide.
      After all, it is not just a moral duty. It is a legal one . Editor’s Note : A

    one_sentence_summary: The British government has designated Palestine Action, a
      protest group advocating for Palestinian rights, as a terrorist organization,
      marking it as the first of its kind to receive such a classification under the
      Terrorism Act 2000.
    paragraph_summary: On July 1, British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper declared Palestine
      Action (PA) a terrorist group, making it the first protest organization in the
      UK to receive such a designation under the Terrorism Act 2000. Cooper labeled
      PA as "dangerous" due to its alleged aggressive actions against businesses linked
      to defense contractors, claiming these actions posed a significant threat to public
      safety. However, her justification for the proscription, which included references
      to specific property damage rather than threats to life, raised concerns among
      legal experts and human rights advocates about the implications for Palestine
      solidarity movements globally. Critics argue that the classification of PA as
      a terrorist entity sets a troubling precedent that could stifle legitimate protest
      and dissent.

      Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report Today I testified at a hearing in Trenton, New
      Jersey to the State Assembly and local government committee to oppose the adoption
      of Bill A3558 in New Jersey. The bill would accept the International Holocaust
      Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, which conflates
      criticism of the state of Israel and Zionism with antisemitism. The IHRA definition
      has been recognized by 35 states in the U.S., and New Jersey may soon become the
      36th. Posted here is the video with slight audio touch-ups, video editing and
      captions. Text of Speech: I am the former Pulitzer-prize winning Middle East Bureau
      Chief for The New York Times. I spent seven year covering the Middle East, including
      in Gaza and the West Bank. I am an Arabic speaker. During my time in the Middle
      East, I was based in Jerusalem and Cairo. I am also the author of 16 books and
      have taught at Columbia University, New York University, Princeton University
      and Rutgers University. I live in Princeton. I strongly oppose A3558, which expands
      antisemitism’s definition to include most anti-Zionst expression for the purpose
      of civil rights law. This is a dangerous assault on free speech by seeking to
      criminalize legitimate criticism of Israeli policies. The Trump administration’s
      campaign to ostensibly root out antisemitism on college campuses is clearly a
      trope to shut down free speech and deport non-citizens, even if they are here
      legally. This bill falsely collapses ethnicity with a political state. And let’s
      be clear, the brunt repression on college campuses was directed against students
      and faculty who opposed the genocide in Gaza, 3,000 of whom were arrested and
      hundreds of whom were censored, suspended, or expelled. Many of these students
      are Jewish. What about their rights? What about their constitutional protections?
      I have had numerous relationships with Israeli journalists and political leaders.
      I knew, for example, former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who negotiated
      the Oslo peace agreement. Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli ultranationalist
      who opposed the peace accord, stated bluntly that the occupation was not beneficial
      to Israel. Israeli colleagues frequently criticize Israeli policies in the Israeli
      press in language that would be defined as antisemitic by A3558. For example,
      the Israeli journalist Gideon Levy, who served in the Israeli army and writes
      for the newspaper Haaretz, has called for sanctions to be imposed on Israel to
      stop the slaughter in Gaza, saying “Do to Israel what you did to South Africa.”
      Omer Bartov, who served as an Israeli company commander in the 1973 war, is Professor
      of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Brown University. He stated in an article
      on July 15 in The New York Times that his “inescapable conclusion has become that
      Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people.” These kinds of
      statements, and many more I can quote from Israeli colleagues and friends, would
      see them under this bill criminalized as antisemites. As someone who speaks and
      writes frequently about the conflict, I fear that any criticism I make of the
      Israeli government, although grounded in my long experience in the region, will
      make me a target if this measure is adopted. It is imperative, especially with
      the press under attack from the Trump administration, that we do not erode our
      constitutionally protected speech and political expression. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST

      seeks to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism that he argues conflates legitimate
      criticism of Israel with antisemitism, highlighting the need for financial support
      for independent journalism amidst this critical issue.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent testimony before a New Jersey State Assembly committee,
      Chris Hedges, a former Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, opposed Bill A3558,
      which seeks to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA)
      definition of antisemitism that equates criticism of Israel and Zionism with antisemitism.
      Hedges argues that this bill poses a significant threat to free speech by criminalizing
      legitimate critiques of Israeli policies, particularly in the context of civil
      rights law. He highlights the dangers of conflating ethnicity with political statehood
      and points out that recent efforts to combat antisemitism on college campuses
      have disproportionately targeted those who oppose Israeli actions, particularly
      regarding the situation in Gaza. Hedges calls for awareness and resistance against
      what he perceives as a broader assault on free expression.

      Cantwell / The Conversation Columbia University agreed on July 23, 2025, to pay
      a US$200 million fine to the federal government and to settle allegations that
      it did not create a safe environment for Jewish students during Palestinian rights
      protests in 2024. The deal will restore the vast majority of the $400 million
      in federal grants and contracts that Columbia was previously awarded, before the
      administration withdrew the funding in March 2025. It marks the first financial
      and political agreement a university has reached with the Trump administration
      in its push for more control over higher education – and stands to have significant
      ripple effects for how other universities and colleges carry out their basic operations.
      Amy Lieberman, the education editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Brendan
      Cantwell , a scholar of higher education at Michigan State University, to understand
      what’s exactly in this agreement – and the lasting precedent it may set on government
      intervention in higher education. What’s in the deal Columbia made with the Trump
      administration? The agreement requires Columbia to make a $200 million payment
      to the federal government. Columbia will also pay $21 million to settle investigations
      brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Columbia will need
      to keep detailed statistics about student applicants – including their race and
      ethnicity, grades and SAT scores – as well as information about faculty and staff
      hiring decisions. Columbia will then have to share this data with the federal
      government. In exchange, the federal government will release most of the $400
      million in frozen grant money previously awarded to Columbia and allow faculty
      at the university to compete for future federal grants. How does this deal address
      antisemitism? The Trump administration has cited antisemitism against students
      and faculty on campuses to justify its broad incursion into the business of universities
      around the country. Antisemitism is a real and legitimate concern in U.S. society
      and higher education , including at Columbia . But the federal complaint the administration
      made against Columbia was not actually about antisemitism. The administration
      made a formal accusation of antisemitism at Columbia in May of this year but suspended
      grants to the university in March. The federal government had initially acknowledged
      that cutting federal research grants did nothing to address the climate for Jewish
      students on campus, for example. When the federal government investigates civil
      rights violations, it usually conducts site visits and does very thorough investigations
      . We never saw such a government report about antisemitism at Columbia or other
      universities. The settlement that Columbia has entered into with the administration
      also doesn’t do much about antisemitism. The agreement includes Columbia redefining
      antisemitism with a broader definition that is also used by the International
      Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The definition now includes “a certain perception
      of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews” – a description that is
      also used by the U.S. State Department and several European governments but some
      critics say conflates antisemitism with anti-Zionism. Instead, the agreement primarily
      has to do with faculty hiring and admissions decisions. The federal government
      alleges that Columbia is discriminating against white and Asian applicants, and
      that this will allow the government to ensure that everybody who is admitted is
      considered only on the basis of merit. The administration could argue that changing
      hiring practices to get faculty who are less hostile to Jewish students could
      change the campus climate, but the agreement doesn’t really identify ways in which
      the university contributed to or ignored antisemitic conduct. Is this a new issue?
      There has been a long-running issue that conservatives and members of the Trump
      administration – dating back to his first term – have with higher education. The
      Trump administration and other conservatives have said for years that higher education
      is too liberal. The protests were the flash point that put Columbia in the administration’s
      crosshairs, as well as claims that Columbia was creating a hostile environment
      for Jewish students. The administration’s complaints aren’t limited to Columbia
      . Harvard is in a protracted conflict with the administration, and the administration
      has launched investigations into dozens of other schools around the country. These
      universities are butting heads with the administration over the same grievance
      that higher education is too liberal. There are also specific claims about antisemitism
      on university campuses and the privileges given to nonwhite students in admissions
      or campus life. While the administration has a common set of complaints about
      a range of universities, there is a mix of schools that the administration is
      taking issue with. Some of them, such as Harvard, are very high profile. The Department
      of Justice forced out the president at the University of Virginia in January 2025
      on the grounds that he had not done enough to root out diversity, equity and inclusion
      programs at the public university. The University of Virginia may have been a
      target for the administration because a Republican governor appointed most members
      of its governance board and agreed with Trump’s complaints. How could this change
      the makeup of Columbia’s student population? The Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that
      Harvard’s affirmative action program, which considered race in admissions, violated
      the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment . This effectively ended race-based
      affirmative action for all U.S. colleges and universities. Now, with the Columbia
      deal, the government could say that it would expect to see a proportion of students
      who are white increase and students who are Black and Latino to decrease at Columbia.
      That’s a legal approach that America First Legal, a conservative legal advocacy
      group founded by Stephen Miller , a Trump administration official, has already
      tried. Back in February 2025, America First Legal alleged in a federal lawsuit
      that the University of California, Los Angeles, was using illegal admissions criteria,
      because of the number of Black and Latino students that were admitted by the school.
      That lawsuit is ongoing. What does this agreement mean for US higher education
      as a whole? It is an enormous, unprecedented shift in how the federal government
      works with higher education. Since the McCarthy era in the 1940s and ’50s, when
      professors were blacklisted and fired because of their alleged communism, Americans
      have not seen the federal government interrogate education. The federal government
      does have a role in securing people’s civil rights, including in the context of
      higher education, but this is very, very different from how the federal government
      has done civil rights investigations and entered into agreements with universities
      in the past. This agreement is very broad and gives the federal government oversight
      of things that have long been under universities’ control, such as whom they hire
      to teach and which students they admit. The federal government is now saying it
      has the right to look over universities’ shoulders and guide them in this work
      that has long been considered independent. And the government is willing to be
      extremely coercive to get universities to comply. What signal does this agreement
      send to other universities? This agreement sets a precedent for the government
      to direct colleges and universities to comply with its political agenda. This
      violates the long tradition of academic independence that had helped to make the
      U.S. higher education system the envy of the world . Columbia can afford paying
      $200 million to the federal government. Most universities can’t afford to pay
      $200 million. And most campuses cannot survive without federal resources, whether
      that comes in the form of student financial aid or research grants . This agreement
      sets a standard for other universities that, if they don’t immediately do what
      the federal government wants them to do, the government could impose penalties
      that are so high it could end their ability to operate. Editor’s Note : A t a

      donation . By Julia Conley / Common Dreams As U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders prepared
      to hold his latest event amplifying teachers’ demands for fair pay on Thursday,
      national data revealed that public school educators are far more likely than people
      in other professions to take on a second job—including during the academic year
      while they’re juggling lesson plans and other teaching responsibilities. According
      to the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES), 17% of public elementary
      and secondary school teachers—about 1 in 6—have second jobs during the school
      year, while 16% work in nonschool settings during the summer months. Across the
      U.S. economy, just 4.6% of all U.S. workers had multiple jobs at a time in 2020-21,
      the latest school year for which data is available regarding teachers who take
      on extra jobs. The numbers during the 2020-21 school year, which was upended by
      the coronavirus pandemic, were consistent with those reported by the Bureau of
      Labor Statistics and the NCES in previous years, according to the Pew Research
      Center, which reported on the data. As Sanders (I-Vt.) noted earlier this week
      when he announced a town hall he is holding Thursday with more than 100 teachers
      and educational leaders, 40% of teachers are also compensated for extra work they
      do within their school systems, like leading extracurricular or other activities.
      “Today, four hedge fund managers on Wall Street earn more in a year than every
      kindergarten teacher in America combined,” said the senator, a longtime advocate
      for education and economic justice. “Teachers: Join us for a town hall… to discuss
      the enormously important issue of raising teacher pay and saving public education.”
      The town hall is set to take place in Washington, D.C. with the Senate Health,
      Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where Sanders is the ranking member,
      at 12:30 pm Eastern time. It will be available via livestream on Sanders’ social
      media accounts. “We need the best education system in the world, and that means
      we need the best teachers,” said Sanders ahead of the event. “To get the best
      teachers, we need to pay them what they deserve.” Pew reported that while younger
      and less experienced teachers are more likely to hold nonteaching jobs during
      the summer months, teachers with the least amount of experience are about as likely
      as teachers who have been working for many years to take on extra jobs during
      the school year. A 2023 Pew poll found that 51% of public school K-12 teachers
      reported they were not very or not at all satisfied with their pay, and another
      survey that same year showed 74% of U.S. adults believed teachers should be paid
      more—including close to 40% who said they should be paid a lot more. The town
      hall is being held days after several school districts and teachers unions filed
      a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its freezing of funds for programs
      for low-income students, students who are learning English in school, after-school
      programs, and teacher development. The plaintiffs argue the withholding of the
      funds violates the Impoundment Control Act, which bars presidents from stopping
      the disbursement of funds that have been appropriated by Congress, and warn that
      the funding freeze could force school districts to lay off teachers and staff
      and reduce programming. “From day one, the Trump administration has attacked public
      education,” said American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, who
      is set to speak at Sanders’ town hall. “We won’t let this administration defund
      our kids’ futures.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of

      donation . By Julia Conley / Common Dreams As U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders prepared
      to hold his latest event amplifying teachers’ demands for fair pay on Thursday,
      national data revealed that public school educators are far more likely than people
      in other professions to take on a second job—including during the academic year
      while they’re juggling lesson plans and other teaching responsibilities. According
      to the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES), 17% of public elementary
      and secondary school teachers—about 1 in 6—have second jobs during the school
      year, while 16% work in nonschool settings during the summer months. Across the
      U.S. economy, just 4.6% of all U.S. workers had multiple jobs at a time in 2020-21,
      the latest school year for which data is available regarding teachers who take
      on extra jobs. The numbers during the 2020-21 school year, which was upended by
      the coronavirus pandemic, were consistent with those reported by the Bureau of
      Labor Statistics and the NCES in previous years, according to the Pew Research
      Center, which reported on the data. As Sanders (I-Vt.) noted earlier this week
      when he announced a town hall he is holding Thursday with more than 100 teachers
      and educational leaders, 40% of teachers are also compensated for extra work they
      do within their school systems, like leading extracurricular or other activities.
      “Today, four hedge fund managers on Wall Street earn more in a year than every
      kindergarten teacher in America combined,” said the senator, a longtime advocate
      for education and economic justice. “Teachers: Join us for a town hall… to discuss
      the enormously important issue of raising teacher pay and saving public education.”
      The town hall is set to take place in Washington, D.C. with the Senate Health,
      Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where Sanders is the ranking member,
      at 12:30 pm Eastern time. It will be available via livestream on Sanders’ social
      media accounts. “We need the best education system in the world, and that means
      we need the best teachers,” said Sanders ahead of the event. “To get the best
      teachers, we need to pay them what they deserve.” Pew reported that while younger
      and less experienced teachers are more likely to hold nonteaching jobs during
      the summer months, teachers with the least amount of experience are about as likely
      as teachers who have been working for many years to take on extra jobs during
      the school year. A 2023 Pew poll found that 51% of public school K-12 teachers
      reported they were not very or not at all satisfied with their pay, and another
      survey that same year showed 74% of U.S. adults believed teachers should be paid
      more—including close to 40% who said they should be paid a lot more. The town
      hall is being held days after several school districts and teachers unions filed
      a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its freezing of funds for programs
      for low-income students, students who are learning English in school, after-school
      programs, and teacher development. The plaintiffs argue the withholding of the
      funds violates the Impoundment Control Act, which bars presidents from stopping
      the disbursement of funds that have been appropriated by Congress, and warn that
      the funding freeze could force school districts to lay off teachers and staff
      and reduce programming. “From day one, the Trump administration has attacked public
      education,” said American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, who
      is set to speak at Sanders’ town hall. “We won’t let this administration defund
      our kids’ futures.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of

      By Juan Cole / TomDispatch The United States has focused on the Middle East since
      World War II, seeking its oil, gas, and other mineral resources and coveting control
      of its strategic waterways. The old colonial powers and the superpowers of the
      Cold War era most often backed dictatorial regimes there, because they were easier
      to control than democracies, and this country also supported the Israeli settler
      colony as a bulwark of Western interests. President George W. Bush was the first
      president to depart (at least rhetorically) from America’s romance with regional
      authoritarians, pledging to “democratize” the Middle East, though he left office
      with little to show for it. Now, you have to wonder whether, in some strange sense,
      the shoe is on the other foot and the pathological U.S. support for dictatorships
      there is now spreading across the Atlantic Ocean, just as the trade winds blow
      Saharan sand and dust toward the American Southwest. Democratic Backsliding Here’s
      something that should sound familiar in the United States today: Qais Saied of
      Tunisia, elected president in 2019, campaigned against homosexuality and — yes!
      — African immigrants. In 2021, he lawlessly dismissed his prime minister and parliament
      and went on to rewrite the country’s constitution so that he could appoint yes-men
      to its Supreme Court. Then he began jailing his political opponents. In four short
      years, Saied undid all the political progress Tunisia had made in the previous
      decade, creating a dictatorship arguably worse than that of Zine El Abidine Ben
      Ali, who was overthrown in January 2011 in the first of several major Arab Spring
      youth revolts. Worse yet — and this should sound familiar, too — Tunisia seemed
      to sleepwalk into authoritarianism. Trade unionists hoped the president would
      reject the neoliberalism of the International Monetary Fund, while civil society
      organizations hoped he would curb the Interior Ministry’s past repressiveness.
      No such luck. Europe declined to punish the newly developing dictatorship by cutting
      off aid, instead rewarding Saied with an economic deal in return for his willingness
      to crack down on African emigration. Of course, such democratic backsliding has
      been a feature of the Middle East for decades, since local civil society remains
      weak, pro-regime billionaires have proliferated, and Western governments have
      seldom reacted negatively to (and all too often rewarded) any move toward dictatorship.
      Now, you might say that the shoe is on the other foot. What Saied did to Tunisia
      might as well have been a blueprint for Donald Trump. Although he hasn’t yet actually
      tried to rewrite the constitution, the MAGA leader has been the beneficiary of
      a decades-long $250 million dark-money plot , led by obscure Federalist Society
      apparatchik Leonard Leo, to reshape the Supreme Court. The result: a set of justices
      who are distinctly inclined to let Trump do his damnedest — even expel undocumented
      residents of the United States to gulags in third-world countries with no court
      process. Meanwhile, labor union members have too often placed faith in Trump’s
      pledges to bring back industry by using tariffs to reduce competition. And the
      centrists of the Democratic Party are the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights, too
      paralyzed to react effectively as he transforms this country into an ever more
      autocratic state. They also seem all too inclined to let our democracy slip away,
      while placing their hopes in a 2026 congressional blue wave that, even if it happens,
      may be too late to stop Trump from creating his version of a one-party state.
      Raw Milk and Vitamin A Consider it typical of our times that Field Marshall Abdelfattah
      al-Sisi’s 2013 coup against the only freely elected Egyptian government since
      the country’s monarchy was toppled in 1952 had no significant adverse consequences
      in Washington. In 2014, a leading officer in the Egyptian army, which receives
      $1.3 billion a year in American aid, made quixotic health claims. Major General
      Ibrahim Abdel-Atti announced that he had personally “defeated AIDS with the grace
      of my God at the rate of 100%. And I defeated hepatitis C.”  In the process, he
      confused the foundational nucleic acids DNA and RNA, provoking one Egyptian comedian
      to suggest that the country’s medical schools should never again accept anyone
      from Abdel-Atti’s village. However, the North Korean-like pall that has blanketed
      freedom of speech in Egypt was precisely what permitted such bizarre official
      behavior, since there was little way for the public to respond to even his most
      absurd claims. Yet, imagine this: Abdel-Atti appears almost sane and sober in
      comparison with the antics of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert
      F. Kennedy, Jr., who has discouraged vaccinations even as a measles outbreak has
      begun to run wild (and prove fatal in a few cases) 25 years after the U.S. officially
      eliminated the disease. Kennedy’s proposed treatment for measles?  Raw milk and
      vitamin A. Sadly, overdoses of the latter have caused liver disease in some children.
      Kennedy is also working hard to gut the Department of Health and Human Services
      and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The damage he’s doing in the
      Trump era to America’s vital and effective vaccination infrastructure could unleash
      serial plagues upon the public. And it’s not likely to get better any time soon,
      given the irrational demagogue now in the White House, just as Egyptians suffer
      under megalomaniacal generals. A Kafala System And here’s another Middle Eastern
      peculiarity inherited from Western colonialism that will sound all too familiar
      in Donald Trump’s America: the large numbers of non-citizens and stateless people
      who suffer from a lack of basic civil and human rights. In the nineteenth and
      early twentieth centuries, imperial Great Britain made treaties with small sheikhdoms
      along the coast of the Persian Gulf to ensure the security of its shipping and
      check rivals like the Ottoman Empire. When the British finally withdrew completely
      from the Gulf in 1972, they left behind postage-stamp countries with vast oil
      and gas wealth, which did not have a sufficient native-born population to work
      the rigs or staff the energy companies. The British Empire had often brought into
      its colonies, like Kuwait and Bahrain, subjects from British India. After decolonization,
      such workers from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were coded as foreigners in
      the Arab Gulf. They began laboring under a “guarantor” ( kafala ) system in which
      a local entrepreneur would take responsibility for migrant laborers who often
      surrendered their passports to him for as long as they were in the country. The
      guarantor would then take a cut of their wages or business profits. No matter
      how long such migrants lived in those countries, they and their children almost
      never became eligible for citizenship, and they could have their visas revoked
      at any time. Others now have trouble even getting in. Typically, the United Arab
      Emirates (UAE) in January announced a ban on visas (for Afghans, Libyans, Yemenis,
      Somalians, Lebanese, Bangladeshi, Cameroonians, Sudanis, and Ugandans). And that
      should sound familiar, since the Trump regime has already implemented a visa ban
      on 19 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries. In short, the policies toward
      immigrant labor in the two regions seem to be converging. Countries like the United
      Arab Emirates have a little more than a million citizens and 10 million mostly
      South Asian guest workers, some of whom have lived there all their lives or are
      even second or third generation residents. Such migrant workers , however, have
      no right to form unions or strike. Any encounter with law enforcement, even a
      fender-bender, can result in their expulsion. New York University Professor Andrew
      Ross was typically banned from the country simply for researching labor conditions.
      British academic Matthew Hedges was imprisoned on false espionage charges in 2018,
      tortured, and threatened with deportation to a UAE black site in Yemen before
      ultimately being released. New York University has a branch in Abu Dhabi, where
      the students and faculty have had run-ins with the government of President Mohammed
      Bin Zayed, which surged in the past two years because the country does not permit
      social media posts criticizing Israel’s atrocities in Gaza. And it’s not only
      migrant laborers in the Middle East who can be denied citizenship despite long
      residence. Indigenous people, too, sometimes become non-citizens (just as Native
      Americans were denied U.S. citizenship until 1924 ). The Arab nationalists of
      Syria denaturalized some 100,000 Kurdish Syrians in Hasakah Province in 1962 and,
      over time, that figure grew to several hundred thousand. The Middle East is a
      patchwork of citizenship hierarchies, where the line can be drawn capriciously
      by nationalists, fundamentalists, or monarchs. It does not take much familiarity
      with Donald Trump’s policies in the past six months to see the ways in which his
      administration seemingly yearns for similar levels of citizenship and limited
      residency to be imposed in this country. He has even threatened to deport naturalized
      American citizens like (can you believe it?) Elon Musk or Zohran Mamdani, the
      Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, for their criticisms of him.
      If his fondest wishes were fulfilled, he might even prefer his country to be more
      like Israel when it came to anyone he didn’t like living there. Expelled for Gandhism
      An analogy could also be made between the “foreign” migrant workers in the Gulf,
      who have no local citizenship or rights, and the Palestinians under Israeli rule
      in the West Bank or Gaza. Like the Syrian Kurds of Hasakah, they have been made
      stateless in their own country. They lack a national government and the rights
      and passport it would give them. Palestinians in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank
      that is directly ruled by the Israeli military, see rights like unionizing or
      striking routinely curbed . Like Gulf workers, Palestinians are subject to expulsion
      at the whim of the Israeli military. And keep in mind that, when Israel seized
      the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, some 300,000 Palestinians were expelled from it
      or, if working abroad, forbidden to return home. Some of those trapped by the
      decades-long occupation have also been subject to arbitrary removal. The Israeli
      authorities illegally expelled Palestinian pacifist Mubarak Awad from his homeland
      in 1988 for advocating Gandhi-style nonviolent noncooperation. Tens of thousands
      of West Bank Palestinians have been forced from their homes in the past two years,
      as entire refugee camps have been razed, the Israeli military has destroyed homes,
      and Israeli squatters on Palestinian land have enacted pogroms.& Since the Hamas
      assault on Israel in October 2023, at least 100,000 Gazans have been forced out
      of Palestine entirely by Israeli commanders, who have ordered that some 90% of
      the housing stock there be damaged or destroyed. Inside the Jewish ethnostate
      of Israel, the 21% of the population who are of Palestinian heritage are distinctly
      second-class citizens. Human Rights Organizations like Adalah have identified
      65 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian-Israelis. In 2018, the Israeli
      parliament declared that national sovereignty is invested solely in the country’s
      Jews. Since October 2023, Palestinian-Israelis have been under strict surveillance
      and have to be careful about their Internet postings. The Israeli Supreme Court
      ruled in 2022 that they can be stripped of their citizenship and expelled for
      breach of loyalty to the Israeli state. SEVIS Hits Like the rulers of some Gulf
      states, Trump and his crew want to treat all noncitizens on visas in the U.S.
      — and even some naturalized citizens — arbitrarily . Since he returned to power
      in January, thousands of visas have been revoked for even minor contact with law
      enforcement, just as happens to hapless migrants in the UAE. Trump officials ran
      the data in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) against
      police reports and zeroed in on 6,400 of them, terminating their SEVIS entries
      without notice. That was, of course, in contravention of government regulations.
      Most of the hits involved cases where charges had been dropped or were minor.
      Affected students filed more than 60 lawsuits and consistently prevailed in court,
      forcing ICE to restore the SEVIS records, at least for now. In addition, Trump
      and Secretary of State Marco Rubio attempted to revoke the visas of students who
      had been active in protests against the Israeli genocide in Gaza (in precisely
      the same way and on the same grounds as the Emirati government does). Among such
      high-profile cases, the State Department targeted figures like Columbia University
      graduate and pro-Palestinian protester Mahmoud Khalil, who had permanent resident
      status in the country but was arrested anyway and sent to a Louisiana prison.
      Tufts graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk, who had written a mild opinion piece for
      her student newspaper criticizing her school’s response to events in Gaza, was
      similarly seized. Apparently, the plan was to avoid letting them appear before
      a judge and instead summarily deport them, but the courts insisted they be given
      hearings, upholding the apparently imperiled principle of habeas corpus . Chapters
      of the American Association of University Professors, along with the Middle East
      Studies Association, have sued on First Amendment grounds to overturn Rubio’s
      policy of declaring speech to be a national security emergency, permitting the
      deportation of visa and green card holders. In 1945, the case of Bridges v. Wixon
      established that not just citizens but all people residing in the United States
      enjoy the protection of the Bill of Rights. As the Cold War heated up in the 1950s,
      however, the court did allow a few deportations of non-citizens due to their membership
      in the Communist Party (as in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy in 1952). Eighty years
      later, in a distinctly new world, Rubio and his colleagues wish to reverse Bridges
      and make the U.S. a giant version of the United Arab Emirates, functionally an
      absolute (Trumpian) monarchy . Instead of emulating the best of Middle Eastern
      values such as generosity to guests and love of learning, Trump and crew seem
      to admire only Western-imposed authoritarianism. Ironically, in the second Trump
      era, America’s billionaires and corporate elites have decided that this country
      should be ruled with some of the same techniques that they and their Middle Eastern
      proxies have long used abroad. Instead of America democratizing the Middle East,
      it’s increasingly clear that Trump and crew have decided to Middle-Easternize
      the United States. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of

      off aid, instead rewarding Saied with an economic deal in return for his willingness
      to crack down on African emigration. Of course, such democratic backsliding has
      been a feature of the Middle East for decades, since local civil society remains
      weak, pro-regime billionaires have proliferated, and Western governments have
      seldom reacted negatively to (and all too often rewarded) any move toward dictatorship.
      Now, you might say that the shoe is on the other foot. What Saied did to Tunisia
      might as well have been a blueprint for Donald Trump. Although he hasn’t yet actually
      tried to rewrite the constitution, the MAGA leader has been the beneficiary of
      a decades-long $250 million dark-money plot , led by obscure Federalist Society
      apparatchik Leonard Leo, to reshape the Supreme Court. The result: a set of justices
      who are distinctly inclined to let Trump do his damnedest — even expel undocumented
      residents of the United States to gulags in third-world countries with no court
      process. Meanwhile, labor union members have too often placed faith in Trump’s
      pledges to bring back industry by using tariffs to reduce competition. And the
      centrists of the Democratic Party are the proverbial deer-in-the-headlights, too
      paralyzed to react effectively as he transforms this country into an ever more
      autocratic state. They also seem all too inclined to let our democracy slip away,
      while placing their hopes in a 2026 congressional blue wave that, even if it happens,
      may be too late to stop Trump from creating his version of a one-party state.
      Raw Milk and Vitamin A Consider it typical of our times that Field Marshall Abdelfattah
      al-Sisi’s 2013 coup against the only freely elected Egyptian government since
      the country’s monarchy was toppled in 1952 had no significant adverse consequences
      in Washington. In 2014, a leading officer in the Egyptian army, which receives
      $1.3 billion a year in American aid, made quixotic health claims. Major General
      Ibrahim Abdel-Atti announced that he had personally “defeated AIDS with the grace
      of my God at the rate of 100%. And I defeated hepatitis C.”  In the process, he
      confused the foundational nucleic acids DNA and RNA, provoking one Egyptian comedian
      to suggest that the country’s medical schools should never again accept anyone
      from Abdel-Atti’s village. However, the North Korean-like pall that has blanketed
      freedom of speech in Egypt was precisely what permitted such bizarre official
      behavior, since there was little way for the public to respond to even his most
      absurd claims. Yet, imagine this: Abdel-Atti appears almost sane and sober in
      comparison with the antics of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert
      F. Kennedy, Jr., who has discouraged vaccinations even as a measles outbreak has
      begun to run wild (and prove fatal in a few cases) 25 years after the U.S. officially
      eliminated the disease. Kennedy’s proposed treatment for measles?  Raw milk and
      vitamin A. Sadly, overdoses of the latter have caused liver disease in some children.
      Kennedy is also working hard to gut the Department of Health and Human Services
      and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The damage he’s doing in the
      Trump era to America’s vital and effective vaccination infrastructure could unleash
      serial plagues upon the public. And it’s not likely to get better any time soon,
      given the irrational demagogue now in the White House, just as Egyptians suffer
      under megalomaniacal generals. A Kafala System And here’s another Middle Eastern
      peculiarity inherited from Western colonialism that will sound all too familiar
      in Donald Trump’s America: the large numbers of non-citizens and stateless people
      who suffer from a lack of basic civil and human rights. In the nineteenth and
      early twentieth centuries, imperial Great Britain made treaties with small sheikhdoms
      along the coast of the Persian Gulf to ensure the security of its shipping and
      check rivals like the Ottoman Empire. When the British finally withdrew completely
      from the Gulf in 1972, they left behind postage-stamp countries with vast oil
      and gas wealth, which did not have a sufficient native-born population to work
      the rigs or staff the energy companies. The British Empire had often brought into
      its colonies, like Kuwait and Bahrain, subjects from British India. After decolonization,
      such workers from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were coded as foreigners in
      the Arab Gulf. They began laboring under a “guarantor” ( kafala ) system in which
      a local entrepreneur would take responsibility for migrant laborers who often
      surrendered their passports to him for as long as they were in the country. The
      guarantor would then take a cut of their wages or business profits. No matter
      how long such migrants lived in those countries, they and their children almost
      never became eligible for citizenship, and they could have their visas revoked
      at any time. Others now have trouble even getting in. Typically, the United Arab
      Emirates (UAE) in January announced a ban on visas (for Afghans, Libyans, Yemenis,
      Somalians, Lebanese, Bangladeshi, Cameroonians, Sudanis, and Ugandans). And that
      should sound familiar, since the Trump regime has already implemented a visa ban
      on 19 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries. In short, the policies toward
      immigrant labor in the two regions seem to be converging. Countries like the United
      Arab Emirates have a little more than a million citizens and 10 million mostly
      South Asian guest workers, some of whom have lived there all their lives or are
      even second or third generation residents. Such migrant workers , however, have
      no right to form unions or strike. Any encounter with law enforcement, even a
      fender-bender, can result in their expulsion. New York University Professor Andrew
      Ross was typically banned from the country simply for researching labor conditions.
      British academic Matthew Hedges was imprisoned on false espionage charges in 2018,
      tortured, and threatened with deportation to a UAE black site in Yemen before
      ultimately being released. New York University has a branch in Abu Dhabi, where
      the students and faculty have had run-ins with the government of President Mohammed
      Bin Zayed, which surged in the past two years because the country does not permit
      social media posts criticizing Israel’s atrocities in Gaza. And it’s not only
      migrant laborers in the Middle East who can be denied citizenship despite long
      residence. Indigenous people, too, sometimes become non-citizens (just as Native
      Americans were denied U.S. citizenship until 1924 ). The Arab nationalists of
      Syria denaturalized some 100,000 Kurdish Syrians in Hasakah Province in 1962 and,
      over time, that figure grew to several hundred thousand. The Middle East is a
      patchwork of citizenship hierarchies, where the line can be drawn capriciously
      by nationalists, fundamentalists, or monarchs. It does not take much familiarity
      with Donald Trump’s policies in the past six months to see the ways in which his
      administration seemingly yearns for similar levels of citizenship and limited
      residency to be imposed in this country. He has even threatened to deport naturalized
      American citizens like (can you believe it?) Elon Musk or Zohran Mamdani, the
      Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, for their criticisms of him.
      If his fondest wishes were fulfilled, he might even prefer his country to be more
      like Israel when it came to anyone he didn’t like living there. Expelled for Gandhism
      An analogy could also be made between the “foreign” migrant workers in the Gulf,
      who have no local citizenship or rights, and the Palestinians under Israeli rule
      in the West Bank or Gaza. Like the Syrian Kurds of Hasakah, they have been made
      stateless in their own country. They lack a national government and the rights
      and passport it would give them. Palestinians in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank
      that is directly ruled by the Israeli military, see rights like unionizing or
      striking routinely curbed . Like Gulf workers, Palestinians are subject to expulsion
      at the whim of the Israeli military. And keep in mind that, when Israel seized
      the West Bank and Gaza in 1967, some 300,000 Palestinians were expelled from it
      or, if working abroad, forbidden to return home. Some of those trapped by the
      decades-long occupation have also been subject to arbitrary removal. The Israeli
      authorities illegally expelled Palestinian pacifist Mubarak Awad from his homeland
      in 1988 for advocating Gandhi-style nonviolent noncooperation. Tens of thousands
      of West Bank Palestinians have been forced from their homes in the past two years,
      as entire refugee camps have been razed, the Israeli military has destroyed homes,
      and Israeli squatters on Palestinian land have enacted pogroms.& Since the Hamas
      assault on Israel in October 2023, at least 100,000 Gazans have been forced out
      of Palestine entirely by Israeli commanders, who have ordered that some 90% of
      the housing stock there be damaged or destroyed. Inside the Jewish ethnostate
      of Israel, the 21% of the population who are of Palestinian heritage are distinctly
      second-class citizens. Human Rights Organizations like Adalah have identified
      65 Israeli laws that discriminate against Palestinian-Israelis. In 2018, the Israeli
      parliament declared that national sovereignty is invested solely in the country’s
      Jews. Since October 2023, Palestinian-Israelis have been under strict surveillance
      and have to be careful about their Internet postings. The Israeli Supreme Court
      ruled in 2022 that they can be stripped of their citizenship and expelled for
      breach of loyalty to the Israeli state. SEVIS Hits Like the rulers of some Gulf
      states, Trump and his crew want to treat all noncitizens on visas in the U.S.
      — and even some naturalized citizens — arbitrarily . Since he returned to power
      in January, thousands of visas have been revoked for even minor contact with law
      enforcement, just as happens to hapless migrants in the UAE. Trump officials ran
      the data in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) against
      police reports and zeroed in on 6,400 of them, terminating their SEVIS entries
      without notice. That was, of course, in contravention of government regulations.
      Most of the hits involved cases where charges had been dropped or were minor.
      Affected students filed more than 60 lawsuits and consistently prevailed in court,
      forcing ICE to restore the SEVIS records, at least for now. In addition, Trump
      and Secretary of State Marco Rubio attempted to revoke the visas of students who
      had been active in protests against the Israeli genocide in Gaza (in precisely
      the same way and on the same grounds as the Emirati government does). Among such
      high-profile cases, the State Department targeted figures like Columbia University
      graduate and pro-Palestinian protester Mahmoud Khalil, who had permanent resident
      status in the country but was arrested anyway and sent to a Louisiana prison.
      Tufts graduate student Rümeysa Öztürk, who had written a mild opinion piece for
      her student newspaper criticizing her school’s response to events in Gaza, was
      similarly seized. Apparently, the plan was to avoid letting them appear before
      a judge and instead summarily deport them, but the courts insisted they be given
      hearings, upholding the apparently imperiled principle of habeas corpus . Chapters
      of the American Association of University Professors, along with the Middle East
      Studies Association, have sued on First Amendment grounds to overturn Rubio’s
      policy of declaring speech to be a national security emergency, permitting the
      deportation of visa and green card holders. In 1945, the case of Bridges v. Wixon
      established that not just citizens but all people residing in the United States
      enjoy the protection of the Bill of Rights. As the Cold War heated up in the 1950s,
      however, the court did allow a few deportations of non-citizens due to their membership
      in the Communist Party (as in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy in 1952). Eighty years
      later, in a distinctly new world, Rubio and his colleagues wish to reverse Bridges
      and make the U.S. a giant version of the United Arab Emirates, functionally an
      absolute (Trumpian) monarchy . Instead of emulating the best of Middle Eastern
      values such as generosity to guests and love of learning, Trump and crew seem
      to admire only Western-imposed authoritarianism. Ironically, in the second Trump
      era, America’s billionaires and corporate elites have decided that this country
      should be ruled with some of the same techniques that they and their Middle Eastern
      proxies have long used abroad. Instead of America democratizing the Middle East,
      it’s increasingly clear that Trump and crew have decided to Middle-Easternize
      the United States. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of

    paragraph_summary: The article by Juan Cole discusses the historical and ongoing
      U.S. involvement in the Middle East, highlighting its focus on securing resources
      and supporting authoritarian regimes for strategic interests. It reflects on the
      shift initiated by President George W. Bush, who aimed to promote democracy in

      need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Ari Paul / Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) The media production
      company Skydance is acquiring Paramount Global . The deal may be thought largely
      to be an entertainment merger, as Paramount owns Comedy Central , MTV , BET ,
      Nickelodeon , Showtime and the Paramount film studio. But Paramount owns broadcast
      network CBS and its news programming, which means that the deal has enormous implications
      for journalism—particularly given that it requires federal approval . The coast
      certainly seems clear for the merger at this point: Paramount has settled what
      is widely regarded as a frivolous lawsuit from President Donald Trump for $16
      million over a CBS 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris; it has also canceled
      its highly successful and long-running Late Show With Stephen Colbert , whose
      host was critical of the settlement. Meanwhile, Paramount ‘s soon-to-be-owner
      has met with “anti-woke” crusader Bari Weiss about a potential partnership with
      CBS . Trump has used his institutional power to attack media he dislikes such
      as ABC and CBS , as well as to defund liberal-leaning public broadcasters NPR
      and PBS ( FAIR.org , 4/25/25 ; Variety , 7/18/25 ; USA Today , 7/18/25 ). Late
      last year, Disney settled a similarly ludicrous Trump lawsuit over ABC ‘s election
      coverage ( FAIR.org , 12/16/24 ). Trump has also used his power to take control
      of government broadcaster Voice of America , once a Cold War propaganda tool for
      US power projection abroad, and fill it with content from One America News Network
      ( AP , 5/7/25 ), a pro-Trump outlet FAIR founder Jeff Cohen once said “makes Fox
      News sound like Democracy Now! ” ( FAIR.org , 10/15/21 ). The latest moves from
      CBS ‘s owners mark the latest seismic shift to the right in the US media landscape.
      Paramount kisses the ring The lawsuit that Paramount settled to pave the way for
      the deal preposterously claimed that an interview with Democratic presidential
      candidate Kamala Harris on the CBS show 60 Minutes was deceptively edited to favor
      her over Trump ( BBC , 7/2/25 ). Anyone who cares about journalism or media freedom
      would have rooted for Paramount and CBS to fight the lawsuit, but Paramount ‘s
      leading stockholder, Shari Redstone, apparently saw the settlement as a small
      price to keep Trump’s Federal Communications Commission from standing in the way
      of the lucrative sale. (Trump claims that the combined company has also agreed
      to air $16 million more in PSAs, described as messages that will “support conservative
      causes supported by President Trump,” as part of the settlement, though Paramount
      denies such a side agreement exists —Variety , 7/4/25 ). The settlement has been
      “broadly criticized as capitulation” by CBS staffers ( Vanity Fair , 7/2/25 ).
      Reuters ( 7/2/25 ) reported that one 60 Minutes source said newsroom staff expressed
      ‘widespread distress’ about the settlement and concerns about the future of the
      CBS News prime time news magazine and its hard-hitting brand of journalism. A
      filing with the FCC ( Deadline , 7/18/25 ) suggested that an upcoming shift in
      CBS ’s news coverage was part of the deal to get the acquisition approved. It
      said that Skydance and FCC officials had “discussed Skydance ’s commitment to
      unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will
      ensure CBS ’s editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives
      of American viewers.” Presumably those “varied ideological perspectives” will
      not include those offensive to Trump, since airing those resulted in Paramount
      paying a multi-million-dollar settlement. As I previously wrote ( FAIR.org , 2/26/25
      ), FCC chair Brendan Carr is a lieutenant in the MAGA movement, and wrote the
      FCC section for Project 2025 , the right-wing policy roadmap for the second Trump
      administration . While vowing to reduce regulation, he has shown no qualms about
      using state power to impose ideological limits on broadcast news. Paramount also
      promised to install an ombud who would investigate “any complaints of bias or
      other concerns” at CBS News , and to eliminate all diversity, equity and inclusion
      programs ( Wrap , 7/23/25 ). ‘Sacrificing free speech to curry favor’ As the deal
      approached, it became clear that CBS ’s ability to operate as a fair news provider
      was slipping, as Bill Owens, the executive producer of 60 Minutes , “announced
      his resignation, saying he can no longer make independent journalism decisions
      for the program” ( NPR , 4/23/25 ). With Colbert’s termination, it’s unclear whether
      any part of the new Skydance empire will escape ideological purification. CBS
      ‘s announcement that it would cancel the Late Show With Stephen Colbert has been
      read as a muzzling of a prominent critic, not just of Trump, but of the Paramount
      settlement. The Writers Guild of America East ( 7/18/25 ) spelled out the authoritarian
      moment plainly: On July 15, during a regular show of the Late Show With Stephen
      Colbert , Colbert went on-air and called the settlement a “big fat bribe” in exchange
      for a favorable decision on the proposed merger between Paramount and Skydance
      , a charge currently under investigation in California. Less than 48 hours later,
      on July 17, Paramount canceled the Late Show With Stephen Colbert , a show currently
      performing first in its timeslot, giving vague references to the program’s “financial
      performance” as the only explanation. For ten years, the show has been one of
      the most successful, beloved and profitable programs on CBS , entertaining an
      audience of millions on late night television, on streaming services and across
      social media. Given Paramount ’s recent capitulation to President Trump in the
      CBS News lawsuit, the Writers Guild of America has significant concerns that the
      Late Show ’s cancellation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with
      the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval. In its first
      new episode in over a year, the Comedy Central flagship animated comedy South
      Park (7/23/25), often embraced by conservatives for its eagerness to offend liberals,
      attacked both Trump and the channel’s owner Paramount. In its raunchy style, USA
      Today ( 7/24/25 ) reported, it “referenced everything from the company’s controversial
      settlement with the president to its shock decision to cancel the Late Show With
      Stephen Colbert .” Show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had previously commented
      on X ( 7/2/25 ), “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park .”
      It remains to be seen whether the thin-skinned Trump White House will hold up
      the acquisition in retaliation for the satire. Trump’s ‘favorite tech company’
      There are indications that more ideological restructuring at the network is on
      its way. CNN ( 7/11/25 ) reported that “ Paramount ’s owner-in-waiting, David
      Ellison, met with journalist entrepreneur Bari Weiss…about a possible tie-up between
      CBS News and her startup the Free Press. ” The report added that “Ellison is said
      to be interested in infusing Weiss’s editorial perspective into CBS News .” For
      those who are unfamiliar with Weiss, she is a former New York Times editor and
      writer who gained fame for attacking “wokeness” ( Commentary , 11/21 )—which for
      the right is any politics that seeks to address racial and gender inequalities—and
      her advocacy for Israel and against critics of its government ( Intercept , 3/8/18
      ). While David Ellison donated to former President Joe Biden’s reelection efforts
      ( CNBC , 4/16/24 ) and other Democratic campaigns , the political commitments
      of his father Larry Ellison may be more relevant. Larry is the co-founder of the
      software giant Oracle and, according to the Forbes 400 list, the fourth-richest
      person in the United States, behind Meta ‘s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon ‘s Jeff Bezos
      and X ‘s Elon Musk. As the New York Times ( 4/2/25 ) noted, Larry “is putting
      up most of the $8 billion bid by his son, David, to buy Paramount .” The elder
      Ellison is well-known for his contributions to conservative causes ( Vox , 2/12/20
      ; Washington Post , 5/20/22 ). He gave $4 million to a super PAC supporting Marco
      Rubio’s presidential bid ( Politico , 2/20/16 ), and $15 million to one backing
      Sen. Tim Scott (R–S.C.) ( Politico , 2/19/22 ). Slate ( 9/14/20 ) called Oracle
      the “Trump Administration’s Favorite Tech Company,” as evidenced by the fact that
      Trump picked Oracle to potentially “partner” with TikTok , giving the Chinese-owned
      social media company a reliable ideological watchdog in order to avoid a congressionally
      mandated ban ( FAIR.org , 12/6/24 ). Shared ‘Zionist values’ One thing the Ellisons
      agree on is wholehearted support for Zionism. In 2017, Larry Ellison gave $16.6
      million to the Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces ( Jewish Telegraphic Agency
      , 11/5/17 ). Two years ago, the Hollywood Reporter ( 10/13/23 ) reported that
      “ Skydance Media , led by David Ellison, has committed $1 million to humanitarian
      relief efforts in Israel” in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.  It
      quoted the company: Skydance stands with Israel, strongly condemns the attacks
      against its citizens, is donating support to the victims of this tragic act of
      terrorism, and prays for the safe release of innocents hostages. Last year, the
      Jerusalem Post ( 7/31/24 ) ran a story “written in cooperation with SkyDance ”
      that highlighted support for Israel by David Ellison and Redstone’s son, “Brandon
      Korff, heir to the Paramount empire.” The article quoted a “source familiar with
      the details” who described Ellison and Korff sharing “Zionist values” and noted
      that “both quietly donate quite a bit to the state of Israel and the IDF.” Redstone
      herself has been an outspoken Zionist during her time at the head of Paramount
      ; when CBS admonished host Tony Dokoupil for his hostile interview with author
      Ta-Nehisi Coates, in which Dokoupil suggested that Coates was an “extremist” on
      Palestine, Redstone publicly criticized network management ( LA Times , 10/9/24
      ). Given the talks with Weiss and the Free Press , one might expect CBS coverage
      to skew even further to the right on the Middle East, as well as on the Trump’s
      administration effort to clamp down on critical speech against Israel’s genocide
      and its support from the US. While Weiss’s brand is all about free speech, she
      got her start in politics agitating for the censorship of professors with pro-Palestinian
      views ( Jewish Currents , 7/23/20 ). Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

      entertainment to significantly impact journalism, as Paramount owns CBS and its
      news programming. The merger is expected to receive federal approval, especially
      after Paramount settled a lawsuit from Donald Trump related to a CBS interview
      with Kamala Harris, and canceled the popular "Late Show With Stephen Colbert,"
      whose host criticized the settlement. This acquisition raises concerns about media
      independence, particularly given Skydance's meetings with conservative figures
      like Bari Weiss and Trump's history of attacking media outlets and attempting
      to influence public broadcasting. The situation reflects broader tensions in the
      media landscape, where ownership and political affiliations may shape news coverage.

      , via Wikimedia Commons In one of the scariest moments in modern history, we''re
      doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we
      need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Ari Paul / Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) The media production
      company Skydance is acquiring Paramount Global . The deal may be thought largely
      to be an entertainment merger, as Paramount owns Comedy Central , MTV , BET ,
      Nickelodeon , Showtime and the Paramount film studio. But Paramount owns broadcast
      network CBS and its news programming, which means that the deal has enormous implications
      for journalism—particularly given that it requires federal approval . The coast
      certainly seems clear for the merger at this point: Paramount has settled what
      is widely regarded as a frivolous lawsuit from President Donald Trump for $16
      million over a CBS 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris; it has also canceled
      its highly successful and long-running Late Show With Stephen Colbert , whose
      host was critical of the settlement. Meanwhile, Paramount ‘s soon-to-be-owner
      has met with “anti-woke” crusader Bari Weiss about a potential partnership with
      CBS . Trump has used his institutional power to attack media he dislikes such
      as ABC and CBS , as well as to defund liberal-leaning public broadcasters NPR
      and PBS ( FAIR.org , 4/25/25 ; Variety , 7/18/25 ; USA Today , 7/18/25 ). Late
      last year, Disney settled a similarly ludicrous Trump lawsuit over ABC ‘s election
      coverage ( FAIR.org , 12/16/24 ). Trump has also used his power to take control
      of government broadcaster Voice of America , once a Cold War propaganda tool for
      US power projection abroad, and fill it with content from One America News Network
      ( AP , 5/7/25 ), a pro-Trump outlet FAIR founder Jeff Cohen once said “makes Fox
      News sound like Democracy Now! ” ( FAIR.org , 10/15/21 ). The latest moves from
      CBS ‘s owners mark the latest seismic shift to the right in the US media landscape.
      Paramount kisses the ring The lawsuit that Paramount settled to pave the way for
      the deal preposterously claimed that an interview with Democratic presidential
      candidate Kamala Harris on the CBS show 60 Minutes was deceptively edited to favor
      her over Trump ( BBC , 7/2/25 ). Anyone who cares about journalism or media freedom
      would have rooted for Paramount and CBS to fight the lawsuit, but Paramount ‘s
      leading stockholder, Shari Redstone, apparently saw the settlement as a small
      price to keep Trump’s Federal Communications Commission from standing in the way
      of the lucrative sale. (Trump claims that the combined company has also agreed
      to air $16 million more in PSAs, described as messages that will “support conservative
      causes supported by President Trump,” as part of the settlement, though Paramount
      denies such a side agreement exists —Variety , 7/4/25 ). The settlement has been
      “broadly criticized as capitulation” by CBS staffers ( Vanity Fair , 7/2/25 ).
      Reuters ( 7/2/25 ) reported that one 60 Minutes source said newsroom staff expressed
      ‘widespread distress’ about the settlement and concerns about the future of the
      CBS News prime time news magazine and its hard-hitting brand of journalism. A
      filing with the FCC ( Deadline , 7/18/25 ) suggested that an upcoming shift in
      CBS ’s news coverage was part of the deal to get the acquisition approved. It
      said that Skydance and FCC officials had “discussed Skydance ’s commitment to
      unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will
      ensure CBS ’s editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives
      of American viewers.” Presumably those “varied ideological perspectives” will
      not include those offensive to Trump, since airing those resulted in Paramount
      paying a multi-million-dollar settlement. As I previously wrote ( FAIR.org , 2/26/25
      ), FCC chair Brendan Carr is a lieutenant in the MAGA movement, and wrote the
      FCC section for Project 2025 , the right-wing policy roadmap for the second Trump
      administration . While vowing to reduce regulation, he has shown no qualms about
      using state power to impose ideological limits on broadcast news. Paramount also
      promised to install an ombud who would investigate “any complaints of bias or
      other concerns” at CBS News , and to eliminate all diversity, equity and inclusion
      programs ( Wrap , 7/23/25 ). ‘Sacrificing free speech to curry favor’ As the deal
      approached, it became clear that CBS ’s ability to operate as a fair news provider
      was slipping, as Bill Owens, the executive producer of 60 Minutes , “announced
      his resignation, saying he can no longer make independent journalism decisions
      for the program” ( NPR , 4/23/25 ). With Colbert’s termination, it’s unclear whether
      any part of the new Skydance empire will escape ideological purification. CBS
      ‘s announcement that it would cancel the Late Show With Stephen Colbert has been
      read as a muzzling of a prominent critic, not just of Trump, but of the Paramount
      settlement. The Writers Guild of America East ( 7/18/25 ) spelled out the authoritarian
      moment plainly: On July 15, during a regular show of the Late Show With Stephen
      Colbert , Colbert went on-air and called the settlement a “big fat bribe” in exchange
      for a favorable decision on the proposed merger between Paramount and Skydance
      , a charge currently under investigation in California. Less than 48 hours later,
      on July 17, Paramount canceled the Late Show With Stephen Colbert , a show currently
      performing first in its timeslot, giving vague references to the program’s “financial
      performance” as the only explanation. For ten years, the show has been one of
      the most successful, beloved and profitable programs on CBS , entertaining an
      audience of millions on late night television, on streaming services and across
      social media. Given Paramount ’s recent capitulation to President Trump in the
      CBS News lawsuit, the Writers Guild of America has significant concerns that the
      Late Show ’s cancellation is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with
      the Trump administration as the company looks for merger approval. In its first
      new episode in over a year, the Comedy Central flagship animated comedy South
      Park (7/23/25), often embraced by conservatives for its eagerness to offend liberals,
      attacked both Trump and the channel’s owner Paramount. In its raunchy style, USA
      Today ( 7/24/25 ) reported, it “referenced everything from the company’s controversial
      settlement with the president to its shock decision to cancel the Late Show With
      Stephen Colbert .” Show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had previously commented
      on X ( 7/2/25 ), “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park .”
      It remains to be seen whether the thin-skinned Trump White House will hold up
      the acquisition in retaliation for the satire. Trump’s ‘favorite tech company’
      There are indications that more ideological restructuring at the network is on
      its way. CNN ( 7/11/25 ) reported that “ Paramount ’s owner-in-waiting, David
      Ellison, met with journalist entrepreneur Bari Weiss…about a possible tie-up between
      CBS News and her startup the Free Press. ” The report added that “Ellison is said
      to be interested in infusing Weiss’s editorial perspective into CBS News .” For
      those who are unfamiliar with Weiss, she is a former New York Times editor and
      writer who gained fame for attacking “wokeness” ( Commentary , 11/21 )—which for
      the right is any politics that seeks to address racial and gender inequalities—and
      her advocacy for Israel and against critics of its government ( Intercept , 3/8/18
      ). While David Ellison donated to former President Joe Biden’s reelection efforts
      ( CNBC , 4/16/24 ) and other Democratic campaigns , the political commitments
      of his father Larry Ellison may be more relevant. Larry is the co-founder of the
      software giant Oracle and, according to the Forbes 400 list, the fourth-richest
      person in the United States, behind Meta ‘s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon ‘s Jeff Bezos
      and X ‘s Elon Musk. As the New York Times ( 4/2/25 ) noted, Larry “is putting
      up most of the $8 billion bid by his son, David, to buy Paramount .” The elder
      Ellison is well-known for his contributions to conservative causes ( Vox , 2/12/20
      ; Washington Post , 5/20/22 ). He gave $4 million to a super PAC supporting Marco
      Rubio’s presidential bid ( Politico , 2/20/16 ), and $15 million to one backing
      Sen. Tim Scott (R–S.C.) ( Politico , 2/19/22 ). Slate ( 9/14/20 ) called Oracle
      the “Trump Administration’s Favorite Tech Company,” as evidenced by the fact that
      Trump picked Oracle to potentially “partner” with TikTok , giving the Chinese-owned
      social media company a reliable ideological watchdog in order to avoid a congressionally
      mandated ban ( FAIR.org , 12/6/24 ). Shared ‘Zionist values’ One thing the Ellisons
      agree on is wholehearted support for Zionism. In 2017, Larry Ellison gave $16.6
      million to the Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces ( Jewish Telegraphic Agency
      , 11/5/17 ). Two years ago, the Hollywood Reporter ( 10/13/23 ) reported that
      “ Skydance Media , led by David Ellison, has committed $1 million to humanitarian
      relief efforts in Israel” in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.  It
      quoted the company: Skydance stands with Israel, strongly condemns the attacks
      against its citizens, is donating support to the victims of this tragic act of
      terrorism, and prays for the safe release of innocents hostages. Last year, the
      Jerusalem Post ( 7/31/24 ) ran a story “written in cooperation with SkyDance ”
      that highlighted support for Israel by David Ellison and Redstone’s son, “Brandon
      Korff, heir to the Paramount empire.” The article quoted a “source familiar with
      the details” who described Ellison and Korff sharing “Zionist values” and noted
      that “both quietly donate quite a bit to the state of Israel and the IDF.” Redstone
      herself has been an outspoken Zionist during her time at the head of Paramount
      ; when CBS admonished host Tony Dokoupil for his hostile interview with author
      Ta-Nehisi Coates, in which Dokoupil suggested that Coates was an “extremist” on
      Palestine, Redstone publicly criticized network management ( LA Times , 10/9/24
      ). Given the talks with Weiss and the Free Press , one might expect CBS coverage
      to skew even further to the right on the Middle East, as well as on the Trump’s
      administration effort to clamp down on critical speech against Israel’s genocide
      and its support from the US. While Weiss’s brand is all about free speech, she
      got her start in politics agitating for the censorship of professors with pro-Palestinian
      views ( Jewish Currents , 7/23/20 ). Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

    text: 'Image provided by Family of Dan Siegel By Mike Siegel / The Oakland Post
      After 52 years of civil rights litigation and 79 revolutions around the sun, my
      father Dan Siegel passed away on July 2, 2025. To the very end, he spent his time
      in struggle for a better world. Here in Oakland, the community knew Dan through
      his political and legal work. Born in the Bronx and raised in Long Island, he
      came to Berkeley in 1967 to study law and join the movement against the Vietnam
      War. Dan was inspired to become a lawyer after spending the summer of 1965 volunteering
      with the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) to register voters in North Carolina.
      When I was growing up, my dad told me stories about being threatened by local
      “good ole boys” and getting freed from jail by a National Lawyers Guild attorney.
      He was radicalized by the experience, and committed himself to being a part of
      the Civil Rights Movement. Dan’s time at UC Berkeley studying law set the stage
      for much of his life and career. In 1969, after being elected as Student Body
      President, he gave a key speech during a “People’s Park” protest that was followed
      by thousands of people marching from campus and confronting police and sheriff’s
      deputies. Governor Ronald Reagan called in the National Guard and numerous protestors
      were shot by police, including James Rector, a bystander who was killed. As a
      result of his role in the People’s Park protest, Dan was charged with inciting
      a riot. The charges were later dismissed, but after he graduated from law school,
      the California State Bar cited Dan’s protest activity as evidence that he lacked
      the “moral character” to become an attorney. He would have to sue the State Bar,
      going all the way up to the California Supreme Court, to win the right to practice
      law. His legal victory, in this first case of his career, established an enduring
      precedent – that protest activity cannot be used to disqualify a person from practicing
      law. With that starting point for his career, Dan spent the next five decades
      fighting for the underdog and taking on entrenched power. Much of his practice
      was focused on representing workers against abusive employers. He represented
      cannery workers in Watsonville, California and pipeline workers in Anchorage,
      Alaska. He counted numerous unions among his clients, including janitors and healthcare
      workers. Along with his wife (my mom) Anne Weills, they won major legal victories
      against numerous colleges and universities for unlawful employment practices,
      including claims for racial discrimination, sex discrimination, and retaliation
      against whistleblowers. Dan and Anne also took on cases relating to police brutality
      and civil rights. They were part of the movement to demand accountability for
      the murder of Oscar Grant by BART police in 2009, and represented the family of
      Alan Blueford, a Skyline High School student killed by Oakland police in 2012.
      They played a major role in litigation to limit the use of solitary confinement
      in California prisons, winning major decisions on behalf of maximum security prisoners
      at Pelican Bay and San Quentin. Truthfully, to recount all of the work my dad
      was a part of is impossible in the context of an obituary. Growing up with him,
      I saw how there were always clients to represent. We talked about their cases
      at the dinner table. Many became extensions of our family and community. In many
      instances, there was not a financial reason to take on these cases – Dan was representing
      people because it was the right thing to do, and because he could use his legal
      skills to help someone. There are other important chapters in Dan’s story, apart
      from the law. He spent two terms on the OUSD School Board, working to foster community-based
      schools. He served on the Oakland Housing Authority Board, an appointee of Mayor
      Elihu Harris. He volunteered for Mayor Jean Quan before the two split over the
      Occupy Oakland movement. He made himself available for a lot of people, and a
      lot of causes, across the East Bay. Dan was also a family man. In some ways, as
      you might imagine, having a dad who was so politically engaged and hard-working
      meant that he wasn’t home as much as we might like. But I will always remember
      the roles he played. Every night, just about, he cooked dinner for my mom, my
      brother and I, often going to elaborate efforts to prepare delicious food from
      various cuisines. He could make Italian food, Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian. My
      cousins praise his fried chicken to this day. There were many memorable meals
      at the house, with lively conversation. Dan also loved to travel. He and my mom
      took backpacking trips to Alaska, kayaking in remote national parks, and they
      also took two treks to the Himalayas. He took the whole family on trips, whether
      it was car camping in the earlier years or trips to Eastern Europe or Southeast
      Asia when us kids were more grown. And in every setting, he was disciplined and
      organized. Whether it was making a shopping list for a big meal, organizing all
      the camping gear for a five-night excursion, or preparing for a three week civil
      rights trial, he was always willing to do the work of planning and preparation.
      Until the end, that is. There’s no true plan or preparation for cancer. I think
      he was surprised, really, that he couldn’t defeat cancer by force of will. Just
      three weeks before his death, Dan gave a speech at the “No Kings” protest in Oakland,
      condemning Trump and his white supremacist backers. It took all his strength for
      the day, but he was committed to showing up and sharing some of his wisdom and
      analysis. I think that’s how he’d like to be remembered. As someone who showed
      up and gave everything he could for the cause of justice, right to the end. Posted

    paragraph_summary: over five decades advocating for civil rights and social justice,
      becoming a prominent figure in Oakland's legal and political landscape. His journey
      began in the Bronx and was shaped by his experiences during the Civil Rights Movement,
      particularly his work with CORE and his involvement in the anti-Vietnam War protests
      at UC Berkeley. Despite facing legal challenges, including being charged with
      inciting a riot during the People’s Park protests, Dan's determination led him
      to successfully challenge the California State Bar's decision to deny him a law
      license based on his activism. This landmark case not only allowed him to practice
      law but also set a significant precedent protecting the rights of activists. Throughout
      his life, Dan remained committed to fighting for a better world until his passing
      on July 2, 2025, at the age of 79.

      volunteered as an aid worker. “It has been an incredibly awful experience to see
      people sort of become sicker and sicker from hunger,” says Nessouli, who describes
      visiting community kitchens in Gaza that have run out of food. “Many of us would
      just have one meal a day,” he says of his seven weeks in Gaza. Now his colleagues
      who remain in Gaza “are having one meal every three days.” Transcript This is

      Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen
      Shaikh. NERMEEN SHAIKH: The BBC, Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse
      have called on Israel to allow journalists in and out of Gaza. In a statement
      , the news outlets said, quote, “We are desperately concerned for our journalists
      in Gaza, who are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families.” Well,
      our next guest, who joins us in our New York studio, was reporting in Gaza for
      seven weeks during his off hours as he also volunteered as an aid worker for the
      medical nonprofit Glia, which brings doctors, nurses and others into Gaza to support
      local healthcare workers. AMY GOODMAN: Afeef Nessouli is a journalist and host
      of With Afeef Nessouli . He’s reported from the Occupied Palestinian Territories
      since 2011. His most recent piece for The Intercept is headlined “Our Reporter
      Got Into Gaza. He Witnessed a Famine of Israel’s Making,” which he wrote with
      journalist and author Steven Thrasher. We last spoke to Afeef in January about
      their report headlined “Surviving War and HIV: Queer, HIV-Positive, and Running
      Out of Medication in Gaza.” Welcome back to Democracy Now! In June, when you left,
      you were in Deir al-Balah, which was packed with many thousands of displaced people.
      Can you talk about what you saw in Gaza? And talk especially about the community
      kitchens and hunger, starvation, people starving to death. AFEEF NESSOULI: Yeah.
      First of all, thank you so much for having me again. I went to Gaza because of
      that first report, and I was there from March 27th to June 3rd. I even lost about
      10 pounds to 12 pounds, because we were having one meal a day. There was rice,
      there was lentils, and sometimes we would have an errant can of tuna that we had
      brought and hadn’t passed out yet to people that were starving. Hunger is something
      that I don’t think any of us here can actually fathom. I think many — maybe many
      of us can in the United States, but most of us can’t. And that feeling was seeing
      people begging all of the time, no matter where you’re walking. If you have your NGO sort
      of paraphernalia on, people want to know if you have tahin , flour. And I speak
      Arabic, and my colleagues were mostly Gazawi, and we would just really appeal
      to them and say, “We really don’t have flour, actually. We’re also really hungry.”
      Many of us would just have one meal a day. Now I’m speaking to my colleagues who
      are having one meal every three days often. I worked at a Glia — AMY GOODMAN:
      And you’re talking about more than a month ago. AFEEF NESSOULI: Yeah, this is
      more than a month ago, right. The blockade started March 2nd. I got in March 27th.
      By then almost, people were already rationing food. We were really, really overly
      thinking about what was available and what would suddenly go away if we did too
      much, if we ate too much. I also volunteered at Shabab Gaza, which is a community
      kitchen. It was in — it’s sort of in collaboration with Glia, so a lot of us kind
      of do both. And at the start of this genocide, there were about 170 community
      kitchens. Two hundred and fifty thousand meals per day were being served. About
      45% of the population was being served. By the time I was leaving, Shabab Gaza,
      at least, went from 250,000 meals a day to 25,000. And now they’re not operating
      really at all. I think that they’re operating when they can, when some farmer
      or someone has potatoes. The last time I was there, on June 1st, they had a bunch
      of potatoes, and they were passing them out and preparing them. But that’s what
      they had. They had potatoes. So, it has been an incredibly awful experience to
      see people sort of become sicker and sicker from hunger. I even had an experience
      where I was sick because I just sort of had beets one day. And I don’t know, maybe
      I had some virus, and together, I couldn’t sort of hack it, and I became quite
      sick for about two or three days. So, it’s pervasive. If you’re a patient, you
      need protein to heal. I mean, so, if you have an explosive injury, and any injury
      that isn’t about malnutrition, malnutrition makes it way worse. And people now
      are going to the hospital because they’re malnourished. People are fainting regularly.
      I’m getting voice notes all the time from people who are just in hunger pain,
      which is hard to hear. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And explain the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,
      so many people being killed while they’re trying to access aid. What’s going on
      there? Were you in the vicinity of any of those aid sites while you were there?
      AFEEF NESSOULI: Yeah, so, they were announced on May 19th. On May 26th or 27th
      — I believe it was the 26th — was the first aid distribution. It was a disaster.
      I remember Al-Qarara and Khan Younis were really loud that day. The GHF has been,
      basically, the new sort of brainchild of the Israelis and the Americans. They
      kind of fight over who even created the idea. But, ultimately, there were 400
      aid sites around Gaza by the U.N.-backed system, and it’s been replaced by now
      just four. For a while, it was three. And many of them don’t always operate. Sometimes
      it’s security reasons. Sometimes it’s maintenance. They have a Facebook page people
      check. From my reporting and my experience, people are shot at, very regularly
      shot at. Doctors mention that the bullet holes seem targeted, like snipers, because
      they’re in certain spots in the back of the head. There’s people who are just
      simply trying to find food for their families, and they go in the middle of the
      night to start lining up. And this is for parcels that are about $1.30 in all,
      like medical supplies, you know, a food parcel, but all of it together is just
      $1.30. And the experience, from what I understand and what I experienced there,
      but it’s also been more developed since I’ve left, is that there’s thousands of
      people just disorganizedly just hoping to find something. And when you get something,
      it’s also pitting you against all of your neighbors, all of your family, because
      you’re the one who somehow picked up this bag of flour, and now you have to somehow
      justify that everyone around you doesn’t get to have that flour, just you. So,
      a lot of people are getting into, you know, sort of tension and fights with each
      other. So it’s just an incredibly chaotic, awful, basically, supplantation of
      what was there before, which was working. Albeit it had its own flaws, it was
      working. AMY GOODMAN: And you went in as a medical worker. You went in with a
      medical aid group and then wrote about your experience. AFEEF NESSOULI: Yeah,
      so, I went in with Glia. I think that it’s really important to realize that right
      now Palestinian journalists are suffering because of malnourishment. But for the
      last year and a half, two years, they’ve been on the frontlines. I don’t think
      that they necessarily needed me to go in as a journalist. What they needed was
      someone to help on the ground, which is what I did. And as part of Glia, I also
      documented, did a lot of interviews with doctors and nurses and sort of gleaned
      this information in retrospect and have a lot of sources there still. And we’ll
      hopefully go back. AMY GOODMAN: Afeef Nessouli, we want to thank you for being
      with us, just recently back from Gaza. We’ll link to your piece in The Intercept

      donation . By Dave DeCamp / Antiwar.com Four of the world’s major news agencies
      have issued a rare joint statement warning that their journalists in Gaza are
      unable to feed themselves due to the US-backed Israeli blockade, as Palestinians
      continue to starve to death under the siege. “We are desperately concerned for
      our journalists in Gaza, who are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their
      families,” AFP , The Associated Press , Reuters , and BBC News said. “For many
      months, these independent journalists have been the world’s eyes and ears on the
      ground in Gaza. They are now facing the same dire circumstances as those they
      are covering.” The news agencies said that journalists “endure many deprivations
      and hardships in war zones. We are deeply alarmed that the threat of starvation
      is now one of them.” They urged the “Israeli authorities to allow journalists
      in and out of Gaza” and said it was “essential that adequate food supplies reach
      the people there.” On top of the starvation, journalists in Gaza continue to be
      targeted by the IDF. On Wednesday, Walaa al-Jabari , who worked for local news
      outlets, was killed along with her husband and four children. Al-Jabari was pregnant
      at the time of her killing, and the Gaza Government Media Office said her death
      brought the total number of journalists killed by Israel since October 7, 2023,
      to 231. The statement from the news agencies came as Gaza’s Health Ministry said
      another two Palestinians had starved to death over the previous 24-hour period.
      Starvation deaths have spiked over the past week, with dozens, mostly children,
      dying of malnutrition due to Israeli-imposed restrictions and the killing of aid
      seekers. The Health Ministry said it has recorded a total of 113 starvation deaths
      . Palestinians in Gaza also continue to be gunned down while attempting to reach
      food aid. Since the end of May, more than 1,000 aid seekers have been killed by
      Israeli forces, mainly near distribution sites run by the US and Israeli-backed
      Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Sabreen Abu al-Kass, a mother of 10 in Gaza,
      told Al Jazeera on Thursday that she attempted to get aid from a GHF site on Thursday
      but failed. “I went to get food, to support my children, and I fainted there.
      No one helped me,” she said. “I couldn’t bring back any aid at all. We returned
      home empty-handed, just like we came. Out of maybe 50 attempts, I was only able
      to get some food once. One time, among thousands of women.” Editor’s Note : A

      have issued a rare joint statement warning that their journalists in Gaza are
      unable to feed themselves due to the US-backed Israeli blockade, as Palestinians
      continue to starve to death under the siege. “We are desperately concerned for
      our journalists in Gaza, who are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their
      families,” AFP , The Associated Press , Reuters , and BBC News said. “For many
      months, these independent journalists have been the world’s eyes and ears on the
      ground in Gaza. They are now facing the same dire circumstances as those they
      are covering.” The news agencies said that journalists “endure many deprivations
      and hardships in war zones. We are deeply alarmed that the threat of starvation
      is now one of them.” They urged the “Israeli authorities to allow journalists
      in and out of Gaza” and said it was “essential that adequate food supplies reach
      the people there.” On top of the starvation, journalists in Gaza continue to be
      targeted by the IDF. On Wednesday, Walaa al-Jabari , who worked for local news
      outlets, was killed along with her husband and four children. Al-Jabari was pregnant
      at the time of her killing, and the Gaza Government Media Office said her death
      brought the total number of journalists killed by Israel since October 7, 2023,
      to 231. The statement from the news agencies came as Gaza’s Health Ministry said
      another two Palestinians had starved to death over the previous 24-hour period.

      donation . By Ana Vračar / Peoples Dispatch In what could become a landmark ruling
      , a Belgian judge recently ordered the Flemish government to halt the transit
      of goods that could be used to continue or expand the genocide in Gaza. The decision
      follows a joint campaign by four organizations – Intal, Vredesactie (Peace Action),
      11.11.11, and the Human Rights League – which was triggered by the discovery of
      containers in the port of Antwerp addressed to Israeli company Ashot Ashkelon
      Industries. The containers included materials used for the assembly of Merkava
      tanks, the same model implicated in the attack that killed six-year-old Hind Rajab
      . The presence of these containers was brought to the attention of the organizations
      through links with investigative media outlets, Isabelle Vanbrabant, national
      coordinator of Intal, told Peoples Dispatch . Based on these alerts, Vredesactie
      initiated a formal inspection request and succeeded in detaining one container,
      though another was allowed to proceed. “We were doubtful about the effectiveness
      of a single inspection,” Vanbrabant says, noting activists feared the shipment
      might go unnoticed or that the inspection would impact only one case – despite
      knowing that Antwerp had previously been used to transport ammunition, and that
      similar cargo was en route aboard new vessels. “We formed a coalition and contacted
      a lawyer. We had a solid case, so we decided to push further,” Vanbrabant explains.
      What followed was a swift but well-prepared legal campaign, which moved beyond
      a single shipment to challenge the broader conduct of Flemish authorities regarding
      military and dual-use exports to Israel. “We chose to argue that this wasn’t about
      one container, but about a wider pattern of the government allowing such cargo
      to pass through,” she said. In a separate statement , Intal emphasized that facilitating
      the transit of military equipment to a country committing war crimes makes a government
      complicit. In this case, legal accountability involves both local and international
      law. Pledges made in 2009 explicitly state the region would not “issue arms export
      licenses that would strengthen the military capabilities of the warring parties”
      in occupied Palestine. Yet, as Vanbrabant describes, Flemish authorities have
      been, put mildly, pretty lax about implementing this line of policy towards Israel.
      “One of the key things this case proves is that having good-sounding legislation
      on paper isn’t enough,” she says. “You need to ensure it’s applied in practice,
      with proper oversight of the agencies involved.” Implications for ongoing and
      future campaigns While the judge criticized the government’s failure to follow
      domestic law, the ruling also leaned heavily on international legal standards.
      “That’s something new – and a very good development,” Vanbrabant stresses. “The
      government made no reference to international law. We did. This could set a real
      precedent for future arms transfer cases.” Activists praised the court’s ruling
      as both thorough and principled. In addition to requiring the Flemish government
      to comply with its own regulations, the judge imposed financial penalties for
      possible violations: if similar cargo bound for Israel is discovered, the government
      will be fined €50,000 per container. Vanbrabant points out that, in the context
      of Europe’s push for rearmament and renewed austerity, the ruling might force
      the government to allocate additional resources to inspection agencies, currently
      underfunded and thus undercapacitated. The ruling is also expected to influence
      ongoing and future campaigns in Belgium. There are already efforts underway challenging
      the country’s stance on arms shipments via its maritime and airspace. The organizations
      behind the Flemish case are also mobilizing against domestic and EU-level plans
      to weaken export controls under the ReArm Europe agenda. “What we achieved locally
      can be expanded,” Vanbrabant says. “This isn’t only about Palestine, it’s also
      about the broader arms export system.” A tool that extends beyond the courts The
      implications of the case are wide-ranging. “Legal action is becoming a growing
      tool [in the Palestine solidarity and anti-armament movements],” Vanbrabant notes.
      “But it goes beyond that.” This is particularly relevant in the context of intensifying
      anti-militarization efforts across Europe and Intal’s wider work. “As a strong
      BDS partner and an organization that works on militarization more broadly, the
      issue of arms embargoes is central to us,” Vanbrabant adds. “In a way, it’s part
      of our DNA as an anti-imperialist group, the BDS campaign and the knowledge that
      genocide is only possible because of our governments’ complicity.” The case is
      also expected to give a boost to the Palestine solidarity movement, which has
      faced constant repression in much of Europe . While the role of Antwerp port workers
      wasn’t as visible as that of logistics workers in Greece or France , who have
      repeatedly refused to load military cargo, this campaign provided an important
      opportunity for labor collectives to raise awareness and consult their members.
      Ultimately, as Vanbrabant emphasizes, the ruling proves that even without major
      resources, it’s possible to take on authorities – and win. The entire case was
      funded through small donations, showing widespread public support for the cause.
      “There’s this belief that you have to be big and powerful to win,” she says. “But
      this proves it doesn’t have to be that way.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

      cruise line Mano Maritime, arrived on Tuesday at the Greek island of Syros in
      the Aegean Sea. The passengers were supposed to disembark for six hours. However,
      they were forced to remain on board due to the protests in support of Palestine.

      pic.twitter.com/npWwMDLPbW — Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) July 22, 2025 “The
      demonstrators posed no danger to us,” an Israeli on board the ship told Hebrew
      news site Walla . Between 120 and 300 protesters waved Palestinian flags and held
      banners reading “stop the genocide” as the ship arrived. Israeli Foreign Minister
      Gideon Saar spoke with his Greek counterpart, Giorgos Gerapetritis, to request
      intervention to resolve the issue. Yet the cruise ship ended up being redirected
      to Limassol, Cyprus. Around 1,600 Israelis were traveling on the MS Crown Iris,
      according to Israel’s Channel 12. A group of the Greek island’s residents organized
      the protest and posted on social media that they “raise their fists in solidarity
      with the Palestinians in Gaza,” adding that “it is unacceptable that tourists
      from Israel continue to be welcomed here while the Palestinians are suffering
      in the Strip.” Israel’s genocidal war has resulted in a significant decline in
      Tel Aviv’s popularity worldwide. Israeli soldiers responsible for war crimes,
      including the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza, are regularly pursued
      and targeted with criminal complaints issued by pro-Palestine organizations in
      courts around the world. Two Israeli soldiers were detained at the Tomorrowland
      festival in Belgium last week. Belgian police released them after conducting an
      interview. The legal complaint was filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which
      has been leading a global campaign against Israeli soldiers involved in war crimes.
      In January, the Israeli army issued restrictions against media coverage of active-duty
      soldiers due to legal risks they face over war crimes in Gaza while traveling
      abroad. This came after an Israeli army reservist’s vacation in Brazil ended abruptly
      after HRF convinced a federal judge in Brazil to open a war crimes investigation
      into his participation in the demolition of civilian homes in Gaza. Editor’s Note

      cruise line Mano Maritime, arrived on Tuesday at the Greek island of Syros in
      the Aegean Sea. The passengers were supposed to disembark for six hours. However,
      they were forced to remain on board due to the protests in support of Palestine.

      demonstrators posed no danger to us,” an Israeli on board the ship told Hebrew
      news site Walla . Between 120 and 300 protesters waved Palestinian flags and held
      banners reading “stop the genocide” as the ship arrived. Israeli Foreign Minister
      Gideon Saar spoke with his Greek counterpart, Giorgos Gerapetritis, to request
      intervention to resolve the issue. Yet the cruise ship ended up being redirected
      to Limassol, Cyprus. Around 1,600 Israelis were traveling on the MS Crown Iris,
      according to Israel’s Channel 12. A group of the Greek island’s residents organized
      the protest and posted on social media that they “raise their fists in solidarity
      with the Palestinians in Gaza,” adding that “it is unacceptable that tourists
      from Israel continue to be welcomed here while the Palestinians are suffering
      in the Strip.” Israel’s genocidal war has resulted in a significant decline in
      Tel Aviv’s popularity worldwide. Israeli soldiers responsible for war crimes,
      including the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza, are regularly pursued
      and targeted with criminal complaints issued by pro-Palestine organizations in
      courts around the world. Two Israeli soldiers were detained at the Tomorrowland
      festival in Belgium last week. Belgian police released them after conducting an
      interview. The legal complaint was filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), which
      has been leading a global campaign against Israeli soldiers involved in war crimes.
      In January, the Israeli army issued restrictions against media coverage of active-duty
      soldiers due to legal risks they face over war crimes in Gaza while traveling
      abroad. This came after an Israeli army reservist’s vacation in Brazil ended abruptly
      after HRF convinced a federal judge in Brazil to open a war crimes investigation
      into his participation in the demolition of civilian homes in Gaza. Editor’s Note

    text: 'President Donald Trump in the White House on July 18. (White House/Daniel
      Torok) In one of the scariest moments in modern history, we''re doing our best
      at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help
      to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Patrick
      Lawrence / Consortium News W ell, it took long enough for the White House and
      the policy cliques to notice even the existence of the BRICS, the group of non–Western
      nations named for its first members. For many years after Brazil, Russia, India,
      China and South Africa coalesced to form this loose but formidable association,
      in the last years of the last century, it was as if Washington were trying to
      will the group and all it represented out of existence. And now look. The first
      thing the United States does as it acknowledges the BRICS, whose members currently
      number 11 and counting, is to announce that it will punish those nations belonging
      to it for … for belonging to it. Earlier this month President Donald Trump — always
      the one to get this kind of nitwittery done — announced that he would impose blanket
      tariffs of 10 percent on all BRICS members — a threat he reiterated two weeks
      later, with the promise of more to come should the group’s members determine to
      exercise their sovereignty in the cause of common interests. The Trumpster on
      this question said July 6: “When I heard about this group from BRICS, six countries
      [sic], basically, I hit them very, very hard. And if they ever really form in
      a meaningful way, it will end very quickly. We can never let anyone play games
      with us.” How’s that for the statecraft of a self-confident nation? This display
      of juvenile impetulance coincided with the opening of the BRICS group’s 17th summit,
      hosted July 6–7 in Rio de Janeiro, as Brazil now holds the group’s rotating presidency.
      The agenda included the usual sorts of things for these occasions: trade and investment,
      inclusive global governance, a global security architecture. This year’s summit
      also condemned the Israeli–American bombing runs against Iran three weeks prior
      to the session as “a violation of international law.” Maybe Trump for once read
      the briefing papers the C.I.A. delivers to the Oval Office each morning and saw
      this coming, as he moved instantly to hit very, very hard a second time. Here
      he is on Truth Social, his digital bullhorn, even before BRICS leaders had checked
      out of their hotels: “Any country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies
      of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% tariff. There will be no exceptions
      to this policy.” So clumsy, so off the mark, so utterly unaware of where the hands
      are on history’s clock. It is funny how often what the late-phase imperium intends
      as displays of strength turn out to be displays of uncertainty, weakness and impotence.
      Here I must correct, and not for the first time, a misunderstanding among U.S.
      officials so common I conclude it is willful. There is not a damn thing the BRICS
      as a group has ever said, done, or stood for that is anti–American. This group
      is about the construction of a world order built on a foundation of parity, the
      common good and international law. It would welcome the participation of all nations
      in this world-historical project, not least, given their capital and technology,
      the U.S. and the other Western powers. It is anti–American only insofar as it
      opposes hegemonic power and— putting the point another way — insofar as the United
      States stands foursquare against all three of the above-noted principles. I am
      surprised to note the extent of Washington’s insecurity as the BRICS nations move
      forward, especially given the lukewarm review the Rio summit got afterward from
      commentators straight across the board. Lydia Polgreen, a New York Times columnist,
      termed the statements coming out of the Rio summit “milquetoast.” The group condemned
      the Iran bombings but did not name names, Polgreen argued. On the other side of
      things, Chas Freeman, the distinguished ambassador emeritus, gave an interesting
      interview with Glenn Diesen 10 days ago under the headline, “The Old World Is
      Dying and the New World Struggles to be Born.” Freeman lauded the BRICS for its
      accomplishments, among these its work creating alternative financial systems,
      the New Development Bank, launched in 2012, its outstanding achievement. But,
      in my interpretation of his remarks, Freeman was critical of the group for not
      acting more in concert — for not making itself a greater presence in geopolitical
      affairs. Russia & Iran’s Nuclear Deal In this connection I was struck by a report
      The Times of London carried July 13 under the headline, “Why is Putin pushing
      Tehran towards Trump’s nuclear deal?” “Russia is leaning on Iran,” Tom Parfitt
      reported, “to accept a deal that denies it the right to enrich uranium for any
      purpose.” It is a good question, coming not quite a month after what we are now
      calling the Twelve–Day War against Iran. Citing an earlier report in Axios , Parfitt
      noted, “Experts said that Moscow was probably pushing for a deal because it is
      wary of Iran disintegrating under renewed assault, which could threaten Russia’s
      economic interests.” It was not clear at the time what Iran thought of Moscow’s
      advice on this point, but it seems plainer now: Iran is now preparing to reopen
      talks on its nuclear programs this Friday with Britain, France, and Germany, signatories
      to the accord the U.S. abandoned during Trump’s first term in 2018. This simply
      must be taken as an exploratory session to see if renewed talks with Washington
      may be possible. Given that Iran is a BRICS member, and that Moscow and Tehran
      signed a wide-ranging strategic partnership last January, the questions raised
      are obvious. What are the BRICS and what are they not, or not yet? What do they
      expect of one another and what ought the rest of the world expect of them? With
      its current membership, and excluding a dozen or so “partner countries,” BRICS
      members account for slightly more than 40 percent of the global population and
      a roughly similar proportion of global output as measured by purchasing power
      parity, known in the trade as PPP. Three of its members, China, India and Brazil,
      count among the world’s 10 largest economies. O.K., but let’s note right off our
      frame of reference. This is a group whose shared interests are fundamentally economic
      as against strategic or geopolitical. This has been so from the first. The BRICS
      got their name indeed, from a Goldman Sachs economist who was specialized in middle-income
      nations, a.k.a. emerging markets. Diverse Economic Models When I first started
      thinking about the BRICS my mind went back to the old Non–Aligned Movement, those
      nations that coalesced around Zhou Enlai’s famous Five Principles — territorial
      integrity and sovereignty, nonaggression, non-interference in others’ internal
      affairs, cooperation for mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence — in the late 1950s
      and early 1960s. The NAM was fundamentally political in nature, fair to say, not
      economic. The BRICS share some of these values, but, by comparison, they have
      no politics — also fair to say. This is a different time. The NAM was a response
      to the Cold War’s disruptive binaries. It reflected the aspiration common among
      its members, many of which were newly independent, for one or another variety
      of social democracy. A considerable role for the state in the development process,
      to take one example, was more or less a given. You have a very diverse set of
      economic models among the BRICS, by contrast. There is one or another form of
      state capitalism — we can count China and Russia here — but none of its members
      is avowedly socialist. In addition, a lot of neoliberal ideology has flowed under
      the bridge since the old NAM days. Michael Hudson, the superbly clarifying economist,
      had an hour-long interview the other day, also with Glenn Diesen, under the headline
      “The Economics of Civilizational Conflict.” In it Hudson reminded us that BRICS
      members typically harbor well-developed capitalist elites, often educated in American
      institutions, often adherents of market-fundamentalist ideologies, and thoroughly
      invested in the neoliberal order. Hudson, to speak personally, put an end to my
      nostalgia trip: It is no good reading into the BRICS things — intentions, purposes,
      determinations — that are simply not there. Global governance, the authority of
      international law, the New Development Bank, efforts to de-dollarize trade: Yes,
      yes, yes and yes. All good, all in the service, fundamentally, of each member’s
      national interest. I see many good things coming from the BRICS as they proceed
      to contribute to the making of a new world order. But I do not see a “bloc,” however
      often those who know little about the group refer to it as one. I do not see a
      secretariat, or strategic alliances (as against partnerships), mutual defense
      pacts, much suggestion of mutual aid. I am not waiting to hear from these nations
      that wonderful old word, “Solidarity,” or “ solidaridad, ” or “ solidarité, ”
      or whatever it is in any other language. I am waiting for something else, yes,
      but I cannot tell you yet what it is. One must look forward, now, the past of
      little use as a guide. This something else will make its appearance, best outcome:
      The direction of history suggests this. But there is little hint of it now, even
      among the non–Western nations. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Patrick Lawrence discusses the United States'
      delayed acknowledgment of the BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India,
      China, and South Africa, among others. Historically, Washington seemed to ignore
      this coalition, but President Donald Trump has now threatened to impose blanket
      tariffs of 10 percent on all BRICS nations, signaling a confrontational stance
      against their growing influence. Trump's remarks, made during the BRICS summit
      in Rio de Janeiro, reflect a dismissive attitude towards the group's potential
      to assert its sovereignty and collective interests. The article critiques this
      approach as a display of immature statecraft, coinciding with the BRICS summit's
      focus on trade, investment, and global governance.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Patrick Lawrence discusses the United States'
      delayed acknowledgment of the BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India,
      China, and South Africa, among others. Historically, Washington seemed to ignore
      this coalition, but President Donald Trump has now threatened to impose blanket
      tariffs of 10 percent on all BRICS nations, signaling a confrontational stance
      against their growing influence. Trump's remarks, made during the BRICS summit
      in Rio de Janeiro, reflect a dismissive attitude towards the group's potential
      to assert its sovereignty and collective interests. The article critiques this
      approach as a display of immature statecraft, coinciding with the BRICS summit's
      focus on trade, investment, and global governance.

      Dreams Columbia University has agreed to pay a $200 million fine and make other
      significant concessions to the Trump administration in a deal to restore federal
      grants canceled earlier this year as part of the president’s assault on institutions
      of higher education. Under the terms of the settlement , which was released Wednesday,
      Columbia agreed to “conduct a thorough review” of its educational programs “in
      regional areas across the university, starting with the Middle East”—bowing to
      the Trump administration’s interference in curriculum-related decisions. Columbia
      also pledged to “undertake a comprehensive review of its international admissions
      processes” and “ensure that international student-applicants are asked questions
      to elicit their reasons for wishing to study in the United States” as the Trump
      administration—under the guise of combating antisemitism— targets international
      students who have taken part in Palestinian rights demonstrations. Earlier this
      week, Columbia suspended or expelled dozens of students over Gaza-related protests.

      23, 2025 at 10:22 PM Columbia’s deal with the federal government sparked immediate,
      furious backlash, with critics condemning the university’s leaders as “ cowards
      ” who are “ bowing down to authoritarianism .” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), whose
      district includes Columbia, said he was “deeply disappointed” to learn of the
      university’s “outrageous and embarrassing $200 million capitulation to the Trump
      administration’s repugnant extortion campaign.” In response to the Trump administration’s
      claim that the university was violating federal law by failing to protect its
      Jewish students, Nadler stressed that “no investigation was ever conducted by
      the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights—the single body charged under
      federal law with investigating antisemitism on campus.” (Columbia did not admit
      to wrongdoing as part of the agreement.) “Rather, unlike Harvard, my alma mater
      has allowed a once highly respected institution to succumb to the Trump administration’s
      coercive and exploitative tactics,” Nadler said in a statement. “Columbia has
      effectively waived the white flag of surrender in its battle at the heart of the
      Trump administration’s war on higher education and academic freedom.” The Columbia
      Daily Spectator , the university’s student newspaper, reported that under its
      settlement with the Trump administration, the university “agreed to reveal the
      admissions data of both rejected and admitted students, including their race,
      GPA, and standardized test performance, to the federal government.” “As part of
      the deal, the federal government will not institute ‘any civil action’ against
      the university and will resume canceled National Institutes of Health and Health
      and Human Services funding, but does not restore grants from the Department of
      Education,” the Spectator observed. “The university is required to comply with
      Title VI to maintain the terms of the deal.” ‪Jacob Schriner-Briggs‬, visiting
      assistant professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, wrote on social media
      that the deal represents “a vicious blow to the academic freedom of university
      employees and students alike” and accused Columbia of “taking its lead from the
      government as to what questions it will ask international applicants and which
      ‘longstanding traditions’ it will ensure all of its students are ‘committed to.''”
      “This capitulation is indefensible,” wrote Schriner-Briggs. Editor’s Note : A

      pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Chris
      Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report This interview is also available on podcast platforms
      and Rumble . The gutting of public funding for higher education in the United
      States has led to the takeover of universities by private donors, many of whom
      are Zionist entities and billionaires. As a result, universities have become,
      as guest Dr. Maura Finkelstein calls them, “banks and real estate development
      companies that offer classes.” As demonstrated by Finkelstein’s story, this new
      paradigm of higher education has pushed aside democratic values and academic freedom.
      In January 2024, as a result of a McCarthyist-style crackdown on pro-Palestinian
      faculty, Finkelstein was fired from her position as a tenured associate professor
      and chair of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Muhlenberg College.
      Her dismissal followed a farcical Department of Education investigation, making
      her one of the latest victims in the purge of dissenters against the Zionist narrative.
      On this episode of The Chris Hedges Report , Finkelstein explains how Muhlenberg
      reached this point of seemingly no return and how it serves as an example of how
      universities nationwide are capitulating to the Trump administration’s crackdown
      on free speech with regard to the genocide in Gaza. From the increasing pressures
      from Zionist campus organizations like Hillel International to the constant monitoring
      and surveillance of those sympathetic to the Palestinian plight on social media,
      Finkelstein and host Chris Hedges make clear the walls are closing in on American
      education and democracy itself. Host Chris Hedges Producer: Max Jones Intro: Diego

      so I can continue to post my now weekly Monday column on ScheerPost and produce
      my weekly television show, The Chris Hedges Report. Transcript Chris Hedges Dr.
      Maura Finkelstein, a tenured associate professor and chair of the Department of
      Sociology and Anthropology at Muhlenberg College, was fired in January 2024 —
      solely because of one anti-Zionist repost on Instagram — after being trolled for
      months by Zionists on social media. Zionists, including students and alumni at
      the college, denounced her “dangerous pro-Hamas rhetoric” and “blatant classroom
      bias against Jewish students.” Finkelstein, who is Jewish, was attacked online
      as a self-hating Jew, a Nazi and a Kapo. Her detractors posted that her family
      must be ashamed of her, that her mother should have aborted her, that she would
      soon lose her job and that “we’re watching you.” A Change.org petition, with some
      8,000 signers, called for her termination. It posted screenshots of Finkelstein’s
      posts: a photo of her, on Oct. 12, in a kaffiyeh, a kaffiyeh-patterned face mask
      and a tank top that read “Anti-Zionist Vibes Only,” below which she had written
      “Free Gaza, free Palestine, stop the ongoing genocide by the Israeli and American
      war machines.” In another, on Oct. 26, she wrote, “ISRAEL DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
      TO DEFEND ITS OCCUPATION.” The petition prompted The Department of Education to
      launch an investigation into Muhlenberg. The firing of Finkelstein is an ominous
      threat to academic freedom. It signals that there is no protection, even tenure,
      for those who oppose not only the genocide, but the state sanctioned narrative.
      Those without tenure, who form the vast majority of university faculties, have
      even less job security. The assault is built around the specious argument that
      support for Palestinians rights is a form of antisemitism, even if you are Jewish.
      It is designed, of course, not to root out antisemitism but silence the left,
      liberals and crush all dissenting voices. Finkelstein is not alone. Over 3,000
      university students were arrested, most during the Biden administration, on college
      campuses. Student activists, along with faculty and administrators, have been
      expelled. Middle Eastern departments have been gutted, closed or put into receivership.
      This witch hunt, foolishly given credibility by university administrators eager
      to curry favor with their rightwing critics and the Trump administration has led
      the White House to withdraw $11 billion in research funding. Harvard alone stands
      to lose $2 billion. The Trump administration is seeking to revoke student visas
      from many of the 1.1 million foreign students in the U.S. It is threatening to
      also revoke nonprofit status from universities such as Harvard and withdraw accreditation
      from Columbia University, despite Columbia’s capitulating to every demand made
      by the Trump administration. Joining me to discuss this wholesale assault on academic
      freedom and its consequences is Dr. Maura Finkelstein. Professor Finkelstein,
      who received her PhD in cultural anthropology from Stanford University, is the
      author of The Archive of Loss: Lively Ruination in Mill Land Mumbai . Her essays
      have been published by Post45, Electric Literature, Allegra Lab, Red Pepper Magazine,
      The Markaz Review, the Scottish Left Review, Mondoweiss, Middle East Eye, and
      Al Jazeera. Let’s just lay out what happened to you. And I think one of the things
      that’s so disturbing to many of us is what they used, which was just slander,
      unsubstantiated slander, to terminate your tenured position. So just walk us through
      that process. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Chris. It’s
      a real honor to be here. So I think there’s two ways or there’s two intersecting
      threads to the story. I think one is the way that these online spaces create and
      facilitate slander, smears, attacks, doxing, harassment. And I think there’s also
      the way that these institutions are utilizing those attacks, if not partnering
      with them to take those attacks to an institutional level and actually shut down
      folks who are speaking out about genocide. So with my case, what happened was,
      like so many people, I was teaching about Palestine before October 7th, 2023,
      before the al-Aqsa Flood. I had a class that I taught that was about Palestine.
      I included Palestine in all of my classes. Well, this was a big concern to Hillel
      International and the Hillel chapter on Muhlenberg’s campus, which is, for folks
      who don’t know, a student organization that claims to be the center for Jewish
      life on campus, but is actually a Zionist organization with direct ties to Israel.
      Chris Hedges They’re largely controlled by AIPAC, having run into the Hillel House
      myself. Maura Finkelstein Very much so. Yeah, they became partners with AIPAC
      about a decade and a half ago, I believe. And they’ve been part of the larger
      Zionist movement to shut down all support for Palestine on campuses. So Hillel
      had been monitoring me, students had been calling for boycotts of my classes.
      Chris Hedges Let me just interrupt you. When you say monitoring you, that often
      means putting students in your classroom to essentially report back to them. Is
      that how they were monitoring you? Maura Finkelstein You know, I hear so many
      stories about how that happens, especially to my Palestinian colleagues. That’s
      been happening for decades now. What actually was happening with me was slightly
      different. They were aware that I was talking, speaking, writing about Palestine.
      I had brought a Palestinian speaker to campus. And so instead of actually infiltrating
      my classes, they called for a boycott of the class. So students were bullied into
      not taking my classes. I heard from anti-Zionist Jewish students who needed a
      Jewish space on campus and so were part of Hillel, but were told that if they
      took my classes or spoke to me or engaged me that they would not be welcomed in
      Hillel. So it was kind of the opposite, which made my classes slightly smaller,
      but also meant that for the students who took my classes, we didn’t have the constant
      disruption and bullying and threats that so many faculty who teach about Palestine
      have experienced and are experiencing now. But what happened after October 7th
      is that I had a Zionist student in both of my classes who was part of Hillel.
      He’s actually since moved to Israel and joined the Israeli military as far as
      I know. And he filed a complaint against a class that I taught on October 12th,
      in which I gave my students space to ask questions about what was happening. And
      that set off a series of events that began with Muhlenberg students and alumni
      with ties through Hillel attacking me on social media. And so the school started
      investigating my classes. That didn’t go anywhere. They started investigating
      my publications. That didn’t go anywhere. And in late November, there were concerns
      about my social media. And that led to a couple investigations in November and
      December that didn’t really go anywhere. I mean, I was barred from my office for
      a week, I had to move my classroom. There were things that the college was doing
      to protect Hillel students and disrupt my job. But nothing really stuck in terms
      of a formal investigation until right after the Department of Education released
      their investigation into, I think at the time it was like 90 some schools, Muhlenberg
      was on it. And within days, there was a formal complaint filed both by the college
      and by a student in Hillel leadership who I still to this day have never met.
      I mean, I’ve never taught the student, met the student, encountered the student.
      And it was a complaint about this one Instagram post that I did not write. The
      Palestinian poet Remi Kanazi wrote it. I reposted it in my stories. And the complaint
      was brought forward. And this was one of the earlier Title VI investigations that
      was making the argument that Zionist is a protected class, like race, ethnicity.
      And so that was the argument that was made by the college. And what I learned
      later through the investigation is that the director of Hillel, the Israel fellow
      at Hillel, so this is a former Israeli soldier who was brought on to American
      colleges and universities through Hillel in order to encourage students to create
      a relationship with Israel, perhaps move there, perhaps join the military, that
      these two staff members had actually started a WhatsApp group with Hillel students.
      And they were monitoring my social media. They were screenshotting everything
      I posted, which was a lot, and sending these images to students with the argument
      that my posts were so dangerous and violent and so hurtful to students that what
      they must do is show them to the students and encourage the students to file complaints
      and that’s what led to the official investigation into me over this one post.
      Chris Hedges Well, the Department of Education, I believe, only cited one social
      media post. Is that correct? Maura Finkelstein Yeah, that’s correct. Well, yes,
      there were actually two. So one of the things that happens when you read through
      these reports is that it becomes very clear that a lot of the complaints that
      were lodged against colleges and universities were from figures outside the colleges
      and universities who are not part of the college or university community, weren’t
      taking classes, weren’t on campus. And they’re very thin and very similar complaints.
      So I think there were five of those that were really clearly not from Muhlenberg.
      One of the complaints was a post that I made that 17 students at Hillel filed
      a complaint about in November and that investigation was dropped. And then, you
      know, that ended up in the Department of Education report. And then the one post
      that ended up being what I was investigated for, this Remi Kanazi post. That was
      also in the Department of Education report. So there were two that were actually
      based on real social media posts and the rest were completely fabricated. Chris
      Hedges Let’s talk about the administration of these colleges. They have just surrendered
      completely with almost no exceptions. Maybe Wesleyan is one, or Union Theological
      Seminary, but you can count them on one hand. And I think that’s very frightening
      for those of us who spent eight years at a university, probably spent close to
      that as well or more doing your doctorate. But it’s terrifying because having
      covered despotic regimes, that last readout of free speech and self-criticism
      and dissent is always usually on those university campuses. And when that’s shut
      down, it’s extremely ominous for where a country goes. But let’s talk about the
      decision on the part of the administrators of Muhlenberg and other universities
      to essentially sacrifice you, I think, vainly. They’re not reading power. This
      isn’t a discussion of good faith. It’s about shutting down pluralism and other
      voices and the left and even liberals. But let’s talk about in your own case specifically,
      and then the broader sort of response on the part of those who are running universities
      and colleges across the United States. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, thanks for that
      question. So in terms of Muhlenberg, I think Muhlenberg College is a really good
      example of all of the problems that we’re seeing in higher ed in the United States
      right now. So it’s a small private college. It’s almost entirely tuition and donor
      run. It’s been financially struggling since I was hired, if not, you know, for
      years before. There have been hiring freezes, have been pay cut freezes, the enrollments
      are down. So these small colleges are really struggling and the only way they
      can survive in addition to tuition, which just keeps going higher and higher and
      higher and student loan debt is an absolute disaster. But the other way that they
      can survive is through private donors. And one of the things that Muhlenberg has
      done over the past few decades is really relied on certain private donors, many
      of whom are Zionist, one of them being Hillel International, to help shape the
      character and identity of the school. So Muhlenberg is known and very proud and,
      you know, Hillel Muhlenberg on their website claims that it’s a safe space for
      Zionists. It’s about 33% Jewish as far as I know the last numbers, which puts
      it in the top four percentage wise in terms of Jewish population schools in the
      US. And almost all of those students are recruited through Hillel. And so you
      have students coming onto campus who are really committed to the Zionist agenda
      of an organization like Hillel and they really want to be part of a Jewish community.
      And so what that means is that if Muhlenberg wants to survive as an institution,
      it needs to make these donors happy. It needs to make these tuition paying students
      happy. And so while I have no sympathy for the administration, I think when you
      have those stakeholders want someone like me gone and threaten to pull financial
      support, make sure that Jewish students are not coming to this campus, you know,
      it puts administrators in a bind. Do they support actually the sort of fundamental
      investment of a school, which is education, which is free thought, which is the
      ability to engage hard ideas, or do they bend to their donors? And in the case
      of Muhlenberg, they bent to their donors, the chair of the board of trustees is
      also a Zionist, his wife is Israeli, there’s a lot of investment in this. And
      the entire time that I taught at Muhlenberg, I was aware of this chilling Zionist
      climate. I thought that I was safe and protected because of my own identity. That
      turned out to be false. But you know, for years, many of the faculty I know who
      perhaps are not Zionists or are committed to Palestinian liberation would never
      utter the word Palestine on campus. They were too scared to do that. They were
      afraid they were going to lose their jobs. And I think what Muhlenberg and what
      my case sort of illustrates is the fact that higher ed is so broken in this country.
      We have no robust public education. We have schools like Columbia that if anything,
      they’re banks and real estate development companies that offer classes. And so
      you see these administrators becoming more and more business oriented and less
      education and research oriented and more invested in ensuring that they exist
      in a space of capital accumulation and less in terms of being spaces of learning
      and education. So I think that my case reveals the crisis in higher ed, but of
      course a school like Muhlenberg and a school like Columbia are entirely different
      financial models. And yet both schools are capitulating to Zionist censorship.
      Chris Hedges When I interviewed Katherine Franke, the law professor who stood
      up for the physical assaults against students, many of whom of course were Jewish,
      who were protesting the genocide, she very quickly said in the interview that
      it wasn’t just outside forces, it wasn’t just the Trump administration, but the
      trustee board of Columbia itself that was perpetuating, and this is the point
      that you just made, and of course, even at a place like Columbia with its massive
      endowment or Harvard with its $54 million endowment, these administrators, many
      of whom are increasingly drawn from the corporate world, they’re not academics,
      and then of course give themselves these staggering salaries of half a million
      dollars a year while 75% of faculty are now contingent or adjuncts, making slave
      wages. But they don’t work for the schools. I think this is the point you’re making,
      they don’t work. They work for these trustee boards, which is about accumulating
      wealth and increasing or protecting the endowment solely. Maura Finkelstein Yeah,
      absolutely. And I think the question that we need to be asking in higher ed, not
      just in terms of censorship and this chilling right-wing move that is anti-equity,
      anti-diversity, etc, etc. But also, where is the money going? So for transparency,
      I was a tenured professor who’s chair of my department. I made $80,000 a year.
      So that’s $50,000 a year that I was taking home. It’s not a lot of money considering
      I worked for two decades in my field, but you’re having administrators at Muhlenberg
      who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars. You’re having administrators
      at Columbia who are making millions of dollars. And so these are people who have
      a lot to lose. Chris Hedges I want to talk about the way Title IX and Title VI
      have been weaponized. You know, so much of what’s happened in this country is,
      I mean, the constitutional rights have just been inverted by judicial fiat. And
      this is just another example of mechanisms that were created to protect minority
      or vulnerable groups. And they were weaponized against you. They’ve been weaponized
      against those who dissent from the dominant narrative. Can you talk about that?
      Maura Finkelstein Yeah, absolutely. So the way it works at a small college like
      Muhlenberg is that there is a Title IX office. Chris Hedges Maybe we should just
      explain what they both are for people who don’t know. Maura Finkelstein Yeah,
      so Title IX and Title VI are these laws that are basically protecting vulnerable
      communities on campus that might be marginalized, pushed out, discriminated against
      because of racism, sexism, et cetera. So Title IX has become, I mean, it’s many
      things, but it’s become the office on campus where gender and sex-based discrimination
      is handled. And so anyone who has followed the rampant crisis with sexual assault
      and sexual harassment on campus knows that Title IX is actually more about protecting
      institutions than it is about protecting students and faculty and staff who have
      experienced harm. And Title VI from the Title VI Civil Rights Act protects against
      discrimination against race, ethnicity, et cetera. And religion has been brought
      into that in large part thanks to President Trump’s last term. And so at a small
      college like Muhlenberg, there’s a Title IX office and Title VI is handled within
      it. And what we’re seeing across the country is that Title VI is being weaponized,
      and this is not new, I mean this has been ongoing for over a decade, but Title
      VI is being weaponized by Zionists to make the argument that any criticism of
      Israel, any criticism of Zionism is actually anti-Semitic, that Zionist is a protected
      class, that any anti-Zionist speech, any pro-Palestine speech, any call for Palestinian
      liberation is akin to anti-Semitism. And, you know, we can look across our institutions
      to see the way that that is either being officially embraced, whether it be through
      the [International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance] IHRA definition of anti-Semitism,
      or whether it be something like Muhlenberg in which I was investigated for anti-Semitism
      because of my anti-Zionist political speech. So the thing about Title IX and Title
      VI, is that when there is a Title VI or Title IX violation, these violations are
      sort of lifted outside of the normal functions of a college and university, which
      in the case of a faculty member like me, would be through faculty governance.
      So what should have happened is that there had been a complaint against me, a
      committee of faculty members whose job is to actually hear my case and decide
      whether or not there’s a legitimate case and whether I should be investigated,
      punished or acquitted based on the complaint. That should have been the first
      thing that happened. It would have been transparent. It would have been following
      the faculty handbook, which are rules that were outlined by the American Association
      of University Professors. And when these complaints, especially around Zionism
      and criticism of Israel are being brought forward and college and university administrators
      are pushing them into these Title IX or Title VI proceedings immediately, they
      become confidential. They are moved outside of faculty governance. They basically
      become this black box. And what I experienced last year is a just complete and
      utter secrecy to the point in which every time I would talk to a colleague about
      what was going on, I would get a threatening message from the Title IX office
      telling me that I was violating the terms of the investigation, that I was compromised
      in the investigation, et cetera, et cetera. And so when I’ve been talking to faculty,
      staff, and students who are being brought into these processes of investigating
      anti-Zionist and pro-Palestine speech and activities, what they’re facing is signing
      NDAs, being sworn to secrecy, existing within these processes and procedures that
      have no transparency at all. And what I learned through my investigation and what
      I’ve learned through talking to other folks is that especially last summer, college
      and university administrators across the country sort of organized policies and
      procedures that could actually circumnavigate these established forms of governance
      in order to take control and basically censor speech on campus. So there’s been
      this very chilling silencing that has everything to do with the sort of normal
      functions of a college and university, which is not perfect, but has its reasonings
      being controlled by administrators who are looking to get rid of students, get
      rid of faculty and get rid of staff who are threatening the Zionist agenda of
      the institution. Chris Hedges But of course, going after people who denounce the
      genocide or challenge Zionism as just a mechanism to essentially shut down the
      left, shut down even liberal dissent, because those people who take those kinds
      of stances generally don’t come from the right, and they generally have a conscience.
      I want to talk about what this has done to the universities. Ellen Schrecker,
      the historian of McCarthyism, said that what’s happening now is far worse. Because
      during McCarthyism, were purges of faculty, people who were charged for having
      links to the Communist Party, whether they did or not. You had, of course, rippling
      through Hollywood and I.F. Stone and all these figures. But she said this time
      around, they’re not just going after figures like you. They’re reconfiguring the
      institutions themselves. They are deforming the institutions in a way that’s far
      more egregious than what happened in the 1950s despite the fact that faculty had
      to take loyalty oaths and this kind of stuff. I don’t know if you agree with that
      and if you can comment on it. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, I do agree with that. And
      I think one of the things that I am seeing is that there are two powerful stakeholders
      in this movement. One is the Zionist, the Jewish Zionist bloc. And one is the
      sort of Christian nationalist, Christian Zionist right-wing movement, like the
      Heritage Foundation who now are working in partnership with each other to not
      just go after those of us who are condemning genocide and condemning Israel and
      condemning Zionism and speaking up for Palestinian liberation, but also they’re
      going after DEI. They’re going after gender and sexuality studies. They’re going
      after ethnic studies. So I think what we’re seeing that is so scary is that these
      institutions, these colonial institutions that have particular forms of hierarchy
      that have particular forms of exclusion, they’ve become a little bit more liberal.
      They’ve become a little bit more inclusive. And that’s created great disruptions
      over the past few decades on college and university campuses. So I think what
      I’m so concerned about amongst many things is the way that administrations are
      allowing for these very, very, very conservative anti-equity Zionist white supremacist
      organizations to sort of pressure college and university administrators to not
      just silence people like me, but also close their DEI offices, cancel their trans
      studies programs, cancel their ethnic studies programs, close their Middle East
      studies programs. And I think this is actually what a lot of administrators want,
      especially because they’re coming from the business world. We don’t have complacent
      campuses. We have much more diversity. We have folks who are coming from very,
      very, different life experiences than what has traditionally been the university
      student body, faculty body, staff body. And that’s really challenged the way these
      institutions are run. So I think we’re seeing this sort of large scale crackdown
      on the left, on liberals, on inclusion, on diversity. And I think that’s also
      what’s so different about the McCarthy years as well. And this is Saree Makdisi’s
      argument that it’s not just, I mean, we can talk about the way that the US and
      Israel interests are entangled, but it’s not even about protecting American interests,
      it’s about protecting Israeli interests, this foreign country. And so I think
      because these forms of silencing and institutional violence are coming from all
      of these different directions, it feels like this perfect storm. But I do think
      that it’s evidence of how the right has been so successful over the past few decades
      of just transforming these conversations around diversity, inclusion, equity,
      et cetera into narratives of anti-Semitism. And when we talk a lot about the Heritage
      Foundation Report Project Esther that came out last year, but in 2021, the Heritage
      Foundation had a report called Inclusion Delusion, where they basically argued
      based on social media that staff members in DEI offices were anti-Semitic and
      did not support Israel and therefore wouldn’t support Jewish students and called
      for a dismantling of DEI because of that. And so we’re seeing these very successful
      campaigns sort of come to fruition in this moment. Chris Hedges And since you
      raised it, let’s talk about the Esther report, which is pretty chilling. Maura
      Finkelstein Yeah. I think one of the things that I am thinking the most about,
      I mean Chris Hedges We should explain what it was. Maura Finkelstein So on October
      7th, 2024, the Heritage Foundation released a report and I’m trained as a social
      scientist and I think that this is really dark, dangerous times, but also anytime
      I want to feel good about my social science research skills, I read a Heritage
      Foundation report and it’s really bad research. But they put forth a report called
      Project Esther in which they argued that a shadowy and non-existent Hamas support
      network or HSN, this sort of like international movement of folks on the left,
      who supported Palestine, who are invested in anti-colonial theory, Jewish Voices
      for Peace, Students for Justice in Palestine, sort of all of these different kinds
      of organizing and thinking on the left were part of this international conspiracy
      and that it was undermining democracy, it was trying to destroy capitalism, which
      for the record sounds great to me. And that this needs to be the sort of greatest
      concern in fighting anti-Semitism. It called for an anti-Semitism task force.
      These were of course all Christian nationalists, Christian Zionists. And I can’t
      speak with any real authority, but I’m sure that this report helped lead to Trump’s
      executive order that is now disappearing students, especially Palestinian students
      who are speaking up for Palestine and against Israel. And what I think is so dangerous
      about the Project Esther report, aside from the fact that the Trump administration
      has used it for very, very violent means, is that it deflects away from the fact
      that there are actually these sort of international organizations that are compromising
      American interests, that are dividing loyalty, but they’re not coming from the
      left, they’re coming from the right, they’re coming from Zionist organizations.
      The student who brought the case against me in terms of the post that got me fired
      is in leadership with the Israel Leadership Network, the ILN, which is a very
      real organization that Hillel International started with in partnership with the
      Israeli government in order to train American college students how to defend Israel
      and shut down criticism of Israel and support for Palestine on campus. So you
      actually do have these movements, but this shadowy Hamas support network doesn’t
      exist and not only does it not exist, it’s being used to free ICE to disappear
      our vulnerable students who are fighting for justice in Palestine and criticizing
      an ongoing genocide. Chris Hedges This is [Richard] Hofstadter, “The Paranoid
      Style in American Politics,” where all of the things these proto-fascists do,
      they project onto their opponents. But of course, for them, it’s quite real. What’s
      this done to American education? I look at it as a real body blow to everything
      you and I care about. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I think
      that it’s pretty depressing to think about how higher ed in the US is going to
      recover from this and what the future of higher ed looks like. I mean, the crisis
      in higher ed has been ongoing. This is not a new phenomenon, but it is startling
      how quickly these institutions are capitulating and crumbling. I take a lot of
      comfort in student movements. take a lot of comfort in our colleagues who continue
      to do the work that they do bravely on campus, despite the threats and the surveillance
      and the suspensions. And I feel like every week I hear a new case of a faculty
      or staff member who is being threatened with termination, who’s being suspended.
      And so that is still ongoing. What I think is really terrifying is how many people
      I know are just quietly putting their head down and trying to do what they can
      without drawing attention to themselves. They’re self-censoring, they’re afraid
      of surveillance, they have their beliefs, but they’re too scared to actually go
      into the classroom and teach their students. This is very concerning to me, and
      I can say this from the position of no longer having an institution that is threatening
      me, I’ve already gone through that. I can’t imagine what it would be like to be
      living with this level of threat and surveillance. But until we have a robust
      and comprehensive community-based movement that leads to a strike, that leads
      to a refusal to capitulate with the demands of the institution, I think we’re
      just going to see a chipping away at everything that makes these institutions
      valuable and worth saving. So I feel very pessimistic about the future of higher
      education. And I don’t know if these institutions as they stand are even worth
      saving at this point. I mean, I’m a person who would love to see robust public
      education. I think education should be free. I think it should be inclusive. I
      think it should be democratic. We definitely do not have that in the United States.
      And I don’t know what it would take to create that or revitalize that. But I think
      especially in terms of the way that the model has contributed to both the strength
      of private colleges and the privatization of public universities, it’s pretty
      hard to imagine how these institutions are going to recover and get back to, you
      know, the work of teaching and learning that they supposedly promise. Chris Hedges
      Well, they just become vocational and everybody majors in computer science. Maura
      Finkelstein Right or you just buy your degree, you can still pay. Chris Hedges
      Or you’re branded. Yeah. That’s what Princeton is. Sorry, Sofia. So you’re right
      exactly in terms of how we have to respond. But I was up with the Columbia protesters
      in the spring of 2024 when they had, Columbia is just under, it’s under lockdown.
      You can’t get into the quad, you know, they have police presence on campus. And
      they said because they had shut down the encampment, they said, now we have to,
      precisely what you just said, that we have to call for a general strike. We have
      to call for university-wide strikes. Well, what happened over the summer of 2024
      is that all of these universities coordinated with private security firms, many
      with links to Israel, to impose such draconian rules that not only could you not
      have encampments, you couldn’t even flyer on campus. There was just no room anymore
      for any kind of dissent. And so I think two of the things that disturbed me is
      one, that those students who certainly correctly saw what was in front of us and
      were attempting to react, came back in the fall to academic gulags, and these
      universities made their choice, which was we are going to essentially abolish
      free speech. We’re going to abolish free speech on college campuses. Maura Finkelstein
      I mean, it’s scary to imagine what happens next, right? You’re a student and you’re
      placing yourself in massive amounts of debt. You’ve been working so hard for your
      degree. You’re a faculty member. You have been, I mean, I was one of these. You’ve
      been working for decades towards this career. You finally have it. What do you
      do? And we’re seeing the real material impact of this. And I say it again and
      again, but once we’ve gotten to the point in which our students are being disappeared
      by ICE, they’re being detained, they’re being deported, that is, you know, we
      keep reaching these tipping points and it’s so scary that I don’t even have language
      to articulate it. But I also think, and I think the students have really shown
      us this, but I think on a larger scale, nothing’s going to change if people aren’t
      willing to really give up things. I think that we’ve created a pretty, for a lot
      of people, especially in higher ed, it’s not upwardly mobile quite in the way
      that we used to think it was, but you get your professor job, it’s pretty comfortable.
      You get into your Ivy League school, it’s going to lead to a particular kind of
      future. And whatever that future was, it doesn’t really exist right now. And I
      think that until we see a collective movement of people who understand that at
      the end of the day, this is about a genocide that we’ve been watching live streamed
      for over 20 months. I have, I mean, you write about this, you’ve been covering
      this for years and years and years. Over the past 20 months, I have seen things
      that I couldn’t even imagine, the most horrible things in the world being done
      to what I think is a safe calculation, 800,000 to a million people who have been
      slaughtered and 2 million people who are on the verge of starvation who are dying
      of illness and starvation, et cetera, et cetera. And within that landscape, giving
      up a career, giving up a degree, from my perspective, it doesn’t feel like a lot
      to lose. It feels like a small thing to lose. And I think the sort of difficulty
      of living in this country right now in the U.S. and how expensive things are,
      how sort of unlivable everything feels, and also the way that we’re socialized
      into this very individual way of engaging the world and not really thinking about
      community care, not really thinking about collective action. I think these things
      have made it really, really difficult for any kind of large scale movement. But
      I think until folks are really clear about the fact that we owe Gaza the risks
      that we can take. We owe Gaza the attention and the refusal to capitulate to authoritarian
      crackdowns until we see all of our lives entangled and realize that nothing changes
      unless we’re willing to sacrifice things. And that is different for everyone,
      but until we’re actually willing to lose things, I don’t think things are going
      to change. So I agree that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to imagine how
      to survive on these campuses. And also as I watch my colleagues twist themselves
      into knots to try to survive within these structures. The question I keep asking
      myself is how bad does it have to get for you before you realize that we are all
      connected in the struggle and we’re experiencing it differently, but there has
      to be real sacrifice. And I think that that comes from the willingness to lose
      one’s job, the willingness to be expelled, the willingness to be suspended. And
      you know, I talk to people on an individual level and there’s buy-in on an ideological
      level, but not on a material level. And so I think as long as that inability to
      imagine oneself as part of a collective and an urgency around that sort of movement
      and action, I don’t think things are going to change. Chris Hedges It’s also about
      integrity, dignity, salvaging. You’ve salvaged yours. I worked at the New York
      Times for 15 years. They bring in a lot of very talented, idealistic journalists,
      and then they crush them, the institution, and by the end they’re broken. And
      they get to still run around and say they work for the New York Times, but they’re,
      as [T. S.] Eliot said, hollow men and women. And I think that’s also why I admire
      what these students have done so much, or what people like you and Rupa Marya
      and Katherine Franke and others have done. I just have two last questions. One,
      what has this done to your students with a conscience? And then I want to talk
      about how this experience has affected you personally in terms of your own reassessment,
      maybe even growth and having confronted the New York Times and been pushed out,
      it’s not easy. It’s like you, I worked many years to get to the New York Times
      and be there and it was hard, it’s hard. But let’s talk about the students and
      then let’s just end by talking about, you know, how this experience has made you
      perhaps reflect on yourself and the world around you in different ways Maura Finkelstein
      Yeah, thanks for that. So in terms of my students, you know, the ones that I still
      have a relationship with, I have a relationship with a lot of my former students,
      I think that when I imagine what it’s like to be a young person right now, I lived
      long enough that I see a great shift, but my students are young enough where they
      are just entering their life now and they’re entering the world. And I think a
      lot of them are very scared. They’re angry. They don’t know what they’re doing,
      what their future looks like. But the thing that I have actually learned from
      them, and I’ve seen this through the encampments, I’ve seen it through talking
      to my former students, is that in a way that perhaps my generation didn’t, I grew
      up in the 80s and 90s, it was a very different time. My students are seeing connections,
      they’re seeing the way that, you know, what is happening in New York is, you know,
      reflecting what’s happening in Gaza and what’s happening in Iran is reflecting…
      You know, they’re seeing these connections, they’re seeing climate collapse, they’re
      seeing the fact that they will probably be in debt for the rest of their life.
      They’re seeing that the jobs that they thought they might someday get don’t exist
      anymore. And on a good day, I take comfort in knowing that I had conversations
      with them over the years about how to see these things as interconnected. And
      now I’m watching as they learn it in real time on a global level and it’s been,
      it gives me hope and it gives me a little sense of faith that these students who
      are no longer willing to accept a status quo, a very, very, very violent status
      quo, that’s not good for them. It’s not good for anyone that they’re actually
      willing to push back, to speak up, to fight. I’ve been really inspired by my students
      and I’ve been really honored to stay connected with a lot of them over the years
      and sort of see how they are paying attention, they are connected to the world.
      And that makes me feel like it is possible to imagine some kind of collective
      action in the future that is based in community. I see my students making those
      connections. Chris Hedges And yet, Maura, they’re alienated from the very institutions
      that should be nurturing and forming them. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, and I think
      there’s actually something kind of inspiring about realizing that the things that
      they thought that they were going to buy into are not there for them. They’re
      not there to provide. They’re not there to lift them up, that they actually can’t
      look to the institution for the things that they thought they needed. They actually
      have to find them with community, with organizing. And I think that that’s a really
      important lesson to learn because to ask, to answer your question about me, you
      know, I wanted to teach, I wanted to write, I wanted to travel, I wanted to continue
      learning throughout my life. I thought being a college professor was the way to
      do that. And it was for a while. And I’m glad that I had that experience. And
      I don’t think that that is, especially in the United States, I don’t think the
      act of challenging power, thinking in particular kinds of ways, having the really
      important, uncomfortable conversations with our students that we need to be having
      is possible within American college and university spaces right now. And so if
      it’s not possible, I don’t want to be part of that. And so I’m fine moving on
      and looking for other places. But I think the thing that is really troubling in
      terms of what that means is that education is supposed to be uncomfortable. Learning
      is supposed to be uncomfortable. And we have colleges and universities who are
      saying we don’t want our students to be uncomfortable, i.e. we don’t want them
      to feel bad about their genocidal politics, et cetera, et cetera. And so just
      seeing that and understanding those commitments makes me feel liberated to not
      be part of those institutions anymore, to not be watching my back, to not be careful
      about what I say or not say. And so I can continue to write and I continue to
      think and have the important conversations and be constantly holding myself accountable
      for the spaces that I show up in and trying to continue to center liberation,
      center social change, center justice. And I will continue to do that wherever
      I am. Unfortunately, in the United States, that also requires a paycheck in order
      to survive. But I think on the level of the human, I feel freer being outside
      of the college than I ever did inside it. And for me, the most important thing
      is to continue to draw attention to what is happening in Gaza and to continue
      to learn how to show up as a better ally and collaborator with the people that
      I feel like I’m in community with and I will continue to do that wherever I am.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, Dr. Maura Finkelstein
      discusses the alarming transformation of American universities into entities primarily
      driven by private funding, particularly from Zionist donors, which undermines
      democratic values and academic freedom. Finkelstein, who was recently dismissed
      from her tenured position at Muhlenberg College amid a crackdown on pro-Palestinian
      faculty, highlights how this trend reflects a broader suppression of dissenting
      voices in academia, exacerbated by pressures from organizations like Hillel International
      and a hostile political climate. The interview underscores the urgent need for
      support to combat these developments and preserve free speech in higher education.

      Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report This interview is also available on podcast platforms
      and Rumble . The gutting of public funding for higher education in the United
      States has led to the takeover of universities by private donors, many of whom
      are Zionist entities and billionaires. As a result, universities have become,
      as guest Dr. Maura Finkelstein calls them, “banks and real estate development
      companies that offer classes.” As demonstrated by Finkelstein’s story, this new
      paradigm of higher education has pushed aside democratic values and academic freedom.
      In January 2024, as a result of a McCarthyist-style crackdown on pro-Palestinian
      faculty, Finkelstein was fired from her position as a tenured associate professor
      and chair of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Muhlenberg College.
      Her dismissal followed a farcical Department of Education investigation, making
      her one of the latest victims in the purge of dissenters against the Zionist narrative.
      On this episode of The Chris Hedges Report , Finkelstein explains how Muhlenberg
      reached this point of seemingly no return and how it serves as an example of how
      universities nationwide are capitulating to the Trump administration’s crackdown
      on free speech with regard to the genocide in Gaza. From the increasing pressures
      from Zionist campus organizations like Hillel International to the constant monitoring
      and surveillance of those sympathetic to the Palestinian plight on social media,
      Finkelstein and host Chris Hedges make clear the walls are closing in on American
      education and democracy itself. Host Chris Hedges Producer: Max Jones Intro: Diego

      Maura Finkelstein, a tenured associate professor and chair of the Department of
      Sociology and Anthropology at Muhlenberg College, was fired in January 2024 —
      solely because of one anti-Zionist repost on Instagram — after being trolled for
      months by Zionists on social media. Zionists, including students and alumni at
      the college, denounced her “dangerous pro-Hamas rhetoric” and “blatant classroom
      bias against Jewish students.” Finkelstein, who is Jewish, was attacked online
      as a self-hating Jew, a Nazi and a Kapo. Her detractors posted that her family
      must be ashamed of her, that her mother should have aborted her, that she would
      soon lose her job and that “we’re watching you.” A Change.org petition, with some
      8,000 signers, called for her termination. It posted screenshots of Finkelstein’s
      posts: a photo of her, on Oct. 12, in a kaffiyeh, a kaffiyeh-patterned face mask
      and a tank top that read “Anti-Zionist Vibes Only,” below which she had written
      “Free Gaza, free Palestine, stop the ongoing genocide by the Israeli and American
      war machines.” In another, on Oct. 26, she wrote, “ISRAEL DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
      TO DEFEND ITS OCCUPATION.” The petition prompted The Department of Education to
      launch an investigation into Muhlenberg. The firing of Finkelstein is an ominous
      threat to academic freedom. It signals that there is no protection, even tenure,
      for those who oppose not only the genocide, but the state sanctioned narrative.
      Those without tenure, who form the vast majority of university faculties, have
      even less job security. The assault is built around the specious argument that
      support for Palestinians rights is a form of antisemitism, even if you are Jewish.
      It is designed, of course, not to root out antisemitism but silence the left,
      liberals and crush all dissenting voices. Finkelstein is not alone. Over 3,000
      university students were arrested, most during the Biden administration, on college
      campuses. Student activists, along with faculty and administrators, have been
      expelled. Middle Eastern departments have been gutted, closed or put into receivership.
      This witch hunt, foolishly given credibility by university administrators eager
      to curry favor with their rightwing critics and the Trump administration has led
      the White House to withdraw $11 billion in research funding. Harvard alone stands
      to lose $2 billion. The Trump administration is seeking to revoke student visas
      from many of the 1.1 million foreign students in the U.S. It is threatening to
      also revoke nonprofit status from universities such as Harvard and withdraw accreditation
      from Columbia University, despite Columbia’s capitulating to every demand made
      by the Trump administration. Joining me to discuss this wholesale assault on academic
      freedom and its consequences is Dr. Maura Finkelstein. Professor Finkelstein,
      who received her PhD in cultural anthropology from Stanford University, is the
      author of The Archive of Loss: Lively Ruination in Mill Land Mumbai . Her essays
      have been published by Post45, Electric Literature, Allegra Lab, Red Pepper Magazine,
      The Markaz Review, the Scottish Left Review, Mondoweiss, Middle East Eye, and
      Al Jazeera. Let’s just lay out what happened to you. And I think one of the things
      that’s so disturbing to many of us is what they used, which was just slander,
      unsubstantiated slander, to terminate your tenured position. So just walk us through
      that process. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, thanks so much for having me, Chris. It’s
      a real honor to be here. So I think there’s two ways or there’s two intersecting
      threads to the story. I think one is the way that these online spaces create and
      facilitate slander, smears, attacks, doxing, harassment. And I think there’s also
      the way that these institutions are utilizing those attacks, if not partnering
      with them to take those attacks to an institutional level and actually shut down
      folks who are speaking out about genocide. So with my case, what happened was,
      like so many people, I was teaching about Palestine before October 7th, 2023,
      before the al-Aqsa Flood. I had a class that I taught that was about Palestine.
      I included Palestine in all of my classes. Well, this was a big concern to Hillel
      International and the Hillel chapter on Muhlenberg’s campus, which is, for folks
      who don’t know, a student organization that claims to be the center for Jewish
      life on campus, but is actually a Zionist organization with direct ties to Israel.
      Chris Hedges They’re largely controlled by AIPAC, having run into the Hillel House
      myself. Maura Finkelstein Very much so. Yeah, they became partners with AIPAC
      about a decade and a half ago, I believe. And they’ve been part of the larger
      Zionist movement to shut down all support for Palestine on campuses. So Hillel
      had been monitoring me, students had been calling for boycotts of my classes.
      Chris Hedges Let me just interrupt you. When you say monitoring you, that often
      means putting students in your classroom to essentially report back to them. Is
      that how they were monitoring you? Maura Finkelstein You know, I hear so many
      stories about how that happens, especially to my Palestinian colleagues. That’s
      been happening for decades now. What actually was happening with me was slightly
      different. They were aware that I was talking, speaking, writing about Palestine.
      I had brought a Palestinian speaker to campus. And so instead of actually infiltrating
      my classes, they called for a boycott of the class. So students were bullied into
      not taking my classes. I heard from anti-Zionist Jewish students who needed a
      Jewish space on campus and so were part of Hillel, but were told that if they
      took my classes or spoke to me or engaged me that they would not be welcomed in
      Hillel. So it was kind of the opposite, which made my classes slightly smaller,
      but also meant that for the students who took my classes, we didn’t have the constant
      disruption and bullying and threats that so many faculty who teach about Palestine
      have experienced and are experiencing now. But what happened after October 7th
      is that I had a Zionist student in both of my classes who was part of Hillel.
      He’s actually since moved to Israel and joined the Israeli military as far as
      I know. And he filed a complaint against a class that I taught on October 12th,
      in which I gave my students space to ask questions about what was happening. And
      that set off a series of events that began with Muhlenberg students and alumni
      with ties through Hillel attacking me on social media. And so the school started
      investigating my classes. That didn’t go anywhere. They started investigating
      my publications. That didn’t go anywhere. And in late November, there were concerns
      about my social media. And that led to a couple investigations in November and
      December that didn’t really go anywhere. I mean, I was barred from my office for
      a week, I had to move my classroom. There were things that the college was doing
      to protect Hillel students and disrupt my job. But nothing really stuck in terms
      of a formal investigation until right after the Department of Education released
      their investigation into, I think at the time it was like 90 some schools, Muhlenberg
      was on it. And within days, there was a formal complaint filed both by the college
      and by a student in Hillel leadership who I still to this day have never met.
      I mean, I’ve never taught the student, met the student, encountered the student.
      And it was a complaint about this one Instagram post that I did not write. The
      Palestinian poet Remi Kanazi wrote it. I reposted it in my stories. And the complaint
      was brought forward. And this was one of the earlier Title VI investigations that
      was making the argument that Zionist is a protected class, like race, ethnicity.
      And so that was the argument that was made by the college. And what I learned
      later through the investigation is that the director of Hillel, the Israel fellow
      at Hillel, so this is a former Israeli soldier who was brought on to American
      colleges and universities through Hillel in order to encourage students to create
      a relationship with Israel, perhaps move there, perhaps join the military, that
      these two staff members had actually started a WhatsApp group with Hillel students.
      And they were monitoring my social media. They were screenshotting everything
      I posted, which was a lot, and sending these images to students with the argument
      that my posts were so dangerous and violent and so hurtful to students that what
      they must do is show them to the students and encourage the students to file complaints
      and that’s what led to the official investigation into me over this one post.
      Chris Hedges Well, the Department of Education, I believe, only cited one social
      media post. Is that correct? Maura Finkelstein Yeah, that’s correct. Well, yes,
      there were actually two. So one of the things that happens when you read through
      these reports is that it becomes very clear that a lot of the complaints that
      were lodged against colleges and universities were from figures outside the colleges
      and universities who are not part of the college or university community, weren’t
      taking classes, weren’t on campus. And they’re very thin and very similar complaints.
      So I think there were five of those that were really clearly not from Muhlenberg.
      One of the complaints was a post that I made that 17 students at Hillel filed
      a complaint about in November and that investigation was dropped. And then, you
      know, that ended up in the Department of Education report. And then the one post
      that ended up being what I was investigated for, this Remi Kanazi post. That was
      also in the Department of Education report. So there were two that were actually
      based on real social media posts and the rest were completely fabricated. Chris
      Hedges Let’s talk about the administration of these colleges. They have just surrendered
      completely with almost no exceptions. Maybe Wesleyan is one, or Union Theological
      Seminary, but you can count them on one hand. And I think that’s very frightening
      for those of us who spent eight years at a university, probably spent close to
      that as well or more doing your doctorate. But it’s terrifying because having
      covered despotic regimes, that last readout of free speech and self-criticism
      and dissent is always usually on those university campuses. And when that’s shut
      down, it’s extremely ominous for where a country goes. But let’s talk about the
      decision on the part of the administrators of Muhlenberg and other universities
      to essentially sacrifice you, I think, vainly. They’re not reading power. This
      isn’t a discussion of good faith. It’s about shutting down pluralism and other
      voices and the left and even liberals. But let’s talk about in your own case specifically,
      and then the broader sort of response on the part of those who are running universities
      and colleges across the United States. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, thanks for that
      question. So in terms of Muhlenberg, I think Muhlenberg College is a really good
      example of all of the problems that we’re seeing in higher ed in the United States
      right now. So it’s a small private college. It’s almost entirely tuition and donor
      run. It’s been financially struggling since I was hired, if not, you know, for
      years before. There have been hiring freezes, have been pay cut freezes, the enrollments
      are down. So these small colleges are really struggling and the only way they
      can survive in addition to tuition, which just keeps going higher and higher and
      higher and student loan debt is an absolute disaster. But the other way that they
      can survive is through private donors. And one of the things that Muhlenberg has
      done over the past few decades is really relied on certain private donors, many
      of whom are Zionist, one of them being Hillel International, to help shape the
      character and identity of the school. So Muhlenberg is known and very proud and,
      you know, Hillel Muhlenberg on their website claims that it’s a safe space for
      Zionists. It’s about 33% Jewish as far as I know the last numbers, which puts
      it in the top four percentage wise in terms of Jewish population schools in the
      US. And almost all of those students are recruited through Hillel. And so you
      have students coming onto campus who are really committed to the Zionist agenda
      of an organization like Hillel and they really want to be part of a Jewish community.
      And so what that means is that if Muhlenberg wants to survive as an institution,
      it needs to make these donors happy. It needs to make these tuition paying students
      happy. And so while I have no sympathy for the administration, I think when you
      have those stakeholders want someone like me gone and threaten to pull financial
      support, make sure that Jewish students are not coming to this campus, you know,
      it puts administrators in a bind. Do they support actually the sort of fundamental
      investment of a school, which is education, which is free thought, which is the
      ability to engage hard ideas, or do they bend to their donors? And in the case
      of Muhlenberg, they bent to their donors, the chair of the board of trustees is
      also a Zionist, his wife is Israeli, there’s a lot of investment in this. And
      the entire time that I taught at Muhlenberg, I was aware of this chilling Zionist
      climate. I thought that I was safe and protected because of my own identity. That
      turned out to be false. But you know, for years, many of the faculty I know who
      perhaps are not Zionists or are committed to Palestinian liberation would never
      utter the word Palestine on campus. They were too scared to do that. They were
      afraid they were going to lose their jobs. And I think what Muhlenberg and what
      my case sort of illustrates is the fact that higher ed is so broken in this country.
      We have no robust public education. We have schools like Columbia that if anything,
      they’re banks and real estate development companies that offer classes. And so
      you see these administrators becoming more and more business oriented and less
      education and research oriented and more invested in ensuring that they exist
      in a space of capital accumulation and less in terms of being spaces of learning
      and education. So I think that my case reveals the crisis in higher ed, but of
      course a school like Muhlenberg and a school like Columbia are entirely different
      financial models. And yet both schools are capitulating to Zionist censorship.
      Chris Hedges When I interviewed Katherine Franke, the law professor who stood
      up for the physical assaults against students, many of whom of course were Jewish,
      who were protesting the genocide, she very quickly said in the interview that
      it wasn’t just outside forces, it wasn’t just the Trump administration, but the
      trustee board of Columbia itself that was perpetuating, and this is the point
      that you just made, and of course, even at a place like Columbia with its massive
      endowment or Harvard with its $54 million endowment, these administrators, many
      of whom are increasingly drawn from the corporate world, they’re not academics,
      and then of course give themselves these staggering salaries of half a million
      dollars a year while 75% of faculty are now contingent or adjuncts, making slave
      wages. But they don’t work for the schools. I think this is the point you’re making,
      they don’t work. They work for these trustee boards, which is about accumulating
      wealth and increasing or protecting the endowment solely. Maura Finkelstein Yeah,
      absolutely. And I think the question that we need to be asking in higher ed, not
      just in terms of censorship and this chilling right-wing move that is anti-equity,
      anti-diversity, etc, etc. But also, where is the money going? So for transparency,
      I was a tenured professor who’s chair of my department. I made $80,000 a year.
      So that’s $50,000 a year that I was taking home. It’s not a lot of money considering
      I worked for two decades in my field, but you’re having administrators at Muhlenberg
      who are making hundreds of thousands of dollars. You’re having administrators
      at Columbia who are making millions of dollars. And so these are people who have
      a lot to lose. Chris Hedges I want to talk about the way Title IX and Title VI
      have been weaponized. You know, so much of what’s happened in this country is,
      I mean, the constitutional rights have just been inverted by judicial fiat. And
      this is just another example of mechanisms that were created to protect minority
      or vulnerable groups. And they were weaponized against you. They’ve been weaponized
      against those who dissent from the dominant narrative. Can you talk about that?
      Maura Finkelstein Yeah, absolutely. So the way it works at a small college like
      Muhlenberg is that there is a Title IX office. Chris Hedges Maybe we should just
      explain what they both are for people who don’t know. Maura Finkelstein Yeah,
      so Title IX and Title VI are these laws that are basically protecting vulnerable
      communities on campus that might be marginalized, pushed out, discriminated against
      because of racism, sexism, et cetera. So Title IX has become, I mean, it’s many
      things, but it’s become the office on campus where gender and sex-based discrimination
      is handled. And so anyone who has followed the rampant crisis with sexual assault
      and sexual harassment on campus knows that Title IX is actually more about protecting
      institutions than it is about protecting students and faculty and staff who have
      experienced harm. And Title VI from the Title VI Civil Rights Act protects against
      discrimination against race, ethnicity, et cetera. And religion has been brought
      into that in large part thanks to President Trump’s last term. And so at a small
      college like Muhlenberg, there’s a Title IX office and Title VI is handled within
      it. And what we’re seeing across the country is that Title VI is being weaponized,
      and this is not new, I mean this has been ongoing for over a decade, but Title
      VI is being weaponized by Zionists to make the argument that any criticism of
      Israel, any criticism of Zionism is actually anti-Semitic, that Zionist is a protected
      class, that any anti-Zionist speech, any pro-Palestine speech, any call for Palestinian
      liberation is akin to anti-Semitism. And, you know, we can look across our institutions
      to see the way that that is either being officially embraced, whether it be through
      the [International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance] IHRA definition of anti-Semitism,
      or whether it be something like Muhlenberg in which I was investigated for anti-Semitism
      because of my anti-Zionist political speech. So the thing about Title IX and Title
      VI, is that when there is a Title VI or Title IX violation, these violations are
      sort of lifted outside of the normal functions of a college and university, which
      in the case of a faculty member like me, would be through faculty governance.
      So what should have happened is that there had been a complaint against me, a
      committee of faculty members whose job is to actually hear my case and decide
      whether or not there’s a legitimate case and whether I should be investigated,
      punished or acquitted based on the complaint. That should have been the first
      thing that happened. It would have been transparent. It would have been following
      the faculty handbook, which are rules that were outlined by the American Association
      of University Professors. And when these complaints, especially around Zionism
      and criticism of Israel are being brought forward and college and university administrators
      are pushing them into these Title IX or Title VI proceedings immediately, they
      become confidential. They are moved outside of faculty governance. They basically
      become this black box. And what I experienced last year is a just complete and
      utter secrecy to the point in which every time I would talk to a colleague about
      what was going on, I would get a threatening message from the Title IX office
      telling me that I was violating the terms of the investigation, that I was compromised
      in the investigation, et cetera, et cetera. And so when I’ve been talking to faculty,
      staff, and students who are being brought into these processes of investigating
      anti-Zionist and pro-Palestine speech and activities, what they’re facing is signing
      NDAs, being sworn to secrecy, existing within these processes and procedures that
      have no transparency at all. And what I learned through my investigation and what
      I’ve learned through talking to other folks is that especially last summer, college
      and university administrators across the country sort of organized policies and
      procedures that could actually circumnavigate these established forms of governance
      in order to take control and basically censor speech on campus. So there’s been
      this very chilling silencing that has everything to do with the sort of normal
      functions of a college and university, which is not perfect, but has its reasonings
      being controlled by administrators who are looking to get rid of students, get
      rid of faculty and get rid of staff who are threatening the Zionist agenda of
      the institution. Chris Hedges But of course, going after people who denounce the
      genocide or challenge Zionism as just a mechanism to essentially shut down the
      left, shut down even liberal dissent, because those people who take those kinds
      of stances generally don’t come from the right, and they generally have a conscience.
      I want to talk about what this has done to the universities. Ellen Schrecker,
      the historian of McCarthyism, said that what’s happening now is far worse. Because
      during McCarthyism, were purges of faculty, people who were charged for having
      links to the Communist Party, whether they did or not. You had, of course, rippling
      through Hollywood and I.F. Stone and all these figures. But she said this time
      around, they’re not just going after figures like you. They’re reconfiguring the
      institutions themselves. They are deforming the institutions in a way that’s far
      more egregious than what happened in the 1950s despite the fact that faculty had
      to take loyalty oaths and this kind of stuff. I don’t know if you agree with that
      and if you can comment on it. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, I do agree with that. And
      I think one of the things that I am seeing is that there are two powerful stakeholders
      in this movement. One is the Zionist, the Jewish Zionist bloc. And one is the
      sort of Christian nationalist, Christian Zionist right-wing movement, like the
      Heritage Foundation who now are working in partnership with each other to not
      just go after those of us who are condemning genocide and condemning Israel and
      condemning Zionism and speaking up for Palestinian liberation, but also they’re
      going after DEI. They’re going after gender and sexuality studies. They’re going
      after ethnic studies. So I think what we’re seeing that is so scary is that these
      institutions, these colonial institutions that have particular forms of hierarchy
      that have particular forms of exclusion, they’ve become a little bit more liberal.
      They’ve become a little bit more inclusive. And that’s created great disruptions
      over the past few decades on college and university campuses. So I think what
      I’m so concerned about amongst many things is the way that administrations are
      allowing for these very, very, very conservative anti-equity Zionist white supremacist
      organizations to sort of pressure college and university administrators to not
      just silence people like me, but also close their DEI offices, cancel their trans
      studies programs, cancel their ethnic studies programs, close their Middle East
      studies programs. And I think this is actually what a lot of administrators want,
      especially because they’re coming from the business world. We don’t have complacent
      campuses. We have much more diversity. We have folks who are coming from very,
      very, different life experiences than what has traditionally been the university
      student body, faculty body, staff body. And that’s really challenged the way these
      institutions are run. So I think we’re seeing this sort of large scale crackdown
      on the left, on liberals, on inclusion, on diversity. And I think that’s also
      what’s so different about the McCarthy years as well. And this is Saree Makdisi’s
      argument that it’s not just, I mean, we can talk about the way that the US and
      Israel interests are entangled, but it’s not even about protecting American interests,
      it’s about protecting Israeli interests, this foreign country. And so I think
      because these forms of silencing and institutional violence are coming from all
      of these different directions, it feels like this perfect storm. But I do think
      that it’s evidence of how the right has been so successful over the past few decades
      of just transforming these conversations around diversity, inclusion, equity,
      et cetera into narratives of anti-Semitism. And when we talk a lot about the Heritage
      Foundation Report Project Esther that came out last year, but in 2021, the Heritage
      Foundation had a report called Inclusion Delusion, where they basically argued
      based on social media that staff members in DEI offices were anti-Semitic and
      did not support Israel and therefore wouldn’t support Jewish students and called
      for a dismantling of DEI because of that. And so we’re seeing these very successful
      campaigns sort of come to fruition in this moment. Chris Hedges And since you
      raised it, let’s talk about the Esther report, which is pretty chilling. Maura
      Finkelstein Yeah. I think one of the things that I am thinking the most about,
      I mean Chris Hedges We should explain what it was. Maura Finkelstein So on October
      7th, 2024, the Heritage Foundation released a report and I’m trained as a social
      scientist and I think that this is really dark, dangerous times, but also anytime
      I want to feel good about my social science research skills, I read a Heritage
      Foundation report and it’s really bad research. But they put forth a report called
      Project Esther in which they argued that a shadowy and non-existent Hamas support
      network or HSN, this sort of like international movement of folks on the left,
      who supported Palestine, who are invested in anti-colonial theory, Jewish Voices
      for Peace, Students for Justice in Palestine, sort of all of these different kinds
      of organizing and thinking on the left were part of this international conspiracy
      and that it was undermining democracy, it was trying to destroy capitalism, which
      for the record sounds great to me. And that this needs to be the sort of greatest
      concern in fighting anti-Semitism. It called for an anti-Semitism task force.
      These were of course all Christian nationalists, Christian Zionists. And I can’t
      speak with any real authority, but I’m sure that this report helped lead to Trump’s
      executive order that is now disappearing students, especially Palestinian students
      who are speaking up for Palestine and against Israel. And what I think is so dangerous
      about the Project Esther report, aside from the fact that the Trump administration
      has used it for very, very violent means, is that it deflects away from the fact
      that there are actually these sort of international organizations that are compromising
      American interests, that are dividing loyalty, but they’re not coming from the
      left, they’re coming from the right, they’re coming from Zionist organizations.
      The student who brought the case against me in terms of the post that got me fired
      is in leadership with the Israel Leadership Network, the ILN, which is a very
      real organization that Hillel International started with in partnership with the
      Israeli government in order to train American college students how to defend Israel
      and shut down criticism of Israel and support for Palestine on campus. So you
      actually do have these movements, but this shadowy Hamas support network doesn’t
      exist and not only does it not exist, it’s being used to free ICE to disappear
      our vulnerable students who are fighting for justice in Palestine and criticizing
      an ongoing genocide. Chris Hedges This is [Richard] Hofstadter, “The Paranoid
      Style in American Politics,” where all of the things these proto-fascists do,
      they project onto their opponents. But of course, for them, it’s quite real. What’s
      this done to American education? I look at it as a real body blow to everything
      you and I care about. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I think
      that it’s pretty depressing to think about how higher ed in the US is going to
      recover from this and what the future of higher ed looks like. I mean, the crisis
      in higher ed has been ongoing. This is not a new phenomenon, but it is startling
      how quickly these institutions are capitulating and crumbling. I take a lot of
      comfort in student movements. take a lot of comfort in our colleagues who continue
      to do the work that they do bravely on campus, despite the threats and the surveillance
      and the suspensions. And I feel like every week I hear a new case of a faculty
      or staff member who is being threatened with termination, who’s being suspended.
      And so that is still ongoing. What I think is really terrifying is how many people
      I know are just quietly putting their head down and trying to do what they can
      without drawing attention to themselves. They’re self-censoring, they’re afraid
      of surveillance, they have their beliefs, but they’re too scared to actually go
      into the classroom and teach their students. This is very concerning to me, and
      I can say this from the position of no longer having an institution that is threatening
      me, I’ve already gone through that. I can’t imagine what it would be like to be
      living with this level of threat and surveillance. But until we have a robust
      and comprehensive community-based movement that leads to a strike, that leads
      to a refusal to capitulate with the demands of the institution, I think we’re
      just going to see a chipping away at everything that makes these institutions
      valuable and worth saving. So I feel very pessimistic about the future of higher
      education. And I don’t know if these institutions as they stand are even worth
      saving at this point. I mean, I’m a person who would love to see robust public
      education. I think education should be free. I think it should be inclusive. I
      think it should be democratic. We definitely do not have that in the United States.
      And I don’t know what it would take to create that or revitalize that. But I think
      especially in terms of the way that the model has contributed to both the strength
      of private colleges and the privatization of public universities, it’s pretty
      hard to imagine how these institutions are going to recover and get back to, you
      know, the work of teaching and learning that they supposedly promise. Chris Hedges
      Well, they just become vocational and everybody majors in computer science. Maura
      Finkelstein Right or you just buy your degree, you can still pay. Chris Hedges
      Or you’re branded. Yeah. That’s what Princeton is. Sorry, Sofia. So you’re right
      exactly in terms of how we have to respond. But I was up with the Columbia protesters
      in the spring of 2024 when they had, Columbia is just under, it’s under lockdown.
      You can’t get into the quad, you know, they have police presence on campus. And
      they said because they had shut down the encampment, they said, now we have to,
      precisely what you just said, that we have to call for a general strike. We have
      to call for university-wide strikes. Well, what happened over the summer of 2024
      is that all of these universities coordinated with private security firms, many
      with links to Israel, to impose such draconian rules that not only could you not
      have encampments, you couldn’t even flyer on campus. There was just no room anymore
      for any kind of dissent. And so I think two of the things that disturbed me is
      one, that those students who certainly correctly saw what was in front of us and
      were attempting to react, came back in the fall to academic gulags, and these
      universities made their choice, which was we are going to essentially abolish
      free speech. We’re going to abolish free speech on college campuses. Maura Finkelstein
      I mean, it’s scary to imagine what happens next, right? You’re a student and you’re
      placing yourself in massive amounts of debt. You’ve been working so hard for your
      degree. You’re a faculty member. You have been, I mean, I was one of these. You’ve
      been working for decades towards this career. You finally have it. What do you
      do? And we’re seeing the real material impact of this. And I say it again and
      again, but once we’ve gotten to the point in which our students are being disappeared
      by ICE, they’re being detained, they’re being deported, that is, you know, we
      keep reaching these tipping points and it’s so scary that I don’t even have language
      to articulate it. But I also think, and I think the students have really shown
      us this, but I think on a larger scale, nothing’s going to change if people aren’t
      willing to really give up things. I think that we’ve created a pretty, for a lot
      of people, especially in higher ed, it’s not upwardly mobile quite in the way
      that we used to think it was, but you get your professor job, it’s pretty comfortable.
      You get into your Ivy League school, it’s going to lead to a particular kind of
      future. And whatever that future was, it doesn’t really exist right now. And I
      think that until we see a collective movement of people who understand that at
      the end of the day, this is about a genocide that we’ve been watching live streamed
      for over 20 months. I have, I mean, you write about this, you’ve been covering
      this for years and years and years. Over the past 20 months, I have seen things
      that I couldn’t even imagine, the most horrible things in the world being done
      to what I think is a safe calculation, 800,000 to a million people who have been
      slaughtered and 2 million people who are on the verge of starvation who are dying
      of illness and starvation, et cetera, et cetera. And within that landscape, giving
      up a career, giving up a degree, from my perspective, it doesn’t feel like a lot
      to lose. It feels like a small thing to lose. And I think the sort of difficulty
      of living in this country right now in the U.S. and how expensive things are,
      how sort of unlivable everything feels, and also the way that we’re socialized
      into this very individual way of engaging the world and not really thinking about
      community care, not really thinking about collective action. I think these things
      have made it really, really difficult for any kind of large scale movement. But
      I think until folks are really clear about the fact that we owe Gaza the risks
      that we can take. We owe Gaza the attention and the refusal to capitulate to authoritarian
      crackdowns until we see all of our lives entangled and realize that nothing changes
      unless we’re willing to sacrifice things. And that is different for everyone,
      but until we’re actually willing to lose things, I don’t think things are going
      to change. So I agree that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to imagine how
      to survive on these campuses. And also as I watch my colleagues twist themselves
      into knots to try to survive within these structures. The question I keep asking
      myself is how bad does it have to get for you before you realize that we are all
      connected in the struggle and we’re experiencing it differently, but there has
      to be real sacrifice. And I think that that comes from the willingness to lose
      one’s job, the willingness to be expelled, the willingness to be suspended. And
      you know, I talk to people on an individual level and there’s buy-in on an ideological
      level, but not on a material level. And so I think as long as that inability to
      imagine oneself as part of a collective and an urgency around that sort of movement
      and action, I don’t think things are going to change. Chris Hedges It’s also about
      integrity, dignity, salvaging. You’ve salvaged yours. I worked at the New York
      Times for 15 years. They bring in a lot of very talented, idealistic journalists,
      and then they crush them, the institution, and by the end they’re broken. And
      they get to still run around and say they work for the New York Times, but they’re,
      as [T. S.] Eliot said, hollow men and women. And I think that’s also why I admire
      what these students have done so much, or what people like you and Rupa Marya
      and Katherine Franke and others have done. I just have two last questions. One,
      what has this done to your students with a conscience? And then I want to talk
      about how this experience has affected you personally in terms of your own reassessment,
      maybe even growth and having confronted the New York Times and been pushed out,
      it’s not easy. It’s like you, I worked many years to get to the New York Times
      and be there and it was hard, it’s hard. But let’s talk about the students and
      then let’s just end by talking about, you know, how this experience has made you
      perhaps reflect on yourself and the world around you in different ways Maura Finkelstein
      Yeah, thanks for that. So in terms of my students, you know, the ones that I still
      have a relationship with, I have a relationship with a lot of my former students,
      I think that when I imagine what it’s like to be a young person right now, I lived
      long enough that I see a great shift, but my students are young enough where they
      are just entering their life now and they’re entering the world. And I think a
      lot of them are very scared. They’re angry. They don’t know what they’re doing,
      what their future looks like. But the thing that I have actually learned from
      them, and I’ve seen this through the encampments, I’ve seen it through talking
      to my former students, is that in a way that perhaps my generation didn’t, I grew
      up in the 80s and 90s, it was a very different time. My students are seeing connections,
      they’re seeing the way that, you know, what is happening in New York is, you know,
      reflecting what’s happening in Gaza and what’s happening in Iran is reflecting…
      You know, they’re seeing these connections, they’re seeing climate collapse, they’re
      seeing the fact that they will probably be in debt for the rest of their life.
      They’re seeing that the jobs that they thought they might someday get don’t exist
      anymore. And on a good day, I take comfort in knowing that I had conversations
      with them over the years about how to see these things as interconnected. And
      now I’m watching as they learn it in real time on a global level and it’s been,
      it gives me hope and it gives me a little sense of faith that these students who
      are no longer willing to accept a status quo, a very, very, very violent status
      quo, that’s not good for them. It’s not good for anyone that they’re actually
      willing to push back, to speak up, to fight. I’ve been really inspired by my students
      and I’ve been really honored to stay connected with a lot of them over the years
      and sort of see how they are paying attention, they are connected to the world.
      And that makes me feel like it is possible to imagine some kind of collective
      action in the future that is based in community. I see my students making those
      connections. Chris Hedges And yet, Maura, they’re alienated from the very institutions
      that should be nurturing and forming them. Maura Finkelstein Yeah, and I think
      there’s actually something kind of inspiring about realizing that the things that
      they thought that they were going to buy into are not there for them. They’re
      not there to provide. They’re not there to lift them up, that they actually can’t
      look to the institution for the things that they thought they needed. They actually
      have to find them with community, with organizing. And I think that that’s a really
      important lesson to learn because to ask, to answer your question about me, you
      know, I wanted to teach, I wanted to write, I wanted to travel, I wanted to continue
      learning throughout my life. I thought being a college professor was the way to
      do that. And it was for a while. And I’m glad that I had that experience. And
      I don’t think that that is, especially in the United States, I don’t think the
      act of challenging power, thinking in particular kinds of ways, having the really
      important, uncomfortable conversations with our students that we need to be having
      is possible within American college and university spaces right now. And so if
      it’s not possible, I don’t want to be part of that. And so I’m fine moving on
      and looking for other places. But I think the thing that is really troubling in
      terms of what that means is that education is supposed to be uncomfortable. Learning
      is supposed to be uncomfortable. And we have colleges and universities who are
      saying we don’t want our students to be uncomfortable, i.e. we don’t want them
      to feel bad about their genocidal politics, et cetera, et cetera. And so just
      seeing that and understanding those commitments makes me feel liberated to not
      be part of those institutions anymore, to not be watching my back, to not be careful
      about what I say or not say. And so I can continue to write and I continue to
      think and have the important conversations and be constantly holding myself accountable
      for the spaces that I show up in and trying to continue to center liberation,
      center social change, center justice. And I will continue to do that wherever
      I am. Unfortunately, in the United States, that also requires a paycheck in order
      to survive. But I think on the level of the human, I feel freer being outside
      of the college than I ever did inside it. And for me, the most important thing
      is to continue to draw attention to what is happening in Gaza and to continue
      to learn how to show up as a better ally and collaborator with the people that
      I feel like I’m in community with and I will continue to do that wherever I am.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the detrimental impact of reduced public
      funding on U.S. higher education, highlighting how private donors, particularly
      Zionist entities, have transformed universities into profit-driven institutions,
      culminating in the firing of Dr. Maura Finkelstein for her pro-Palestinian stance.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, Dr. Maura Finkelstein
      discusses the alarming transformation of American universities into entities primarily
      driven by private funding, particularly from Zionist donors, which undermines
      democratic values and academic freedom. Finkelstein, who was recently dismissed
      from her tenured position at Muhlenberg College amid a crackdown on pro-Palestinian
      faculty, highlights how this trend reflects a broader suppression of dissenting
      voices in academia, exacerbated by pressures from organizations like Hillel International
      and a hostile political climate. The interview underscores the urgent need for
      support to combat these developments and preserve free speech in higher education.

      donation . By Omar Zahzah / The Electronic Intifada In January 2023, Dell Technologies
      Inc, an American multinational, won a tender from the Israeli defense ministry
      to provide servers and related services to the Israeli military, other security
      bodies and the ministry itself. The deal was valued at over $150 million. Corporate
      watchdog WhoProfits.org reported on the tender and revealed that Dell subsidiaries
      like VMware and EMC Israel Advanced Information Technologies, along with Dell
      staff, provided technology and training to the Israeli military and partnered
      in occupation-linked initiatives such as the National Cyber Park in the Naqab,
      which Israel established after “a government decision to promote national capabilities
      in the cyber space as part of a concept of combined work between government, academia,
      industry and the military.” However, internal documents obtained by The Electronic
      Intifada suggest Dell is more closely entwined with the Israeli military than
      previously known, particularly by supplying technology for Israel’s artificial
      intelligence (AI) -assisted genocide in Gaza. Dell’s ties to Israel stretch back
      two decades: In 2006, it won a tender to provide 50,000 computers to the Israeli
      army and another to supply portable computers to the government. In 2016, Dell
      rebranded to Dell Technologies after merging with software firm EMC Corporation,
      enabling greater focus on emerging cloud technologies. Dell also absorbed EMC’s
      extensive Israeli presence – it had been active there since 1996, establishing
      its first research and development center in Ramat Gan in 2006. In 2011, after
      acquiring several Israeli start-ups, the R&D center was rebranded “a center of
      excellence.” “Deeply committed” Michael Dell, founder and CEO of the company that
      bears his name, told the Dell Future Ready Conference in May 2016 that Dell is
      “deeply committed to Israel.” “We want to be here, we want to be a partner in
      the incredible innovation that occurs here.” He also met Israeli Prime Minister
      Benjamin Netanyahu, now wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes
      and crimes against humanity, at the conference. In January 2024, months into Israel’s
      Gaza genocide, Dell shared a photo of himself and Israeli President Isaac Herzog
      – whose words blaming “an entire nation” in Gaza for 7 October would be cited
      later that month in the International Court of Justice ruling ordering Israel
      to cease all genocidal acts in Gaza. “It’s an honor to stand with @Isaac_Herzog
      and Israel,” Dell wrote. It’s an honor to stand with @Isaac_Herzog and https://t.co/oWYshnAJw1

      is also reportedly a major donor to Friends of the Israel Defense Forces. As such,
      the company’s practice of technologically fortifying Israel’s oppressive policies
      is not exactly a secret. Still, scrutiny tends to focus primarily on how the company
      bolsters military occupation. Nearly two years into the Gaza genocide, Google,
      Amazon and Microsoft have borne the brunt of criticism for their participation
      in Project Nimbus and Azure – tech projects which provide AI and cloud services
      that power the Israeli military’s surveillance of Palestinians and potentially
      help generate kill-lists. “Mass assassination factory” A November 2023 report
      by +972 Magazine and Local Call revealed that the Israeli military was using “The
      Gospel,” an AI program that generates infrastructure targets, including private
      residences, for the Israeli military to strike. One source described it as enabling
      “a mass assassination factory.” In April 2024, a partner report found that the
      Israeli army was using another artificial intelligence program, “Lavender,” to
      generate kill- lists. Lavender notoriously has a 10 percent margin of error. This
      is compounded by criteria the Israeli military gives the program to automate the
      identification of potential targets so broad, the kill lists are essentially arbitrary.
      Another automated program, “ Where’s Daddy ,” allows the Israeli military to track
      Palestinians with the express purpose of carrying out bombings once the individual
      has gone home. Mass casualties are guaranteed by these AI-assisted operations.
      With such blatantly murderous applications, it is no surprise that there is growing
      protest against Big Tech’s role in Israel’s genocide. A bombshell report from
      Francesca Albanese, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human
      Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, exposes how Israel’s “forever-occupation
      has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and big tech – providing
      boundless supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while
      investors and private and public institutions profit freely.” The report spells
      out the direct responsibility that corporate entities hold not to engage in potential
      violations of human rights nor undertake any endeavors that undermine the Palestinian
      right to self-determination. Corporate entities and executives found to be in
      violation can potentially be subjected to domestic and international legal action.
      “AI is one of today’s weapons of mass destruction and Google is a willing war
      profiteer,” Mohammad Khatami, Zelda Montes, and Katie Sim, three Google employees
      fired for taking part in mass civil disobedience against Project Nimbus in April
      2024, wrote in The Nation . “Systems like The Gospel and Lavender are made possible
      through the kind of cloud computing infrastructure that companies like Google,
      [Amazon Web Services,] and Intel provide.” Now, it seems that Dell is also implicated
      in this process. Internal documents shared with The Electronic Intifada reveal
      that Dell technology is supporting a host of Israeli military operations, including
      AI used to monitor and target Palestinians. These materials show that Dell hardware
      is used when running Lavender and The Gospel to automate targeting decisions and
      minimize human oversight, increasing the speed of military assaults. Israel’s
      notorious cyberwarfare force Unit 8200, uses Dell’s AI-powered Pro-Rugged 13 laptops
      for intelligence gathering, surveillance and military operations. Dell also provides
      laptops and servers that enable Israeli AI company AnyVision’s facial recognition
      systems – which facilitate mass surveillance of Palestinians at checkpoints and
      other sites. Paper thin The technology that Dell provides to AnyVision, as well
      as to CISCO Israel (laptops, edge servers, VMware, networking solutions) and Cognyte
      Technologies Israel Ltd. (laptops, servers, networking solutions) all facilitate
      mass surveillance of Palestinians. CISCO provides communication infrastructure
      for surveillance, enabling real-time monitoring of civilian populations and military
      activities. Cognyte Technologies Ltd. uses Dell tech for cyber-intelligence systems
      that track people in Gaza and the West Bank. The documents also reveal that beneficiaries
      of Dell technologies include the Israeli army’s Golani Brigade – implicated in
      the murder of 15 paramedics and emergency workers in Rafah in April, the naval
      unit Flotilla 13 and the Israeli air force. Elbit Systems Land & C41 – the Israeli
      arms manufacturer’s military communications technology arm – also reportedly receives
      laptops, servers and networking solutions from Dell Technologies. When contacted
      for comment, Dell initially sent the following statement: “Dell is committed to
      the highest standards and complying with local laws and regulations where we do
      business. Please refer to our Human Rights policy, provided below.” That policy
      stipulates how: “Dell respects the human rights of all people as reflected in
      the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” It goes on to say that the company
      “will not be complicit in human rights violations, and we hold our suppliers and
      other business partners to this same standard.” Finally, the policy asserts that
      the company complies with “local laws and regulations wherever we do business.
      If local law conflicts with the principles in this policy, within the bounds of
      local laws we seek ways to honor the principles of internationally recognized
      human rights and influence progress towards the highest standards.” Then, bizarrely,
      the company, which uses Outlook for communications, apparently tried to recall
      the statement it sent this journalist (but since the message had already been
      opened, its contents were still available.) Shortly after notification of the
      recall attempt, a final message from Dell’s media team was received, asking to
      “please hold on this statement. We may have an updated one for you.” This “updated”
      statement has not come as of time of writing. Dell’s close association with a
      state charged with genocide at the International Court of Justice surely undermines
      the company’s effort to portray itself as an ethical company. Dell’s website boasts
      that it was recognized in 2025 as “One of the World’s Most Ethical Companies”
      for the 13th time by the for-profit Ethisphere Institute. In May 2024, Dell even
      announced a partnership with governments around the world to address ethical concerns
      regarding AI. But these gestures are paper-thin: Ethisphere charges for company
      ratings, and other recipients of the “Most Ethical Companies” title have included
      US weapons manufacturer Leidos and Elbit Systems America, a subsidiary of Israel’s
      Elbit systems. Dell’s track record is distinctive, though not in the way it wants
      to be perceived: By providing the technologies that power Israel’s racialized
      surveillance and killing machine from AI programs, Dell belongs right next to
      Google, Amazon, Intel and Microsoft as a corporate profiteer of occupation, apartheid
      and the first live-streamed genocide in history. Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      Workers (UFCW) Local 700 members across Indiana voted on July 10 and 11 to reject
      a tentative agreement covering 8,000 Kroger retail workers. This is the second
      contract Kroger workers have rejected, after 74 percent voted down the first offer
      in May. Local 700 has not announced the vote percentage on the second tentative
      agreement. Kroger’s offer included a wage increase of just $0.90 over 3 years
      for starting pay, along with a $200 Kroger gift card that members called “insulting.”
      “That $200 gift card felt like a huge joke,” said Andrea Reynolds, a 27-year Kroger
      worker in Kokomo. “I couldn’t tell you how many contracts I’ve been through, and
      that is the lowest ratification ‘bonus’ we’ve ever had.” David Fredrick, a 20-year
      drug department manager at Kroger in Indianapolis, posted a skit on social media
      poking fun at the offer, pretending to pay his electric bill with a Kroger gift
      card. ‘DONE WORKING FOR CRUMBS’ The second tentative agreement did include some
      improvements from the first—the result of one month of intense organizing led
      entirely by rank-and-file members. The improvements included shortening the contract
      from four years to three; new, although limited, staffing language; higher wages
      over a shorter period; and earlier spousal health care coverage. Yet, the offer
      still didn’t meet members’ needs—nor their higher expectations, raised by member
      organizing, as well as by strong contract campaigns in neighboring unions, such
      as Teamsters Local 135. “Members have seen other union contracts in our area,
      like Pepsi, Coke, and UPS. They know that there are better results with more action,”
      said Shahriar Sayeem, who has worked at Kroger in Fishers for 8 years. “It has
      to be a good contract for everybody, not just for the people at top pay or in
      lead positions.” “We’ve settled so much. We’ve given away so much,” added Reynolds.
      “We’re done working for crumbs.” Despite sky-high operating profits of $3.8 billion
      in 2024, Kroger is attempting to recuperate lost profits and shareholder value
      from its failed merger with Albertsons, which was defeated by a coalition of UFCW
      locals and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in December 2024. Kroger remains
      the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Kroger workers across the country report
      chronic understaffing that results in long lines and higher prices for customers
      and unsafe conditions for workers. Less hours for workers mean they often rely
      on public benefits like Medicaid and SNAP, while Kroger offers food pantries for
      workers in their own break rooms. NO VOTE DESPITE SCARE TACTICS Local 700 members
      reported rumors, misinformation, and scare tactics abounded during the two-day
      period between the announcement of a TA on July 8 and voting just two days later.
      On members’ ballots, rejecting the contract also meant voting to authorize a strike.
      Approving the contract meant voting no on the strike authorization vote. The combination
      vote struck fear in some workers, who recognized that even if they wanted to strike,
      they couldn’t hack it on $250 a week strike benefits from the UFCW International—benefits
      that wouldn’t kick in until day 8 of a strike. “In my store, there was a rumor
      that we were going to be out on strike in the next week,” said Reynolds. “Unorganized
      strikes are not helpful to the membership. What are we losing by voting down these
      concessionary contracts?” Essential Workers for Democracy, a movement for union
      democracy in the UFCW, fought for first day strike pay at the 2023 UFCW convention
      , but the resolution was defeated. ORGANIZING FOR MORE “After we voted no on the
      first contract, we started organizing Zoom meetings,” Sayeem said. “We had to
      start from the ground up—completely from scratch.” These Zoom meetings, supported
      by Essential Workers for Democracy, became a weekly deliberation space for members
      to ask questions, share information, and support one another. Through these meetings,
      members put together a petition with five contract demands and made plans to circulate
      it among their co-workers. The demands are: livable wages with dollar raises,
      not cents; fair staffing language with teeth, not just labor-management meetings;
      affordable healthcare — real family coverage, no givebacks; job security with
      protection from automation and subcontracting; and no givebacks on disciplinary
      language. As of July 17, over 350 Kroger workers have signed the petition. To
      highlight their demands to the public, members also put signs in their car windows
      in the parking lot, so co-workers and customers would read “Indiana Kroger Workers
      Can’t Survive Off of Quarters!” while walking to the store. Members have also
      been wearing buttons and stickers reading “Kroger Workers United for a Living
      Wage” and “Kroger Workers United for a Strong Contract” on their aprons. O.U.R.
      Local 700, the rank-and-file committee of Kroger workers fighting for a strong
      contract, will hold a press conference and rally outside of an Indianapolis Kroger
      store on August 3. SOLIDARITY SHIRT DAYS In the days before major holidays and
      moneymaking periods for Kroger, upper management from regional corporate offices
      visit the stores for a walkthrough. “We came up with the initial idea for solidarity
      shirt days at the in-person meeting we held right after we voted down our first
      contract,” said Sayeem. “We had a corporate store walk coming up for the Fourth
      of July. We thought, ‘The store will be prepared, we should be, too’.” Sayeem
      and two co-workers began talking to others about organizing a Solidarity Shirt
      Day, where everyone would wear a yellow T-shirt underneath their blue Kroger aprons.
      They planned it for the same day as their corporate walk, so management would
      take notice. The action was a success, but Sayeem realized it could be even bigger
      next time. “People wanted to join—they came up and asked, ‘When are you guys doing
      it next?’ And after we voted down the contract [the second time], people came
      up to me and said, ‘When are we going to do it again?’” “When you see people all
      wearing the same color, they feel strong,” Sayeem said. “They think, ‘I’m not
      alone in this fight.’” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      Workers (UFCW) Local 700 members across Indiana voted on July 10 and 11 to reject
      a tentative agreement covering 8,000 Kroger retail workers. This is the second
      contract Kroger workers have rejected, after 74 percent voted down the first offer
      in May. Local 700 has not announced the vote percentage on the second tentative
      agreement. Kroger’s offer included a wage increase of just $0.90 over 3 years
      for starting pay, along with a $200 Kroger gift card that members called “insulting.”
      “That $200 gift card felt like a huge joke,” said Andrea Reynolds, a 27-year Kroger
      worker in Kokomo. “I couldn’t tell you how many contracts I’ve been through, and
      that is the lowest ratification ‘bonus’ we’ve ever had.” David Fredrick, a 20-year
      drug department manager at Kroger in Indianapolis, posted a skit on social media
      poking fun at the offer, pretending to pay his electric bill with a Kroger gift
      card. ‘DONE WORKING FOR CRUMBS’ The second tentative agreement did include some
      improvements from the first—the result of one month of intense organizing led
      entirely by rank-and-file members. The improvements included shortening the contract
      from four years to three; new, although limited, staffing language; higher wages
      over a shorter period; and earlier spousal health care coverage. Yet, the offer
      still didn’t meet members’ needs—nor their higher expectations, raised by member
      organizing, as well as by strong contract campaigns in neighboring unions, such
      as Teamsters Local 135. “Members have seen other union contracts in our area,
      like Pepsi, Coke, and UPS. They know that there are better results with more action,”
      said Shahriar Sayeem, who has worked at Kroger in Fishers for 8 years. “It has
      to be a good contract for everybody, not just for the people at top pay or in
      lead positions.” “We’ve settled so much. We’ve given away so much,” added Reynolds.
      “We’re done working for crumbs.” Despite sky-high operating profits of $3.8 billion
      in 2024, Kroger is attempting to recuperate lost profits and shareholder value
      from its failed merger with Albertsons, which was defeated by a coalition of UFCW
      locals and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in December 2024. Kroger remains
      the largest supermarket chain in the U.S. Kroger workers across the country report
      chronic understaffing that results in long lines and higher prices for customers
      and unsafe conditions for workers. Less hours for workers mean they often rely
      on public benefits like Medicaid and SNAP, while Kroger offers food pantries for
      workers in their own break rooms. NO VOTE DESPITE SCARE TACTICS Local 700 members
      reported rumors, misinformation, and scare tactics abounded during the two-day
      period between the announcement of a TA on July 8 and voting just two days later.
      On members’ ballots, rejecting the contract also meant voting to authorize a strike.

      to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers
      and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Schuyler Mitchell /
      Truthout On July 14, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for President Donald
      Trump’s administration to fire more than 1,300 workers at the Department of Education
      (DOE). The order, while not a final ruling on the legal merits of the case, lifted
      a district court injunction that had prevented Trump from gutting the federal
      agency. Now, while litigation plays out in the courts, the administration is free
      to move forward with its campaign promise to shut down the DOE — a cause conservatives
      have championed for more than four decades. Truthout spoke with two education
      policy experts at nonprofit think tanks to learn more about how the mass layoffs
      at the DOE will immediately impact schools, teachers, and students’ daily lives:
      Jon Valant , the director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings
      Institution, where his research specializes in K-12 education policy, and Sara
      Partridge , the associate director of higher education at the Center for American
      Progress. The interview below has been lightly edited for clarity and concision.
      The DOE now stands to be roughly half the size it was in 2024, thanks to a combination
      of layoffs and resignations. What do you foresee as the most immediate or urgent
      impacts of the Supreme Court order allowing the Trump administration’s mass firings
      to continue? Sara Partridge : One area that the workforce reductions were largely
      concentrated in is the Office of Federal Student Aid, which administers grant,
      work study, and student loan programs for 9.9 million students each year. The
      Office of Federal Student Aid is responsible for processing the Free Application
      for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), disbursing student loan forms, managing repayment
      of student loans, and providing oversight and monitoring of all the parties that
      participate in the federal student aid program. They also provide information
      to students and families and help to resolve complaints and issues related to
      student loan servicing. These are important responsibilities that ensure students
      across the country can access postsecondary education and repay their loans, and
      that taxpayer dollars spent on financial aid go to programs that meet federal
      requirements. Student loan borrowers will in all likelihood face a reduced quality
      of service and more issues with student loan repayment in the coming months and
      years as a result of these changes. Can you talk a little more about the issues
      that current and future student loan borrowers will face? Sara Partridge : Many
      student loan borrowers in repayment are already in distress and facing the risk
      of default. One recent analysis found that as of April, 5.8 million or 31 percent
      of borrowers with a payment due are in late stage delinquency, or more than 90
      days past due on payments. Once payments are 270 days late, the borrower enters
      default and collections may begin. As many as 1.8 million could reach default
      status in July, 1 million in August, and 2 million in September, the study estimated.
      Already, borrowers who are past due on their payments have seen an average credit
      score decrease of 60 points, which will stay on their credit report for 7 years
      and result in less access to credit and higher interest rates. When in default,
      a borrower’s wages, tax returns, and Social Security checks may be garnished.
      Currently, there is a backlog of at least 1.5 million applications for income-driven
      repayment plans, which will likely increase as more borrowers seek to switch out
      of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, due to the fact that the administration
      is restarting interest accrual for those who are currently in an administrative
      forbearance as a result of ongoing litigation against the SAVE plan. When student
      loan borrowers have issues or errors with monthly payments, income-driven repayment
      plans, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, delays for relief under borrower defense
      or closed school discharge, or any other number of issues that their servicer
      fails to resolve, they can contact the Ombudsman Office at the Department of Education.
      As of March 2025, more than 6,500 complaints remained unresolved. I expect that
      these workforce reductions will make it even more challenging for borrowers to
      receive help or relief when they confront errors, challenges, or complex situations
      relating to their student loans. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) also just
      phased out a number of federal student loan repayment plans. How might the Supreme
      Court ruling and this budget bill together reshape the student loan landscape?
      Sara Partridge: The Department has both ongoing and new duties to carry out that
      will require significant expertise, resources, and staff that may no longer be
      available. The Office of Federal Student Aid will have the task of implementing
      a range of new programs as a result of the OBBBA, including introducing new loan
      limits for graduate students and parent borrowers, moving borrowers into new repayment
      plans, and expanding Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs.
      Many of these changes will start to take place July 1, 2026, and some will require
      new regulations to determine how they will be implemented. These are tall tasks
      on a quick timeline, even for a fully staffed Department. Student loan borrowers
      will see a range of changes starting in July 2026, including higher monthly payments
      under the new OBBBA plans. Graduate borrowers and parent borrowers will see new
      limits on federal student loans. The graduate and professional borrowing limits
      will likely disproportionately impact students pursuing medicine, dentistry, and
      other health care fields, forcing many to rely on more risky private student loans.
      The OBBBA also limits repayment options for parent borrowers, barring them from
      accessing income-driven repayment plans. Is there anything students should do
      now to prepare for changes in student aid administration? Sara Partridge: If borrowers
      are past due on their student loan payments, they should contact their servicer
      to work with them to prevent going into default. If they are a Parent PLUS borrower,
      they may want to consider consolidating their loans before July 2026 to access
      the amended income-based repayment plan (although this can, in some cases, reset
      progress toward cancellation, so borrowers should speak with their servicer about
      this choice). If borrowers are facing ongoing challenges with their student loans
      that they cannot get resolution for with their servicer or the Department of Education,
      student loan borrowers can open cases with their congressional representatives,
      which will serve the dual purposes of getting them assistance while also making
      Congress aware of the myriad challenges borrowers are facing right now, and encourage
      them to hold the administration accountable for delivering on its statutory duties.
      When might the effects of reduced capacity at the DOE begin to ripple into K-12
      schools, impacting teachers and students? Jon Valant: It looks like the staffing
      cuts are having negative impacts already. For example, the cuts were heavily concentrated
      in the Institute of Education Sciences, which has been slashed to the point where
      we’re losing access to data that we rely on to evaluate needs and progress. That
      being said, I think the most significant, direct impacts might actually come from
      the funding cuts — or the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold billions
      of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds — that are causing immediate
      headaches and sacrifices from schools. Those are previously approved funds that
      school districts have been promised that suddenly aren’t available for a new school
      year that’s quickly approaching. We’ll see where that ends up, since they’ll have
      to deal with legal and political challenges, but that could mean fewer services
      for English language learners and fewer before- and after-school programs. And
      now, just a month or two before the school year starts, school and district leaders
      are scrambling to figure out what cuts they might have to make to programs and
      staff. Another agency disproportionately targeted by layoffs is the Office for
      Civil Rights. How do you think the DOE’s closing will impact equity and civil
      rights in schools? Jon Valant: Protecting students’ civil rights is one of the
      core functions of the U.S. Department of Education. I’m concerned about what the
      Office for Civil Rights staffing cuts mean for the Education Department’s ability
      to fulfill its obligations in that regard — now and in the future. Maybe even
      more than that, though, I’m concerned with the way that this administration is
      redefining, twisting, and narrowing the Department’s priorities with respect to
      civil rights. In the past, the focus has been on protecting vulnerable groups
      of students. Now, the focus seems to be on weaponizing civil rights enforcement
      to threaten school districts and universities that don’t align with its positions
      on culture-war issues like LGBTQ+ rights. We’ve seen that with universities like
      Harvard and Columbia, as well as with state and local K-12 education agencies,
      including Maine and California. Sara Partridge: The March 2025 workforce reductions
      closed seven of the Department’s 12 regional civil rights offices, laying off
      208 investigators, or 55 percent of the agency’s total investigative staff. A
      recent court filing showed that under the Trump administration, the Office for
      Civil Rights has dismissed civil rights complaints at a rapid-fire pace. Historically,
      close to half of the complaints about civil rights violations have related to
      discrimination due to disability. Students of all backgrounds, but in particular
      those with disabilities, may see their rights to equal educational opportunity
      diminished under this administration, and evidence already suggests that layoffs
      of civil rights investigators are taking their toll. Jon, you wrote in this Brookings
      piece that there’s a “dangerous gap between education’s problems and proposed
      ‘solutions.’” You note chronic absenteeism and large gaps in student test scores.
      Can you explain how dismantling the DOE fails to respond to the key problems you’re
      seeing in education — and how it could make these issues worse for students? Jon
      Valant: Let’s run down some of the many challenges facing K-12 schools in the
      United States right now. We’ve seen years-long declines in academic performance
      — that started before COVID — especially among the country’s lowest-scoring students.
      We continue to battle high rates of chronic absenteeism and other indicators of
      student disengagement. We have alarming data on student mental health and have
      to grapple with challenges related to cell phone use, social media, and other
      issues that originate outside of classrooms. We have a workforce that’s rapidly
      changing with school systems that aren’t equipped to keep up with those changes.
      How does dismantling the U.S. Department of Education or slashing funds for schools
      help with any of that? I have no idea. This is an era of genuine challenges for
      U.S. students and schools, and yet many of our leaders seem more focused on winning
      culture-war battles than actually addressing those challenges. What are some specific
      policies that you think would more adequately address these issues? Jon Valant:
      I think what defines great schools, more than anything, is outstanding teachers
      and instruction. We can use policy more strategically to attract, retain, and
      develop excellent teachers, especially in schools that most need additional support.
      I also think we have a lot of work to do in evaluating the quality of curricular
      materials, encouraging schools and districts to adopt high-quality curricula,
      and training teachers in those curricula. And, really, I’d like to see policymakers
      think more seriously about schools’ role in sustaining a healthy democracy and
      cohesive society. School isn’t only about preparing students for college and the
      workforce. It’s also about developing an ability to get along with another, respect
      other people’s perspectives and experiences, know how to spot misinformation,
      and value the country’s norms and institutions. Is there any angle or consequence
      you think is being overlooked in media coverage of the DOE dismantlement? Sara
      Partridge: The nearly $900 million in cuts to federal education research undertaken
      by the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) are a critical blow
      to researchers’ and policymakers’ understanding of education outcomes, trends,
      and issues. In postsecondary education, these contracts help us understand how
      student loan dollars are distributed and the outcomes of students who borrow for
      college. They help us understand who continues to face barriers to enrolling and
      graduating from college. Some of these studies are longitudinal and take place
      over a decade or more, so interrupting and re-starting them means wasted resources
      and years of lost time. Canceling these projects is short-sighted and could potentially
      be deeply damaging to the long-term future of the American education system. Republicans
      frame closing the DOE as an effort to give power back to the states. What role
      do the states play in this? Is it actually feasible for states to take over the
      DOE’s functions? Jon Valant: President Trump likes to say that he’s “sending education
      back to the states.” But the truth is that states and localities, not the federal
      government, have been the key actors in K-12 education all along. For example,
      the federal government only covers about one-tenth of the expenses for K-12 education,
      with state and local governments covering the rest. The federal government isn’t
      involved in selecting curriculum or deciding what content students should learn.
      It doesn’t hire teachers and school leaders or even decide what standards should
      be used for hiring teachers and school leaders. Those responsibilities fall to
      more local levels of government. That’s not to say that the federal government
      isn’t important in K-12 education — it is. It plays key roles in protecting students’
      civil rights, collecting data and supporting research, and providing funding and
      support to vulnerable groups, like students with disabilities and students in
      poverty. Sara Partridge: The federal government conducts research and oversight,
      ensures students’ civil rights are protected, distributes funding to states and
      schools, administers postsecondary student financial aid, and runs grant programs
      that help fill gaps or foster innovation. States, on the other hand, are primarily
      responsible for academic standards, curriculum, and graduation requirements; teacher
      certification; and a majority of public school funding. Any major changes to these
      responsibilities would require an act of Congress. Historically, the federal government
      has played an essential role in prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal
      opportunity for all students. Certain federal standards and guardrails also ensure
      that taxpayer dollars are well spent on quality education. Shifting responsibility
      to the states without providing any mechanisms for accountability or oversight
      at the federal level would undoubtedly make the educational playing field more
      unequal and leave students with the greatest need behind. Editor’s Note : A t

    paragraph_summary: On July 14, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration
      to proceed with plans to lay off over 1,300 employees at the Department of Education
      (DOE), effectively enabling the administration to fulfill its long-standing goal
      of reducing the agency's size, a move supported by conservatives for decades.
      This decision lifted a previous district court injunction and permits the administration
      to continue its efforts while legal challenges are ongoing. Education policy experts,
      Jon Valant and Sara Partridge, discussed the immediate consequences of these layoffs,
      particularly the significant impact on the Office of Federal Student Aid, which
      manages essential programs for nearly 10 million students, including grants and
      student loans. The anticipated reduction in workforce could result in diminished
      support for students and schools, affecting their daily operations and overall
      educational outcomes.

      Truthout On July 14, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for President Donald
      Trump’s administration to fire more than 1,300 workers at the Department of Education
      (DOE). The order, while not a final ruling on the legal merits of the case, lifted
      a district court injunction that had prevented Trump from gutting the federal
      agency. Now, while litigation plays out in the courts, the administration is free
      to move forward with its campaign promise to shut down the DOE — a cause conservatives
      have championed for more than four decades. Truthout spoke with two education
      policy experts at nonprofit think tanks to learn more about how the mass layoffs
      at the DOE will immediately impact schools, teachers, and students’ daily lives:
      Jon Valant , the director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings
      Institution, where his research specializes in K-12 education policy, and Sara
      Partridge , the associate director of higher education at the Center for American
      Progress. The interview below has been lightly edited for clarity and concision.
      The DOE now stands to be roughly half the size it was in 2024, thanks to a combination
      of layoffs and resignations. What do you foresee as the most immediate or urgent
      impacts of the Supreme Court order allowing the Trump administration’s mass firings
      to continue? Sara Partridge : One area that the workforce reductions were largely
      concentrated in is the Office of Federal Student Aid, which administers grant,
      work study, and student loan programs for 9.9 million students each year. The
      Office of Federal Student Aid is responsible for processing the Free Application
      for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), disbursing student loan forms, managing repayment
      of student loans, and providing oversight and monitoring of all the parties that
      participate in the federal student aid program. They also provide information
      to students and families and help to resolve complaints and issues related to
      student loan servicing. These are important responsibilities that ensure students
      across the country can access postsecondary education and repay their loans, and
      that taxpayer dollars spent on financial aid go to programs that meet federal
      requirements. Student loan borrowers will in all likelihood face a reduced quality
      of service and more issues with student loan repayment in the coming months and
      years as a result of these changes. Can you talk a little more about the issues
      that current and future student loan borrowers will face? Sara Partridge : Many
      student loan borrowers in repayment are already in distress and facing the risk
      of default. One recent analysis found that as of April, 5.8 million or 31 percent
      of borrowers with a payment due are in late stage delinquency, or more than 90
      days past due on payments. Once payments are 270 days late, the borrower enters
      default and collections may begin. As many as 1.8 million could reach default
      status in July, 1 million in August, and 2 million in September, the study estimated.
      Already, borrowers who are past due on their payments have seen an average credit
      score decrease of 60 points, which will stay on their credit report for 7 years
      and result in less access to credit and higher interest rates. When in default,
      a borrower’s wages, tax returns, and Social Security checks may be garnished.
      Currently, there is a backlog of at least 1.5 million applications for income-driven
      repayment plans, which will likely increase as more borrowers seek to switch out
      of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, due to the fact that the administration
      is restarting interest accrual for those who are currently in an administrative
      forbearance as a result of ongoing litigation against the SAVE plan. When student
      loan borrowers have issues or errors with monthly payments, income-driven repayment
      plans, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, delays for relief under borrower defense
      or closed school discharge, or any other number of issues that their servicer
      fails to resolve, they can contact the Ombudsman Office at the Department of Education.
      As of March 2025, more than 6,500 complaints remained unresolved. I expect that
      these workforce reductions will make it even more challenging for borrowers to
      receive help or relief when they confront errors, challenges, or complex situations
      relating to their student loans. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) also just
      phased out a number of federal student loan repayment plans. How might the Supreme
      Court ruling and this budget bill together reshape the student loan landscape?
      Sara Partridge: The Department has both ongoing and new duties to carry out that
      will require significant expertise, resources, and staff that may no longer be
      available. The Office of Federal Student Aid will have the task of implementing
      a range of new programs as a result of the OBBBA, including introducing new loan
      limits for graduate students and parent borrowers, moving borrowers into new repayment
      plans, and expanding Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs.
      Many of these changes will start to take place July 1, 2026, and some will require
      new regulations to determine how they will be implemented. These are tall tasks
      on a quick timeline, even for a fully staffed Department. Student loan borrowers
      will see a range of changes starting in July 2026, including higher monthly payments
      under the new OBBBA plans. Graduate borrowers and parent borrowers will see new
      limits on federal student loans. The graduate and professional borrowing limits
      will likely disproportionately impact students pursuing medicine, dentistry, and
      other health care fields, forcing many to rely on more risky private student loans.
      The OBBBA also limits repayment options for parent borrowers, barring them from
      accessing income-driven repayment plans. Is there anything students should do
      now to prepare for changes in student aid administration? Sara Partridge: If borrowers
      are past due on their student loan payments, they should contact their servicer
      to work with them to prevent going into default. If they are a Parent PLUS borrower,
      they may want to consider consolidating their loans before July 2026 to access
      the amended income-based repayment plan (although this can, in some cases, reset
      progress toward cancellation, so borrowers should speak with their servicer about
      this choice). If borrowers are facing ongoing challenges with their student loans
      that they cannot get resolution for with their servicer or the Department of Education,
      student loan borrowers can open cases with their congressional representatives,
      which will serve the dual purposes of getting them assistance while also making
      Congress aware of the myriad challenges borrowers are facing right now, and encourage
      them to hold the administration accountable for delivering on its statutory duties.
      When might the effects of reduced capacity at the DOE begin to ripple into K-12
      schools, impacting teachers and students? Jon Valant: It looks like the staffing
      cuts are having negative impacts already. For example, the cuts were heavily concentrated
      in the Institute of Education Sciences, which has been slashed to the point where
      we’re losing access to data that we rely on to evaluate needs and progress. That
      being said, I think the most significant, direct impacts might actually come from
      the funding cuts — or the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold billions
      of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds — that are causing immediate
      headaches and sacrifices from schools. Those are previously approved funds that
      school districts have been promised that suddenly aren’t available for a new school
      year that’s quickly approaching. We’ll see where that ends up, since they’ll have
      to deal with legal and political challenges, but that could mean fewer services
      for English language learners and fewer before- and after-school programs. And
      now, just a month or two before the school year starts, school and district leaders
      are scrambling to figure out what cuts they might have to make to programs and
      staff. Another agency disproportionately targeted by layoffs is the Office for
      Civil Rights. How do you think the DOE’s closing will impact equity and civil
      rights in schools? Jon Valant: Protecting students’ civil rights is one of the
      core functions of the U.S. Department of Education. I’m concerned about what the
      Office for Civil Rights staffing cuts mean for the Education Department’s ability
      to fulfill its obligations in that regard — now and in the future. Maybe even
      more than that, though, I’m concerned with the way that this administration is
      redefining, twisting, and narrowing the Department’s priorities with respect to
      civil rights. In the past, the focus has been on protecting vulnerable groups
      of students. Now, the focus seems to be on weaponizing civil rights enforcement
      to threaten school districts and universities that don’t align with its positions
      on culture-war issues like LGBTQ+ rights. We’ve seen that with universities like
      Harvard and Columbia, as well as with state and local K-12 education agencies,
      including Maine and California. Sara Partridge: The March 2025 workforce reductions
      closed seven of the Department’s 12 regional civil rights offices, laying off
      208 investigators, or 55 percent of the agency’s total investigative staff. A
      recent court filing showed that under the Trump administration, the Office for
      Civil Rights has dismissed civil rights complaints at a rapid-fire pace. Historically,
      close to half of the complaints about civil rights violations have related to
      discrimination due to disability. Students of all backgrounds, but in particular
      those with disabilities, may see their rights to equal educational opportunity
      diminished under this administration, and evidence already suggests that layoffs
      of civil rights investigators are taking their toll. Jon, you wrote in this Brookings
      piece that there’s a “dangerous gap between education’s problems and proposed
      ‘solutions.’” You note chronic absenteeism and large gaps in student test scores.
      Can you explain how dismantling the DOE fails to respond to the key problems you’re
      seeing in education — and how it could make these issues worse for students? Jon
      Valant: Let’s run down some of the many challenges facing K-12 schools in the
      United States right now. We’ve seen years-long declines in academic performance
      — that started before COVID — especially among the country’s lowest-scoring students.
      We continue to battle high rates of chronic absenteeism and other indicators of
      student disengagement. We have alarming data on student mental health and have
      to grapple with challenges related to cell phone use, social media, and other
      issues that originate outside of classrooms. We have a workforce that’s rapidly
      changing with school systems that aren’t equipped to keep up with those changes.
      How does dismantling the U.S. Department of Education or slashing funds for schools
      help with any of that? I have no idea. This is an era of genuine challenges for
      U.S. students and schools, and yet many of our leaders seem more focused on winning
      culture-war battles than actually addressing those challenges. What are some specific
      policies that you think would more adequately address these issues? Jon Valant:
      I think what defines great schools, more than anything, is outstanding teachers
      and instruction. We can use policy more strategically to attract, retain, and
      develop excellent teachers, especially in schools that most need additional support.
      I also think we have a lot of work to do in evaluating the quality of curricular
      materials, encouraging schools and districts to adopt high-quality curricula,
      and training teachers in those curricula. And, really, I’d like to see policymakers
      think more seriously about schools’ role in sustaining a healthy democracy and
      cohesive society. School isn’t only about preparing students for college and the
      workforce. It’s also about developing an ability to get along with another, respect
      other people’s perspectives and experiences, know how to spot misinformation,
      and value the country’s norms and institutions. Is there any angle or consequence
      you think is being overlooked in media coverage of the DOE dismantlement? Sara
      Partridge: The nearly $900 million in cuts to federal education research undertaken
      by the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) are a critical blow
      to researchers’ and policymakers’ understanding of education outcomes, trends,
      and issues. In postsecondary education, these contracts help us understand how
      student loan dollars are distributed and the outcomes of students who borrow for
      college. They help us understand who continues to face barriers to enrolling and
      graduating from college. Some of these studies are longitudinal and take place
      over a decade or more, so interrupting and re-starting them means wasted resources
      and years of lost time. Canceling these projects is short-sighted and could potentially
      be deeply damaging to the long-term future of the American education system. Republicans
      frame closing the DOE as an effort to give power back to the states. What role
      do the states play in this? Is it actually feasible for states to take over the
      DOE’s functions? Jon Valant: President Trump likes to say that he’s “sending education
      back to the states.” But the truth is that states and localities, not the federal
      government, have been the key actors in K-12 education all along. For example,
      the federal government only covers about one-tenth of the expenses for K-12 education,
      with state and local governments covering the rest. The federal government isn’t
      involved in selecting curriculum or deciding what content students should learn.
      It doesn’t hire teachers and school leaders or even decide what standards should
      be used for hiring teachers and school leaders. Those responsibilities fall to
      more local levels of government. That’s not to say that the federal government
      isn’t important in K-12 education — it is. It plays key roles in protecting students’
      civil rights, collecting data and supporting research, and providing funding and
      support to vulnerable groups, like students with disabilities and students in
      poverty. Sara Partridge: The federal government conducts research and oversight,
      ensures students’ civil rights are protected, distributes funding to states and
      schools, administers postsecondary student financial aid, and runs grant programs
      that help fill gaps or foster innovation. States, on the other hand, are primarily
      responsible for academic standards, curriculum, and graduation requirements; teacher
      certification; and a majority of public school funding. Any major changes to these
      responsibilities would require an act of Congress. Historically, the federal government
      has played an essential role in prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal
      opportunity for all students. Certain federal standards and guardrails also ensure
      that taxpayer dollars are well spent on quality education. Shifting responsibility
      to the states without providing any mechanisms for accountability or oversight
      at the federal level would undoubtedly make the educational playing field more
      unequal and leave students with the greatest need behind. Editor’s Note : A t

      donation . By Jonathan Cook / Jonathan Cook Blog The Financial Times revealed
      this month that a cabal of Israeli investors, one of the world’s top business
      consulting groups and a think-tank headed by former British prime minister Tony
      Blair had been secretly working on plans to exploit the ruins of Gaza as prime
      real estate. The secret consortium appears to have been seeking practical ways
      to realise US President Donlad Trump’s “vision” of Gaza as the “Riviera of the
      Middle East”: transforming the small coastal enclave into a playground for the
      rich and an enticing investment opportunity, once it can be ethnically cleansed
      of its Palestinian population. Meanwhile, the UK government has declared Palestine
      Action a terrorist organisation – the first time in British history that a direct-action
      campaign group has been banned under Britain’s already draconian terrorism legislation.
      Notably, the government of Keir Starmer took the decision to proscribe Palestine
      Action after lobbying from Elbit Systems, an Israeli weapons maker whose factories
      in the UK have been targeted by Palestine Action for disruption. Elbit supplies
      Israel with killer drones and other weapons central to Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
      These revelations came to light as the United Nation’s special rapporteur on the
      occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, published a report – titled
      “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide” – exposing Big Business’ extensive
      involvement in, and profits from, Israel’s crimes in Gaza. In an interview with
      US journalist Chris Hedges, Albanese, an expert in international law, concluded:
      “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped, because it is lucrative. It’s profitable
      for far too many.” Albanese lists dozens of major western companies that are deeply
      invested in Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people. This is not a new development,
      as she notes. These firms have exploited business opportunities associated with
      Israel’s violent occupation of the Palestinian people’s lands for years, and in
      some cases decades. The switch from Israel’s occupation of Gaza to its current
      genocide hasn’t threatened profits; it has enhanced them. Or as Albanese puts
      it: “The profits have increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into
      an economy of genocide.” The special rapporteur has been a growing thorn in the
      side of Israel and its western sponsors over the past 21 months of slaughter in
      Gaza. That explains why Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of state, announced soon
      after her report was issued that he was imposing sanctions on Albanese for her
      efforts to shed light on the crimes of Israeli and US officials. Revealingly,
      he called her statements – rooted in international law – “economic warfare against
      the United States and Israel”. Albanese and the UN system of universal human rights
      that stands behind her, it seems, represent a threat to western profiteering.
      Window on the future Israel effectively serves as the world’s largest business
      incubator – though, in its case, not just by nurturing start-up companies. Rather,
      it offers global corporations the chance to test and refine new weapons, machinery,
      technologies, data collection and automation processes in the occupied territories.
      These developments are associated with mass oppression, control, surveillance,
      incarceration, ethnic cleansing – and now genocide. In a world of shrinking resources
      and growing climate chaos, such innovative technologies of subjugation are likely
      to have domestic, in addition to overseas, applications. Gaza is the corporate
      world’s laboratory, and a window into our own future. In her 60-page report, Albanese
      writes that her research “reveals how the forever-occupation has become the ideal
      testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech… while investors and private
      and public institutions profit freely”. Her point was underscored by the Israeli
      arms firm Rafael, which issued a promotional video of its Spike FireFly drone
      that showed it locating, chasing and killing a Palestinian in what it called “urban
      warfare” in Gaza. In September, the UK government will welcome Rafael and other
      Israeli weapons companies to London to sell weapons like this drone. Israel uses
      murder as marketing. https://t.co/7oShowLwtD — CAAT (@CAATuk) July 14, 2025 As
      the UN special rapporteur points out, quite aside from the issue of genocide in
      Gaza, western companies have been under a legal and moral obligation to sever
      ties with Israel’s system of occupation since last summer. That was when the world’s
      highest court, the International Court of Justice, ruled Israel’s decades-old
      occupation was a criminal enterprise based on apartheid and forcible transfer
      – or what Albanese refers to as policies of “displacement and replacement”. Instead,
      the corporate sector – and western governments – continue to deepen their involvement
      in Israel’s crimes. It is not just arms manufacturers profiting from the genocidal
      levelling of Gaza and the occupations of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Big
      Tech, construction and materials firms, agribusiness, the tourism industry, the
      goods and services sector, and supply chains have also got in on the act. And
      enabling it all is a finance sector – which includes banks, pension funds, universities,
      insurers and charities – keen to continue investing in this architecture of oppression.
      Albanese describes the mosaic of companies partnering with Israel as “an eco-system
      sustaining this illegality”. Escaping scrutiny For these corporations and their
      enablers, international law – the legal system Albanese and her fellow UN rapporteurs
      are there to uphold – serves as an impediment to the pursuit of profit. Albanese
      notes that the business sector can escape scrutiny by shielding behind other actors.
      Israel and its senior officials are on notice for committing genocide, crimes
      against humanity and war crimes. When she wrote to 48 companies to warn them that
      they were colluding in this criminality, they either responded that this was Israel’s
      responsibility, not theirs, or that it was for states, not international law,
      to regulate their business activities. Corporations, Albanese points out, can
      secure their biggest profits in the “grey areas of the law” – laws they have helped
      to shape. Lockheed Martin’s F-35 jets, whose “beast mode” has been shop-windowed
      by Israel as it has destroyed Gaza, depend on some 1,600 other specialist firms
      operating in eight separate states, including Britain. Late last month the UK
      high court, while admitting British-made components used in the F-35 were likely
      to contribute to war crimes in Gaza, ruled that it was up to Starmer’s government
      to make “acutely sensitive and political” decisions about the export of these
      parts. UK foreign secretary David Lammy, by contrast, told a parliamentary committee
      it was not for the government to assess whether Israel was committing war crimes
      in Gaza, using British arms, it was “a decision for the court”. Abtisam Mohamed:
      "Have they [Israel] breached international law?" David Lammy: "That''s a decision
      for a court, its not a decision for the govt" "But the court said its a decision
      for the executive" "Sorry?" pic.twitter.com/lLkectWyV0 — Saul Staniforth (@SaulStaniforth)
      July 8, 2025 Lockheed Martin has joined the buck-passing. A spokesperson said
      : “Foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions. Discussions
      about those sales are best addressed by the US government.” Big Tech collusion
      Albanese also points the finger at leading tech firms for rapidly and deeply embedding
      in Israel’s illegal occupation, including by acquiring Israeli start-ups that
      exploit expertise gained from the oppression of Palestinians. The NSO Group has
      developed Pegasus phone spyware that is now being used to surveill politicians,
      journalists and human rights activists around the world. Last year the Biden administration
      signed a contract with another Israeli spyware firm, Paragon. Will we learn one
      day that the US used exactly this kind of technology to spy on Albanese and other
      international law experts, on the pretext that they were waging so-called “economic
      warfare”? IBM trains Israeli military and intelligence personnel, and is central
      to the collection and storage of biometric data on Palestinians. Hewlett Packard
      Enterprises supplies technology to Israel’s occupation regime, prison service
      and police. Microsoft has developed its largest centre outside the US in Israel,
      from which it has fashioned systems for use by the Israeli military, while Google
      and Amazon have a $1.2 billion contract to provide it with tech infrastructure.
      The prestigious research university MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
      has collaborated with Israel and companies like Elbit to develop automated weapons
      systems for drones and refine their swarm formations. Palantir, which supplies
      the Israeli military with Artificial Intelligence platforms, announced a deeper
      strategic partnership in January 2024, early in Israel’s slaughter in Gaza, over
      what the Bloomberg news agency termed “Battle Tech”. Over the past 21 months,
      Israel has been introducing new automated programs driven by AI – such as “ Lavendar
      ”, “Gospel” and “ Where’s Daddy? ” – to select huge numbers of targets in Gaza
      with little or no human oversight. Albanese calls this “the dark side of the start-up
      nation that is so embedded, so intimately related to the military industry aims
      and gains.” Not surprisingly, tech firms are falling back on all-too-familiar
      smears against the special rapporteur and the UN for pulling back the veil on
      their activities. The Washington Post reported that, in the wake of Albanese’s
      report, Google’s co-founder, Sergey Brin, called the UN “transparently antisemitic”
      in a chat on a staff forum. Concentration camp There are a long list of other
      household names in Albanese’s report: Caterpillar, Volvo and Hyundai are accused
      of supplying heavy machinery to destroy homes, mosques and infrastructure in Gaza
      and the West Bank. Leading banks such as BNP Paribas and Barclays have underwritten
      treasury bonds to boost market confidence in Israel through the genocide and maintain
      its favourable interest rates. BP, Chevron and other energy firms are profiting
      from existing gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean and pipelines that pass
      through Palestinian maritime waters off Gaza. Israel issued exploration licences
      for Gaza’s own undeveloped gas field, off the coast, shortly after launching its
      genocidal slaughter. Israel’s latest plan to create, in its own words, a “ concentration”
      camp inside Gaza – where Palestinian civilians are to be tightly confined under
      armed guard – will doubtless rely on business partnerships similar to those behind
      the bogus “aid distribution hubs” Israel has already imposed on the enclave’s
      people. Israeli soldiers have testified that they are being ordered to shoot into
      crowds of starving Palestinians queueing for food at these hubs – explaining why
      dozens of Palestinians have been killed daily for weeks on end. Those hubs, run
      by the misleadingly named Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, were in part the brainchild
      of the Boston Consulting Group, the same management consultants caught this month
      plotting to turn Gaza into Trump’s Palestinian-free “Riviera of the Middle East”.
      Israel’s planned concentration camp built on the ruins of the city of Rafah –
      to be termed, again deceptively, a “humanitarian zone” – will require all those
      entering to be “security screened”, using biometric data, before their incarceration.
      Doubtless other contractors, using largely automated systems, will control the
      camp’s interior until, in the Israeli government’s words, “an emigration plan”
      can be implemented to expel the population from Gaza. Albanese points to the many
      precedents for private corporations driving some of the most horrifying crimes
      in history, from slavery to the Holocaust. Albanese urges lawyers and civil society
      actors to pursue legal avenues against these firms in the countries in which they
      are registered. Where possible, consumers should exert what pressure they can
      by boycotting these corporations. She concludes by recommending that states impose
      sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel. Further, she calls on the besieged International
      Criminal Court – four of whose judges are, like her, under US sanctions – as well
      as national courts “to investigate and prosecute corporate executives and/or corporate
      entities for their part in the commission of international crimes and laundering
      of the proceeds from those crimes”. Psychopathic culture All of this is crucial
      to understanding why western capitals have continued to partner in Israel’s slaughter,
      even as Holocaust and genocide scholars – many of them Israeli – have reached
      a firm consensus that its actions amount to genocide. Governing parties in western
      countries like the US and Britain are largely dependent on Big Business, both
      for their electoral success and, after victory at the polling booth, in maintaining
      popularity through the promotion of “economic stability”. Keir Starmer reached
      power in the UK after spurning the popular grassroots funding model of his predecessor,
      Jeremy Corbyn, and wooing instead the corporate sector with promises that the
      party would be in its pocket. His reassurances were also key to making sure the
      billionaire-owned media – which had ferociously turned on Corbyn, constantly vilifying
      him as an “antisemite” for his democratic socialist and pro-Palestinian positions
      – smoothed Starmer’s path to Downing Street. In the US, the billionaires even
      have one of their own in power, in Donald Trump. But even his campaign depended
      on funding from big donors like Miriam Adelson , the Israeli widow of casino magnate
      Sheldon Adelson. Adelson is among a number of top donors, funding both main parties
      , who make no bones about their number one political priority being Israel. Once
      in power, parties are then effectively held to ransom by major corporations on
      large areas of domestic and foreign policy. The financial sector had to be bailed
      out by taxpayers – and still is through so-called “austerity measures” – after
      its reckless excesses crashed the global ecomomy in the late 2000s. Western governments
      considered the banks “too big to fail”. Similarly, Israel – the world’s biggest
      incubator for the arms and surveillance industries – is just too big to be allowed
      to fail as well. Even as it commits genocide. Critics of the rise of globalised
      corporations over the past half century, such as famed linguist Noam Chomsky and
      law professor Joel Bakan, have long noted the inherently psychopathic traits of
      corporate culture. Corporations are legally obligated to pursue profit and prioritise
      shareholder value over other considerations. Limitations on their freedoms to
      do so are near non-existent after waves of deregulation from suborned western
      governments. Bakan observes that corporations are indifferent to the suffering
      or safety of others. They are incapable of maintaining enduring relationships.
      They lack any sense of guilt, or capacity for self-restraint. And they lie, cheat
      and deceive to maximise profits. These psychopathic tendencies have been on show
      in scandal after scandal, whether from the tobacco and banking industries, or
      from pharmaceutical and energy companies. Why would Big Business behave any better
      in pursuing profits tied up in the Gaza genocide? Bakan addresses those who confuse
      his argument with a conspiracy theory. The psychopathic behaviours of corporations
      simply reflect the legal imperatives on them as institutions – what he calls their
      “logical dynamic” – to maximise profit and sideline rivals, whatever the consequences
      for the wider society, future generations or the planet. Growing fat on genocide
      The stakes in Gaza are high for western governments precisely because they are
      so high for the business world growing fat on Israel’s genocide. Governments and
      corporations have an overwhelming shared interest in protecting Israel from scrutiny
      and criticism: it serves as their colonial attack dog in the oil-rich Middle East,
      and it acts as a cash-cow for the weapons, surveillance and incarceration industries.
      Which explains why Trump and Starmer, on one side, and university administrations,
      on the other, have invested so much political and moral capital in crushing the
      spaces, especially in academia, where free speech and protest are supposed to
      be most prized. The unversities are far from a disinterested party. Before their
      campus encampments were trashed by police, student demonstrators sought to highlight
      how heavily invested the universities are in the economy of occupation and genocide,
      both financially and through research partnerships with the Israeli military and
      Israeli universities. The need to ringfence Israel from scrutiny also explains
      rapid moves in the West both to impute “antisemitism” to every effort to hold
      Israel, or its genocidal army, to account. The desperate lengths to which governments
      will go was on display this month as UK officials and the establishment media
      kicked up a storm of outrage after a punk band at Glastonbury chanted “Death,
      death to the IDF!” – a reference to Israel’s genocidal army. And as the power
      of the antisemitism accusation has weakened from misuse, western capitals are
      now rewriting their statutes to designate as “terrorism” any attempt to put a
      spoke in the wheels of the genocide economy, by for example sabotaging weapons
      factories. Morality and international law are being scattered to the winds to
      keep the West’s most important colonial spin-off a money-maker. Business as usual
      Israel’s indispensability to the corporate sector and a captured western political
      class extends far beyond tiny Gaza. Israel is playing an outsize role as a war-industries
      incubator on a global battlefield in which the West seeks to ensure its continuing
      military and economic primacy over China. Last month the global business elite
      – comprising tech billionaires and corporate titans, joined by political leaders,
      media editors, and military and intelligence officials – met once again at the
      publicity-shy Bilderberg summit , this year hosted in Stockholm. Prominent were
      the CEOs of major “defence” suppliers and arms manufacturers such as Palantir,
      Thales, Helsing, Anduril and Saab. Drone warfare – being used in innovative ways
      by key military clients like Israel and Ukraine – was high on the agenda . The
      greater integration of AI into drones appears to have been a mainstay of the discussions.
      The subtext this year, as in recent years, was a supposed rising threat from China
      and an associated “authoritarian axis” comprising Russia, Iran and North Korea.
      This threat is seen chiefly in economic and technological terms. In May, Eric
      Schmidt, the former head of Google and a Bilderberg board member, wrote with alarm
      in the New York Times: “China is at parity or pulling ahead of the United States
      in a variety of technologies, notably at the AI frontier.” He added that the West
      was in a race against China over the imminent development of super-intelligent
      AI, which would give the winner “the keys to control the entire world”. Schmidt,
      like other Bilderberg regulars, predicts that the power-draining needs of super
      AI will lead to ever-intensifying energy wars for the West to stay top dog. Or
      as a Guardian report on the conference summed up the mood : “In this desperate
      winner-takes-all race for the keys to the world, in which the ‘geopolitics of
      energy’ becomes ever more important, power stations – along with the data centers
      they feed – are going to become the No 1 military targets.” Israel’s slaughter
      in Gaza is seen as playing a critical role in opening up the “battlescape”. The
      same corporations cashing in on the Gaza genocide stand to benefit from the more
      permissive environment – legally and militarily – created by Israel for future
      wars, ones where massacred civilians count only as “incidental deaths”. An April
      article in the New Yorker magazine set out the challenge facing US military planners,
      who have considered themselves hobbled since the 1980s by the rise of a human
      rights community that developed an expertise in the laws of war independently
      from the Pentagon’s self-serving interpretations. The result, say US generals
      regretfully, has been a “general aversion to collateral damage risk” – that is,
      killing civilians. Pentagon military planners are keen to use the slaughter in
      Gaza as a precedent for their own genocidal violence in subduing future economic
      rivals like China and Russia who threaten the official US doctrine of “global
      full-spectrum dominance”. The New Yorker sets out this thinking: “Gaza not only
      looks like a dress rehearsal for the kind of combat US soldiers may face. It is
      a test of the American public’s tolerance for the levels of death and destruction
      that such kinds of warfare entail.” According to the magazine, the genocidal violence
      being unleashed by Israel is opening up the “legal maneuver space” – the space
      needed to commit crimes against humanity in full view. This is where much of the
      impulse comes from in western capitals to normalise the genocide – present it
      as business as usual – and demonise its opponents. The arms makers and tech companies
      whose coffers have been swollen by Israel’s genocide in Gaza stand to make far
      greater riches from a similarly devastating war against China. Whatever the script
      we are sold, there will be nothing moral or existential about this coming battle.
      As ever, it will be about rich people keen to get even richer. Editor’s Note :

    one_sentence_summary: A recent Financial Times report reveals that a secret consortium,
      including Israeli investors and a think-tank led by Tony Blair, has been planning

      it into a luxury destination in line with Donald Trump's vision of the region.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article by Jonathan Cook, it was revealed that a
      secret consortium involving Israeli investors, a major business consulting group,
      and a think-tank led by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has been planning
      to exploit the ruins of Gaza as lucrative real estate, aligning with Donald Trump's
      vision of transforming Gaza into a wealthy resort area after the displacement
      of its Palestinian population. Concurrently, the UK government has designated
      Palestine Action, a direct-action campaign group opposing Israeli actions, as
      a terrorist organization, following pressure from Elbit Systems, an Israeli arms
      manufacturer. This decision marks a significant escalation in the UK's response
      to activism against Israel's military actions, which have been criticized in a
      report by UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese, highlighting the complicity
      of big business in the ongoing violence and occupation in Gaza.

      donation . By Jonathan Cook / Jonathan Cook Blog The Financial Times revealed
      this month that a cabal of Israeli investors, one of the world’s top business
      consulting groups and a think-tank headed by former British prime minister Tony
      Blair had been secretly working on plans to exploit the ruins of Gaza as prime
      real estate. The secret consortium appears to have been seeking practical ways
      to realise US President Donlad Trump’s “vision” of Gaza as the “Riviera of the
      Middle East”: transforming the small coastal enclave into a playground for the
      rich and an enticing investment opportunity, once it can be ethnically cleansed
      of its Palestinian population. Meanwhile, the UK government has declared Palestine
      Action a terrorist organisation – the first time in British history that a direct-action
      campaign group has been banned under Britain’s already draconian terrorism legislation.
      Notably, the government of Keir Starmer took the decision to proscribe Palestine
      Action after lobbying from Elbit Systems, an Israeli weapons maker whose factories
      in the UK have been targeted by Palestine Action for disruption. Elbit supplies
      Israel with killer drones and other weapons central to Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
      These revelations came to light as the United Nation’s special rapporteur on the
      occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, published a report – titled
      “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide” – exposing Big Business’ extensive
      involvement in, and profits from, Israel’s crimes in Gaza. In an interview with
      US journalist Chris Hedges, Albanese, an expert in international law, concluded:
      “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped, because it is lucrative. It’s profitable
      for far too many.” Albanese lists dozens of major western companies that are deeply
      invested in Israel’s oppression of the Palestinian people. This is not a new development,
      as she notes. These firms have exploited business opportunities associated with
      Israel’s violent occupation of the Palestinian people’s lands for years, and in
      some cases decades. The switch from Israel’s occupation of Gaza to its current
      genocide hasn’t threatened profits; it has enhanced them. Or as Albanese puts
      it: “The profits have increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into
      an economy of genocide.” The special rapporteur has been a growing thorn in the
      side of Israel and its western sponsors over the past 21 months of slaughter in
      Gaza. That explains why Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of state, announced soon
      after her report was issued that he was imposing sanctions on Albanese for her
      efforts to shed light on the crimes of Israeli and US officials. Revealingly,
      he called her statements – rooted in international law – “economic warfare against
      the United States and Israel”. Albanese and the UN system of universal human rights
      that stands behind her, it seems, represent a threat to western profiteering.
      Window on the future Israel effectively serves as the world’s largest business
      incubator – though, in its case, not just by nurturing start-up companies. Rather,
      it offers global corporations the chance to test and refine new weapons, machinery,
      technologies, data collection and automation processes in the occupied territories.
      These developments are associated with mass oppression, control, surveillance,
      incarceration, ethnic cleansing – and now genocide. In a world of shrinking resources
      and growing climate chaos, such innovative technologies of subjugation are likely
      to have domestic, in addition to overseas, applications. Gaza is the corporate
      world’s laboratory, and a window into our own future. In her 60-page report, Albanese
      writes that her research “reveals how the forever-occupation has become the ideal
      testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech… while investors and private
      and public institutions profit freely”. Her point was underscored by the Israeli
      arms firm Rafael, which issued a promotional video of its Spike FireFly drone
      that showed it locating, chasing and killing a Palestinian in what it called “urban
      warfare” in Gaza. In September, the UK government will welcome Rafael and other
      Israeli weapons companies to London to sell weapons like this drone. Israel uses
      murder as marketing. https://t.co/7oShowLwtD — CAAT (@CAATuk) July 14, 2025 As
      the UN special rapporteur points out, quite aside from the issue of genocide in
      Gaza, western companies have been under a legal and moral obligation to sever
      ties with Israel’s system of occupation since last summer. That was when the world’s
      highest court, the International Court of Justice, ruled Israel’s decades-old
      occupation was a criminal enterprise based on apartheid and forcible transfer
      – or what Albanese refers to as policies of “displacement and replacement”. Instead,
      the corporate sector – and western governments – continue to deepen their involvement
      in Israel’s crimes. It is not just arms manufacturers profiting from the genocidal
      levelling of Gaza and the occupations of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Big
      Tech, construction and materials firms, agribusiness, the tourism industry, the
      goods and services sector, and supply chains have also got in on the act. And
      enabling it all is a finance sector – which includes banks, pension funds, universities,
      insurers and charities – keen to continue investing in this architecture of oppression.
      Albanese describes the mosaic of companies partnering with Israel as “an eco-system
      sustaining this illegality”. Escaping scrutiny For these corporations and their
      enablers, international law – the legal system Albanese and her fellow UN rapporteurs
      are there to uphold – serves as an impediment to the pursuit of profit. Albanese
      notes that the business sector can escape scrutiny by shielding behind other actors.
      Israel and its senior officials are on notice for committing genocide, crimes
      against humanity and war crimes. When she wrote to 48 companies to warn them that
      they were colluding in this criminality, they either responded that this was Israel’s
      responsibility, not theirs, or that it was for states, not international law,
      to regulate their business activities. Corporations, Albanese points out, can
      secure their biggest profits in the “grey areas of the law” – laws they have helped
      to shape. Lockheed Martin’s F-35 jets, whose “beast mode” has been shop-windowed
      by Israel as it has destroyed Gaza, depend on some 1,600 other specialist firms
      operating in eight separate states, including Britain. Late last month the UK
      high court, while admitting British-made components used in the F-35 were likely
      to contribute to war crimes in Gaza, ruled that it was up to Starmer’s government
      to make “acutely sensitive and political” decisions about the export of these
      parts. UK foreign secretary David Lammy, by contrast, told a parliamentary committee
      it was not for the government to assess whether Israel was committing war crimes
      in Gaza, using British arms, it was “a decision for the court”. Abtisam Mohamed:
      "Have they [Israel] breached international law?" David Lammy: "That''s a decision
      for a court, its not a decision for the govt" "But the court said its a decision
      for the executive" "Sorry?" pic.twitter.com/lLkectWyV0 — Saul Staniforth (@SaulStaniforth)
      July 8, 2025 Lockheed Martin has joined the buck-passing. A spokesperson said
      : “Foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions. Discussions
      about those sales are best addressed by the US government.” Big Tech collusion
      Albanese also points the finger at leading tech firms for rapidly and deeply embedding
      in Israel’s illegal occupation, including by acquiring Israeli start-ups that
      exploit expertise gained from the oppression of Palestinians. The NSO Group has
      developed Pegasus phone spyware that is now being used to surveill politicians,
      journalists and human rights activists around the world. Last year the Biden administration
      signed a contract with another Israeli spyware firm, Paragon. Will we learn one
      day that the US used exactly this kind of technology to spy on Albanese and other
      international law experts, on the pretext that they were waging so-called “economic
      warfare”? IBM trains Israeli military and intelligence personnel, and is central
      to the collection and storage of biometric data on Palestinians. Hewlett Packard
      Enterprises supplies technology to Israel’s occupation regime, prison service
      and police. Microsoft has developed its largest centre outside the US in Israel,
      from which it has fashioned systems for use by the Israeli military, while Google
      and Amazon have a $1.2 billion contract to provide it with tech infrastructure.
      The prestigious research university MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
      has collaborated with Israel and companies like Elbit to develop automated weapons
      systems for drones and refine their swarm formations. Palantir, which supplies
      the Israeli military with Artificial Intelligence platforms, announced a deeper
      strategic partnership in January 2024, early in Israel’s slaughter in Gaza, over
      what the Bloomberg news agency termed “Battle Tech”. Over the past 21 months,
      Israel has been introducing new automated programs driven by AI – such as “ Lavendar
      ”, “Gospel” and “ Where’s Daddy? ” – to select huge numbers of targets in Gaza
      with little or no human oversight. Albanese calls this “the dark side of the start-up
      nation that is so embedded, so intimately related to the military industry aims
      and gains.” Not surprisingly, tech firms are falling back on all-too-familiar
      smears against the special rapporteur and the UN for pulling back the veil on
      their activities. The Washington Post reported that, in the wake of Albanese’s
      report, Google’s co-founder, Sergey Brin, called the UN “transparently antisemitic”
      in a chat on a staff forum. Concentration camp There are a long list of other
      household names in Albanese’s report: Caterpillar, Volvo and Hyundai are accused
      of supplying heavy machinery to destroy homes, mosques and infrastructure in Gaza
      and the West Bank. Leading banks such as BNP Paribas and Barclays have underwritten
      treasury bonds to boost market confidence in Israel through the genocide and maintain
      its favourable interest rates. BP, Chevron and other energy firms are profiting
      from existing gas fields in the eastern Mediterranean and pipelines that pass
      through Palestinian maritime waters off Gaza. Israel issued exploration licences
      for Gaza’s own undeveloped gas field, off the coast, shortly after launching its
      genocidal slaughter. Israel’s latest plan to create, in its own words, a “ concentration”
      camp inside Gaza – where Palestinian civilians are to be tightly confined under
      armed guard – will doubtless rely on business partnerships similar to those behind
      the bogus “aid distribution hubs” Israel has already imposed on the enclave’s
      people. Israeli soldiers have testified that they are being ordered to shoot into
      crowds of starving Palestinians queueing for food at these hubs – explaining why
      dozens of Palestinians have been killed daily for weeks on end. Those hubs, run
      by the misleadingly named Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, were in part the brainchild
      of the Boston Consulting Group, the same management consultants caught this month
      plotting to turn Gaza into Trump’s Palestinian-free “Riviera of the Middle East”.
      Israel’s planned concentration camp built on the ruins of the city of Rafah –
      to be termed, again deceptively, a “humanitarian zone” – will require all those
      entering to be “security screened”, using biometric data, before their incarceration.
      Doubtless other contractors, using largely automated systems, will control the
      camp’s interior until, in the Israeli government’s words, “an emigration plan”
      can be implemented to expel the population from Gaza. Albanese points to the many
      precedents for private corporations driving some of the most horrifying crimes
      in history, from slavery to the Holocaust. Albanese urges lawyers and civil society
      actors to pursue legal avenues against these firms in the countries in which they
      are registered. Where possible, consumers should exert what pressure they can
      by boycotting these corporations. She concludes by recommending that states impose
      sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel. Further, she calls on the besieged International
      Criminal Court – four of whose judges are, like her, under US sanctions – as well
      as national courts “to investigate and prosecute corporate executives and/or corporate
      entities for their part in the commission of international crimes and laundering
      of the proceeds from those crimes”. Psychopathic culture All of this is crucial
      to understanding why western capitals have continued to partner in Israel’s slaughter,
      even as Holocaust and genocide scholars – many of them Israeli – have reached
      a firm consensus that its actions amount to genocide. Governing parties in western
      countries like the US and Britain are largely dependent on Big Business, both
      for their electoral success and, after victory at the polling booth, in maintaining
      popularity through the promotion of “economic stability”. Keir Starmer reached
      power in the UK after spurning the popular grassroots funding model of his predecessor,
      Jeremy Corbyn, and wooing instead the corporate sector with promises that the
      party would be in its pocket. His reassurances were also key to making sure the
      billionaire-owned media – which had ferociously turned on Corbyn, constantly vilifying
      him as an “antisemite” for his democratic socialist and pro-Palestinian positions
      – smoothed Starmer’s path to Downing Street. In the US, the billionaires even
      have one of their own in power, in Donald Trump. But even his campaign depended
      on funding from big donors like Miriam Adelson , the Israeli widow of casino magnate
      Sheldon Adelson. Adelson is among a number of top donors, funding both main parties
      , who make no bones about their number one political priority being Israel. Once
      in power, parties are then effectively held to ransom by major corporations on
      large areas of domestic and foreign policy. The financial sector had to be bailed
      out by taxpayers – and still is through so-called “austerity measures” – after
      its reckless excesses crashed the global ecomomy in the late 2000s. Western governments
      considered the banks “too big to fail”. Similarly, Israel – the world’s biggest
      incubator for the arms and surveillance industries – is just too big to be allowed
      to fail as well. Even as it commits genocide. Critics of the rise of globalised
      corporations over the past half century, such as famed linguist Noam Chomsky and
      law professor Joel Bakan, have long noted the inherently psychopathic traits of
      corporate culture. Corporations are legally obligated to pursue profit and prioritise
      shareholder value over other considerations. Limitations on their freedoms to
      do so are near non-existent after waves of deregulation from suborned western
      governments. Bakan observes that corporations are indifferent to the suffering
      or safety of others. They are incapable of maintaining enduring relationships.
      They lack any sense of guilt, or capacity for self-restraint. And they lie, cheat
      and deceive to maximise profits. These psychopathic tendencies have been on show
      in scandal after scandal, whether from the tobacco and banking industries, or
      from pharmaceutical and energy companies. Why would Big Business behave any better
      in pursuing profits tied up in the Gaza genocide? Bakan addresses those who confuse
      his argument with a conspiracy theory. The psychopathic behaviours of corporations
      simply reflect the legal imperatives on them as institutions – what he calls their
      “logical dynamic” – to maximise profit and sideline rivals, whatever the consequences
      for the wider society, future generations or the planet. Growing fat on genocide
      The stakes in Gaza are high for western governments precisely because they are
      so high for the business world growing fat on Israel’s genocide. Governments and
      corporations have an overwhelming shared interest in protecting Israel from scrutiny
      and criticism: it serves as their colonial attack dog in the oil-rich Middle East,
      and it acts as a cash-cow for the weapons, surveillance and incarceration industries.
      Which explains why Trump and Starmer, on one side, and university administrations,
      on the other, have invested so much political and moral capital in crushing the
      spaces, especially in academia, where free speech and protest are supposed to
      be most prized. The unversities are far from a disinterested party. Before their
      campus encampments were trashed by police, student demonstrators sought to highlight
      how heavily invested the universities are in the economy of occupation and genocide,
      both financially and through research partnerships with the Israeli military and
      Israeli universities. The need to ringfence Israel from scrutiny also explains
      rapid moves in the West both to impute “antisemitism” to every effort to hold
      Israel, or its genocidal army, to account. The desperate lengths to which governments
      will go was on display this month as UK officials and the establishment media
      kicked up a storm of outrage after a punk band at Glastonbury chanted “Death,
      death to the IDF!” – a reference to Israel’s genocidal army. And as the power
      of the antisemitism accusation has weakened from misuse, western capitals are
      now rewriting their statutes to designate as “terrorism” any attempt to put a
      spoke in the wheels of the genocide economy, by for example sabotaging weapons
      factories. Morality and international law are being scattered to the winds to
      keep the West’s most important colonial spin-off a money-maker. Business as usual
      Israel’s indispensability to the corporate sector and a captured western political
      class extends far beyond tiny Gaza. Israel is playing an outsize role as a war-industries
      incubator on a global battlefield in which the West seeks to ensure its continuing
      military and economic primacy over China. Last month the global business elite
      – comprising tech billionaires and corporate titans, joined by political leaders,
      media editors, and military and intelligence officials – met once again at the
      publicity-shy Bilderberg summit , this year hosted in Stockholm. Prominent were
      the CEOs of major “defence” suppliers and arms manufacturers such as Palantir,
      Thales, Helsing, Anduril and Saab. Drone warfare – being used in innovative ways
      by key military clients like Israel and Ukraine – was high on the agenda . The
      greater integration of AI into drones appears to have been a mainstay of the discussions.
      The subtext this year, as in recent years, was a supposed rising threat from China
      and an associated “authoritarian axis” comprising Russia, Iran and North Korea.
      This threat is seen chiefly in economic and technological terms. In May, Eric
      Schmidt, the former head of Google and a Bilderberg board member, wrote with alarm
      in the New York Times: “China is at parity or pulling ahead of the United States
      in a variety of technologies, notably at the AI frontier.” He added that the West
      was in a race against China over the imminent development of super-intelligent
      AI, which would give the winner “the keys to control the entire world”. Schmidt,
      like other Bilderberg regulars, predicts that the power-draining needs of super
      AI will lead to ever-intensifying energy wars for the West to stay top dog. Or
      as a Guardian report on the conference summed up the mood : “In this desperate
      winner-takes-all race for the keys to the world, in which the ‘geopolitics of
      energy’ becomes ever more important, power stations – along with the data centers
      they feed – are going to become the No 1 military targets.” Israel’s slaughter
      in Gaza is seen as playing a critical role in opening up the “battlescape”. The
      same corporations cashing in on the Gaza genocide stand to benefit from the more
      permissive environment – legally and militarily – created by Israel for future
      wars, ones where massacred civilians count only as “incidental deaths”. An April
      article in the New Yorker magazine set out the challenge facing US military planners,
      who have considered themselves hobbled since the 1980s by the rise of a human
      rights community that developed an expertise in the laws of war independently
      from the Pentagon’s self-serving interpretations. The result, say US generals
      regretfully, has been a “general aversion to collateral damage risk” – that is,
      killing civilians. Pentagon military planners are keen to use the slaughter in
      Gaza as a precedent for their own genocidal violence in subduing future economic
      rivals like China and Russia who threaten the official US doctrine of “global
      full-spectrum dominance”. The New Yorker sets out this thinking: “Gaza not only
      looks like a dress rehearsal for the kind of combat US soldiers may face. It is
      a test of the American public’s tolerance for the levels of death and destruction
      that such kinds of warfare entail.” According to the magazine, the genocidal violence
      being unleashed by Israel is opening up the “legal maneuver space” – the space
      needed to commit crimes against humanity in full view. This is where much of the
      impulse comes from in western capitals to normalise the genocide – present it
      as business as usual – and demonise its opponents. The arms makers and tech companies
      whose coffers have been swollen by Israel’s genocide in Gaza stand to make far
      greater riches from a similarly devastating war against China. Whatever the script
      we are sold, there will be nothing moral or existential about this coming battle.
      As ever, it will be about rich people keen to get even richer. Editor’s Note :

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article by Jonathan Cook, it was revealed that a
      secret consortium involving Israeli investors, a major business consulting group,
      and a think-tank led by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has been planning
      to exploit the ruins of Gaza as lucrative real estate, aligning with Donald Trump's
      vision of transforming Gaza into a wealthy resort area after the displacement
      of its Palestinian population. Concurrently, the UK government has designated
      Palestine Action, a direct-action campaign group opposing Israeli actions, as
      a terrorist organization, following pressure from Elbit Systems, an Israeli arms
      manufacturer. This decision marks a significant escalation in the UK's response
      to activism against Israel's military actions, which have been criticized in a
      report by UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese, highlighting the complicity
      of big business in the ongoing violence and occupation in Gaza.

      academics, and writers gathered at John Jay College of Criminal Justice for the
      annual Left Forum conference. With roots in the Socialists Scholars Conference,
      Left Forum was regularly one of the largest gatherings of the U.S. left. The crowd
      of over a thousand people ranged from members of small, socialist sects hawking
      newspapers to academics presenting their latest scholarship. That year, Defending
      Rights & Dissent convened a panel on “Defending Dissent in the Age of Trump.”
      Also attending Left Forum that year, we can now report, were multiple Special
      Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including FBI Unit Chief Andrew
      Thomas Mitchell. The agents were there to attend a panel entitled “Russiagate
      and WikiLeaks.” The panel was organized by Randy Credico, a comedian and activist
      who hosted the radio programs “Live on the Fly” and “Assange Countdown to Freedom.”
      Other panelists included Dennis Bernstein, host of KPFK’s Flashpoints; Max Blumenthal,
      founder of the Grayzone ; Anya Parampil, at the time with RT; and Ray McGovern,
      a former CIA analyst turned peace activist. According to the copy of the Left
      Forum program retained by the FBI, Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of Media,
      Culture, and Communication at New York University, was supposed to speak as well.
      Defending Rights & Dissent reviewed a recording of the panel and Miller did not
      participate. The revelation that FBI agents surveilled the panel of journalists
      and activists stem from documents the FBI turned over to Defending Rights & Dissent
      as part of ongoing litigation under the Freedom of Information Act. The two-page
      document is an “FD-302,” a report used by FBI agents to document investigatory
      activity. These reports are most typically used to memorialize interviews. fbi-fd-302-left-forum-russiagate-and-wikileaks
      Download Since September 2024, Defending Rights & Dissent has been suing the FBI
      in order to compel them to turn over their files on WikiLeaks and its founder
      Julian Assange. Although the FD-302 is not labeled by investigation, all other
      files in the document set are part of the investigation titled “Roger J. Stone,
      Jr.; Foreign Agents Registration Act; Sensitive Investigative Matter.” Although
      the caption of the investigation mentions the Foreign Agent Registration Act,
      the opening communication makes clear that Stone was being investigated “in connection
      with his activities related to the unauthorized access of computer data belonging
      to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the unauthorized transmittal and
      disclosure of the data to persons not entitled to see it.” The FBI was investigating
      Stone’s prior knowledge of publications internal DNC emails by WikiLeaks and whether
      he had been in contact with Guccifier 2.0, a hacking group the U.S. government
      claims was a front for Russian intelligence. Other documents make clear Stone
      is being investigated under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as conspiracy
      and aiding and abetting statutes. There is no mention of Stone being an unregistered
      foreign agent. Ultimately, Stone was not charged under any of these statutes but
      instead was charged with obstruction of justice, making false statements to the
      FBI, and witness tampering. He was convicted in November 2019 but pardoned by
      Donald Trump the following year. The investigation was opened as a counterintelligence
      matter on July 25, 2017. Files obtained by Defending Rights & Dissent show that
      Peter Strzok, then Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence
      Division, approved the investigation. roger-stone-investigation-opening-communication
      Download Credico, who hosted the Left Forum panel, was accused of being Stone’s
      “back channel” to WikiLeaks. Credio was subpoenaed both by the House Intelligence
      Committee and by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Under oath during Stone’s trial,
      Credico denied being a back channel. The comedian and radio host referenced the
      subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee during the panel discussion. He
      also said, “Stop giving [Roger Stone] any credibility. Just leave him out. Stop.
      He loves it. He’s eating it up. He had nothing to do with it at all. He insinuated
      himself into the story because he’s an egomaniac and Trump had dumped him and
      he wanted to get back in. So he went fishing. He came to me and I blew him off
      a bunch of times.” Assuming this connection was what led FBI agents to attend
      the Left Forum panel, it is difficult to see any legitimate investigatory value
      to their actions. The two-page investigative report is mostly redacted, including
      what the agents made of the discussion. Unredacted text in the second paragraph
      reads, “The small classroom was packed with observers including people standing
      in the back, sitting on the floor, and peering in through the door. The panel
      lasted approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes. At the conclusion of the panel, [redacted].”
      The second page of the report appears to indicate that an unspecified individual
      was interviewed. It is unclear if the redacted text deals with the interview,
      a report of the panelists’ remarks, something else, or some combination thereof.
      Defending Rights & Dissent reached out to panel organizer Randy Credico. He informed
      us that on that same day at Left Forum, he also performed a comedy set. After
      the set, “a young man and woman, who were dressed like Disney tourists, came up
      to me as I was walking alone and told me how much they loved the show.” As Credico
      was walking away, they revealed themselves to be FBI agents. After speaking with
      the agents for “a minute,” Credico put them on the phone with his attorney who
      made arrangements to speak with them at another date. It is likely this is the
      “interview” referenced in the FD-302. If the FBI’s goal was to interview Credico,
      why the FBI felt the need to attend both a panel of journalists and activists
      and comedy show before approaching him is unclear. The FBI’s actions in this case
      are chilling from the standpoint of First Amendment rights. Left Forum was a political
      conference, held at a college campus. By attending the panel, the FBI learned
      no information of utility to a criminal investigation into violations of the Computer
      Fraud and Abuse Act. But they did observe political speech. Although there are
      serious First Amendment implications to allowing the FBI to secretly attend a
      political panel, the Attorney General guidelines for FBI investigations considers
      information learned from observing an event open to the public to be “public information.”
      For decades, Defending Rights & Dissent and other civil libertarians warned the
      loose rules for attending public events opens the door to allowing the FBI to
      spy on First Amendment-protected activity. The files received in response to the
      Defending Rights & Dissent lawsuit are yet another documentation of their abusive
      nature. Although the FBI spoke with Credico for about a minute before making arrangements
      with his lawyer, they sat through an entire panel during which speakers shared
      their dissenting views on U.S.-Russia relations and the Russiagate investigations.
      Panelists rejected the official explanation that the Democratic National Committee
      had been hacked by Russians or that there was collusion between the Trump campaign
      and Russia. Many of their remarks were openly critical of the FBI, with McGovern
      criticizing Strzok by name. McGovern also stated that his criticism of Russiagate
      led people to believe he was pro-Trump, but he wasn’t. “Trump is the worst president
      of the United States ever had,” the former CIA analyst said. “But if you don’t
      have enough reason to get rid of him on all these other things, including the
      fact that my grandchildren, nine of them will not have clean air to breathe or
      clean water to drink when they’re my age, if you can’t get rid of this guy without
      a phony set up here like Russiagate then you know there’s no hope for you.” Other
      panelists echoed concerns that by focusing on Russiagate as opposed to other issues
      like the economy, Democrats were ineffective at resisting Trump. Bernstein criticized
      the disparate coverage between Russigate and the U.S.-backed Saudi war in Yemen,
      noting the country was on the brink of famine. Bernstein also criticized Rachel
      Maddow, noting that when it came to Russigate, “no minutiae escapes her.” “She
      loves Russiagate right. And she loves the collusion story. She loves that word
      collusion. Collusion and the Trump administration. Well, there was collusion,”
      the Flashpoints host said. “The collusion was between the emerging Trump administration
      and the Israelis to suppress a pro-Palestinian vote at the United Nations. That’s
      what we miss with this kind of horrific reporting.” Ironically, Blumenthal warned
      that Russiagate would become a form of McCarthyism used against the left – a remark
      later confirmed by the presence of the FBI at the panel. At the end of the discussion,
      Credico asked each panelist to explain why WikiLeaks and Julian Assange are important.
      On top of the panelists’ remarks, audience members also made political comments
      during the question and answer session, unaware the FBI was quite literally watching
      and listening to them. All of this First Amendment-protected speech is unrelated
      to any legitimate law enforcement purpose. But it is precisely the type of speech
      the FBI has surveilled in the past. Having any government agent present and listening
      in on a political discussion has a chilling impact. That the FBI is a joint law
      enforcement and national security agency with a long history of spying on the
      First Amendment only compounds the chilling impact. Defending Rights & Dissent’s
      lawsuit against the FBI for their files on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange is ongoing.

      Jr.; Foreign Agents Registration Act; Sensitive Investigative Matter.” Although
      the caption of the investigation mentions the Foreign Agent Registration Act,
      the opening communication makes clear that Stone was being investigated “in connection
      with his activities related to the unauthorized access of computer data belonging
      to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the unauthorized transmittal and
      disclosure of the data to persons not entitled to see it.” The FBI was investigating
      Stone’s prior knowledge of publications internal DNC emails by WikiLeaks and whether
      he had been in contact with Guccifier 2.0, a hacking group the U.S. government
      claims was a front for Russian intelligence. Other documents make clear Stone
      is being investigated under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as conspiracy
      and aiding and abetting statutes. There is no mention of Stone being an unregistered
      foreign agent. Ultimately, Stone was not charged under any of these statutes but
      instead was charged with obstruction of justice, making false statements to the
      FBI, and witness tampering. He was convicted in November 2019 but pardoned by
      Donald Trump the following year. The investigation was opened as a counterintelligence
      matter on July 25, 2017. Files obtained by Defending Rights & Dissent show that
      Peter Strzok, then Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence
      Division, approved the investigation. roger-stone-investigation-opening-communication
      Download Credico, who hosted the Left Forum panel, was accused of being Stone’s
      “back channel” to WikiLeaks. Credio was subpoenaed both by the House Intelligence
      Committee and by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Under oath during Stone’s trial,
      Credico denied being a back channel. The comedian and radio host referenced the
      subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee during the panel discussion. He
      also said, “Stop giving [Roger Stone] any credibility. Just leave him out. Stop.
      He loves it. He’s eating it up. He had nothing to do with it at all. He insinuated
      himself into the story because he’s an egomaniac and Trump had dumped him and
      he wanted to get back in. So he went fishing. He came to me and I blew him off
      a bunch of times.” Assuming this connection was what led FBI agents to attend
      the Left Forum panel, it is difficult to see any legitimate investigatory value
      to their actions. The two-page investigative report is mostly redacted, including
      what the agents made of the discussion. Unredacted text in the second paragraph
      reads, “The small classroom was packed with observers including people standing
      in the back, sitting on the floor, and peering in through the door. The panel
      lasted approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes. At the conclusion of the panel, [redacted].”
      The second page of the report appears to indicate that an unspecified individual
      was interviewed. It is unclear if the redacted text deals with the interview,
      a report of the panelists’ remarks, something else, or some combination thereof.
      Defending Rights & Dissent reached out to panel organizer Randy Credico. He informed
      us that on that same day at Left Forum, he also performed a comedy set. After
      the set, “a young man and woman, who were dressed like Disney tourists, came up
      to me as I was walking alone and told me how much they loved the show.” As Credico
      was walking away, they revealed themselves to be FBI agents. After speaking with
      the agents for “a minute,” Credico put them on the phone with his attorney who
      made arrangements to speak with them at another date. It is likely this is the
      “interview” referenced in the FD-302. If the FBI’s goal was to interview Credico,
      why the FBI felt the need to attend both a panel of journalists and activists
      and comedy show before approaching him is unclear. The FBI’s actions in this case
      are chilling from the standpoint of First Amendment rights. Left Forum was a political
      conference, held at a college campus. By attending the panel, the FBI learned
      no information of utility to a criminal investigation into violations of the Computer
      Fraud and Abuse Act. But they did observe political speech. Although there are
      serious First Amendment implications to allowing the FBI to secretly attend a
      political panel, the Attorney General guidelines for FBI investigations considers
      information learned from observing an event open to the public to be “public information.”
      For decades, Defending Rights & Dissent and other civil libertarians warned the
      loose rules for attending public events opens the door to allowing the FBI to
      spy on First Amendment-protected activity. The files received in response to the
      Defending Rights & Dissent lawsuit are yet another documentation of their abusive
      nature. Although the FBI spoke with Credico for about a minute before making arrangements
      with his lawyer, they sat through an entire panel during which speakers shared
      their dissenting views on U.S.-Russia relations and the Russiagate investigations.
      Panelists rejected the official explanation that the Democratic National Committee
      had been hacked by Russians or that there was collusion between the Trump campaign
      and Russia. Many of their remarks were openly critical of the FBI, with McGovern
      criticizing Strzok by name. McGovern also stated that his criticism of Russiagate
      led people to believe he was pro-Trump, but he wasn’t. “Trump is the worst president
      of the United States ever had,” the former CIA analyst said. “But if you don’t
      have enough reason to get rid of him on all these other things, including the
      fact that my grandchildren, nine of them will not have clean air to breathe or
      clean water to drink when they’re my age, if you can’t get rid of this guy without
      a phony set up here like Russiagate then you know there’s no hope for you.” Other
      panelists echoed concerns that by focusing on Russiagate as opposed to other issues
      like the economy, Democrats were ineffective at resisting Trump. Bernstein criticized
      the disparate coverage between Russigate and the U.S.-backed Saudi war in Yemen,
      noting the country was on the brink of famine. Bernstein also criticized Rachel
      Maddow, noting that when it came to Russigate, “no minutiae escapes her.” “She
      loves Russiagate right. And she loves the collusion story. She loves that word
      collusion. Collusion and the Trump administration. Well, there was collusion,”
      the Flashpoints host said. “The collusion was between the emerging Trump administration
      and the Israelis to suppress a pro-Palestinian vote at the United Nations. That’s
      what we miss with this kind of horrific reporting.” Ironically, Blumenthal warned
      that Russiagate would become a form of McCarthyism used against the left – a remark
      later confirmed by the presence of the FBI at the panel. At the end of the discussion,
      Credico asked each panelist to explain why WikiLeaks and Julian Assange are important.
      On top of the panelists’ remarks, audience members also made political comments
      during the question and answer session, unaware the FBI was quite literally watching
      and listening to them. All of this First Amendment-protected speech is unrelated
      to any legitimate law enforcement purpose. But it is precisely the type of speech
      the FBI has surveilled in the past. Having any government agent present and listening
      in on a political discussion has a chilling impact. That the FBI is a joint law
      enforcement and national security agency with a long history of spying on the
      First Amendment only compounds the chilling impact. Defending Rights & Dissent’s
      lawsuit against the FBI for their files on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange is ongoing.

      Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. “You Feel
      Like Your Life Is Over.” That’s the title of a new report released jointly by
      Americans for Immigrant Justice, the Sanctuary of the South and Human Rights Watch.
      It details dangerous and abusive conditions at three immigration detention centers
      in Miami, Florida, since Trump returned to office. One of the detained people
      they spoke to said detention officers made men eat while shackled with their hands
      behind their backs. One man said, quote, “We had to bend over and eat off the
      chairs with our mouths, like dogs.” The report also describes how detained immigrants
      are routinely denied access to legal counsel and critical medical care. Some have
      been held incommunicado in solitary confinement as an apparent punishment for
      seeking mental healthcare. For more, we’re joined by Belkis Wille, an associate
      director in Human Rights Watch’s Crisis, Conflict and Arms Division, author of
      the new report , “’You Feel Like Your Life Is Over’: Abusive Practices at Three
      Florida Immigration Detention Centers.” Belkis Wille, thanks so much for joining
      us from Washington. We have spoken to you about abusive conditions in countries
      around the world. We’re talking to you right now about what’s happening here in
      the United States, in Florida. Talk about what you found. BELKIS WILLE: What we
      found was that since January 20th of this year, there has been an upsurge in immigrants
      being detained, including, in particular, in Florida. And what this meant was
      that tons of people were being brought to these immigration detention centers.
      One of the ones we look at, Krome, within the first three months of the year was
      suddenly at, you know, two, three times its capacity in terms of the number of
      people being brought. And with that overcrowding came truly horrific conditions,
      unsanitary conditions, people being unable to get access to medical care, both
      to see medical health professionals and to get key treatment that they need for
      chronic health conditions, women being brought to a male-only detention center,
      being held there and denied any access to medical care because they were told
      this is a male-only facility. AMY GOODMAN: In a TikTok video that went viral in
      March, an unidentified immigrant from Mexico detained at the Krome ICE jail in
      Miami begs for help. As he secretly records the inhumane conditions inside his
      overcrowded holding cell, several other immigrant men are seen sleeping on the
      floor. And the significance of it, what it is showing? BELKIS WILLE: So, what
      we see in that video is exactly what was described by these men that were held
      at Krome Detention Center. These cells are being used for the, quote-unquote,
      “processing period” when people are first brought in. Now, these cells are only
      meant to hold a small number of people for a matter of hours. Those conditions
      you saw, those are men who were held in there for one week, two weeks in those
      rooms. They do not have regular access to showers. They’re in frigid temperatures
      with the air conditioning blasting. They’re sleeping on concrete floors for days.
      Some of the rooms don’t have, you know, regular access to a sink and soap to wash
      people’s hands. And as I mentioned, those same cells were being used at some point
      to hold women being brought to Krome — again, a male-only facility. The women
      told me that in their cell they had a toilet, but with the way that the windows
      were only partially glazed over, male detainees from other cells could actually
      stand on a chair and look in and watch them while they were using the toilet.
      AMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk about the people who have died in detention in
      Florida? BELKIS WILLE: What we saw across all three detention centers that we
      looked at was really a concerning and chronic lack of access to appropriate medical
      care. And what we saw was that people with, you know, chronic health conditions,
      where their records were on file — it was clear that they had diabetes, or they
      had HIV or asthma or any number of conditions — they were not being given regular
      access to their medication. And in some cases, people begging to see a doctor
      were not given access to a doctor. And in the case of two instances, a Ukrainian
      man, Maksym, who was brought in, you know, he was in very good health, his wife
      said, until he got brought to Krome. He got sicker and sicker, was begging to
      see a doctor. He saw medical professionals that were not prescribing him medication
      to address his illnesses. And we spoke to his cellmate, who describes how in the
      middle of the night, suddenly he started foaming at the mouth, vomiting, defecated
      on himself. That day, again, he had been insisting to see a doctor and had not
      seen one. And he was taken away on a stretcher and then died. And there was also
      a Haitian woman the same age as Maksym, also 44, and we interviewed a woman who
      was in the cell opposite her, who saw her collapsing and had — AMY GOODMAN: This
      is Marie Ange Blaise? BELKIS WILLE: Exactly. This is Marie Ange Blaise. And the
      woman we spoke to watched as it took far too long for a guard to come, as cellmates
      were screaming for a guard. The guard came, sauntered over, then walked away slowly
      before calling the medical team. They took, you know, 10, 15 minutes to arrive.
      And then one signaled to the rest of the group, you know, “It’s too late,” and
      the woman was taken away and then pronounced dead. AMY GOODMAN: So, she was held
      at Broward Transitional Center, BTC. You also report on Federal Detention Center
      and, of course, Krome in Miami. Can you talk about what it means when these companies,
      when these — I didn’t actually say that wrong — when these jails are privatized?
      They’re companies. And what role do they play in, for example, when they don’t
      have enough food for people? You save money by not giving them so much food. BELKIS WILLE:
      Absolutely. So, Broward Transitional Center, BTC, and Krome are both run by private
      companies that have contracts from ICE to run them. And at a facility like Krome,
      as I said, you know, within the first three months of the year, they became, you
      know, far over capacity of the facility. And detainees explained to me, those
      that were already detained in 2024, the change in conditions. Suddenly they weren’t
      getting, you know, substantial and warm breakfasts anymore. Suddenly their meal
      portions for lunch and dinner were cut. They couldn’t even eat in the canteen
      anymore. They were required to eat in their cells, which is still the case, because
      the facility is so overcrowded. And as you said, that’s a financial matter, that,
      you know, that’s a way of saving on the money being spent on food. When we wrote
      to the companies that are running Krome and BTC, we got no responses to our substantial
      allegations. One company simply wrote back and said, “You have to talk to ICE.
      We can’t respond to any of your allegations.” AMY GOODMAN: What exactly is Human
      Rights Watch calling for now? I mean, these three detention centers in Florida
      are a small example of the mass, expanding detention complex that is growing across
      this country, from places in swamps like the Everglades, what the Republicans
      have called “Alligator Alcatraz” to make it sound a bit cute, to the new, expanding
      detention centers on military bases. BELKIS WILLE: Absolutely. I mean, as you
      said, this is just a small example of a system that is abusive and is treating
      immigrants in detention in a dehumanizing manner. One immediate thing that could
      be done by the government that would really limit the number of people who are
      at risk of ending up in these facilities is to reinstate programs like the humanitarian
      parole and TPS programs, programs that invited people from Cuba, from Haiti, Venezuela,
      Nicaragua, Afghanistan, to come to this country lawfully. And these people were
      told they could come to America and got this protection until the situation in
      the country of their origin improved. And instead, suddenly saw a political decision
      taken to strip these people of their status, and now all of these people, as their
      status gets terminated, are at risk of being detained at these detention centers.
      So, that’s one very easy and quick fix. But, you know, there are also so many
      alternatives to detention for immigrants. It was ICE itself, in 2004, that developed
      an alternatives to detention program, a program that, by many measures, was effective.
      Why do we — why are we seeing a system that is using detention centers as the
      default, when we’re showing very clearly these detention centers are carrying
      out abuses, and not just abuses of international human rights law, but abuses
      of ICE’s very own detention standards? AMY GOODMAN: What does it mean — and maybe
      you can’t answer this, but — when an ICE jail is placed on a military base? Already,
      congressmembers, who have every right to go at any time, unannounced, to an ICE jail
      to investigate, to inspect, are having trouble getting in, under the Trump administration.
      But if they then have to get not only permission from ICE, but from the Pentagon,
      to get onto a military base? BELKIS WILLE: That’s of extreme concern. So much
      of the immediate solution that’s needed to address and rein in these abuses is
      oversight. And oversight includes an ability for those in power to visit these
      facilities and to ensure that abuses are not being carried out. What we heard
      from people at facilities like Krome is that when the management of the facilities
      and ICE found out there was going to be a visit, you know, a few nights before,
      suddenly, a hundred men would get transferred out, a wall would get repainted,
      so that, you know, the reality of the facility and its overcrowding would not
      be properly seen. So, when you’re talking about facilities that are even harder
      to get access to, it really means we’re talking about a black hole that does not
      allow for appropriate oversight of conditions. AMY GOODMAN: Belkis Wille, we want

      floor. And the significance of it, what it is showing? BELKIS WILLE: So, what
      we see in that video is exactly what was described by these men that were held
      at Krome Detention Center. These cells are being used for the, quote-unquote,
      “processing period” when people are first brought in. Now, these cells are only
      meant to hold a small number of people for a matter of hours. Those conditions
      you saw, those are men who were held in there for one week, two weeks in those
      rooms. They do not have regular access to showers. They’re in frigid temperatures
      with the air conditioning blasting. They’re sleeping on concrete floors for days.
      Some of the rooms don’t have, you know, regular access to a sink and soap to wash
      people’s hands. And as I mentioned, those same cells were being used at some point
      to hold women being brought to Krome — again, a male-only facility. The women
      told me that in their cell they had a toilet, but with the way that the windows
      were only partially glazed over, male detainees from other cells could actually
      stand on a chair and look in and watch them while they were using the toilet.
      AMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk about the people who have died in detention in
      Florida? BELKIS WILLE: What we saw across all three detention centers that we
      looked at was really a concerning and chronic lack of access to appropriate medical
      care. And what we saw was that people with, you know, chronic health conditions,
      where their records were on file — it was clear that they had diabetes, or they
      had HIV or asthma or any number of conditions — they were not being given regular
      access to their medication. And in some cases, people begging to see a doctor
      were not given access to a doctor. And in the case of two instances, a Ukrainian
      man, Maksym, who was brought in, you know, he was in very good health, his wife
      said, until he got brought to Krome. He got sicker and sicker, was begging to
      see a doctor. He saw medical professionals that were not prescribing him medication
      to address his illnesses. And we spoke to his cellmate, who describes how in the
      middle of the night, suddenly he started foaming at the mouth, vomiting, defecated
      on himself. That day, again, he had been insisting to see a doctor and had not
      seen one. And he was taken away on a stretcher and then died. And there was also
      a Haitian woman the same age as Maksym, also 44, and we interviewed a woman who
      was in the cell opposite her, who saw her collapsing and had — AMY GOODMAN: This
      is Marie Ange Blaise? BELKIS WILLE: Exactly. This is Marie Ange Blaise. And the
      woman we spoke to watched as it took far too long for a guard to come, as cellmates
      were screaming for a guard. The guard came, sauntered over, then walked away slowly
      before calling the medical team. They took, you know, 10, 15 minutes to arrive.
      And then one signaled to the rest of the group, you know, “It’s too late,” and
      the woman was taken away and then pronounced dead. AMY GOODMAN: So, she was held
      at Broward Transitional Center, BTC. You also report on Federal Detention Center
      and, of course, Krome in Miami. Can you talk about what it means when these companies,
      when these — I didn’t actually say that wrong — when these jails are privatized?
      They’re companies. And what role do they play in, for example, when they don’t
      have enough food for people? You save money by not giving them so much food. BELKIS WILLE:
      Absolutely. So, Broward Transitional Center, BTC, and Krome are both run by private
      companies that have contracts from ICE to run them. And at a facility like Krome,
      as I said, you know, within the first three months of the year, they became, you
      know, far over capacity of the facility. And detainees explained to me, those
      that were already detained in 2024, the change in conditions. Suddenly they weren’t
      getting, you know, substantial and warm breakfasts anymore. Suddenly their meal
      portions for lunch and dinner were cut. They couldn’t even eat in the canteen
      anymore. They were required to eat in their cells, which is still the case, because
      the facility is so overcrowded. And as you said, that’s a financial matter, that,
      you know, that’s a way of saving on the money being spent on food. When we wrote
      to the companies that are running Krome and BTC, we got no responses to our substantial
      allegations. One company simply wrote back and said, “You have to talk to ICE.
      We can’t respond to any of your allegations.” AMY GOODMAN: What exactly is Human
      Rights Watch calling for now? I mean, these three detention centers in Florida
      are a small example of the mass, expanding detention complex that is growing across
      this country, from places in swamps like the Everglades, what the Republicans
      have called “Alligator Alcatraz” to make it sound a bit cute, to the new, expanding
      detention centers on military bases. BELKIS WILLE: Absolutely. I mean, as you
      said, this is just a small example of a system that is abusive and is treating
      immigrants in detention in a dehumanizing manner. One immediate thing that could
      be done by the government that would really limit the number of people who are
      at risk of ending up in these facilities is to reinstate programs like the humanitarian
      parole and TPS programs, programs that invited people from Cuba, from Haiti, Venezuela,
      Nicaragua, Afghanistan, to come to this country lawfully. And these people were
      told they could come to America and got this protection until the situation in
      the country of their origin improved. And instead, suddenly saw a political decision
      taken to strip these people of their status, and now all of these people, as their
      status gets terminated, are at risk of being detained at these detention centers.
      So, that’s one very easy and quick fix. But, you know, there are also so many
      alternatives to detention for immigrants. It was ICE itself, in 2004, that developed
      an alternatives to detention program, a program that, by many measures, was effective.
      Why do we — why are we seeing a system that is using detention centers as the
      default, when we’re showing very clearly these detention centers are carrying
      out abuses, and not just abuses of international human rights law, but abuses
      of ICE’s very own detention standards? AMY GOODMAN: What does it mean — and maybe
      you can’t answer this, but — when an ICE jail is placed on a military base? Already,
      congressmembers, who have every right to go at any time, unannounced, to an ICE jail
      to investigate, to inspect, are having trouble getting in, under the Trump administration.
      But if they then have to get not only permission from ICE, but from the Pentagon,
      to get onto a military base? BELKIS WILLE: That’s of extreme concern. So much
      of the immediate solution that’s needed to address and rein in these abuses is
      oversight. And oversight includes an ability for those in power to visit these
      facilities and to ensure that abuses are not being carried out. What we heard
      from people at facilities like Krome is that when the management of the facilities
      and ICE found out there was going to be a visit, you know, a few nights before,
      suddenly, a hundred men would get transferred out, a wall would get repainted,
      so that, you know, the reality of the facility and its overcrowding would not
      be properly seen. So, when you’re talking about facilities that are even harder
      to get access to, it really means we’re talking about a black hole that does not
      allow for appropriate oversight of conditions. AMY GOODMAN: Belkis Wille, we want

      Polychroniou / Truthout On July 4, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the “One
      Big Beautiful Bill“ Act into law, implementing his reactionary policy agenda.
      This megabill is the most sweeping legislation in modern U.S. history and elevates
      neoliberalism to a new stage with huge tax cuts for the rich and equally huge
      cuts to the social safety net, including food programs and Medicaid coverage.
      Indeed, those who somehow interpreted Trump’s policies as representing an end
      to the neoliberal order in the U.S. could hardly have been more wrong. Now, it
      is the turn of the French government to show the world that neoliberalism remains
      the dominant organizing principle for advanced capitalist societies. Confronted
      with a faltering economy , big budget deficits, and record-high debt levels ,
      the government of Prime Minister François Bayrou has unveiled a budget plan that
      shares some uncanny similarities with Trump’s megabill, although it is surely
      not as brutal as the “Big Ugly Bill” will be for most U.S. citizens. The French
      budget plan for 2026 seeks to restore public finances with proposals that include
      slashing thousands of civil service jobs, shutting down so-called “unproductive”
      national agencies, cutting prescription drug subsidies, reducing health care expenditure
      by €5 billion, and freezing pensions and virtually all other benefits paid out
      by the government to 2025 levels. The controversial budget plan proposed by the
      French prime minister also includes abolishing two statutory holidays from the
      country’s annual calendar — Easter Monday and May 8. The latter, known as Victory
      Day, is a pivotal holiday that commemorates the victory of the Allies over Nazi
      Germany. The government claims that abolishing those two public holidays would
      generate several billion euros in additional state revenues through increased
      economic activity. The French prime minister has also left open the possibility
      of additional statutory holidays receiving the axe. All in all, the proposed budget
      plan aims at €43.8 billion ($50.88 billion) in deficit reduction for 2026 in order
      to return the public deficit to 4.6 percent of France’s gross domestic product
      (GDP), from its current 5.8 percent, and to 2.9 percent of GDP by 2029. “ It’s
      the last stop before the cliff, before we are crushed by the debt ,” Bayrou said
      in a speech to members of parliament, cabinet members, and journalists, invoking
      Greece’s debt crisis of more than a decade ago as a warning of what could be in
      store for France. Currently, France’s public debt is at 114 percent of the country’s
      GDP and is the third-largest in Europe , behind Greece and Italy. Across Europe,
      neoliberals are still using the Greek debt crisis to create fear in public consciousness
      about government spending so they can enforce draconian austerity measures without
      opposition or public outcry. Incidentally, the Greek debt crisis erupted in late
      2009, when the nation’s public debt-to-GDP ratio had climbed to 118 percent and
      interest rates began to rise substantially, with the 10-year government bond yield
      surging over 11 percent in late 2010 as the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio trended
      around 128 percent and was deemed unsustainable. More than 15 years later, Greece’s
      economy is still stuck in the same outmoded growth model of the early 2000s, and
      the government debt-to-GDP ratio stands today at 146 percent but is now assumed
      by markets and the euro masters to be sustainable. Three massive bailouts from
      the European Union and the International Monetary Fund worth a staggering total
      of nearly €310 billion ($360 billion), accompanied by the most sadistic fiscal
      policies in the postwar era, devastated economic activity and resulted in constantly
      growing unemployment, which in 2014 rose as high as 28 percent, alongside an alarming
      rise in suicide rates . That’s the logic of neoliberal financial capitalism for
      you, a system that is structured to be brutally exploitative with a powerful stranglehold
      over the real economy, serving only a privileged few and inherently prone to crises
      but always counting on rescues from Big Government through massive bailouts .
      But there is more obscenity included in the French government budget plan than
      already mentioned. Just like Trump’s megabill, Bayrou’s budget plan slashes the
      social safety net but expands the defense budget. Indeed, the proposed cuts in
      the social safety net and even the assault on French labor through the abolition
      of a historically significant holiday like Victory Day are made precisely in order
      to make room for increases in military spending. President Emmanuel Macron announced
      on July 13 that France will boost mili tary spending significantly due to growing
      regional uncertainties, with Russia allegedly representing the biggest threat
      to European security. In fact, Macron went so far as to make the outrageous statement
      that the steep increases in military spending are needed because Europe is under
      a greater threat than at any other point since the end of World War II. Subsequently,
      Bayrou’s budget plan will add €3.5 billion to the 2026 defense budget and €3 billion
      to the 2027 budget. Bayrou himself declared the defense budget to be “sacrosanct”
      and exempt from budget cuts. Neoliberal economics is of course tightly linked
      to militarism and warmongering. Most NATO countries are boosting their military
      spending to 5 percent of GDP , largely because the alliance remains subservient
      to the United States and European leaders want to appease Donald Trump, who has
      threatened to disengage from NATO over the U.S. paying an “unfair share” as member.
      But in so doing, the European governments become full and willing partners in
      the militaristic adventures of the United States, which now views China, not Russia,
      as the biggest threat to its supremacy. In any case, the idea that Russia somehow
      has strategic aims to militarily attack Europe is as ludicrous as it is nonsensical.
      To what end? A question never asked by European leaders and therefore never answered.
      Nonetheless, thanks to its multi-party system, the political environment in France
      is radically different from the one that exists in the United States, and the
      odds that the budget measures proposed by Bayrou’s government will pass are probably
      small. First, Bayrou leads a minority government and his budget plan faces opposition
      from both the left and the far right. In fact, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the
      left-wing party La France Insoumise, has already called for Bayrou’s resignation
      , while Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right National Rally, has threatened
      to topple the government if it doesn’t roll back the spending plan. Interestingly
      enough, both the left and the far right in France see the government budget plan
      as something of a class war budget. As hard as it may be to imagine a far right
      leader adopting a working-class perspective, Le Pen took to X to declare that
      “ this government prefers to attack the French people, workers and pensioners,
      rather than hunt waste.” Indeed, the French government also risks backlash over
      its austerity-driven budget plan from some of the country’s major trade unions,
      and it is highly unlikely that the majority of French citizens will swallow cuts
      in the social safety net while military spending receives a major boost. Lest
      we forget, the previous French prime minister, Michel Barnier, was forced to resign
      in December 2024, just three months into his term. Left-wing lawmakers and unions
      had consistently opposed the plans of the Barnier government to slash the state
      budget by many billions of euros in order to shrink the deficit. Eventually, the
      French government collapsed after Barnier tried to pass a social security bill
      (a key component of the government’s budget proposal) without parliamentary approval.
      In a rare display of cooperation, left and far right lawmakers joined forces to
      pass a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Barnier. Given the state of
      French politics and society, it is quite likely that the current government of
      François Bayrou will meet the same fate as that of Michel Barnier’s government.
      If that were to happen, it would certainly be yet another victory in the ongoing
      struggle of the ever-rebellious French people against the cruelty of neoliberalism.

      But in so doing, the European governments become full and willing partners in
      the militaristic adventures of the United States, which now views China, not Russia,
      as the biggest threat to its supremacy. In any case, the idea that Russia somehow
      has strategic aims to militarily attack Europe is as ludicrous as it is nonsensical.
      To what end? A question never asked by European leaders and therefore never answered.
      Nonetheless, thanks to its multi-party system, the political environment in France
      is radically different from the one that exists in the United States, and the
      odds that the budget measures proposed by Bayrou’s government will pass are probably
      small. First, Bayrou leads a minority government and his budget plan faces opposition
      from both the left and the far right. In fact, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the
      left-wing party La France Insoumise, has already called for Bayrou’s resignation
      , while Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right National Rally, has threatened
      to topple the government if it doesn’t roll back the spending plan. Interestingly
      enough, both the left and the far right in France see the government budget plan
      as something of a class war budget. As hard as it may be to imagine a far right
      leader adopting a working-class perspective, Le Pen took to X to declare that
      “ this government prefers to attack the French people, workers and pensioners,
      rather than hunt waste.” Indeed, the French government also risks backlash over
      its austerity-driven budget plan from some of the country’s major trade unions,
      and it is highly unlikely that the majority of French citizens will swallow cuts
      in the social safety net while military spending receives a major boost. Lest
      we forget, the previous French prime minister, Michel Barnier, was forced to resign
      in December 2024, just three months into his term. Left-wing lawmakers and unions
      had consistently opposed the plans of the Barnier government to slash the state
      budget by many billions of euros in order to shrink the deficit. Eventually, the
      French government collapsed after Barnier tried to pass a social security bill
      (a key component of the government’s budget proposal) without parliamentary approval.
      In a rare display of cooperation, left and far right lawmakers joined forces to
      pass a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Barnier. Given the state of
      French politics and society, it is quite likely that the current government of
      François Bayrou will meet the same fate as that of Michel Barnier’s government.
      If that were to happen, it would certainly be yet another victory in the ongoing
      struggle of the ever-rebellious French people against the cruelty of neoliberalism.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article by C.J. Polychroniou for Truthout, the author
      discusses the implications of U.S. President Donald Trump's signing of the "One
      Big Beautiful Bill" Act, which represents a significant shift toward neoliberalism
      through substantial tax cuts for the wealthy and severe reductions in social safety
      net programs. The article draws parallels with the French government's budget
      plan for 2026, proposed by Prime Minister François Bayrou, which aims to address
      economic challenges by cutting thousands of civil service jobs, reducing healthcare
      spending, and freezing pensions and benefits. Additionally, the plan controversially
      includes the abolition of two public holidays, highlighting the ongoing dominance
      of neoliberal policies in advanced capitalist societies.

      By Edward Curtin / Behind the Curtain That the United States of America is controlled
      by a criminally perverse, two party ruling class should be obvious to any reasonable
      (not rational, for the above-named people are very rational) person not living
      in what Jean-Paul Sartre, the French existential writer, called bad faith ( mauvaise
      foi). Bad faith is based on Sartre’s premise that people are radically free despite
      social and biological constraints; in each person’s consciousness they sense this
      but choose to play games, to perform for themselves and others, and to act as
      if they have no choices when they do. They deny their freedom. This is not lying
      but a form of self-deception since one cannot lie to oneself for “the one to whom
      the lie is told and the one who lies are one and the same person, which means
      that I must know in my capacity as a deceiver the truth which is hidden from me
      in my capacity as the one deceived,” writes Sartre. This should be so obvious
      but it escapes most people who imbibe psychobabble. Lying is different since it
      involves other people. “The essence of the lie implies in fact that the liar actually
      is in complete possession of the truth which he is hiding,” added Sartre. This
      cynical consciousness that knows the truth but denies it to others is a perfect
      description of  politicians, propagandists, intelligence services, and their media
      mouthpieces. They know they are lying and are proud of it, but of course they
      will never admit it. Regular people also lie regularly but with not the same tremendous
      social consequences. People often say that certain people really believes their
      own lies, that they are deluded, but this is impossible. I begin with this brief
      excursion into philosophy (and psychology) because I recently read a fine journalist,
      Patrick Lawrence, in an otherwise excellent article – “Trump, Bibi, and Ayn Rand’s
      ghost” – write the following about war criminals Trump and Netanyahu’s recent
      dinner meeting in which  Netanyahu shows Trump a letter he wrote nominating Trump
      for the Nobel Peace Prize, that Medea Benjamin of Code Pink rightly called “surreal:
      We must reason through the matter such that we are able to recognize that these
      two appalling men were serious in their self-congratulation. The idea of themselves
      they presented before the media cameras is to them genuine: They sincerely understand
      themselves in this way—virtuous, courageous, standing heroically alone, bearing
      the world’s banner forward . (my emphasis ) Of what are such people made? This
      is our question. Attempting our answer leads us beyond politics and policy and
      into the spheres of psychology and pathology. I have long contended that any true
      understanding of global affairs cannot leave out consideration of the mental and
      emotional makeup of those who, for better or worse, are in positions of leadership.
      The Israeli PM, a case in point, exhibits clear symptoms of clinical psychosis
      if by this we mean a frayed relationship with reality. Now Patrick Lawrence most
      forcefully and eloquently often condemns Trump and Netanyahu and their ilk as
      the genocidal war criminals that they are. Because I admire his work so much,
      I hesitate to pick up on his point about their sincerity, but I think it is essential
      to do so because of its wider implications. Sartre claimed “sincerity,” purportedly
      the anti-thesis of self-deception, takes one deeper into self-deception. It goes
      to Patrick’s  question of what are such people made, of what are we all made;
      it goes behind psychology to its philosophical presuppositions and beyond the
      issue of pathology to a theological analysis of evil. While Lawrence’s analysis
      is focused not on these matters but on Ayn Rand’s influence on Trump, Netanyahu,
      and the wider individualistic culture – an astute analysis – it respectfully needs
      an a priori corrective. I maintain that not for a second do Trump and Netanyahu
      believe they are genuine or virtuous or believe their own lies. They are the perfect
      examples of hypocrites, as in the word’s etymological sense of stage actor; pretender,
      dissembler, from the Greek hypokritēs. To repeat: it is impossible to believe
      one’s own lies since one knows they are not the truth one withholds. Since it
      is obvious from their own words and actions and can be followed in real time video
      by any concerned person that they enthusiastically support the genocide of the
      Palestinians without an iota of compunction, can we say they are mentally ill? 
      I think not. That would suggest that if in some alternative universe they were
      tried for their crimes and convicted, they should be sent to a mental institution,
      not a prison, because they are sick. They are far beyond sick and are the current
      examples of their nations’ predecessors’ support for massive war crimes for a
      very long time. Both the U.S.A. and Zionist Israel were founded on similar claims
      of being  God-ordained countries that hid the satanic violence they used against
      native peoples and anyone who dared to suggest God was not on their sides. Are
      they, as Lawrence says of Netanyahu, out of touch with reality? I think not. In
      any case, whose reality? Those in power, with the corporate mass media and tech
      companies as accomplices, create their own reality, as in the famous quote attributed
      to a George W. Bush aid by Ron Suskind: “We’re an empire now, and when we act,
      we create our own reality.” This is even truer today with the use of artificial
      Intelligence. Their reality is not yours, mine, or Patrick Lawrence’s. Their facts
      are not ours. In any case, to suggest Netanyahu is out of touch with “reality”
      would suggest mental illness, not evil intent. Sartre would say that to do so
      is to excuse him, which is clearly not Patrick’s intention. The result, however,
      of saying that Netanyahu and Trump sincerely think of themselves as genuine does
      exactly that. One can, of course, reject Sartre’s philosophical premise about
      freedom, bad faith, and lying in favor of psychological and biological explanations.
      This is the modern approach, which is commonplace. It assumes much. It needs to
      be understood within the historical context of the decline of religion and the
      rise of science, modernism, and post-modernism. It is not scientific, however,
      but pseudo-scientific, and delusional on its own claims to being scientific. I
      maintain that it fails to comprehend the nature of evil. But like Sartre and Dostoevsky,
      I too believe we are fundamentally free. Which is not to say we are not confronted
      with biological and social limitations on that freedom. We are. But fundamentally
      we have free will. In the ancient tragedy Oedipus Rex , known in its Greek original
      as Oedipus Tyrannus , Oedipus commits two heinous acts: he kills his father and
      marries his mother. He commits crimes against society and sins against the gods.
      But he does so unknowingly, unconsciously, as the play makes clear. Throughout
      the Western world in morality and law it has become accepted, as Aristotle argues
      in his Ethics , that consciousness and will are necessary for acts to be ethically
      bad or good. If Netanyahu, Trump, and their ilk (to be clear, by ilk I mean Biden
      and former U.S. presidents and Israeli prime ministers before Netanyahu) are not
      conscious but believe they are being virtuous by mass murdering Palestinians and
      so many others, then they, like Oedipus, deserve sympathy. For they know not what
      they do. But they clearly know, so they deserve no sympathy. They deserve condemnation.
      What could possess them, and all the other political leaders, to commit mass murder
      over and over again while reveling in their “accomplishments,” and to speak casually
      about using nuclear weapons? For that is what they do. I should emphasize that
      I am not referring to individuals who commit murder and other horrible crimes
      but to political leaders backed by millions of supporters. Institutional leaders
      who quite rationally sit in offices discussing the best methods for slaughtering
      millions. Why do they act this way? Why did Hitler? Harry Truman with Hiroshima
      and Nagasaki? George W. Bush with Iraq? You know all the names, or should. They
      are legion, as are the statistics. The demonic nature of U.S. history from the
      start is there for all to contemplate, as the late theologian David Ray Griffin
      has documented in a number of books. No amount of feigned amnesia will erase the
      bloody truth of American history, the cheap grace we bestow upon ourselves. It
      is demonic, as is the history of Zionism in Palestine. So we are left with the
      question that has engaged people for millennia: What is the nature of evil? The
      demonic? While not here entering into a long analysis of this question, I will
      cast my vote with those, such as Soren Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Herman
      Melville , et al., who have claimed it goes much deeper than psychological sickness
      to a spiritual level and that the Enlightenment’s error was that it lacked a devil.
      Satan is hard character to fathom, but when he is strutting his stuff, the consequences
      of his evil are blatantly real in the actions of those who have sold their souls
      for his favors. In Melville’s Moby Dick the possessed Ahab says to Starbuck and
      to us: Ahab is forever Ahab, man. This whole act is immutably decreed. ‘T’was
      rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am
      the Fates’ lieutenant, I act under orders. The same clarity of mind and will can
      be said of Trump, Netanyahu, and their ilk. They know from whence their orders
      come; they echo Ahab’s words that “from hell’s heart” and “for hate’s sake” they
      will kill the innocent and exult in the slaughter. God and Satan battle on. Editor’s

    paragraph_summary: In his article, Edward Curtin argues that the United States is
      governed by a corrupt two-party system that operates under a façade of democracy,
      which he likens to the concept of "bad faith" as described by philosopher Jean-Paul
      Sartre. Curtin suggests that many individuals, including politicians and media
      figures, are aware of the truth yet choose to deceive others, embodying a cynical
      consciousness that prioritizes self-interest over honesty. He contrasts this with
      the everyday lies of ordinary people, emphasizing that while they may deceive
      themselves, the stakes are not as high as those involved in political and media
      manipulation. Ultimately, he calls for awareness and support to challenge this
      pervasive dishonesty.

    paragraph_summary: In his article, Edward Curtin argues that the United States is
      governed by a corrupt two-party system that operates under a façade of democracy,
      which he likens to the concept of "bad faith" as described by philosopher Jean-Paul
      Sartre. Curtin suggests that many individuals, including politicians and media
      figures, are aware of the truth yet choose to deceive others, embodying a cynical
      consciousness that prioritizes self-interest over honesty. He contrasts this with
      the everyday lies of ordinary people, emphasizing that while they may deceive
      themselves, the stakes are not as high as those involved in political and media
      manipulation. Ultimately, he calls for awareness and support to challenge this
      pervasive dishonesty.

      to ScheerPost This is the first of three articles on how the American Left is
      remembered, or not, in high school textbook American History. Part 1 deals with
      the larger society within which our textbooks exist. The deliberate elimination
      of inconvenient facts from textbooks mirrors their elimination from daily life.
      The misuse of language, specifically the use of faulty definitions, is as common
      in textbooks as it is in media. Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his
      enemy is. Assata Shakur Assata: An Autobiography 1987 In 1984 Winston Smith wanted
      to remember. He wanted to remember details from the past as much as he wanted
      to remember the photograph that had just been destroyed. As punishment for wanting
      to remember he was made to repeat and repeat and repeat the slogan, “Who controls
      the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” What
      was true in Orwell’s 1984 is true in our 2025. Historical memory is being eliminated
      by prohibiting the teaching of European settler campaigns against the Indigenous,
      institutionalized inequality and historical discrimination on the basis of race
      or sex. As I write, the U.S. government is scrubbing critical environmental data
      from federal websites. The Pentagon is removing thousands of documents and photographs
      honoring the contributions of women and people of color. Perhaps the ugliest and
      most petty attempt to bury inconvenient names is Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s 2025
      order to rename Navy ships which honor a variety of civil rights leaders. Here
      are some of the names to be eliminated. The pattern is unmistakable. United States
      Naval Ship ( USNS ) Harvey Milk : Meant to honor the memory of the gay rights
      campaigner who served in the Navy during the Korean War before being discharged
      for his sexuality. USNS Thurgood Marshall: Named in honor of Thurgood Marshall,
      the first African American U.S. Supreme Court Justice and a pioneering civil rights
      attorney. USNS Cesar Chavez: Named after Cesar Chavez, a labor leader and civil
      rights activist who co-founded the United Farm Workers union. USNS Medgar Evers:
      Commemorates Medgar Evers, a civil rights activist and World War II veteran assassinated
      by a white supremacist in 1963. USNS Harriet Tubman: Honors Harriet Tubman, an
      Underground Railroad conductor and Union spy during the Civil War. She liberated
      over 700 enslaved individuals and was posthumously awarded the rank of brigadier
      general in the Maryland National Guard. USNS Dolores Huerta: Honors a labor leader
      and co-founder of the United Farm Workers alongside Cesar Chavez. USNS Lucy Stone:
      Honors a suffragist and abolitionist who was arrested for participating in protests
      for women’s suffrage. In prison she was beaten, tortured and force-fed. USNS Ruth
      Bader Ginsburg: Honors the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice known for her lifelong
      advocacy of gender equality and civil rights. These efforts are recent, but they
      are not new. For decades much of the history in high school textbooks has been
      cleansed of inconvenient material. These are some of the “missing links” that
      I have written about in a series for ScheerPost . In this installment, I intend
      to explore the disappearance of historical contributions made by American socialists,
      communists and fellow travelers (aka the American Left) in establishing worker
      rights and civil rights for the American people. Who controls the past controls
      the future Did you ever learn that communists and socialists have made positive
      contributions to American society? Do you know that both groups worked to establish
      labor unions and to ensure the rights of American workers? Did you know that socialist
      labor unions are, at least partly, responsible for the 8-hour-workday? Did you
      know that the American Communist Party contributed to the struggle for civil rights
      and racial justice in the early 20th century? Did you learn, in school, about
      the Scottsboro Boys and who came to their defense? Are you aware that the left-wing
      has significant roots in American history? Did you learn that in the 1912 presidential
      election when the Socialist Party candidate, Eugene V. Debs, secured six percent
      of the popular vote, socialists already held 1,200 offices in 340 cities, including,
      in 79 cities, the office of mayor. According to a Brookings Institute paper, FDR’s
      New Deal drew on socialist proposals to create Social Security. Lyndon Johnson’s
      “war on poverty” was inspired by the book The Other America written by Michael
      Harrington who, in 1968, became the chairman of the Socialist Party of America.
      Were you taught any of that? Eliminating the history and accomplishments of the
      left-wing is deliberate. Burying selective parts of the past distorts our understanding
      of who we have been and who we are. Who controls the present controls the past
      Richard Hofstadter wrote in The Paranoid Style in American Politics that the “far-right”
      practiced a style of rhetoric consistent with paranoia. Political paranoia, he
      wrote, sees conspiracies to be “directed against a nation, a culture, a way of
      life whose fate affects not [only] himself but millions of others.” Such paranoia
      often manifests itself in exaggerated terminologies. For example, Tea Party opposition
      to the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) involved charges that it was a “ socialist
      takeover. ” Conservative commentator Bill Kristol compared Obamacare to communism.
      No matter what they said, the ACA was about expanded health care not a conspiracy. 
      Paranoia and exaggeration go hand in hand and are most effective when directed
      at those who have no idea what the terms actually mean. Take the recent attempt
      by Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem , to justify use of National
      Guard Forces on the streets of Los Angeles. “We are not going away,” she said.
      “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome
      leadership that this governor and this mayor … have tried to insert into the city.”
      Who is she referring to? Of course, claiming that LA needs to be liberated “from
      socialists” is nonsense, but such rhetoric can normalize disinformation especially
      when it is reported in the media without correction. A free press should be expected
      to correct what are obviously factual errors and state clearly, for example, that
      the National Guard was not in Los Angeles to liberate the city from anyone, let
      alone socialists. Language is never neutral. It is deeply intertwined with the
      interests of those who dominate public discourse. As the meanings of political
      terms are transformed, they cease to be complex ideologies and often become justifications
      for dismissing anything that the powers that be wish dismissed. As a result, terms
      like “socialism” and “communism” are transformed into labels to be afraid of,
      rather than ideas worth defining. In the end, history will be shaped by what is
      remembered. Liberals are neither socialists nor communists For a variety of reasons,
      many Americans continue to suffer from wide-spread ideological confusion. The
      confusion comes from more than one source, but mostly from inadequate schooling.
      If students never learn to clearly define terms like “socialism,” “democracy,”
      “liberal/conservative” or “communism” they will be vulnerable to ever-present
      attempts at manipulation. More than a few politicians take advantage of this,
      Senator Mike Lee (R-Ut) for example, reacted to a June 2025 assassination of two
      Minnesota lawmakers by posting on X, “This is what happens when Marxists don’t
      get their way.” The term Marxist is here used as an epithet meant to discredit
      the suspected shooter or his supposed acquaintances. Or perhaps he was trying
      to discredit Karl Marx, it is hard to tell. Donald Trump managed to top Sen. Lee
      with his own abuse of political labels. During the 2025 campaign, speaking in
      Arizona , he called Kamala Harris a “socialist, Marxist, communist, and fascist”
      in one campaign speech. That made so little sense that he might just as well have
      added cannibal and vegetarian. Disappeared from textbooks When artists, writers,
      social reformers, critics of war and union leaders self-identify as socialists
      or communists, or simply as sympathetic to the left, that is a fact not usually
      mentioned in the textbooks. But even when such individuals are too significant
      to leave out, their political convictions are ignored as much as possible. These
      are serious omissions with serious consequences. For example, any history of the
      Harlem Renaissance will include Langston Hughes , but the fact that he spent decades
      supporting communist and socialist programs is seldom made clear. In his writing,
      however, his politics are clear. In 1935, his poem “Let America Be America Again
      ” identified exactly what the Trump Administration is trying to remove from the
      history curriculum and thus from our common memory. Say who are you that mumbles
      in the dark? And who are you that draws your veil across the stars? I am the poor
      white, fooled and pushed apart, I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars. I am the
      red man driven from the land, I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek And
      finding only the same old stupid plan. Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.
      Manufactured ignorance or how we got here As an adolescent, what I learned about
      communism and socialism did not come from a classroom. It was delivered most afternoons
      in syndicated repeats of two black and white television shows. When I was 8 and
      9-years-old, for reasons beyond my control, television was both my babysitter
      and my favorite teacher. Most of those political lessons came from “ I Led 3 Lives
      ” and “ Superman ”. The first was billed as the real-life story of Herbert A.
      Philbrick , an advertising executive recruited by J. Edgar Hoover to spy on “a
      network of subversive communist fronts.” The second featured a “mild-mannered
      reporter” who was also the embodiment of “truth, justice and the American way.”
      Each episode of “3 Lives” began with unforgettable melodramatic music and a perilous
      voice-over assuring viewers that Philbrick had really been “a citizen, a communist,
      and a counterspy.” Never subtle, it was perfect for an 8-year-old. In total, 117
      half-hour episodes “were broadcast over 600 stations in an overt attempt to take
      anti-Communism into mass culture.” The fourth episode, Railroad Strike Attempt
      , is still worth watching (and discussing in a classroom). It presents a story
      of “satisfied railway workers” being manipulated, by their union bosses, into
      striking and thus harming American transport. Superman usually battled gangsters
      and con artists, but there were episodes focused on the ever-present communist
      threat. In “ The Monkey Mystery, ” a young “Eastern European woman” is threatened
      by the same communists who had recently killed her scientist/father. Alfred Eaker,
      a filmmaker and critic , calls it “a delightfully far-fetched mystery.” Occasionally,
      real teachers made things worse. My 8th grade teacher, a Franciscan nun, recommended
      a book by J. Edgar Hoover titled Masters of Deceit : The Story of Communism in
      America . She read a section to the class and suggested that it would help us
      identify nearby communists. I looked forward to the challenge, but the only communists
      I could identify were in the convent because they lived communally and owned nothing
      individually. The fact is that most of my generation entered high school having
      learned to fear stuff we did not understand. I can’t help but wonder how much,
      or if, that has changed. Ask yourself if you learned, in school, a useful understanding
      of communism? But does it even matter what we learn or don’t learn in school?
      While I assume that, if you are reading this, you know that the Soviet Union no
      longer exists and you know that Russia is no longer a communist state. Most of
      us remember news reports from the Berlin Wall to Boris Yeltsin. But for many,
      after learning to fear the Soviets because they were communists, they couldn’t
      let go. In a 2022 Economist /YouGov poll , 42% of Americans thought that Russia
      was still communist. This nostalgia for a communist Russia has even infected the
      Senate. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) asserted in 2022 that Russia had invaded
      Ukraine because, “It’s a communist country, so he [Putin] can’t feed his people,
      so they need more farmland.” You can’t make this up. Check the link. Manufactured
      ignorance or the Russians are coming On the flip side of a poorly defined but
      ominous enemy is the assumed validity of clichés like “My country, right or wrong.”
      Such simple sentiments manifest themselves in convictions that are passed from
      person to person like a virus. One example comes from the autobiography of an
      American political activist, Assata Shakur . Midway through the book she recalls
      a discussion she had in 1964, when she was about 17. She tried to justify the
      growing U.S. role in Vietnam by suggesting that, “the U.S. was fighting for Democracy.”
      When she added that the communists “wanted to take over everything,” someone asked
      her what communism was and she quickly realized she had no idea. “My image of
      a communist came from a cartoon. It was a spy with a black trench coat and a black
      hat pulled down over his face, slinking around corners… I knew I didn’t know what
      the hell communism was, and yet I’d been dead set against it…. I never forgot
      that day…. Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his enemy is.” At the same
      age, my understanding of Cold War politics was similar. Her convictions had come
      from cartoons, mine had come from a couple of old television shows. I too did
      not know what communism was and I too might have imagined a secretive man wearing
      a black trench coat. By the 1970s, Ms. Shakur had become a member of the Black
      Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army. She became a target of COINTELPRO
      , an FBI counterintelligence program created to discredit and neutralize organizations
      including the Panthers and the Communist Party. Long story short, in 1984 she
      was granted political asylum in Cuba, where she still lives . The first time I
      was called a communist I was 16. I had agreed to pass out flyers supporting the
      grape boycott in the parking lot of a Safeway. One woman, after glancing at the
      flyer, looked at me and grumbled, “You, young man, must be a communist!” As she
      dropped the flyer, she seemed unnecessarily angry. I was supporting a farmworker
      strike in Delano, California, but I didn’t see how that was connected to communism,
      until I quickly realized that it made sense in an I-Led-3-Lives kind of way. That
      is, it made sense when almost any act of advocacy or dissent could be reframed
      as subversive. Fortunately, by that time, I had come to the same conclusion as
      Assata Shakur: “Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his enemy is.” Misleading
      definitions The textbooks define the economic and political system of the United
      States as it is seen by most industrialists and most “successful” politicians.
      Thus, the United States is simply identified as capitalist. In the textbooks,
      unions, socialists, communists, and social anarchists are conversely portrayed
      as challengers to that capitalism. All of these terms are then defined carelessly
      and sometimes even incorrectly. Capitalism as defined in textbooks Adam Smith
      did not use the word “capitalism” in his work. Instead, he wrote about “commercial
      society” which, according to the Encyclopedia of Philosophy , emphasizes his belief
      that the economic is only one component of the human condition. Instead of using
      the term “capitalism,” “ The Americans ” uses the term “free enterprise” while
      “ History Alive! ” uses “capitalism,” but in both textbooks the essence of the
      definition is the same. Capitalism is “an economic system, in which private businesses
      and individuals control the means of production.” Such a rudimentary definition
      is not very useful. In the United States, for example, governments (federal, state
      and local) have substantial ownership and substantial control. Government spending
      accounts for more than one third of GDP and the federal government owns about
      28% of the land . So, it is not simply businesses that control “the means of production.”
      According to the textbooks, Adam Smith was also a strong advocate of competition,
      but there is no discussion of currently existing monopolies. When monopolies are
      discussed, it is largely in the context of the early twentieth century (i.e.,
      Carnegie and U.S. Steel, Rockefeller and Standard Oil and Teddy Roosevelt the
      “trust buster.”) Socialism as defined in textbooks Socialism is defined in “ The
      Americans ” as “An economic and political system based on government ownership
      of business and property, and an equal distribution of wealth.” The definition
      is basically the same in “ History Alive!”. Neither is correct. In the real world
      there are many political parties and various governments that claim the label
      socialist. An honest high school textbook might start there, but I would focus
      on what is called democratic socialism because that is the most relevant in the
      American context which includes Eugene V. Debs, Senator Bernie Sanders and others
      including Zohran Mamdani , the recent winner in the Democratic primary for Mayor
      of New York City. Democratic socialism aims to achieve goals through democratic
      means, respecting civil liberties and political pluralism. Predictably, it didn’t
      take long for Trump to misuse clearly defined terms for his own purpose. On July
      1 , he called the democratic socialist a communist. “Look, we don’t need a communist
      in this country, but if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him…” Many
      European countries have active socialist parties including the Social Democratic
      Party of Germany ( SPD ), the French Socialist Party ( PS), and the Spanish Socialist
      Workers’ Party ( PSOE ).  Each of these parties advocates different policies,
      but in none of them does the government own “the businesses.” If you doubt this,
      look it up. Among European countries, Norway seems to have the most state-owned
      enterprises . The Norwegian state owns about 9.6% of all non-agricultural business
      and that rises to almost 13% when companies with a minority share of ownership
      are included. In France, the government also holds shares in some companies mostly
      in areas like energy, transportation, and finance, but private parties control
      the vast majority of businesses. The second part of the textbook definition of
      socialism is “an equal distribution of wealth.” That statement is found in a number
      of textbooks. It implies that each person possesses the same amount of assets
      and income. It is not only untrue, but in all likelihood impossible to administer.
      No country that I know of has ever even attempted an equal distribution. In the
      United States, the socialist Eugene V. Debs was a fierce critic of capitalism,
      but he never suggested an equal distribution of wealth. The most well-known socialist
      in the U.S. today is Senator Bernie Sanders, and he has never proposed an equal
      distribution of wealth. Communism as defined in textbooks Given that communism
      is so often referred to in the text, as “an enemy,” it is important for students
      to develop a real understanding of what it is and why it was labeled an enemy.
      At the very least the students should understand  how basic ideas of communism
      developed as responses to the massive inequalities coming from industrial capitalism.
      None of that is what I have found in any high school text. In “ The Americans
      ,” communism is defined as “An economic and political system based on one party
      government and state ownership of property.” In “ History Alive! ” it is “An economic
      or political system, in which the state owns all property and the means of production.”
      If this definition is limited to the USSR and the post-WWII satellites in Eastern
      Europe it is at least minimally correct. The state did own “the means of production”
      and most of the businesses, but, according to most analysts , wide-spread state
      ownership was not very effective. For that reason, in 1987, then Soviet leader
      Mikhail Gorbachev wrote Perestroika in which he outlined ideas for reforming the
      Soviet system. Then in 1990 the Soviet parliament approved a law allowing private
      ownership of small factories and businesses. Similar changes were made in some
      soon to be former satellite states, but soon after that the Soviet system fell
      apart. Is confusedness a word? Word or not, at this point confusion and uncertainty
      are what we have. As an example of one source of uncertainty, most of the national
      governments that Americans almost always refer to as communist (i.e., Cuba, China)
      claim to be socialist. China is officially a communist state, but its economy
      is often referred to, by the Chinese, as a socialist market economy or “socialism
      with Chinese characteristics .” Communist Cuba calls itself a socialist state
      led by the Communist Party. Vietnam calls itself a socialist republic and is,
      importantly, no longer considered an enemy. Another source of uncertainty may
      stem from the fact that Karl Marx called himself a socialist. Some blame for confusion
      should also be assigned to the textbooks used in the required courses in world
      history. In general, those books neglect to explain the extraordinary differences
      among contemporary governments in places like Denmark, France and Germany versus
      that of the former Soviet Union or present-day North Korea. Perhaps, publishers
      expect an increase in state adoptions (thus, increased revenue) for boldly confounding
      democratic socialism with authoritarian communism. No matter what the pressure
      on publishers, history should never be written to propagandize, or to instill
      patriotism. History should never be cleansed just to please the reader or to inspire
      the student. Publishers should stick to facts; slavery was brutally real. Ethnic
      cleansing and genocide were and are real. Racism was and is real. I began this
      with Winston Smith’s desperate attempts to remember. Near the end of Orwell’s
      prophetic novel , he summarized Big Brother’s work like this: The past was erased,
      the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. That should serve as a warning
      to all of us. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    paragraph_summary: The article by Jim Mamer, published on ScheerPost, explores the
      systematic erasure of the American Left and inconvenient historical facts from
      high school history textbooks, reflecting a broader societal trend of historical
      memory manipulation. It argues that this deliberate omission mirrors the suppression
      of critical narratives about European settler colonialism, institutionalized inequality,
      and discrimination based on race and gender. The piece draws parallels to George
      Orwell's "1984," emphasizing that controlling historical narratives shapes present
      and future perceptions. It highlights current actions by the U.S. government,
      such as the removal of environmental data and the renaming of Navy ships honoring
      civil rights leaders, as part of a troubling pattern to sanitize history and obscure
      the contributions of marginalized groups.

      to ScheerPost This is the first of three articles on how the American Left is
      remembered, or not, in high school textbook American History. Part 1 deals with
      the larger society within which our textbooks exist. The deliberate elimination
      of inconvenient facts from textbooks mirrors their elimination from daily life.
      The misuse of language, specifically the use of faulty definitions, is as common
      in textbooks as it is in media. Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his
      enemy is. Assata Shakur Assata: An Autobiography 1987 In 1984 Winston Smith wanted
      to remember. He wanted to remember details from the past as much as he wanted
      to remember the photograph that had just been destroyed. As punishment for wanting
      to remember he was made to repeat and repeat and repeat the slogan, “Who controls
      the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” What
      was true in Orwell’s 1984 is true in our 2025. Historical memory is being eliminated
      by prohibiting the teaching of European settler campaigns against the Indigenous,
      institutionalized inequality and historical discrimination on the basis of race
      or sex. As I write, the U.S. government is scrubbing critical environmental data
      from federal websites. The Pentagon is removing thousands of documents and photographs
      honoring the contributions of women and people of color. Perhaps the ugliest and
      most petty attempt to bury inconvenient names is Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s 2025
      order to rename Navy ships which honor a variety of civil rights leaders. Here
      are some of the names to be eliminated. The pattern is unmistakable. United States
      Naval Ship ( USNS ) Harvey Milk : Meant to honor the memory of the gay rights
      campaigner who served in the Navy during the Korean War before being discharged
      for his sexuality. USNS Thurgood Marshall: Named in honor of Thurgood Marshall,
      the first African American U.S. Supreme Court Justice and a pioneering civil rights
      attorney. USNS Cesar Chavez: Named after Cesar Chavez, a labor leader and civil
      rights activist who co-founded the United Farm Workers union. USNS Medgar Evers:
      Commemorates Medgar Evers, a civil rights activist and World War II veteran assassinated
      by a white supremacist in 1963. USNS Harriet Tubman: Honors Harriet Tubman, an
      Underground Railroad conductor and Union spy during the Civil War. She liberated
      over 700 enslaved individuals and was posthumously awarded the rank of brigadier
      general in the Maryland National Guard. USNS Dolores Huerta: Honors a labor leader
      and co-founder of the United Farm Workers alongside Cesar Chavez. USNS Lucy Stone:
      Honors a suffragist and abolitionist who was arrested for participating in protests
      for women’s suffrage. In prison she was beaten, tortured and force-fed. USNS Ruth
      Bader Ginsburg: Honors the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice known for her lifelong
      advocacy of gender equality and civil rights. These efforts are recent, but they
      are not new. For decades much of the history in high school textbooks has been
      cleansed of inconvenient material. These are some of the “missing links” that
      I have written about in a series for ScheerPost . In this installment, I intend
      to explore the disappearance of historical contributions made by American socialists,
      communists and fellow travelers (aka the American Left) in establishing worker
      rights and civil rights for the American people. Who controls the past controls
      the future Did you ever learn that communists and socialists have made positive
      contributions to American society? Do you know that both groups worked to establish
      labor unions and to ensure the rights of American workers? Did you know that socialist
      labor unions are, at least partly, responsible for the 8-hour-workday? Did you
      know that the American Communist Party contributed to the struggle for civil rights
      and racial justice in the early 20th century? Did you learn, in school, about
      the Scottsboro Boys and who came to their defense? Are you aware that the left-wing
      has significant roots in American history? Did you learn that in the 1912 presidential
      election when the Socialist Party candidate, Eugene V. Debs, secured six percent
      of the popular vote, socialists already held 1,200 offices in 340 cities, including,
      in 79 cities, the office of mayor. According to a Brookings Institute paper, FDR’s
      New Deal drew on socialist proposals to create Social Security. Lyndon Johnson’s
      “war on poverty” was inspired by the book The Other America written by Michael
      Harrington who, in 1968, became the chairman of the Socialist Party of America.
      Were you taught any of that? Eliminating the history and accomplishments of the
      left-wing is deliberate. Burying selective parts of the past distorts our understanding
      of who we have been and who we are. Who controls the present controls the past
      Richard Hofstadter wrote in The Paranoid Style in American Politics that the “far-right”
      practiced a style of rhetoric consistent with paranoia. Political paranoia, he
      wrote, sees conspiracies to be “directed against a nation, a culture, a way of
      life whose fate affects not [only] himself but millions of others.” Such paranoia
      often manifests itself in exaggerated terminologies. For example, Tea Party opposition
      to the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) involved charges that it was a “ socialist
      takeover. ” Conservative commentator Bill Kristol compared Obamacare to communism.
      No matter what they said, the ACA was about expanded health care not a conspiracy. 
      Paranoia and exaggeration go hand in hand and are most effective when directed
      at those who have no idea what the terms actually mean. Take the recent attempt
      by Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem , to justify use of National
      Guard Forces on the streets of Los Angeles. “We are not going away,” she said.
      “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome
      leadership that this governor and this mayor … have tried to insert into the city.”
      Who is she referring to? Of course, claiming that LA needs to be liberated “from
      socialists” is nonsense, but such rhetoric can normalize disinformation especially
      when it is reported in the media without correction. A free press should be expected
      to correct what are obviously factual errors and state clearly, for example, that
      the National Guard was not in Los Angeles to liberate the city from anyone, let
      alone socialists. Language is never neutral. It is deeply intertwined with the
      interests of those who dominate public discourse. As the meanings of political
      terms are transformed, they cease to be complex ideologies and often become justifications
      for dismissing anything that the powers that be wish dismissed. As a result, terms
      like “socialism” and “communism” are transformed into labels to be afraid of,
      rather than ideas worth defining. In the end, history will be shaped by what is
      remembered. Liberals are neither socialists nor communists For a variety of reasons,
      many Americans continue to suffer from wide-spread ideological confusion. The
      confusion comes from more than one source, but mostly from inadequate schooling.
      If students never learn to clearly define terms like “socialism,” “democracy,”
      “liberal/conservative” or “communism” they will be vulnerable to ever-present
      attempts at manipulation. More than a few politicians take advantage of this,
      Senator Mike Lee (R-Ut) for example, reacted to a June 2025 assassination of two
      Minnesota lawmakers by posting on X, “This is what happens when Marxists don’t
      get their way.” The term Marxist is here used as an epithet meant to discredit
      the suspected shooter or his supposed acquaintances. Or perhaps he was trying
      to discredit Karl Marx, it is hard to tell. Donald Trump managed to top Sen. Lee
      with his own abuse of political labels. During the 2025 campaign, speaking in
      Arizona , he called Kamala Harris a “socialist, Marxist, communist, and fascist”
      in one campaign speech. That made so little sense that he might just as well have
      added cannibal and vegetarian. Disappeared from textbooks When artists, writers,
      social reformers, critics of war and union leaders self-identify as socialists
      or communists, or simply as sympathetic to the left, that is a fact not usually
      mentioned in the textbooks. But even when such individuals are too significant
      to leave out, their political convictions are ignored as much as possible. These
      are serious omissions with serious consequences. For example, any history of the
      Harlem Renaissance will include Langston Hughes , but the fact that he spent decades
      supporting communist and socialist programs is seldom made clear. In his writing,
      however, his politics are clear. In 1935, his poem “Let America Be America Again
      ” identified exactly what the Trump Administration is trying to remove from the
      history curriculum and thus from our common memory. Say who are you that mumbles
      in the dark? And who are you that draws your veil across the stars? I am the poor
      white, fooled and pushed apart, I am the Negro bearing slavery’s scars. I am the
      red man driven from the land, I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek And
      finding only the same old stupid plan. Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.
      Manufactured ignorance or how we got here As an adolescent, what I learned about
      communism and socialism did not come from a classroom. It was delivered most afternoons
      in syndicated repeats of two black and white television shows. When I was 8 and
      9-years-old, for reasons beyond my control, television was both my babysitter
      and my favorite teacher. Most of those political lessons came from “ I Led 3 Lives
      ” and “ Superman ”. The first was billed as the real-life story of Herbert A.
      Philbrick , an advertising executive recruited by J. Edgar Hoover to spy on “a
      network of subversive communist fronts.” The second featured a “mild-mannered
      reporter” who was also the embodiment of “truth, justice and the American way.”
      Each episode of “3 Lives” began with unforgettable melodramatic music and a perilous
      voice-over assuring viewers that Philbrick had really been “a citizen, a communist,
      and a counterspy.” Never subtle, it was perfect for an 8-year-old. In total, 117
      half-hour episodes “were broadcast over 600 stations in an overt attempt to take
      anti-Communism into mass culture.” The fourth episode, Railroad Strike Attempt
      , is still worth watching (and discussing in a classroom). It presents a story
      of “satisfied railway workers” being manipulated, by their union bosses, into
      striking and thus harming American transport. Superman usually battled gangsters
      and con artists, but there were episodes focused on the ever-present communist
      threat. In “ The Monkey Mystery, ” a young “Eastern European woman” is threatened
      by the same communists who had recently killed her scientist/father. Alfred Eaker,
      a filmmaker and critic , calls it “a delightfully far-fetched mystery.” Occasionally,
      real teachers made things worse. My 8th grade teacher, a Franciscan nun, recommended
      a book by J. Edgar Hoover titled Masters of Deceit : The Story of Communism in
      America . She read a section to the class and suggested that it would help us
      identify nearby communists. I looked forward to the challenge, but the only communists
      I could identify were in the convent because they lived communally and owned nothing
      individually. The fact is that most of my generation entered high school having
      learned to fear stuff we did not understand. I can’t help but wonder how much,
      or if, that has changed. Ask yourself if you learned, in school, a useful understanding
      of communism? But does it even matter what we learn or don’t learn in school?
      While I assume that, if you are reading this, you know that the Soviet Union no
      longer exists and you know that Russia is no longer a communist state. Most of
      us remember news reports from the Berlin Wall to Boris Yeltsin. But for many,
      after learning to fear the Soviets because they were communists, they couldn’t
      let go. In a 2022 Economist /YouGov poll , 42% of Americans thought that Russia
      was still communist. This nostalgia for a communist Russia has even infected the
      Senate. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) asserted in 2022 that Russia had invaded
      Ukraine because, “It’s a communist country, so he [Putin] can’t feed his people,
      so they need more farmland.” You can’t make this up. Check the link. Manufactured
      ignorance or the Russians are coming On the flip side of a poorly defined but
      ominous enemy is the assumed validity of clichés like “My country, right or wrong.”
      Such simple sentiments manifest themselves in convictions that are passed from
      person to person like a virus. One example comes from the autobiography of an
      American political activist, Assata Shakur . Midway through the book she recalls
      a discussion she had in 1964, when she was about 17. She tried to justify the
      growing U.S. role in Vietnam by suggesting that, “the U.S. was fighting for Democracy.”
      When she added that the communists “wanted to take over everything,” someone asked
      her what communism was and she quickly realized she had no idea. “My image of
      a communist came from a cartoon. It was a spy with a black trench coat and a black
      hat pulled down over his face, slinking around corners… I knew I didn’t know what
      the hell communism was, and yet I’d been dead set against it…. I never forgot
      that day…. Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his enemy is.” At the same
      age, my understanding of Cold War politics was similar. Her convictions had come
      from cartoons, mine had come from a couple of old television shows. I too did
      not know what communism was and I too might have imagined a secretive man wearing
      a black trench coat. By the 1970s, Ms. Shakur had become a member of the Black
      Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army. She became a target of COINTELPRO
      , an FBI counterintelligence program created to discredit and neutralize organizations
      including the Panthers and the Communist Party. Long story short, in 1984 she
      was granted political asylum in Cuba, where she still lives . The first time I
      was called a communist I was 16. I had agreed to pass out flyers supporting the
      grape boycott in the parking lot of a Safeway. One woman, after glancing at the
      flyer, looked at me and grumbled, “You, young man, must be a communist!” As she
      dropped the flyer, she seemed unnecessarily angry. I was supporting a farmworker
      strike in Delano, California, but I didn’t see how that was connected to communism,
      until I quickly realized that it made sense in an I-Led-3-Lives kind of way. That
      is, it made sense when almost any act of advocacy or dissent could be reframed
      as subversive. Fortunately, by that time, I had come to the same conclusion as
      Assata Shakur: “Only a fool lets somebody else tell him who his enemy is.” Misleading
      definitions The textbooks define the economic and political system of the United
      States as it is seen by most industrialists and most “successful” politicians.
      Thus, the United States is simply identified as capitalist. In the textbooks,
      unions, socialists, communists, and social anarchists are conversely portrayed
      as challengers to that capitalism. All of these terms are then defined carelessly
      and sometimes even incorrectly. Capitalism as defined in textbooks Adam Smith
      did not use the word “capitalism” in his work. Instead, he wrote about “commercial
      society” which, according to the Encyclopedia of Philosophy , emphasizes his belief
      that the economic is only one component of the human condition. Instead of using
      the term “capitalism,” “ The Americans ” uses the term “free enterprise” while
      “ History Alive! ” uses “capitalism,” but in both textbooks the essence of the
      definition is the same. Capitalism is “an economic system, in which private businesses
      and individuals control the means of production.” Such a rudimentary definition
      is not very useful. In the United States, for example, governments (federal, state
      and local) have substantial ownership and substantial control. Government spending
      accounts for more than one third of GDP and the federal government owns about
      28% of the land . So, it is not simply businesses that control “the means of production.”
      According to the textbooks, Adam Smith was also a strong advocate of competition,
      but there is no discussion of currently existing monopolies. When monopolies are
      discussed, it is largely in the context of the early twentieth century (i.e.,
      Carnegie and U.S. Steel, Rockefeller and Standard Oil and Teddy Roosevelt the
      “trust buster.”) Socialism as defined in textbooks Socialism is defined in “ The
      Americans ” as “An economic and political system based on government ownership
      of business and property, and an equal distribution of wealth.” The definition
      is basically the same in “ History Alive!”. Neither is correct. In the real world
      there are many political parties and various governments that claim the label
      socialist. An honest high school textbook might start there, but I would focus
      on what is called democratic socialism because that is the most relevant in the
      American context which includes Eugene V. Debs, Senator Bernie Sanders and others
      including Zohran Mamdani , the recent winner in the Democratic primary for Mayor
      of New York City. Democratic socialism aims to achieve goals through democratic
      means, respecting civil liberties and political pluralism. Predictably, it didn’t
      take long for Trump to misuse clearly defined terms for his own purpose. On July
      1 , he called the democratic socialist a communist. “Look, we don’t need a communist
      in this country, but if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him…” Many
      European countries have active socialist parties including the Social Democratic
      Party of Germany ( SPD ), the French Socialist Party ( PS), and the Spanish Socialist
      Workers’ Party ( PSOE ).  Each of these parties advocates different policies,
      but in none of them does the government own “the businesses.” If you doubt this,
      look it up. Among European countries, Norway seems to have the most state-owned
      enterprises . The Norwegian state owns about 9.6% of all non-agricultural business
      and that rises to almost 13% when companies with a minority share of ownership
      are included. In France, the government also holds shares in some companies mostly
      in areas like energy, transportation, and finance, but private parties control
      the vast majority of businesses. The second part of the textbook definition of
      socialism is “an equal distribution of wealth.” That statement is found in a number
      of textbooks. It implies that each person possesses the same amount of assets
      and income. It is not only untrue, but in all likelihood impossible to administer.
      No country that I know of has ever even attempted an equal distribution. In the
      United States, the socialist Eugene V. Debs was a fierce critic of capitalism,
      but he never suggested an equal distribution of wealth. The most well-known socialist
      in the U.S. today is Senator Bernie Sanders, and he has never proposed an equal
      distribution of wealth. Communism as defined in textbooks Given that communism
      is so often referred to in the text, as “an enemy,” it is important for students
      to develop a real understanding of what it is and why it was labeled an enemy.
      At the very least the students should understand  how basic ideas of communism
      developed as responses to the massive inequalities coming from industrial capitalism.
      None of that is what I have found in any high school text. In “ The Americans
      ,” communism is defined as “An economic and political system based on one party
      government and state ownership of property.” In “ History Alive! ” it is “An economic
      or political system, in which the state owns all property and the means of production.”
      If this definition is limited to the USSR and the post-WWII satellites in Eastern
      Europe it is at least minimally correct. The state did own “the means of production”
      and most of the businesses, but, according to most analysts , wide-spread state
      ownership was not very effective. For that reason, in 1987, then Soviet leader
      Mikhail Gorbachev wrote Perestroika in which he outlined ideas for reforming the
      Soviet system. Then in 1990 the Soviet parliament approved a law allowing private
      ownership of small factories and businesses. Similar changes were made in some
      soon to be former satellite states, but soon after that the Soviet system fell
      apart. Is confusedness a word? Word or not, at this point confusion and uncertainty
      are what we have. As an example of one source of uncertainty, most of the national
      governments that Americans almost always refer to as communist (i.e., Cuba, China)
      claim to be socialist. China is officially a communist state, but its economy
      is often referred to, by the Chinese, as a socialist market economy or “socialism
      with Chinese characteristics .” Communist Cuba calls itself a socialist state
      led by the Communist Party. Vietnam calls itself a socialist republic and is,
      importantly, no longer considered an enemy. Another source of uncertainty may
      stem from the fact that Karl Marx called himself a socialist. Some blame for confusion
      should also be assigned to the textbooks used in the required courses in world
      history. In general, those books neglect to explain the extraordinary differences
      among contemporary governments in places like Denmark, France and Germany versus
      that of the former Soviet Union or present-day North Korea. Perhaps, publishers
      expect an increase in state adoptions (thus, increased revenue) for boldly confounding
      democratic socialism with authoritarian communism. No matter what the pressure
      on publishers, history should never be written to propagandize, or to instill
      patriotism. History should never be cleansed just to please the reader or to inspire
      the student. Publishers should stick to facts; slavery was brutally real. Ethnic
      cleansing and genocide were and are real. Racism was and is real. I began this
      with Winston Smith’s desperate attempts to remember. Near the end of Orwell’s
      prophetic novel , he summarized Big Brother’s work like this: The past was erased,
      the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. That should serve as a warning
      to all of us. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    paragraph_summary: The article by Jim Mamer, published on ScheerPost, explores the
      systematic erasure of the American Left and inconvenient historical facts from
      high school history textbooks, reflecting a broader societal trend of historical
      memory manipulation. It argues that this deliberate omission mirrors the suppression
      of critical narratives about European settler colonialism, institutionalized inequality,
      and discrimination based on race and gender. The piece draws parallels to George
      Orwell's "1984," emphasizing that controlling historical narratives shapes present
      and future perceptions. It highlights current actions by the U.S. government,
      such as the removal of environmental data and the renaming of Navy ships honoring
      civil rights leaders, as part of a troubling pattern to sanitize history and obscure
      the contributions of marginalized groups.

      was the shooter, and that Mr. Ray was set up to take the blame.” “As we review
      these newly released files, we will assess whether they offer additional insights
      beyond the findings our family has already accepted,” their statement said. As
      his relatives noted, the FBI infamously surveilled King—America’s most hated man,
      according to a 1968 Harris poll that showed the civil rights icon with a 75% negative
      approval rating—under the notorious COINTELPRO program, especially after his civil
      rights activism evolved into staunch critiques of U.S. militarism during the escalating
      Vietnam War and capitalism-driven economic inequality. Then-Attorney General Robert
      F. Kennedy authorized the wiretapping of King’s phone, with the head agent in
      charge of COINTELPRO, William Sullivan, warning that “we must mark [King]… as
      the most dangerous Negro of the future in this nation.” This, just before King
      was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 for helping to lead the struggle against
      Jim Crow segregation and disenfranchisement. The FBI systematically bugged King’s
      home and hotel rooms, mailed an anonymous letter urging him to kill himself, and
      even sent a tape of what it claimed was King having one of his numerous alleged

      convoy sent by the U.N. World Food Programme in northern Gaza in the hopes of
      getting flour. In a statement, the U.N. agency said, quote, “As the convoy approached,
      the surrounding crowd came under fire from Israeli tanks, snipers and other gunfire,”
      unquote. These latest killings come as the starvation crisis in Gaza continues
      to deepen. UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, has accused Israel
      of starving civilians, including a million children. The entire population, more
      than 2 million people, lack access to sufficient food, putting their lives at
      immediate risk. Health authorities in Gaza say 19 people died of starvation over
      the last day, including at least one infant. This is the uncle of 3-month-old
      Yahya Al-Najjar. ANAN AL-NAJJAR: [translated] He died due to malnutrition and
      the unavailability of baby formula at the Gaza Strip. We urge the entire world,
      all Arab countries and everyone with a living consciousness, humanity and dignity,
      to just stand with the children, just to let baby formula get into the Gaza Strip.
      AMY GOODMAN: Since late May, when militarized aid sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed
      so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were established, nearly 900 Palestinians
      have been killed while attempting to access aid, and more than 5,700 have been
      injured. This is the brother of Raed Sindy, who was killed by Israeli fire while
      attempting to access aid yesterday at a site run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian
      Aid Foundation. AHMED SINDY: [translated] They go out just trying to stave off
      their hunger and the hunger of their children, but they come back wrapped in shrouds.
      We ask God Almighty, and we appeal to the international community, that these
      death traps be shut down and that humanitarian corridors be opened, out of mercy
      for our children, our women and our elderly. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined
      by two guests. In London, Davide Piscitelli is with us, an advanced researcher
      at Forensic Architecture at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he co-directs
      Gaza research and is working on a forthcoming report tentatively titled “The Architecture
      of Genocidal Starvation in Gaza.” And in Somerville, Massachusetts, Alex de Waal
      is with us, executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University,
      author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine . He’s working
      with Forensic Architecture on their report on starvation in Gaza. Welcome you
      both to Democracy Now! Davide Piscitelli, let’s begin with you. You are coming
      out with this final report in the next few weeks, but you felt it was critical
      to get out something faster than that. Talk about why and what you found. DAVIDE PISCITELLI:
      Yeah, thank you. What we saw yesterday, with over 90 people being killed while
      seeking aid, is something that we have been seeing daily since the end of May,
      especially with the introduction of the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid system
      and also the dismantling of the U.N. system already in place, forcing civilians
      waiting aid at the crossing, like yesterday at the Zikim crossing in the north.
      In our forthcoming report, we are analyzing how the militarized aid system, the GHF,
      is replacing the U.N. system in Gaza. The GHF is where we see most of the violence
      right now, especially in the proximity of the GHF, but also inside the GHF and
      along the path. And there is a reason for this. The GHF system has only like four
      stations. As we know, three are in Rafah, south of Gaza. One is in central, close
      to the Wadi Gaza. And this is only for the population that are in the south. So,
      the population that are in the north, they are completely cut out of this system.
      And we are comparing four stations to the 400 sites of the U.N. model. So, we
      have been collecting and verifying visual evidence of attacks against civilians
      and infrastructure, again, both in the proximity of the GHF or inside them. And
      we also analyze the temporal and spatial architecture of the GHF system, which
      is a system that is designed to be little. So, what we saw yesterday and the day
      before and in the past month is just the result of this new, introduced militarized
      system. I can speak a bit more about the spatial and temporal architecture of
      the system, if you like. AMY GOODMAN: Go ahead. DAVIDE PISCITELLI: So, the GHF system,
      we are analyzing in two elements. Like, the spatial element, we call it a militarized
      system, because over the past 21 months we were analyzing satellite images, and
      we see how — we saw a lot of destruction. As we all know, virtually all Gaza has
      been destroyed. But in the meantime, there is a military infrastructure that is
      growing inside Gaza, starting from the margin, especially over the month of April
      and May 2025. We saw the complete destruction of Rafah and the construction of
      the corridor, the Morag Corridor. So, between the Morag Corridor and the Philadelphi
      Corridor, we start to see pop up new military stations. And few days after, we
      started to see what is today the aid distribution center of the GHF starting to
      grow out of this infrastructure. So the GHF aid system is an extension of the
      military infrastructure that Israelis put in place in Gaza. And then there’s a
      temporal element of it. We analyzed over 160 announcements of the GHF. And by
      putting them on a timeline, we started to see that, on average, the site is only
      open for 20 to 23 minutes. And after the 19th of June, the site is only open for
      10 minutes. That means that the civilians has only 10 minutes to enter and collect
      food, when it’s possible. Another important date on the time is the time between
      the announcement and the opening. And this shrank down to 17 minutes. Having only
      17 minutes means two things: one, that Palestinians cannot access to the site,
      because they have to walk between 2.5 to 10 kilometers, by walk, under hot temperature,
      hot surfaces like sand and between rubble, but also it means that it forces further
      displacement towards the south. And we are seeing from satellite images that new
      tents are getting closer and closer to the GHF, but the GHF stations are inside
      the military zone, and this is where the shootings are happening right now. AMY GOODMAN:
      Alex de Waal, I’d like to bring you into this conversation. You’re executive director
      of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation:
      The History and Future of Famine . You’re working with Forensic Architecture on
      their report. We have just heard that in the last day 19 people, including at
      least one infant, have died of starvation in Gaza. Can you talk about why this
      is happening? ALEX DE WAAL: So, let me say that I’ve been working on this field
      of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for more than 40 years, and there
      is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely engineered, closely monitored,
      precisely designed mass starvation of a population as is happening in Gaza today.
      So, we have known, from expert reports by the United Nations, by the independent
      Famine Review Committee, by many others, exactly how this situation would unfold.
      And in May, there were some authoritative reports that indicated two trajectories
      that starvation might take in Gaza. There was then a complete siege. And if that
      siege were to be continued, Gaza would completely run out of food within weeks.
      And it takes about 60 to 80 days for an adult to die of starvation. It’s entirely
      predictable, foreseeable. A child will die much more quickly, and particularly
      a young child without infant formula, without clean water, without maternal care,
      etc. We knew this was going to happen. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has “humanitarian”
      in the name, but it is not anything that a humanitarian professional would ever
      design. There are decades of experience of how you design these operations to
      work in war zones, and the U.N. had had a system, 400 feeding stations, as Davide
      mentioned, all embedded within the community, so that you could use the support
      of the community, of families, to make sure there was minimal disruption. It wasn’t
      enough, but it was still something. Now what is happening with the Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation is that not enough food is being provided. It’s simply the rations
      are not enough. The essential food that children need is not there. The essential
      services, like clean water, like sanitation, like shelter, like fuel for cooking,
      none of those are there. And then, as this report documents, the only way in which
      people can get access to those centers is by putting themselves in harm’s way,
      by risking death by shooting, in order to get — to try and get food to feed their
      children. So, it is entirely unsurprising, exactly as was predicted. And the only
      surmise that one — the only conclusion that one can come to is that Israel is
      doing this deliberately. They know exactly what they are doing, and this is intended.
      AMY GOODMAN: Alex, you’ve referred to the ICJ — that’s the International Court
      of Justice — provisional order, more than a year ago, in March of 2024, that instructed
      Israel to provide a full spectrum of humanitarian relief and essential services
      through the U.N. Even the Israeli judge voted for it on the panel. It was unanimous.
      What happened as a result? ALEX DE WAAL: So, that was a very, very important decision.
      It was an instruction, an order by the highest court in the world, the World Court,
      if you like, to Israel. And it had that humanitarian provision. It also had a
      vote of 16 to 1 to say that this was a requirement, if Israel were to fulfill
      its obligations to prevent genocide. Now, that is very important. The Genocide
      Convention is not a convention just for punishing genocide. It’s a convention
      for preventing it. So, by definition, you can’t wait until after a genocide has
      happened or after a famine has happened. We shouldn’t wait and then count the
      graves of the children who have died, and then say, “Wasn’t that terrible? Never
      again.” When we have an authoritative warning, we need to act — and not just Israel.
      All states that are signatory to the Genocide Convention — the United States,
      Germany, the United Kingdom — everyone is required to act to prevent genocide.
      And that decision, that instruction, that order by the International Court of
      Justice — and, as you say, the Israeli former chair of the high court, Aharon
      Barak, voted for it — was the most authoritative order that one can have. And
      it has not been acted upon. And what is happening today with this Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation is an utter travesty of that. And I think we can all draw the logical
      conclusion from this shameful failure to prevent an utterly foreseeable disaster
      and crime. AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, and
      we’ll link to your reports , your preliminary findings at democracynow.org, and
      also, again, Alex, your London Review of Books article that we interviewed you

      Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation: The History and
      Future of Famine , he’s working with Forensic Architecture on their forthcoming

    paragraph_summary: The article highlights the escalating starvation crisis in Gaza,
      exacerbated by Israel's blockade and violent attacks on civilians seeking aid.
      A report by analysts Davide Piscitelli and Alex de Waal describes the situation
      as a meticulously engineered mass starvation, with de Waal noting that there has
      never been a case of such targeted famine in his 40 years of work in humanitarian
      crises. Recent events have seen Israeli forces kill at least 115 people, including
      92 who were attempting to secure aid, with a particularly deadly incident occurring
      at the Zikim crossing where 79 individuals were killed while gathering near a
      U.N. aid convoy. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has accused Israel of
      deliberately starving the population, which includes over a million children,
      as more than 2 million people in Gaza face severe food shortages.

      The starvation crisis in Gaza is deepening under Israel’s brutal blockade and
      amid regular massacres of civilians attempting to secure aid at the only officially
      sanctioned aid sites, run by Israeli troops and American mercenaries. The so-called
      Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the onset of famine are the subjects of a new
      report by analysts Davide Piscitelli and Alex de Waal for the research organization
      Forensic Architecture on the “architecture of genocidal starvation” in Gaza. “I’ve
      been working on this field of famine, food crisis and humanitarian action for
      more than 40 years, and there is no case, over those four decades, of such minutely
      engineered, closely monitored, precisely designed mass starvation of a population
      as is happening in Gaza today,” says de Waal, who is also the author of Mass Starvation:
      The History and Future of Famine . Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy
      may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: In one of the deadliest days yet for
      aid seekers in Gaza, Israeli forces killed at least 115 people on Sunday, including
      92 who were killed while seeking aid. In the deadliest attack, at least 79 people
      at the Zikim crossing in North Gaza were massacred as they gathered near an aid

      Alex de Waal, I’d like to bring you into this conversation. You’re executive director
      of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University, author of Mass Starvation:
      The History and Future of Famine . You’re working with Forensic Architecture on
      their report. We have just heard that in the last day 19 people, including at

      A report by analysts Davide Piscitelli and Alex de Waal describes the situation
      as a meticulously engineered mass starvation, with de Waal noting that there has
      never been a case of such targeted famine in his 40 years of work in humanitarian
      crises. Recent events have seen Israeli forces kill at least 115 people, including
      92 who were attempting to secure aid, with a particularly deadly incident occurring
      at the Zikim crossing where 79 individuals were killed while gathering near a
      U.N. aid convoy. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has accused Israel of
      deliberately starving the population, which includes over a million children,
      as more than 2 million people in Gaza face severe food shortages.

      passage of their sprawling budget reconciliation bill—which includes major attacks
      on the ACA and Medicaid—the measure could compel insurers to further raise premiums.
      Higher premiums would leave many more people unable to afford coverage. The KFF-Peterson
      analysis also pointed to a Trump administration rule that imposes new restrictions
      on ACA enrollment. “Early indications are that individual market insurers will

    text: 'Claudia Sheinbaum during the signing of a presidential decree ensuring integration
      of health services. Source: Government of Mexico/X In one of the scariest moments
      in modern history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies
      that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider
      a tax-deductible donation . By Outra Saude / Peoples Dispatch The first week of
      July could go down in history as a milestone in Mexico’s pursuit of health sovereignty.
      At a press conference held on Friday, July 4, President Claudia Sheinbaum, along
      with Health Secretary David Kershenobich and Alejandro Svarch, head of IMSS-Bienestar
      (a public agency providing healthcare services), announced an ambitious plan to
      boost domestic production of medicines and medical supplies, aiming to reduce
      the country’s reliance on imports. The urgent need for such a policy shift was
      outlined during the mañanera – the daily press briefing hosted by Sheinbaum and
      her administration – recordings of which are available online . Currently, over
      65% of the medicines and medical supplies used in Mexico are imported . According
      to Sheinbaum, the country spends nearly 300 billion Mexican pesos (approximately
      USD 16 billion) annually on these imports. Since a 2008 policy change ended purchasing
      preferences for domestically manufactured inputs, Mexico’s trade deficit in the
      health sector has only worsened. “For us, it’s essential to increase production
      within Mexico, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, not only for economic
      reasons but also for sovereignty,” Sheinbaum said. “In a vulnerable situation
      like a future pandemic, we don’t want to depend on manufacturers the entire world
      will be competing for in order to ensure supplies.” As Svarch explained during
      the press conference, the initiative includes incentives for the creation of new
      pharmaceutical plants in Mexico – initially in partnership with the private sector
      – as well as the expansion of existing facilities. To ensure consistent demand
      for these manufacturers, the government has already issued a decree mandating
      that public procurement of medical supplies prioritize companies based in Mexico.
      The initial investment , estimated at 10.5 billion pesos (approximately USD 570
      million), will be funded by the domestic private sector, not by the government.
      Dubbed the “Mexico Plan” for healthcare industrialization, the initiative also
      includes reforms to the country’s intellectual property regime. In addition to
      restructuring the agency responsible for patent approvals, there will be a strong
      emphasis on producing generic medications. Beyond bolstering health sovereignty,
      the Sheinbaum administration argues that localizing the production of medicines
      and medical equipment will accelerate economic development and lay the groundwork
      for a future free, universal, public healthcare system in Mexico. Measures to
      reclaim sovereignty Until 2008, pharmaceutical companies were required to maintain
      manufacturing facilities in Mexico in order to receive sanitary registration,
      a prerequisite for marketing medications and supplying products to the public
      sector. This regulation, known as the “plant requirement,” was revoked that year
      by former neoliberal President Felipe Calderón, on the grounds that eliminating
      the rule would reduce drug prices. In practice, the policy shift failed to lower
      medication costs and instead led to deeper market penetration by multinational
      pharmaceutical giants. Today, 14 of the world’s 15 largest pharmaceutical corporations
      operate in Mexico. Meanwhile, the market share of domestic companies in the sector
      has “fallen significantly,” said Alejandro Svarch during the press conference.
      A presidential decree signed by President Sheinbaum on June 2 reinstates a preference
      for domestic firms in public healthcare procurement. According to the text: “In
      procurement processes for medicines, healthcare supplies, and medical devices,
      the Ministry of Health shall promote the participation of individuals or legal
      entities that demonstrate investments in the national production chain, such as
      local factories, laboratories, warehouses, or other relevant infrastructure.”
      Companies meeting these criteria will receive additional points in public tenders,
      giving them a competitive edge in the bidding process. The same decree also established
      a Pharmaceutical Investment Promotion Committee. The new body will include representatives
      from the Secretariats of Health, Economy, and Anti-Corruption (Mexico’s secretariats
      are equivalent to ministries). The Health Secretariat will lead the committee,
      whose primary goal is to promote investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing infrastructure
      across the country. Government officials emphasized that future facilities should
      focus primarily on producing generic drugs. “A generic medicine can cost several
      times less than a patented one,” Svarch noted, identifying 385 pharmaceutical
      products whose patents are set to expire soon. If these drugs are manufactured
      locally, the move could yield substantial savings for the government and the population.
      The administration’s strategy appears to avoid the use of compulsory licensing
      or patent waivers; instead, it aims to wait for the expiration of existing patents
      before ramping up domestic production. At a previous press conference on May 29,
      President Sheinbaum indicated that the state-owned pharmaceutical laboratory Birmex
      would be tasked with facilitating partnerships with private firms to help expand
      Mexico’s domestic pharmaceutical industry. Noting the limited role of Mexican
      firms in pharmaceutical production, often restricted to “cardboard packaging,”
      as he put it, Alejandro Svarch explained that the government intends to reverse
      this pattern. The plan includes tying negotiations with multinational companies
      for the procurement of high-cost medications to broader commitments: not just
      local production, but also investment in technical and scientific capabilities.
      “We want a more aggressive strategy so that the industry immediately begins relocating
      its processes,” said Eduardo Clark, Undersecretary for Integration and Development
      in the Health Sector. Two components of the initiative remain less clear. No specific
      details have been released yet regarding planned reforms to the Mexican Institute
      of Industrial Property (IMPI), the agency responsible for patent approvals. Similarly,
      the proposed creation of training centers for skilled professionals in the pharmaceutical
      sector has yet to be formally outlined. The 10.5 billion pesos (approx. USD 570
      million) in planned initial investments will be distributed among four Mexican
      pharmaceutical companies. Laboratorios Kener will invest 5.1 billion pesos (approx.
      USD 275 million) to triple the capacity of its injectable drug facility by 2027
      and begin producing CAR-T cell therapies for cancer treatment. Genbio will contribute
      4 billion pesos (approx. USD 215 million) to establish a plasma fractionation
      plant. Alpharma BioGenTec will invest 800 million pesos (approx. USD 43 million)
      to develop biopharmaceutical and biotechnology infrastructure in collaboration
      with universities. Neolsym will allocate 500 million pesos (approx. USD 27 million)
      toward the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other raw
      materials. Alejandro Svarch noted that the project drew inspiration from Brazil’s
      Health Economic-Industrial Complex (CEIS). (While both models include public-private
      partnerships, the Brazilian approach is more heavily anchored in public laboratories.)
      Health Secretary David Kershenobich added that the ultimate goal is to create
      a robust “biopharmaceutical ecosystem” within Mexico. Can Mexico build a universal
      healthcare system? Unlike Brazil, which has operated the Unified Health System
      (SUS) for over three decades, Mexico does not yet have a public, free, and universal
      healthcare system. Instead, healthcare in Mexico is fragmented among three main
      agencies: ISSSTE (serving public sector employees), IMSS (for private sector workers),
      and the recently created IMSS-Bienestar (serving the poorest segments of the population,
      especially the unemployed and informal workers who lack other forms of coverage).
      Private healthcare remains a significant part of the system. This structure resembles
      Brazil’s pre-SUS era: a segmented model tied to the social security system, lacking
      coordination across institutions and not guaranteeing free care. Access is largely
      determined by contributions to social security. Former President Andrés Manuel
      López Obrador, who governed from 2018 to 2024, pledged to create a “Mexican Unified
      Health System” and took major steps to universalize the constitutional right to
      health. One of his first moves was to dismantle Seguro Popular , a neoliberal-era
      program that charged fees to citizens without formal social security coverage
      and was plagued by major corruption scandals. In its place, IMSS-Bienestar was
      launched in 2023 under the leadership of Alejandro Svarch, intended as the foundation
      for a future universal system. Like Brazil’s SUS, IMSS-Bienestar is free at the
      point of care, requires no formal enrollment, and covers both primary and specialized
      services. According to López Obrador’s final government report , the program had
      already been rolled out in 23 of Mexico’s 32 states and was serving approximately
      53 million people out of a national population of 129 million. To further promote
      free access to medications, López Obrador also established the Megafarmacia del
      Bienestar , a pharmacy operated by the state-owned pharmaceutical company Birmex.
      Any citizen with a valid prescription from one of the country’s three main public
      healthcare agencies can obtain their prescribed medications free of charge if
      available – mirroring the principles of Brazil’s SUS. Under President Claudia
      Sheinbaum, the push to “build a universal, free, high-quality, and equitable system”
      is focused on strengthening primary care, according to Ramiro López Elizalde,
      Undersecretary for Health Policies and Population Welfare. The administration
      also plans to promote “community participation” and accelerate the integration
      of hospitals, universities, and industry into the emerging national system. The
      recently announced pharmaceutical infrastructure initiatives are part of this
      broader strategy. The plan’s contradictions In an editorial published Saturday,
      July 5, the progressive newspaper La Jornada described the Sheinbaum administration’s
      plan to boost domestic pharmaceutical production as a “positive” step, but including
      some limitations. Chief among its concerns is the plan’s reliance on private Mexican
      capital, which is expected to provide the majority of the investment for implementation.
      “The experience of recent decades shows the need to closely monitor the private
      sector, as it is a well-established fact that it will always act in pursuit of
      short-term profits, even when this comes at the expense of society as a whole,”
      the editorial warned. The paper continued: “The country’s pharmaceutical sovereignty
      can only be fully restored with strong state involvement in training professionals,
      channeling investment into strategic areas of public health – which are not always
      the most profitable – fostering an industry aligned with national needs, and building
      a resilient supply chain capable of withstanding global crises and the political
      whims of Washington, which has used restrictions on vital supplies as a weapon
      against nations that challenge its hegemony.” Originally written by Guilherme

      Claudia Sheinbaum announced a plan to enhance domestic production of medicines
      and medical supplies during a press conference on July 4. This initiative, which
      includes collaboration with the private sector to establish new pharmaceutical
      plants and expand existing facilities, aims to reduce Mexico's reliance on imports,
      which currently account for over 65% of the country's medical supplies. Sheinbaum
      highlighted the financial burden of approximately 300 billion Mexican pesos (around
      USD 16 billion) spent annually on imports and emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency,
      particularly in the context of potential future pandemics. The initiative marks
      a critical shift in policy following a 2008 change that worsened the trade deficit
      in the health sector.

      a tax-deductible donation . By Outra Saude / Peoples Dispatch The first week of
      July could go down in history as a milestone in Mexico’s pursuit of health sovereignty.
      At a press conference held on Friday, July 4, President Claudia Sheinbaum, along
      with Health Secretary David Kershenobich and Alejandro Svarch, head of IMSS-Bienestar
      (a public agency providing healthcare services), announced an ambitious plan to
      boost domestic production of medicines and medical supplies, aiming to reduce
      the country’s reliance on imports. The urgent need for such a policy shift was
      outlined during the mañanera – the daily press briefing hosted by Sheinbaum and
      her administration – recordings of which are available online . Currently, over
      65% of the medicines and medical supplies used in Mexico are imported . According
      to Sheinbaum, the country spends nearly 300 billion Mexican pesos (approximately
      USD 16 billion) annually on these imports. Since a 2008 policy change ended purchasing
      preferences for domestically manufactured inputs, Mexico’s trade deficit in the
      health sector has only worsened. “For us, it’s essential to increase production
      within Mexico, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, not only for economic
      reasons but also for sovereignty,” Sheinbaum said. “In a vulnerable situation
      like a future pandemic, we don’t want to depend on manufacturers the entire world
      will be competing for in order to ensure supplies.” As Svarch explained during
      the press conference, the initiative includes incentives for the creation of new
      pharmaceutical plants in Mexico – initially in partnership with the private sector
      – as well as the expansion of existing facilities. To ensure consistent demand
      for these manufacturers, the government has already issued a decree mandating
      that public procurement of medical supplies prioritize companies based in Mexico.
      The initial investment , estimated at 10.5 billion pesos (approximately USD 570
      million), will be funded by the domestic private sector, not by the government.
      Dubbed the “Mexico Plan” for healthcare industrialization, the initiative also
      includes reforms to the country’s intellectual property regime. In addition to
      restructuring the agency responsible for patent approvals, there will be a strong
      emphasis on producing generic medications. Beyond bolstering health sovereignty,
      the Sheinbaum administration argues that localizing the production of medicines
      and medical equipment will accelerate economic development and lay the groundwork
      for a future free, universal, public healthcare system in Mexico. Measures to
      reclaim sovereignty Until 2008, pharmaceutical companies were required to maintain
      manufacturing facilities in Mexico in order to receive sanitary registration,
      a prerequisite for marketing medications and supplying products to the public
      sector. This regulation, known as the “plant requirement,” was revoked that year
      by former neoliberal President Felipe Calderón, on the grounds that eliminating
      the rule would reduce drug prices. In practice, the policy shift failed to lower
      medication costs and instead led to deeper market penetration by multinational
      pharmaceutical giants. Today, 14 of the world’s 15 largest pharmaceutical corporations
      operate in Mexico. Meanwhile, the market share of domestic companies in the sector
      has “fallen significantly,” said Alejandro Svarch during the press conference.
      A presidential decree signed by President Sheinbaum on June 2 reinstates a preference
      for domestic firms in public healthcare procurement. According to the text: “In
      procurement processes for medicines, healthcare supplies, and medical devices,
      the Ministry of Health shall promote the participation of individuals or legal
      entities that demonstrate investments in the national production chain, such as
      local factories, laboratories, warehouses, or other relevant infrastructure.”
      Companies meeting these criteria will receive additional points in public tenders,
      giving them a competitive edge in the bidding process. The same decree also established
      a Pharmaceutical Investment Promotion Committee. The new body will include representatives
      from the Secretariats of Health, Economy, and Anti-Corruption (Mexico’s secretariats
      are equivalent to ministries). The Health Secretariat will lead the committee,
      whose primary goal is to promote investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing infrastructure
      across the country. Government officials emphasized that future facilities should
      focus primarily on producing generic drugs. “A generic medicine can cost several
      times less than a patented one,” Svarch noted, identifying 385 pharmaceutical
      products whose patents are set to expire soon. If these drugs are manufactured
      locally, the move could yield substantial savings for the government and the population.
      The administration’s strategy appears to avoid the use of compulsory licensing
      or patent waivers; instead, it aims to wait for the expiration of existing patents
      before ramping up domestic production. At a previous press conference on May 29,
      President Sheinbaum indicated that the state-owned pharmaceutical laboratory Birmex
      would be tasked with facilitating partnerships with private firms to help expand
      Mexico’s domestic pharmaceutical industry. Noting the limited role of Mexican
      firms in pharmaceutical production, often restricted to “cardboard packaging,”
      as he put it, Alejandro Svarch explained that the government intends to reverse
      this pattern. The plan includes tying negotiations with multinational companies
      for the procurement of high-cost medications to broader commitments: not just
      local production, but also investment in technical and scientific capabilities.
      “We want a more aggressive strategy so that the industry immediately begins relocating
      its processes,” said Eduardo Clark, Undersecretary for Integration and Development
      in the Health Sector. Two components of the initiative remain less clear. No specific
      details have been released yet regarding planned reforms to the Mexican Institute
      of Industrial Property (IMPI), the agency responsible for patent approvals. Similarly,
      the proposed creation of training centers for skilled professionals in the pharmaceutical
      sector has yet to be formally outlined. The 10.5 billion pesos (approx. USD 570
      million) in planned initial investments will be distributed among four Mexican
      pharmaceutical companies. Laboratorios Kener will invest 5.1 billion pesos (approx.
      USD 275 million) to triple the capacity of its injectable drug facility by 2027
      and begin producing CAR-T cell therapies for cancer treatment. Genbio will contribute
      4 billion pesos (approx. USD 215 million) to establish a plasma fractionation
      plant. Alpharma BioGenTec will invest 800 million pesos (approx. USD 43 million)
      to develop biopharmaceutical and biotechnology infrastructure in collaboration
      with universities. Neolsym will allocate 500 million pesos (approx. USD 27 million)
      toward the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and other raw
      materials. Alejandro Svarch noted that the project drew inspiration from Brazil’s
      Health Economic-Industrial Complex (CEIS). (While both models include public-private
      partnerships, the Brazilian approach is more heavily anchored in public laboratories.)
      Health Secretary David Kershenobich added that the ultimate goal is to create
      a robust “biopharmaceutical ecosystem” within Mexico. Can Mexico build a universal
      healthcare system? Unlike Brazil, which has operated the Unified Health System
      (SUS) for over three decades, Mexico does not yet have a public, free, and universal
      healthcare system. Instead, healthcare in Mexico is fragmented among three main
      agencies: ISSSTE (serving public sector employees), IMSS (for private sector workers),
      and the recently created IMSS-Bienestar (serving the poorest segments of the population,
      especially the unemployed and informal workers who lack other forms of coverage).
      Private healthcare remains a significant part of the system. This structure resembles
      Brazil’s pre-SUS era: a segmented model tied to the social security system, lacking
      coordination across institutions and not guaranteeing free care. Access is largely
      determined by contributions to social security. Former President Andrés Manuel
      López Obrador, who governed from 2018 to 2024, pledged to create a “Mexican Unified
      Health System” and took major steps to universalize the constitutional right to
      health. One of his first moves was to dismantle Seguro Popular , a neoliberal-era
      program that charged fees to citizens without formal social security coverage
      and was plagued by major corruption scandals. In its place, IMSS-Bienestar was
      launched in 2023 under the leadership of Alejandro Svarch, intended as the foundation
      for a future universal system. Like Brazil’s SUS, IMSS-Bienestar is free at the
      point of care, requires no formal enrollment, and covers both primary and specialized
      services. According to López Obrador’s final government report , the program had
      already been rolled out in 23 of Mexico’s 32 states and was serving approximately
      53 million people out of a national population of 129 million. To further promote
      free access to medications, López Obrador also established the Megafarmacia del
      Bienestar , a pharmacy operated by the state-owned pharmaceutical company Birmex.
      Any citizen with a valid prescription from one of the country’s three main public
      healthcare agencies can obtain their prescribed medications free of charge if
      available – mirroring the principles of Brazil’s SUS. Under President Claudia
      Sheinbaum, the push to “build a universal, free, high-quality, and equitable system”
      is focused on strengthening primary care, according to Ramiro López Elizalde,
      Undersecretary for Health Policies and Population Welfare. The administration
      also plans to promote “community participation” and accelerate the integration
      of hospitals, universities, and industry into the emerging national system. The
      recently announced pharmaceutical infrastructure initiatives are part of this
      broader strategy. The plan’s contradictions In an editorial published Saturday,
      July 5, the progressive newspaper La Jornada described the Sheinbaum administration’s
      plan to boost domestic pharmaceutical production as a “positive” step, but including
      some limitations. Chief among its concerns is the plan’s reliance on private Mexican
      capital, which is expected to provide the majority of the investment for implementation.
      “The experience of recent decades shows the need to closely monitor the private
      sector, as it is a well-established fact that it will always act in pursuit of
      short-term profits, even when this comes at the expense of society as a whole,”
      the editorial warned. The paper continued: “The country’s pharmaceutical sovereignty
      can only be fully restored with strong state involvement in training professionals,
      channeling investment into strategic areas of public health – which are not always
      the most profitable – fostering an industry aligned with national needs, and building
      a resilient supply chain capable of withstanding global crises and the political
      whims of Washington, which has used restrictions on vital supplies as a weapon
      against nations that challenge its hegemony.” Originally written by Guilherme

      includes collaboration with the private sector to establish new pharmaceutical

      highlighted the financial burden of approximately 300 billion Mexican pesos (around
      USD 16 billion) spent annually on imports and emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency,
      particularly in the context of potential future pandemics. The initiative marks
      a critical shift in policy following a 2008 change that worsened the trade deficit
      in the health sector.

      agreed to hold nuclear talks with the UK, France, and Germany, an informed source
      told the semi-official Tasnim News Agency on 20 July. “Tehran and the European
      troika have come to an agreement in principle on the resumption of the talks about
      Iran’s nuclear program, but the timing and location of the negotiations are under
      debate,” the Iranian source said. “The decision as to which country will be hosting
      the upcoming talks has not been finalized yet,” the source added. The report goes
      on to say that “Iran was considering a request from the EU3 about the resumption
      of talks on the nuclear issue and the removal of sanctions.” Upcoming Iranian-European
      negotiations are expected to take place at the level of deputy foreign ministers.
      The UK, France, and Germany recently threatened a reimposition of UN sanctions
      under the “snapback mechanism” of the 2015 nuclear deal, which western countries
      have continued to hold Iran to despite Washington’s withdrawal from the agreement
      in 2018. Last week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei vowed a “proportionate
      and appropriate response” to any reimposition of sanctions by the European signatories
      of the 2015 deal. The Tasnim News Agency report comes as nuclear talks between
      Tehran and Washington remain stalled following the US-backed Israeli war on Iran
      last month. Iranian media said earlier this month that Tehran was considering
      a US request for a resumption of talks. Sources said at the time that Tehran may
      demand compensation for the war, which Washington joined directly with a bunker-buster
      attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. US President Donald Trump publicly said
      several times in recent weeks that talks are unnecessary, claiming Washington
      “obliterated” all of Iran’s nuclear facilities. A new US intelligence assessment
      has concluded that only one of the three Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities
      targeted in last month’s US airstrikes was seriously damaged, casting doubt on
      Trump’s claims that Iran’s nuclear capabilities were completely destroyed. A previous
      intelligence assessment noted that Iran’s nuclear program was only set back by
      months. Tehran has vowed to continue enriching uranium and building its nuclear
      program. Ali Larijani, senior advisor to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,
      said on 18 July that nuclear negotiations with the US are “not a priority” and
      “should not be rushed.” “Negotiation is a tactic. Let the leadership decide when
      it is necessary. If it isn’t, then there’s no need to use it,” he added. “There
      is no urgency for talks … They have waged a war against us; they must first explain
      why.” “Any decision to engage in diplomacy rests solely with Imam Khamenei, who
      has not yet authorized negotiations,” Larijani went on to say. Late last month,
      Israel threatened to resume the war against Iran if it attempted to move forward
      with its nuclear program. Israel Hayom reported on Thursday evening that Israel
      and the US are considering “additional strikes” on Iran. Editor’s Note : A t a

      donation . By Ju-Hyun Park / Truthout The smoke over Iran may have cleared, but
      the aftershocks of the U.S. and Israel’s unprovoked attack are still reverberating
      . In one fell swoop, Washington conclusively demonstrated its total unreliability
      as a diplomatic partner. The lessons of this moment are being metabolized by heads
      of state across the world, including on the Korean Peninsula, where Donald Trump’s
      overtures for renewed dialogue with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
      (DPRK) have so far been rebuffed. Trump’s flashy promises that he would revive
      the diplomatic process with Pyongyang never had much merit. The previous round
      of talks under his first administration significantly harmed the chances of future
      negotiations. Kim Jong Un’s recent decision to reject a personal letter from the
      U.S. president was only the latest indication of this. While Trump has vowed to
      “get the conflict solved with North Korea,” observers would do well to understand
      that North Korea places little value in the “personal relationship” between Kim
      and Trump that has been a focal point of much media chatter. Pyongyang’s official
      response to Trump’s election campaign pronouncements made this clear : “The foreign
      policy of a state and personal feelings must be strictly distinguished. For nearly
      80 years since the founding of the DPRK, the U.S. has pursued the most vicious
      and persistent hostile policy toward it.” For North Korea, talks with Trump were
      nothing novel, just the latest in a series of diplomatic engagements going back
      to the Clinton administration. Once again, Pyongyang discovered that the U.S.
      would treat negotiations as a shakedown, rather than as a dialogue. At the 2019
      Hanoi Summit, the North Korean delegation departed abruptly upon realizing the
      U.S. had no interest in lifting its blockade. Since then, the DPRK has formalized
      its stance that its nuclear weapons are not up for negotiation with foreign powers.
      Diplomatic resolution with the U.S., once a key objective of DPRK foreign policy,
      is no longer considered desirable until Washington changes its “hostile policy”
      of sanctions, constant war drills, and attempts at domestic interference. Trump’s
      attack on Iran will now cement this position. Israel technically struck Iran first,
      but this hardly matters to Pyongyang, and it shouldn’t matter to the rest of us
      either. The facts speak for themselves. The U.S. was engaged in diplomatic talks
      with Iran when, on the verge of an agreement, Washington provided logistical and
      tactical support for Israel’s unprovoked and illegal attack on military and civilian
      targets that killed hundreds of people. Israeli officials contested White House
      claims that they had acted alone, saying they received a “green light” from the
      president himself. Sen. Ted Cruz, in a now- viral gaffe , felt there was such
      little distinction between Israel and the U.S. that he simply told Tucker Carlson,
      “We are striking Iran.” The lesson is clear for observers around the world: Washington’s
      word cannot be trusted, and diplomacy could even be a fig leaf masking its real
      strategy of coercion or aggression. The echoes of Iraq in Trump’s attack on Iran
      have already been widely commented on, and the resemblance will likely not be
      lost on Pyongyang either. In the early 2000s, the U.S. could have convinced North
      Korea to avoid nuclear armament; a prior agreement to do so under Clinton already
      existed, but the U.S. was late on fulfilling its vows to provide North Korea with
      civilian nuclear technology and normalization of relations. Instead of following
      through on these promises, the George W. Bush administration branded North Korea
      part of an “Axis of Evil” and launched its “war on terror” in Afghanistan and
      Iraq. Iraq, in particular, was instructive. Prior to the U.S. invasion, the Iraqi
      government opened its doors to international weapons inspectors and voluntarily
      dismantled parts of its missile arsenal. In the end, this did nothing to deter
      Washington. In fact, had Iraq stood defiant against Washington’s pressure, or
      even actually pursued weapons of mass destruction, its sovereignty might have
      been protected, and millions of people in the region might still be alive, or
      never displaced from their homes. Eight years later, Obama’s disastrous intervention
      in Libya, a country that had previously surrendered its nuclear program in diplomatic
      talks, reinforced these lessons. Iran’s experience simply consolidates a thesis
      that, from Pyongyang’s vantage, has already been vindicated by history. The case
      of Iran also carries special implications for the Korean Peninsula, given the
      military cooperation between the DPRK and the Islamic Republic. Pyongyang has
      an extensive history as a military and political actor in West Asia. In keeping
      with its own roots as an anti-imperialist, socialist state, North Korea directly
      aided political movements confronting Zionism and imperialism in the region, including
      Nasserist Egypt, various Arab socialist parties (including within the Palestinian
      Resistance), and the Islamic Republic of Iran. North Korea is one of the few countries
      anywhere that has never recognized the state of Israel, and only one of a handful
      of non-Muslim countries in this category. In the case of Iran, North Korea was
      a military trading partner that helped arm the fledgling Islamic Republic during
      a devastating U.S.-backed invasion by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the 1980s. Iran’s
      ballistic missile arsenal was built from native adaptations of North Korean designs;
      U.S. intelligence has also long claimed Iran’s nuclear facilities bear the fingerprints
      of North Korean assistance. According to a 2006 report by Robert Hughes in Jane’s
      Defense Weekly , which has henceforth been cited in Congressional Research Office
      reports, North Korea assisted in the design and construction of Iran’s various
      underground nuclear facilities, dispatching technical experts to oversee the project
      in 2005. North Korea itself houses an underground labyrinth of military and civilian
      facilities that date back to the Korean War, when this technology was developed
      out of necessity to shield the population from Washington’s genocidal bombing.
      The truth of how each side performed militarily may not be known to the wider
      world for some time, but this latest war was nonetheless a trial run for how DPRK
      military technologies could fare in a showdown with the United States. Iran’s
      ballistic missiles, particularly its hypersonics, proved capable of shattering
      Israel’s Iron Dome in addition to THAAD, a U.S. missile defense system stationed
      in both Israel and South Korea. Meanwhile, Trump’s claims to have “obliterated”
      Iran’s nuclear facilities seem to be pure bluster. The New York Times , citing
      U.S. intelligence, reported that while ventilation tunnels at Fordow were damaged,
      the underground facility, which is the most deeply buried of all known Iranian
      nuclear sites, remained intact . If Fordow indeed remains operational, then a
      new picture of the U.S. and DPRK’s relative military capabilities emerges. The
      30,000-pound GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator “bunker buster” bomb saw its
      first-ever combat usage at Fordow. If a dozen of these weapons couldn’t collapse
      the Fordow complex, then it is likely that North Korea’s most heavily defended
      subterranean structures are also impervious to them. Routine U.S. threats to “totally
      destroy” North Korea (in Trump’s words) or to bring about the “end of [the] regime”
      (in Biden’s) would now seem far less substantiated. But if Trump’s current behavior
      is any indication, the tough talk will probably continue — and Pyongyang will
      not treat any future threats idly. Iran is also part of an emerging pattern in
      how the new administration might conduct future wars. Trump’s prior attempt at
      regime change in Yemen , initially planned as an eight-month operation, was cut
      short just 52 days in, after killing unprecedented numbers of Yemenis but achieving
      no strategic aims. This assault on Iran was even shorter, not even lasting two
      weeks (though future attacks cannot be ruled out). If a cohesive Trump Doctrine
      ever emerges, the use of short-term, highly opportunistic violence may be one
      of its pillars. For as long as Washington and Pyongyang began engaging in dialogue
      since the George H. Bush administration, U.S. presidents have frequently entertained
      the possibility of limited strikes on North Korea, including Trump in his first
      administration . Even with his strikes on Iran likely to be deemed a military
      failure, Trump now seems more, not less, likely to repeat this pattern elsewhere.
      For North Korea, drawing the correct lessons from the U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran
      is an existential matter. U.S. coercion in Korea and around the world is at untenable
      levels, with no substantial benefit for the U.S. population, not to mention the
      rest of humanity. The U.S. military conducted 275 days of war games in Korea last
      year; this year, even more war games are scheduled, and a military disaster in
      March already wounded dozens of people and damaged hundreds of buildings in the
      border village of Nogok-ri. Washington and Seoul call these military drills “defensive”
      in their public communications, but a recent report from the Atlantic Council
      gives us a more honest view. In its assessment of the recent Guardian Tiger I
      & II tabletop exercises, the think tank concludes that the U.S. must be prepared
      to fight a simultaneous nuclear war with China and North Korea , and that rather
      than doing everything possible to prevent this, Washington should “prepare for
      the possibility of a limited nuclear attack” on U.S. soil. Today, the chairpersons
      of both the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees are calling
      to redeploy U.S. nukes to the peninsula . Democrats and Republicans are mostly
      united in their hostility towards Iran and North Korea alike, but the people of
      the U.S. must be more astute. The DPRK will never answer hostility with meekness,
      but it might reciprocate genuine gestures of peace and solidarity. Those signals
      won’t come from Washington or Wall Street — it will be up to the people of this
      country to send that message instead. The call to action is simple: U.S. out of
      Korea , out of West Asia, and everywhere. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

      the aftershocks of the U.S. and Israel’s unprovoked attack are still reverberating
      . In one fell swoop, Washington conclusively demonstrated its total unreliability
      as a diplomatic partner. The lessons of this moment are being metabolized by heads
      of state across the world, including on the Korean Peninsula, where Donald Trump’s
      overtures for renewed dialogue with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
      (DPRK) have so far been rebuffed. Trump’s flashy promises that he would revive
      the diplomatic process with Pyongyang never had much merit. The previous round
      of talks under his first administration significantly harmed the chances of future
      negotiations. Kim Jong Un’s recent decision to reject a personal letter from the
      U.S. president was only the latest indication of this. While Trump has vowed to
      “get the conflict solved with North Korea,” observers would do well to understand
      that North Korea places little value in the “personal relationship” between Kim
      and Trump that has been a focal point of much media chatter. Pyongyang’s official
      response to Trump’s election campaign pronouncements made this clear : “The foreign
      policy of a state and personal feelings must be strictly distinguished. For nearly
      80 years since the founding of the DPRK, the U.S. has pursued the most vicious
      and persistent hostile policy toward it.” For North Korea, talks with Trump were
      nothing novel, just the latest in a series of diplomatic engagements going back
      to the Clinton administration. Once again, Pyongyang discovered that the U.S.
      would treat negotiations as a shakedown, rather than as a dialogue. At the 2019
      Hanoi Summit, the North Korean delegation departed abruptly upon realizing the
      U.S. had no interest in lifting its blockade. Since then, the DPRK has formalized
      its stance that its nuclear weapons are not up for negotiation with foreign powers.
      Diplomatic resolution with the U.S., once a key objective of DPRK foreign policy,
      is no longer considered desirable until Washington changes its “hostile policy”
      of sanctions, constant war drills, and attempts at domestic interference. Trump’s
      attack on Iran will now cement this position. Israel technically struck Iran first,
      but this hardly matters to Pyongyang, and it shouldn’t matter to the rest of us
      either. The facts speak for themselves. The U.S. was engaged in diplomatic talks
      with Iran when, on the verge of an agreement, Washington provided logistical and
      tactical support for Israel’s unprovoked and illegal attack on military and civilian
      targets that killed hundreds of people. Israeli officials contested White House
      claims that they had acted alone, saying they received a “green light” from the
      president himself. Sen. Ted Cruz, in a now- viral gaffe , felt there was such
      little distinction between Israel and the U.S. that he simply told Tucker Carlson,
      “We are striking Iran.” The lesson is clear for observers around the world: Washington’s
      word cannot be trusted, and diplomacy could even be a fig leaf masking its real
      strategy of coercion or aggression. The echoes of Iraq in Trump’s attack on Iran
      have already been widely commented on, and the resemblance will likely not be
      lost on Pyongyang either. In the early 2000s, the U.S. could have convinced North
      Korea to avoid nuclear armament; a prior agreement to do so under Clinton already
      existed, but the U.S. was late on fulfilling its vows to provide North Korea with
      civilian nuclear technology and normalization of relations. Instead of following
      through on these promises, the George W. Bush administration branded North Korea
      part of an “Axis of Evil” and launched its “war on terror” in Afghanistan and
      Iraq. Iraq, in particular, was instructive. Prior to the U.S. invasion, the Iraqi
      government opened its doors to international weapons inspectors and voluntarily
      dismantled parts of its missile arsenal. In the end, this did nothing to deter
      Washington. In fact, had Iraq stood defiant against Washington’s pressure, or
      even actually pursued weapons of mass destruction, its sovereignty might have
      been protected, and millions of people in the region might still be alive, or

      $86,000 to finance a tour of Israel for 16 Americans to get them to use their
      vast online influence to craft more positive images of a nation openly engaged
      in genocide. The effort is being made as Israel reacts to a significant turn in
      public opinion against it, especially by Western youth. Tel Aviv realizes its
      usual methods of propaganda — and apparently its own inhouse troll army — are
      no longer working as they once did. The daily Haaretz reported : “Foreign Ministry
      officials say the tour delivers significant media, advocacy, and diplomatic benefits
      – and represents a strategic shift, as traditional outreach is no longer sufficient
      to shape public opinion. They aim to leverage the massive followings of young
      social media influencers to bolster Israel’s standing in the U.S.” The Americans,
      whose names have not been divulged, belong to the MAGA and America First movements,
      the newspaper said. They are all younger than 30 and each have hundreds of thousands
      or millions of followers, a vast, target-rich environment for propaganda.  Israel
      intends to bring more than 500 “influencer delegations” to Israel this year, the
      ministry said. It is paying an organization called Israel365 to organize the first
      American tour because it is in a “unique position to convey a pro-Israel stance
      that aligns entirely with the MAGA and America First agenda.” Israel365’s website
      says the group “stands unapologetically for the Jewish people’s God-given right
      to the entire Land of Israel,” calls the two-state solution a “delusion,” and
      says it’s defending “Western civilization against threats from both Progressive
      Left extremism and global jihad.” Israeli officials justified the no-bid contract
      with the organization because of its “experience and know-how in creating awareness,
      engagement, and mobilization of Christian audiences regarding their support for
      the Jewish people and the State of Israel,” Haaretz reported. Ministry officials
      told the newspaper that “while older Republicans and American conservatives still
      hold pro-Israel views, positive perspectives towards Israel are falling across
      all younger age groups.” News of the tour comes after the U.S. national teachers
      union voted to ditch the Zionist curriculum of the Ant-Defamation League, which
      was influencing young American minds. Western youth, including conservatives,
      have become increasingly aware of the history of Israel’s expulsion of Palestinian
      people from their land and of Israel’s stated genocidal intent and actions in
      Gaza today. It is a wave of understanding Israel needs to contain. A ministry
      source said: “We’re working with influencers, sometimes with delegations of influencers.
      Their networks have huge followings, and their messages are more effective than
      if they came directly from the ministry.” Haaretz reported: “The strategy appears
      to be paying off. During the 12-day conflict last month with Iran, Israeli digital
      messaging garnered roughly 1.8 billion online views, boosted in part by social
      media influencers with millions of followers. The Foreign Ministry has set a goal
      of bringing 550 influencer delegations to Israel by the end of 2025 to continue
      this outreach.” The Foreign Ministry chose Israel365 because “with the rise of
      the America First movement and MAGA in American politics, it’s essential for Israel
      that the movement adopt a pro-Israel position.” A Foreign Ministry document said
      Israel365 “has the ability to smoothly link the spiritual/biblical and geopolitical
      aspects of support for Israel.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted

      donation . By Joe Lauria / Consortium News T he Israel foreign ministry will spend
      $86,000 to finance a tour of Israel for 16 Americans to get them to use their
      vast online influence to craft more positive images of a nation openly engaged
      in genocide. The effort is being made as Israel reacts to a significant turn in
      public opinion against it, especially by Western youth. Tel Aviv realizes its
      usual methods of propaganda — and apparently its own inhouse troll army — are
      no longer working as they once did. The daily Haaretz reported : “Foreign Ministry
      officials say the tour delivers significant media, advocacy, and diplomatic benefits
      – and represents a strategic shift, as traditional outreach is no longer sufficient
      to shape public opinion. They aim to leverage the massive followings of young
      social media influencers to bolster Israel’s standing in the U.S.” The Americans,
      whose names have not been divulged, belong to the MAGA and America First movements,
      the newspaper said. They are all younger than 30 and each have hundreds of thousands
      or millions of followers, a vast, target-rich environment for propaganda.  Israel
      intends to bring more than 500 “influencer delegations” to Israel this year, the
      ministry said. It is paying an organization called Israel365 to organize the first
      American tour because it is in a “unique position to convey a pro-Israel stance
      that aligns entirely with the MAGA and America First agenda.” Israel365’s website
      says the group “stands unapologetically for the Jewish people’s God-given right
      to the entire Land of Israel,” calls the two-state solution a “delusion,” and
      says it’s defending “Western civilization against threats from both Progressive
      Left extremism and global jihad.” Israeli officials justified the no-bid contract
      with the organization because of its “experience and know-how in creating awareness,
      engagement, and mobilization of Christian audiences regarding their support for
      the Jewish people and the State of Israel,” Haaretz reported. Ministry officials
      told the newspaper that “while older Republicans and American conservatives still
      hold pro-Israel views, positive perspectives towards Israel are falling across
      all younger age groups.” News of the tour comes after the U.S. national teachers
      union voted to ditch the Zionist curriculum of the Ant-Defamation League, which
      was influencing young American minds. Western youth, including conservatives,
      have become increasingly aware of the history of Israel’s expulsion of Palestinian
      people from their land and of Israel’s stated genocidal intent and actions in
      Gaza today. It is a wave of understanding Israel needs to contain. A ministry
      source said: “We’re working with influencers, sometimes with delegations of influencers.
      Their networks have huge followings, and their messages are more effective than
      if they came directly from the ministry.” Haaretz reported: “The strategy appears
      to be paying off. During the 12-day conflict last month with Iran, Israeli digital
      messaging garnered roughly 1.8 billion online views, boosted in part by social
      media influencers with millions of followers. The Foreign Ministry has set a goal
      of bringing 550 influencer delegations to Israel by the end of 2025 to continue
      this outreach.” The Foreign Ministry chose Israel365 because “with the rise of
      the America First movement and MAGA in American politics, it’s essential for Israel
      that the movement adopt a pro-Israel position.” A Foreign Ministry document said
      Israel365 “has the ability to smoothly link the spiritual/biblical and geopolitical
      aspects of support for Israel.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted

      / Truthout For weeks, unidentifiable men and women wearing neck gaiters, mismatched
      camouflage attire, gloves and baseball caps have stood outside hearing rooms at
      the federal immigration courthouse in Lower Manhattan. They block stairwells and
      elevators, waiting for immigrants to leave mandatory court appointments, before
      handcuffing them and taking them to processing centers. Family members may wait
      days before finding out where their loved ones are being held — or if they’re
      even still in the country. As U.S. immigration officials seek to arrest more than
      a million people this year, an army of plainclothes law enforcement agents has
      dispersed across the country. They arrive in unmarked vehicles while only their
      eyes peek out from a balaclava. Their bulletproof vests may identify them as “police”
      or a “federal agent” but often offer no hint as to their agency or division. They
      arrest workers at grocery stores and car washes and detain people near churches
      . They’ve been recorded smashing a car window to detain an asylum seeker, blamed
      for breaking doors and accused of intimidating reporters . For undocumented immigrants
      and asylum seekers, the specter of an arrest lurks behind every trip outside.
      For people in these communities, the fear of being quickly deported is now accompanied
      by a new concern: that they may be kidnapped by individuals pretending to be law
      enforcement officers. Legal experts, federal legislators and immigration activists
      told Truthout that by concealing their identities, immigration enforcement personnel
      have created fertile ground for impersonators to endanger the general public by
      posing as law police or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. “It’s
      creating a lot of fear, of not knowing who these people are, of suddenly people
      approaching you to tell you and asking your name and your immigration status on
      the screen when they don’t even have identification,” Rufina Reyes, the director
      of Washington-based grassroots organization La Resistencia, told Truthout while
      speaking through an interpreter. “Without any ID, without anything that can accredit
      them that they are legitimate, we could be exposed to a possible kidnapping, and
      that’s basically what’s happening.” In February, a South Carolina man was charged
      with kidnapping, impersonating a law enforcement officer and other crimes after
      video footage emerged of him confronting a Latino driver and telling the man he
      was going to be sent back to Mexico . In April , a man was arrested in Florida
      after allegedly pulling in front of a vehicle and demanding the identification
      and immigration status of two men. The same month, a Florida woman was arrested
      after allegedly kidnapping her ex-boyfriend’s wife while wearing a t-shirt that
      said “ICE,” referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and covering her
      face with a mask . In early June, a man posing as an ICE agent in Philadelphia
      reportedly robbed an automobile shop, zip-typing a woman in the process and saying
      that he “was going to take undocumented employees into custody.” Less than a week
      later, a man allegedly disguised as law enforcement fatally shot Minnesota House
      Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband and their dog. In recent weeks, immigration
      officers’ deployment of face coverings has emerged as a focus for legislators
      across various levels of government, who have argued that their widespread use
      allows immigration personnel to act as an unaccountable secret police force. As
      agencies including the FBI and IRS assist with immigration enforcement operations,
      legal rights organizations have argued that the inability to identify agents poses
      problems for oversight. “We would normally be trying to follow a paper trail and
      verify that paper trail against what we actually see happening on ground, and
      can’t do that if you don’t even know who is who is doing what,” Naureen Shah,
      director of government affairs for the equality division of the American Civil
      Liberties Union (ACLU), told Truthout . In response, Democrats have begun introducing
      bills to ensure that federal immigration agents are clearly identifiable. “We
      need to bring a national standard to ICE agents, and we need to bring transparency
      and accountability,” Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-New York), told Truthout. Velázquez
      introduced federal legislation in June to prohibit ICE agents from wearing facial
      coverings and mandate that agents have clothes displaying their name and affiliation
      with ICE while making arrests. “If we accept, as Americans, this kind of secrecy
      and abuse against immigrants, it’s only a matter of time before it is used against
      American citizens too.” That has already happened. On July 2, the ACLU of Southern
      California and other legal organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the legality
      of immigration raids around Los Angeles. The legal claim noted that “numerous
      U.S. citizens who work, reside, or just happen to be in neighborhoods with large
      numbers of people of color” are “also getting swept up.” The same day , the Mexican
      American Legal Defense and Educational Fund demanded the federal government pay
      $1 million in damages to a U.S. citizen who was detained by federal immigration
      officers at a Home Depot. For years, legal organizations have argued that the
      deceptive tactics used by ICE agents to make arrests violate the Fourth Amendment.
      ICE agents have long represented themselves as local police officers or pretended
      to be delivery workers by carrying fake business emblems, according to training
      materials obtained by the Immigrant Defense Project in 2014. The organization
      has said that ICE’s use of ruses has escalated since 2017 . But historians and
      law enforcement experts say the current omnipresent use of face coverings is a
      departure from longstanding practices by federal law enforcement conducting immigration
      operations. Despite the legal efforts to rein in their tactics, ICE personnel
      have vast authority. They can conduct arrests without a warrant . They can carry
      out operations in areas of private businesses that are considered publicly accessible,
      like a restaurant dining area. They don’t have to offer badge numbers or names,
      though they are supposed to identify themselves as an “immigration officer” after
      an arrest is made. From California to New York, stories have emerged of agents
      refusing to state their agency affiliation while carrying out operations. In June,
      footage emerged of ICE agents on Long Island detaining a Hispanic U.S. citizen.
      Elzon Lemus, who was pulled over while driving to work, said that the agents refused
      to say what agency they represented even as he sat handcuffed on the street .
      On the other side of the country, ICE personnel arrested U.S. citizen Andrea Velez,
      accusing her of assaulting a federal officer. Velez said that she did not assault
      an officer and was racially profiled, and that the people who arrested her didn’t
      identify themselves . These tactics prompted furious outcry from Democratic politicians,
      who have compared ICE’s actions to those used by authoritarian regimes and extremist
      groups. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said that she “will never accept these unlawful
      and chaotic raids.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu compared ICE agents to NSC-131, a
      New England-based neo-Nazi group . Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Donald Trump was
      using federal immigration officers as a “modern-day Gestapo.” “The KKK would mask
      themselves,” Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York) told Truthout during a phone
      call. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE have balked at these comparisons
      and framed calls to unmask agents as attempts to endanger the lives of the armed
      federal officers that rove in large groups. Agency officials have argued that
      facial coverings help protect officers. “Every day the men and women of ICE put
      their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens.
      Make no mistake, Democrat politicians like Hakeem Jeffries, Mayor Wu of Boston, Governor
      Tim Walz, and Mayor [Karen] Bass of Los Angeles are contributing to the surge
      in assaults of our ICE officers through their repeated vilification and demonization
      of ICE,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in
      an email sent to Truthout via a spokesperson. “From comparisons to the modern-day
      Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the violent rhetoric of these sanctuary politicians
      is despicable. This violence against ICE must end.” In response to a query sent
      by Truthout , the agency claimed that assaults against ICE law enforcement have
      risen 700 percent, but did not provide details about how that figure was calculated
      or how many people have been charged for the alleged assaults. They also did not
      say if instances like the arrest of New York City Comptroller Brad Lander — who
      was arrested in June and accused of assaulting a law enforcement official after
      he tried to escort a migrant past agents seeking to detain him — counted toward
      that number. Others have noted that an increase in confrontations between officers
      and protesters is not surprising given the dramatic rise in encounters between
      ICE and the public under the Trump administration as officers seek to conduct
      3,000 arrests per day to meet. Civil rights experts, immigrant advocacy groups
      and Democratic lawmakers told Truthout these arguments don’t hold water and view
      such statements as justifications for an immigration enforcement apparatus set
      on drastically expanding the scope of its authority. Since taking office, the
      Trump administration has dramatically expanded the scope of immigration enforcement
      practices by deporting people to countries where they have no ties, refusing to
      communicate with local police agencies ahead of enforcement actions , ignoring
      court orders , ramping up arrests of people without criminal convictions , detaining
      green card holders and cancelling bond hearings for immigrants who arrive in the
      U.S. illegally, meaning they will be detained for the entirety of court proceedings.
      Set against this backdrop, the unidentifiable immigration agents are just another
      symbol of a government agency that wants to act with unchecked power. The masking
      “represents the normalization of a class of federal agents, a class of law enforcement
      that has even more impunity to operate as it wishes in communities,” Emanuel Gomez
      Gonzalez, a member of Durham, North Carolina- based immigrant-rights nonprofit
      Siembra NC, which helps people understand their legal rights, told Truthout .
      “If we are asking people to record interactions, but the officer never identifies
      themselves, there is never any way to hold them accountable for actions that they’re
      captured committing that are apparent violations of constitutional rights.” That
      lack of accountability has been fostered for decades, Alex Vitale, the coordinator
      of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, told Truthout
      . “This deportation machine was created by the Democrats. Beginning with Clinton,
      the Democrats created massive investments in harsher legal frameworks, massive
      expansions of the resources for border enforcement, [and] a rhetorical acceptance
      of the deportations,” Vitale said. “Obama oversaw the highest levels of deportations
      in the nation’s history, and then Trump inherits that and further ramps it up.
      They’re all throwing up their arms like, oh my god, fascism just fell from the
      sky.” New legislative efforts to rein in ICE’s authority will face both the political
      challenge of getting passed and the practical question of whether federal agents
      would adhere to new restrictions on their conduct. Even so, those legislative
      efforts are occurring at the local, state, and federal level. In California, two
      state lawmakers introduced legislation to prohibit most law enforcement officials
      from covering their faces and mandate that they be identifiable by their uniform
      . Alex Marthews, the national chair of anti-surveillance group Restore the Fourth,
      told Truthout that his organization has been working with lawmakers in Massachusetts
      municipalities to pass ordinances that would require ICE officers to show proof
      of their agency affiliation and identity when asked by local police. Such legislation
      could be “really powerful,” said Naureen Shah of the ACLU. “People who are in
      law enforcement do not want to be scrutinized by the public,” Shah said. “So if
      you are law enforcement who doesn’t want to be questioned about what you’re doing,
      you may be less likely to show up at a city if they are asking people for ID.”
      In addition to the legislation introduced by Velázquez, Representatives Dan Goldman
      and Adriano Espaillat, introduced another piece of legislation that would amend
      the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require that DHS officers show their faces,
      identify which component of DHS they work for, and wear official insignia. On
      July 8, two Democratic senators released legislation that would require ICE agents
      to display their agency affiliation and badge number or name. Such legislation
      is virtually certain to stall with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress,
      a fact Velázquez acknowledged during her call with Truthout . House Speaker Mike
      Johnson has scoffed at the suggestion that ICE agents should be identifiable.
      Even so, skeptics have viewed the proposals as weak efforts to rein in ICE’s authority.
      The bill proposed by Velázquez would permit DHS to determine disciplinary action
      for officers who are deemed to have unnecessarily concealed their identity, while
      the legislation introduced by Goldman and Espaillat did not specify how agents
      could be punished. Vitale referred to these legislative efforts as “accountability
      theater” and argued they suffer from a more significant problem: merely requiring
      that law enforcement personnel are identifiable does little to curtail abuses
      of power. “The problem here is that people are stuck in a fantasy of liberal legal
      formalism that imagines that police are accountable to the public, but this is
      a fantasy people labor under that causes them to produce these completely naive
      and unrealistic ideas about police accountability,” Vitale said. “Even if you
      knew the identity of a federal agent who you believe is engaged in misconduct,
      there’s still no effective remedy for that.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

      to be delivery workers by carrying fake business emblems, according to training
      materials obtained by the Immigrant Defense Project in 2014. The organization
      has said that ICE’s use of ruses has escalated since 2017 . But historians and
      law enforcement experts say the current omnipresent use of face coverings is a
      departure from longstanding practices by federal law enforcement conducting immigration
      operations. Despite the legal efforts to rein in their tactics, ICE personnel
      have vast authority. They can conduct arrests without a warrant . They can carry
      out operations in areas of private businesses that are considered publicly accessible,
      like a restaurant dining area. They don’t have to offer badge numbers or names,
      though they are supposed to identify themselves as an “immigration officer” after
      an arrest is made. From California to New York, stories have emerged of agents
      refusing to state their agency affiliation while carrying out operations. In June,
      footage emerged of ICE agents on Long Island detaining a Hispanic U.S. citizen.
      Elzon Lemus, who was pulled over while driving to work, said that the agents refused
      to say what agency they represented even as he sat handcuffed on the street .
      On the other side of the country, ICE personnel arrested U.S. citizen Andrea Velez,
      accusing her of assaulting a federal officer. Velez said that she did not assault
      an officer and was racially profiled, and that the people who arrested her didn’t
      identify themselves . These tactics prompted furious outcry from Democratic politicians,
      who have compared ICE’s actions to those used by authoritarian regimes and extremist
      groups. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said that she “will never accept these unlawful
      and chaotic raids.” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu compared ICE agents to NSC-131, a
      New England-based neo-Nazi group . Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Donald Trump was
      using federal immigration officers as a “modern-day Gestapo.” “The KKK would mask
      themselves,” Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-New York) told Truthout during a phone
      call. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE have balked at these comparisons
      and framed calls to unmask agents as attempts to endanger the lives of the armed
      federal officers that rove in large groups. Agency officials have argued that
      facial coverings help protect officers. “Every day the men and women of ICE put
      their lives on the line to protect and defend the lives of American citizens.
      Make no mistake, Democrat politicians like Hakeem Jeffries, Mayor Wu of Boston, Governor
      Tim Walz, and Mayor [Karen] Bass of Los Angeles are contributing to the surge
      in assaults of our ICE officers through their repeated vilification and demonization
      of ICE,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in
      an email sent to Truthout via a spokesperson. “From comparisons to the modern-day
      Nazi gestapo to glorifying rioters, the violent rhetoric of these sanctuary politicians
      is despicable. This violence against ICE must end.” In response to a query sent
      by Truthout , the agency claimed that assaults against ICE law enforcement have
      risen 700 percent, but did not provide details about how that figure was calculated
      or how many people have been charged for the alleged assaults. They also did not
      say if instances like the arrest of New York City Comptroller Brad Lander — who
      was arrested in June and accused of assaulting a law enforcement official after
      he tried to escort a migrant past agents seeking to detain him — counted toward
      that number. Others have noted that an increase in confrontations between officers
      and protesters is not surprising given the dramatic rise in encounters between
      ICE and the public under the Trump administration as officers seek to conduct
      3,000 arrests per day to meet. Civil rights experts, immigrant advocacy groups
      and Democratic lawmakers told Truthout these arguments don’t hold water and view
      such statements as justifications for an immigration enforcement apparatus set
      on drastically expanding the scope of its authority. Since taking office, the
      Trump administration has dramatically expanded the scope of immigration enforcement
      practices by deporting people to countries where they have no ties, refusing to
      communicate with local police agencies ahead of enforcement actions , ignoring
      court orders , ramping up arrests of people without criminal convictions , detaining
      green card holders and cancelling bond hearings for immigrants who arrive in the
      U.S. illegally, meaning they will be detained for the entirety of court proceedings.
      Set against this backdrop, the unidentifiable immigration agents are just another
      symbol of a government agency that wants to act with unchecked power. The masking
      “represents the normalization of a class of federal agents, a class of law enforcement
      that has even more impunity to operate as it wishes in communities,” Emanuel Gomez
      Gonzalez, a member of Durham, North Carolina- based immigrant-rights nonprofit
      Siembra NC, which helps people understand their legal rights, told Truthout .
      “If we are asking people to record interactions, but the officer never identifies
      themselves, there is never any way to hold them accountable for actions that they’re
      captured committing that are apparent violations of constitutional rights.” That
      lack of accountability has been fostered for decades, Alex Vitale, the coordinator
      of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, told Truthout
      . “This deportation machine was created by the Democrats. Beginning with Clinton,
      the Democrats created massive investments in harsher legal frameworks, massive
      expansions of the resources for border enforcement, [and] a rhetorical acceptance
      of the deportations,” Vitale said. “Obama oversaw the highest levels of deportations
      in the nation’s history, and then Trump inherits that and further ramps it up.
      They’re all throwing up their arms like, oh my god, fascism just fell from the
      sky.” New legislative efforts to rein in ICE’s authority will face both the political
      challenge of getting passed and the practical question of whether federal agents
      would adhere to new restrictions on their conduct. Even so, those legislative
      efforts are occurring at the local, state, and federal level. In California, two
      state lawmakers introduced legislation to prohibit most law enforcement officials
      from covering their faces and mandate that they be identifiable by their uniform
      . Alex Marthews, the national chair of anti-surveillance group Restore the Fourth,
      told Truthout that his organization has been working with lawmakers in Massachusetts
      municipalities to pass ordinances that would require ICE officers to show proof
      of their agency affiliation and identity when asked by local police. Such legislation
      could be “really powerful,” said Naureen Shah of the ACLU. “People who are in
      law enforcement do not want to be scrutinized by the public,” Shah said. “So if
      you are law enforcement who doesn’t want to be questioned about what you’re doing,
      you may be less likely to show up at a city if they are asking people for ID.”
      In addition to the legislation introduced by Velázquez, Representatives Dan Goldman
      and Adriano Espaillat, introduced another piece of legislation that would amend
      the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require that DHS officers show their faces,
      identify which component of DHS they work for, and wear official insignia. On
      July 8, two Democratic senators released legislation that would require ICE agents
      to display their agency affiliation and badge number or name. Such legislation
      is virtually certain to stall with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress,
      a fact Velázquez acknowledged during her call with Truthout . House Speaker Mike
      Johnson has scoffed at the suggestion that ICE agents should be identifiable.
      Even so, skeptics have viewed the proposals as weak efforts to rein in ICE’s authority.
      The bill proposed by Velázquez would permit DHS to determine disciplinary action
      for officers who are deemed to have unnecessarily concealed their identity, while
      the legislation introduced by Goldman and Espaillat did not specify how agents
      could be punished. Vitale referred to these legislative efforts as “accountability
      theater” and argued they suffer from a more significant problem: merely requiring
      that law enforcement personnel are identifiable does little to curtail abuses
      of power. “The problem here is that people are stuck in a fantasy of liberal legal
      formalism that imagines that police are accountable to the public, but this is
      a fantasy people labor under that causes them to produce these completely naive
      and unrealistic ideas about police accountability,” Vitale said. “Even if you
      knew the identity of a federal agent who you believe is engaged in misconduct,
      there’s still no effective remedy for that.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

      operations have created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty among undocumented
      immigrants and asylum seekers in the U.S. These agents, often dressed in plain
      clothes and equipped with unmarked vehicles, have been seen waiting outside federal
      courthouses and other public places to detain individuals after their court appointments,

      International Excellencies, Friends, I express my appreciation to the government
      of Colombia and South Africa for convening this group, and to all members of the
      Hague Group, its founding members for their principled stance, and the others
      who are joining. May you keep groing and so the strength and effectiveness of
      your concrete actions. Thank you also to the Secretariat for its tireless work,
      and last but not least, the Palestinian experts—individuals and organisations
      who travelled to Bogota from occupied Palestine, historical Palestine/Israel and
      other places of the diaspora/exile, to accompany this process, after providing
      HG with outstanding, evidence-based briefings. And of course all of you who are
      here today/ It is important to be here today, in a moment that may prove historical
      indeed. There is hope that these two days will move all present to work together
      to take concrete measures to end the genocide in Gaza and, hopefully, end the
      erasure of the Palestinian for what remains of Palestine—because this is the testing
      ground for a system where freedom, rights, and justice are made real for all.
      This hope, that people like me hold tight, is a discipline. A discipline we all
      should have. The occupied Palestinian territory today is a hellscape. In Gaza,
      Israel has dismantled even the last UN function—humanitarian aid—in order to deliberately
      starve, displace time and again, or kill a population they have marked for elimination.
      In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, ethnic cleansing advances through
      unlawful siege, mass displacement, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention,
      widespread torture. Across all areas under Israeli rule, Palestinians live under
      the terror of annihilation, broadcast in real time to a watching world. The very
      few Israeli people who stand against genocide, occupation, and apartheid—while
      the majority openly cheers and calls for more—remind us that Israeli liberation,
      too, is inseparable from Palestinian freedom. The atrocities of the past 21 months
      are not a sudden aberration; they are the culmination of decades of policies to
      displace and replace the Palestinian people. Against this backdrop, it is inconceivable
      that political forums, from Brussels to NY, are still debating recognition of
      the State of Palestine—not because it’s unimportant, but because for 35 years
      states have stalled, refused recognition, pretending to “invest in the PA” while
      abandoning the Palestinian people to Israel’s relentless, rapacious territorial
      ambitions and unspeakable crimes. Meanwhile political discourse has reduced Palestine
      to a humanitarian crisis to manage in perpetuity rather than a political issue
      demanding principled and firm resolution: end permanent occupation, apartheid
      and today genocide. And it is not the law that has failed or faltered—it is political
      will that has abdicated. But today, we are also witnessing a rupture. Palestine’s
      immense suffering has cracked open the possibility of transformation. Even if
      this is not fully reflected into political agendas (yet), a revolutionary shift
      is underway—one that, if sustained, will be remembered as a moment when history
      changed course. And this is why I came to this meeting with a sense of being at
      a historical turning point —discursively and politically. First, the narrative
      is shifting: away from Israel’s endlessly invoked “right to self-defence” and
      toward the long-denied Palestinian right to self-determination—systematically
      invisibilised, suppressed and delegitimised for decades. The weaponisation of
      antisemitism applied to Palestinian words, and narratives, and the dehumanising
      use of the terrorism framework for Palestinian action (from armed resistance to
      the work of NGOs pursuing justice in international arena), has led to a global
      political paralysis that has been intentional. It must be redressed. The time
      is now. Second, and consequentially, we are seeing the rise of a new multilateralism:
      principled, courageous, increasingly led by the Global Majority it pains me that
      I have yet to see this include European countries. As a European, I fear what
      the region and its institutions have come to symbolize to many: a sodality of
      states preaching international law yet guided more by colonial mindset than principle,
      acting as vassals to the US empire, even as it drags us from war to war, misery
      to misery and when it comes to Palestine: from silence to complicity. But the
      presence of European countries at this meeting shows that a different path is
      possible. To them I say: the Hague Group has the potential to signal not just
      a coalition, but a new moral center in world politics. Please, stand with them.
      Millions are watching—hoping—for leadership that can birth a new global order
      rooted in justice, humanity, and collective liberation. This is not just about
      Palestine. This is about all of us. Principled states must rise to this moment.
      It does not need to have a political allegiance, color, political party flags
      or ideologies: it needs to be upheld by basic human values. Those which Israel
      has been mercilessly crushing for 21 months now. Meanwhile I applaud the calling
      of this emergency conference in Bogota to address the unrelenting devastation
      in Gaza. So it is on this, that focus must be directed. The measures adopted in
      January by the Hague Group were symbolically powerful. It was the signal of the
      discursive and political shift needed. But they are the absolute bear minimum.
      I implore you to expand your commitment. And to turn that commitment into concrete
      actions, legislatively, judicially in each of your jurisdictions. And to consider
      first and foremost, what must we do to stop the genocidal onslaught. For Palestinians,
      especially those in Gaza, this question is existential. But it really is applicable
      to the humanity of all of us. In  this context my responsibility here is to recommend
      to you, uncompromisingly and dispassionately, the cure for the root cause. We
      are long past dealing with symptoms, the comfort zone of too many these days.
      And my words will show that what the Hague Group has committed to do and is considering
      expanding upon, is a small commitment towards what’s just and due based on your
      obligations under international law. Obligations, not sympathy, not charity. Each
      state immediately review and suspend all ties with Israel. Their military, strategic,
      political, diplomatic, economic,  relations – both imports and exports –  and
      to make sure that their private sector, insurers, banks, pension funds, universities
      and other goods, and services providers in the supply chains do the same. Treating
      the occupation as business as usual translates into supporting or providing aid
      or assistance to the unlawful presence of Israel in the OPT. These ties must be
      terminated as a matter of urgency. I will have the opportunity to elaborate on  the
      technicalities and implications in our further sessions but lets be clear, I mean
      cutting ties with Israel as a whole. Cutting ties only with the “components” of
      it in the oPt is not an option. This is in line with the duty on all states stemming
      from the July 2024 Advisory Opinion which confirmed the illegality of Israel’s
      prolonged occupation, which it declared tantamount to racial segregation and apartheid
      . The General Assembly adopted that opinion. These findings are more than sufficient
      for action. Further, it is the state of Israel who is accused of war crimes, crimes
      against humanity and genocide, so it is the state that must be responsible for
      its wrongdoings. As I argue in my last report to the HRC, the Israeli economy
      is structured to sustain the occupation, and has now turned genocidal. It is impossible
      to disentangle Israel’s state policies and economy from its longstanding policies
      and economy of occupation. It has been inseparable for decades. The longer states
      and others stay engaged, the more this illegality at its heart is legitimised.
      This is the complicity. Now that economy has turned genocidal. There is no good
      Israel, bad Israel. I ask you to consider this moment as if we were sitting here
      in the 1990s, discussing the case of apartheid South Africa. Would you have proposed
      selective sanctions on SA for its conduct in individual Bantustans? Or would you
      have recognised the state’s criminal system as a whole? And here, what Israel
      is doing is worse. This comparison— is a legal and factual assessment supported
      by international legal proceedings many in this room are part of. This is what
      concrete measures mean. Negotiating with Israel on how to manage what remains
      of Gaza and West Bank, in Brussels or elsewhere, is an utter dishonor international
      law. And to the Palestinians and those from all corners of the world standing
      by them, often at great cost and sacrifice, I say whatever happens, Palestine
      will have written this tumultuous chapter—not as a footnote in the chronicles
      of would-be conquerors, but as the newest verse in a centuries-long saga of peoples
      who have risen against injustice, colonialism, and today more than ever neoliberal
      tyranny. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      state immediately review and suspend all ties with Israel. Their military, strategic,
      political, diplomatic, economic,  relations – both imports and exports –  and
      to make sure that their private sector, insurers, banks, pension funds, universities
      and other goods, and services providers in the supply chains do the same. Treating
      the occupation as business as usual translates into supporting or providing aid
      or assistance to the unlawful presence of Israel in the OPT. These ties must be
      terminated as a matter of urgency. I will have the opportunity to elaborate on  the
      technicalities and implications in our further sessions but lets be clear, I mean
      cutting ties with Israel as a whole. Cutting ties only with the “components” of
      it in the oPt is not an option. This is in line with the duty on all states stemming
      from the July 2024 Advisory Opinion which confirmed the illegality of Israel’s
      prolonged occupation, which it declared tantamount to racial segregation and apartheid
      . The General Assembly adopted that opinion. These findings are more than sufficient
      for action. Further, it is the state of Israel who is accused of war crimes, crimes
      against humanity and genocide, so it is the state that must be responsible for
      its wrongdoings. As I argue in my last report to the HRC, the Israeli economy
      is structured to sustain the occupation, and has now turned genocidal. It is impossible
      to disentangle Israel’s state policies and economy from its longstanding policies
      and economy of occupation. It has been inseparable for decades. The longer states
      and others stay engaged, the more this illegality at its heart is legitimised.
      This is the complicity. Now that economy has turned genocidal. There is no good
      Israel, bad Israel. I ask you to consider this moment as if we were sitting here
      in the 1990s, discussing the case of apartheid South Africa. Would you have proposed
      selective sanctions on SA for its conduct in individual Bantustans? Or would you
      have recognised the state’s criminal system as a whole? And here, what Israel
      is doing is worse. This comparison— is a legal and factual assessment supported
      by international legal proceedings many in this room are part of. This is what
      concrete measures mean. Negotiating with Israel on how to manage what remains
      of Gaza and West Bank, in Brussels or elsewhere, is an utter dishonor international
      law. And to the Palestinians and those from all corners of the world standing
      by them, often at great cost and sacrifice, I say whatever happens, Palestine
      will have written this tumultuous chapter—not as a footnote in the chronicles
      of would-be conquerors, but as the newest verse in a centuries-long saga of peoples
      who have risen against injustice, colonialism, and today more than ever neoliberal
      tyranny. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      in addressing the ongoing crisis in Palestine, particularly the dire situation
      in Gaza and the West Bank. She emphasized the importance of collective action
      to combat what she described as genocide and ethnic cleansing against the Palestinian
      people, highlighting the need for evidence-based discussions and concrete measures
      to restore rights and justice. Albanese called for unity and discipline among

      made good on his pledge to sue The Wall Street Journal over its reporting that
      he wrote a “bawdy” letter for a leather-bound album that Ghislaine Maxwell prepared
      for the 50th birthday of Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender
      who allegedly killed himself in jail while facing federal sex trafficking charges.
      Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence “for conspiring with Jeffrey
      Epstein to sexually abuse minors,” collected dozens of letters for the book, according
      to the Journal . The one allegedly crafted by Trump, the newspaper reported, “contains
      several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which
      appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker. A pair of small arcs denotes the
      woman’s breasts, and the future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below
      her waist, mimicking pubic hair.” The letter, for Epstein''s birthday, includes
      a message depicting a fake exchange between Trump and Epstein: "Enigmas never
      age" "wonderful secret." https://t.co/3wp5M9u3lT pic.twitter.com/IZlwgLvwQ7 —
      Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) July 17, 2025 As the paper—part of billionaire Richard
      Murdoch’s media empire—detailed Thursday evening: The letter concludes: “Happy
      Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” In an interview with
      the Journal on Tuesday evening, Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the
      picture. “This is not me. This is a fake thing. It’s a fake Wall Street Journal
      story,” he said. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of
      women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.” He told the Journal
      he was preparing to file a lawsuit if it published an article. “I’m gonna sue
      The Wall Street Journal just like I sued everyone else,” he said. On Friday, the
      president— a well-documented liar —sued the Journal in a federal court in Miami,
      Florida for assault, libel, and slander, according to CNN . In addition to the
      newspaper and its parent company News Corp, Politico reported , “the suit names
      WSJ reporters Khadeeja Safdar and Joe Palazzolo. It also names Rupert Murdoch
      .” Trump sued Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal in Judge Aileen Cannon''s district.

      ( @esqueer.net ) July 18, 2025 at 5:43 PM Trump had said on his Truth Social platform
      Friday morning: I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit
      against him and his ‘pile of garbage’ newspaper, the WSJ . That will be an interesting
      experience!!!” Later Friday, he addressed the filing in a post that noted his
      other recent lawsuits against media companies: BREAKING NEWS: We have just filed
      a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious,
      defamatory, FAKE NEWS “article” in the useless “rag” that is, The Wall Street
      Journal . This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors
      of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ , as well as its corporate owners
      and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!)
      at the top of the list. We have proudly held to account ABC and George Slopadopoulos,
      CBS and 60 Minutes, The Fake Pulitzer Prizes, and many others who deal in, and
      push, disgusting LIES, and even FRAUD, to the American People. This lawsuit is
      filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to
      continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive
      wrongdoings of the Fake News Media. I hope Rupert and his “friends” are looking
      forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide
      in this case. Thank you for your attention to this matter. We will, MAKE AMERICA
      GREAT AGAIN! The president’s history with Epstein has received heightened scrutiny
      in recent days, amid demand for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to release
      its full files on the late sex offender. The two men were publicly associated
      with each other in the 1990s, up until a reported falling out over a business
      deal in 2004. Epstein was first arrested for sex crimes two years later. Shortly
      after leaving the Trump administration earlier this year, Elon Musk , the richest
      man on Earth, claimed on his social media platform X that the president “is in
      the Epstein files” and “that is the real reason they have not been made public.”
      After congressional Republicans repeatedly blocked a measure that would force
      the DOJ to release all Epstein files while protecting victims early this week,
      Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) introduced the Epstein Files
      Transparency Act and warned that if it is not considered by the House of Representatives
      within seven legislative days, a discharge petition will be circulated. Late Thursday,
      after the Journal report was published, Trump said in a Truth post: “Based on
      the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney
      General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject
      to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right
      now!” In a post on X, Bondi said , “President Trump—we are ready to move the court
      tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.” Trump’s suit against the Journal
      comes as CBS parent company Paramount is under fire for its $16 million settlement
      with the Republican, who filed suit over the media organization’s handling of
      a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris , last year’s
      Democratic presidential candidate, before the November election. Among the critics
      framing that deal as a “big fat bribe” intended to secure federal approval of
      Paramount’s pending merger with Skydance is late-night host Stephen Colbert, who
      announced Thursday that CBS has canceled his show following his recent commentary.
      The network’s claim that it was a financial, not political, decision has been
      met with widespread skepticism. “It’s pretty obvious why Paramount chose to surrender
      to Trump,” U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a Friday statement. “The Redstone
      family, the major owners of the company, is in line to receive $2.4 billion from
      the sale of Paramount to Skydance, but they can only receive this money if the
      Trump administration approves this deal.” Tying the end of “The Late Show With
      Stephen Colbert” to congressional Republicans’ attack on funding for NPR and PBS
      , the DOJ targeting Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Trump’s threats to oust Federal
      Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Sanders declared that “this is what the march toward
      authoritarianism looks like.” In just the last day, Colbert was cancelled, PBS
      and NPR were defunded, and Trump threatened to sue even conservative outlets like
      the Wall Street Journal and NewsCorp over revelations related to Epstein. It sure
      looks like an open attempt at authoritarian control of the media. — Dylan Williams
      (@dylanotes) July 18, 2025 The Paramount settlement followed one in Trump’s case
      against ABC— which last December agreed to pay $15 million and release a note
      of regret after anchor and political commentator George Stephanopoulos said Trump
      had been found “liable for rape” of writer E. Jean Carroll . A federal jury found
      him civilly liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but not rape. Sanders and
      several other critics have warned that the media “succumbing to pressure” from
      Trump sets “an incredibly dangerous precedent.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

    text: 'Donald Trump | Source: X By Ralph Nader / Nader.org Since the attached article
      was published on May 2, 2025, Trump has made matters worse by having his Congressional
      Republicans shred America’s historic social safety net in one big, savage, cruel,
      and vicious bill. He also gave more power, privileges, and tax escapes to giant
      corporations who fund him, enrich him, and empower him further. Trump’s gang of
      six on the Supreme Court has blocked federal judges trying to stop his violations
      of law and the Constitution. Several lower court rulings suspending Trump’s illegal
      actions have been put on hold until the Supreme Court issues final decisions.
      Some final decisions may take months, a year, or longer to be decided. Unfortunately,
      it won’t be until early October when the Justices return from their long, leisurely
      vacation. In the meantime, Trump is renewing his wreckage, blatantly dictating,
      as Trump says, “This is only the beginning.” —————————————————— “YOU’RE FIRED!”
      – GROWING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE REJECTING TRUMP Of all the epithets seething
      from the foul mouth of King Donald I (his preferred title) – “deranged,” “wacko,”
      “lunatic,” “crazy,” “crooked,” “loser,” “criminal,” and “corrupt,” the most timely,
      functional one is his favorite: “YOU’RE FIRED.” Launched from his TV program,
      “The Apprentice,” while a failed businessman, Trump, using the poisonous tusks
      of Elon Musk, has conveyed that exit phrase to hundreds of thousands of innocent
      public servants, performing crucial tasks, and key government contractors since
      January 20, 2025. Given his wreckage of lives, livelihoods, health, safety and
      freedom of speech here and abroad in just 100 days, Trump invites daily the unifying
      command arising out of his declaration of war against the American people – in
      red states and blue states – “YOU’RE FIRED!” Trump, a corporation masquerading
      as a Human must be unmasked by the following bill of particulars: Because your
      first “presentation of self” on January 20 th was to declare that you are the
      law and that no constitution, statute or regulation was going to stop your issuance
      of scores of illegal Executive Order Dictates, “YOU’RE FIRED!” The Constitution
      does NOT provide for either a Monarch or a Dictator! Because on and after January
      20, 2025, you launched a major PURGE of lawfully acting civil servants, including
      17 Inspector Generals, mandated to root out criminal and fraudulent activities,
      and top officials in the Pentagon, Intelligence and Regulatory agencies without
      reason and notice, replacing them with sycophants, “YOU’RE FIRED!” Because you
      are daily CENSORING and IMPERILLING people, protected by our First Amendment,
      with police state kidnappings, illegal imprisonment in foreign and domestic jails,

    paragraph_summary: Since the publication of the article on May 2, 2025, Donald Trump
      has exacerbated the situation in the U.S. by dismantling the social safety net
      through a harsh legislative bill that benefits large corporations while undermining
      the rule of law. His influence extends to the Supreme Court, where his appointed
      justices have halted lower court rulings that challenge his illegal actions, leaving
      critical decisions pending for an extended period. As Trump continues to assert
      his power, he has been dismissing numerous public servants and contractors, creating
      widespread discontent among the American populace. The article critiques Trump's
      authoritarian approach and calls for accountability, emphasizing the urgent need
      to recognize and address the harm he is inflicting on the country.

    text: 'Donald Trump | Source: X By Ralph Nader / Nader.org Since the attached article
      was published on May 2, 2025, Trump has made matters worse by having his Congressional
      Republicans shred America’s historic social safety net in one big, savage, cruel,
      and vicious bill. He also gave more power, privileges, and tax escapes to giant
      corporations who fund him, enrich him, and empower him further. Trump’s gang of
      six on the Supreme Court has blocked federal judges trying to stop his violations
      of law and the Constitution. Several lower court rulings suspending Trump’s illegal
      actions have been put on hold until the Supreme Court issues final decisions.
      Some final decisions may take months, a year, or longer to be decided. Unfortunately,
      it won’t be until early October when the Justices return from their long, leisurely
      vacation. In the meantime, Trump is renewing his wreckage, blatantly dictating,
      as Trump says, “This is only the beginning.” —————————————————— “YOU’RE FIRED!”
      – GROWING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE REJECTING TRUMP Of all the epithets seething
      from the foul mouth of King Donald I (his preferred title) – “deranged,” “wacko,”
      “lunatic,” “crazy,” “crooked,” “loser,” “criminal,” and “corrupt,” the most timely,
      functional one is his favorite: “YOU’RE FIRED.” Launched from his TV program,
      “The Apprentice,” while a failed businessman, Trump, using the poisonous tusks
      of Elon Musk, has conveyed that exit phrase to hundreds of thousands of innocent
      public servants, performing crucial tasks, and key government contractors since
      January 20, 2025. Given his wreckage of lives, livelihoods, health, safety and
      freedom of speech here and abroad in just 100 days, Trump invites daily the unifying
      command arising out of his declaration of war against the American people – in
      red states and blue states – “YOU’RE FIRED!” Trump, a corporation masquerading
      as a Human must be unmasked by the following bill of particulars: Because your
      first “presentation of self” on January 20 th was to declare that you are the
      law and that no constitution, statute or regulation was going to stop your issuance
      of scores of illegal Executive Order Dictates, “YOU’RE FIRED!” The Constitution
      does NOT provide for either a Monarch or a Dictator! Because on and after January
      20, 2025, you launched a major PURGE of lawfully acting civil servants, including
      17 Inspector Generals, mandated to root out criminal and fraudulent activities,
      and top officials in the Pentagon, Intelligence and Regulatory agencies without
      reason and notice, replacing them with sycophants, “YOU’RE FIRED!” Because you
      are daily CENSORING and IMPERILLING people, protected by our First Amendment,
      with police state kidnappings, illegal imprisonment in foreign and domestic jails,
      threats, harassment, bigotry and outright criminal extortions for unlawful demands,
      “YOU’RE FIRED!” Because you have repeatedly violated Congressional mandates, including
      the power of the purse and health/safety standards, and because you have illegally
      seized basic congressional authority under the Constitution, having defied over

      The Trump administration is reportedly handing the personal information of all
      79 million Medicaid enrollees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), giving
      vast power to the rogue agency as it ravages communities across the U.S. The data
      includes names, addresses, ethnicity and race, birth dates, and Social Security
      numbers of Medicaid enrollees, per an agreement signed between Centers for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement
      was reported by the Associated Press . The deal stipulates that ICE will not be
      able to download the data, and will only be allowed to access it between 9 am
      to 5 pm, Monday through Friday, through September 9. However, the Trump administration
      has previously faced lawsuits from states over the sharing of Medicaid data with
      ICE, saying that the laws providing for the protection of such data are clear
      cut. The agreement says that the information sharing is meant to help ICE track
      down “the location of aliens” in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security
      assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that the agreement exists for the purpose
      of “exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid
      benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.” Crucially, undocumented immigrants
      are not allowed to enroll in Medicaid, and other immigrants in the U.S. have to
      meet certain qualifications in order to be eligible. Conservatives have long made
      claims of widespread fraud within Medicaid and other welfare programs, but there
      is no evidence to back them up . Further, there is no reason to give ICE access
      to the data to investigate fraud, as there are already Medicaid fraud investigators
      in every state and territory tasked with doing just that. But, using fraud and
      unauthorized immigration as excuses, Trump administration officials have worked
      relentlessly to expand the police state — replacing public services meant to help
      working class Americans with law enforcement officers who enjoy anonymity and
      impunity. Republicans have used lies about fraud and immigration to help push
      their marquee budget bill, which will force millions of Americans off of Medicaid
      coverage when the bill’s cuts take effect in 2027. In other words, some Medicaid
      recipients may be targeted by the Trump administration as a result of the data-sharing
      agreement and later kicked off of their life-saving benefits anyway. At the same
      time, fear over being racially profiled or surveilled by the data-sharing agreement
      may prevent people from enrolling in Medicaid to begin with. By targeting Medicaid,
      the Trump administration is targeting some of the poorest Americans in the U.S.
      Medicaid provides health care coverage for households making around or under the
      poverty level, as well as people unable to work like those with certain disabilities.

      Institute for Social Research Reason seems to have been gradually abolished by
      the language of bombs. As weapons systems get ‘smarter’ and ‘smarter’, the range
      of diplomatic instruments used by the Global North states becomes blunter and
      blunter. US and European diplomats have returned to the old colonial habit of
      speaking loudly and brusquely, lecturing the natives about what they should or
      should not do while they themselves do whatever they want. If the natives do not
      agree, then the old colonial rulers simply threaten to cut off their hands or
      bomb their homes. When the International Criminal Court tried to open a file to
      investigate US atrocities in Afghanistan, Washington reacted by revoking the prosecutors’
      visas and threatening to sanction their families. More recently, the United States
      government sanctioned UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese for her report
      on corporate complicity in the Israeli genocide against the Palestinian people.
      This gangster-like behaviour reflects the longstanding attitude of colonial rulers,
      indicating a return to a period when the West sent its gunboats to threaten our
      countries to trade as they wanted us to trade rather than to trade as equals.
      During the colonial period, that form of behaviour was called gunboat diplomacy.
      What we have now is an updated version: nuclear missile diplomacy . The 2025 North
      Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) summit at The Hague offers yet another example
      of this nuclear missile diplomacy. The final communiqué was the shortest produced
      at any NATO meeting, with only five points, two of which were about money. The
      Hague Declaration was only 425 words, whereas the Washington Declaration , issued
      at the 2024 summit, was 5,419 words (44 paragraphs). This time there was no granular
      detail about this or that threat, nor was there a long and detailed assessment
      of the war in Ukraine or how NATO supports that war without limit. While the 2024
      declaration asserted that ‘Ukraine’s future is in NATO’, this position was nowhere
      to be found in the 2025 statement. It was clear that the United States simply
      would not allow a laundry list of NATO’s obsessions. Instead, it was the US obsession
      that prevailed: that Europe increase its military spending to pay for the US protective
      shield around the continent. Under US pressure, NATO states formally agreed to
      increase their military spending to 5% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by
      2035. Since many NATO members have not even met the previous 2% target, this move
      will likely spark serious domestic debates across the alliance. By our calculations,
      as the FACTS graphic above shows, NATO states currently spend $2.7 trillion on
      war making. As they move to increase military spending to 5% of their GDP, that
      number will rise to $3.8 trillion – a good $1 trillion more than in previous years.
      What else could be done with $1 trillion? For one, global hunger could be eradicated
      in twenty to twenty-five years, hunger among children could be eradicated immediately,
      or the entire $11.4 trillion external debt of developing countries could be paid
      off in just over a decade. As it stands, the United Nations (UN) has warned that
      the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will not be met by their target year
      of 2030 and might in fact be delayed by decades, if not a century. One of the
      most alarming areas of backsliding is SDG 2: Zero Hunger. The UN Food and Agriculture
      Organisation (FAO) estimates that, absent major inflation shocks or geopolitical
      and geological disruptions, it would take an extra $40 to $50 billion per year
      to end global hunger. Instead, that money is being spent to blow up food systems
      rather than build them. In 2024, global military expenditure reached $3.7 trillion.
      That same year, the United Nations approved an annual budget of just $3.72 billion
      (which includes peacekeeping). The UN budget, therefore, is only 0.1% of the global
      arms budget. It is difficult to look at these figures and not feel the futility
      of advancing an agenda for peace between peoples and diplomacy between states.
      There is so much that needs to be solved and yet so little that is being done
      in this dispensation – however limited – to solve these problems. NATO states
      agreed to US President Donald Trump’s mandate to increase military spending to
      5% of their GDP without any dispute. Because of their various neoliberal debt
      brakes, they will have to cut social spending in order to pay for their increased
      arms production and purchases. Germany, which has the largest GDP in Europe, is
      nonetheless mired in deep social problems; for instance, 21.1% of the German population
      faces the risk of poverty or social exclusion. The German government, led by Chancellor
      Friedrich Merz, has pledged €650 billion over the next five years toward military
      spending in order to reach the 5% target by 2035 – an amount even the Financial
      Times finds to be ‘staggering’. To meet this pledge, Germany will need to raise
      about €144 billion per year, primarily through budget reallocations – i.e., austerity –
      and increased borrowing – i.e., debt (raising taxes is unlikely, even in the form
      of regressive value-added taxes on consumption). In other words, what Europe and
      the United States have adopted is the path of austerity and war. That is their
      promise to the world for the period ahead. Meanwhile, at the 17 th BRICS Summit
      in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), the BRICS+ countries – which now include Indonesia
      – opted for a different worldview. The BRICS+ statement called for programmes
      ‘for the benefit of our people through the promotion of peace, a more representative,
      fairer international order, a reinvigorated and reformed multilateral system,
      sustainable development, and inclusive growth’. The key words here are peace and
      development. That is the choice that has been laid out before us: austerity and
      war on the one hand, or development and peace on the other. Faced with this choice,
      we rage, we weep, we take to the streets and refuse to allow for any direction
      other than peace. This was how the Iraqi poet Badr Shakir al-Sayyab (1926–1964)
      felt in 1953 after he was expelled from Iraq for his participation in the failed
      1952 Iraqi Intifada against the monarchy. Later that year, in Tehran, he witnessed
      the CIA-backed coup that removed Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq from power and
      restored the Shah of Iran. In 1954, he wrote the long poem ‘Weapons and Children’
      (الأسلحة والأطفال). A passage from it is presented below: ‘Iron’ Who is all this
      iron for? For a chain twisting around a wrist A blade held to breast or vein A
      key to the prison door for those that are not slaves A noria that scoops blood.
      ‘Bullets’ Who are all these bullets for? For miserable Korean children Hungry
      workers in Marseille The people of Baghdad and the rest Whoever wants to be saved
      Iron Bullets Bullets Bullets Iron… I hear the merchant And the laughing children,
      And like the blade before the victim notices, Like lightning scattered in my mind
      Like a screen, like a wound gushing blood – I see craters rumbling – Filling the
      horizon – flames, and blood Pouring down like rain showers, filling the expanse
      Bullets and fire. The face of the sky Scowls whenever iron shakes it Iron and
      fire, fire and iron… Then the impact, then the bomb! Thunder everywhere, Lifeless
      body parts, and the rubble of a home. Old iron for a new battle Iron… to level
      this waterless desert, Where children drew in the sand And where older folks thought
      it was safe. ‘Peace’ As if the spark in the letters Is covered over by the darkness
      of caves, With the hopes of the first man. What picture did he inscribe on the
      stones, Spurred on by death: is it a victory, A longing for the best of worlds?
      That is the choice: iron or peace, bullets or development. There is no peace through
      guns, no development through bullets. This is a choice. You must participate in
      making this choice. Your silence leads to guns and bullets and war; your voice,
      if it is loud enough alongside the voices of others, might take us to peace and
      development, the laughter of children as they play without fear in the dusk. Editor’s

      Institute for Social Research Reason seems to have been gradually abolished by
      the language of bombs. As weapons systems get ‘smarter’ and ‘smarter’, the range
      of diplomatic instruments used by the Global North states becomes blunter and
      blunter. US and European diplomats have returned to the old colonial habit of
      speaking loudly and brusquely, lecturing the natives about what they should or
      should not do while they themselves do whatever they want. If the natives do not
      agree, then the old colonial rulers simply threaten to cut off their hands or
      bomb their homes. When the International Criminal Court tried to open a file to
      investigate US atrocities in Afghanistan, Washington reacted by revoking the prosecutors’
      visas and threatening to sanction their families. More recently, the United States
      government sanctioned UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese for her report
      on corporate complicity in the Israeli genocide against the Palestinian people.

      Donald Trump’s second term, education has remained a central battleground in American
      politics. Republicans claim that classrooms have become hotbeds of “woke” indoctrination,
      accusing educators of promoting progressive agendas and tolerating antisemitism
      . In contrast, Democrats argue that conservatives are systematically defunding
      and dismantling public and higher education precisely because it teaches values
      like diversity, equity, and inclusion . While these partisan skirmishes dominate
      headlines, they obscure a much deeper and more enduring issue that encompasses
      all of these issues and more: the influence of corporate and military power on
      public education. For decades, scholars have warned that corporations have steadily
      infiltrated the classroom—not to promote critical thinking or democratic values,
      but to cultivate ideologies that reinforce capitalism, nationalism, and militarism
      . Critical media literacy educators, in particular, have called attention to the
      convergence of tech firms and military entities in education, offering so-called
      “free” digital tools that double as Trojan horses for data collection and ideological
      control. One striking example is the rise of programs like NewsGuard , which uses
      public fears over fake news to justify increased surveillance of students’ online
      activity. Relatedly, in 2018, the Atlantic Council partnered with Meta to perform
      “fact-checking” on platforms such as Facebook.  In 2022, the US Marine Corps discussed
      developing media literacy trainings. It remains to be seen what training, if any,
      they will develop. However, what is known is that a large global player has entered
      the media literacy arena: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ). While
      NATO presents its initiatives as supportive of media literacy and democratic education,
      these efforts appear to be oriented more toward reinforcing alignment with its
      strategic and political priorities than to fostering critical civic engagement.
      NATO was created in 1949, during the Cold War, as a military alliance to contain
      communism. Although the war officially ended in 1991, NATO has expanded both its
      mission and membership. Today, it encompasses more than thirty member nations
      and continues to frame itself as a global force for peace, democracy, and security.
      But this self-image masks real conflicts of interest. NATO is deeply intertwined
      with powerful nation-states and corporate actors . It routinely partners with
      defense contractors, tech firms, think tanks , and Western governments—all of
      which have a vested interest in maintaining specific political and economic systems.
      These relationships raise concerns when NATO extends its reach into education.
      Can a military alliance—closely linked to the defense industry and state propaganda
      —credibly serve as a neutral force in media education? In 2022, NATO associates
      collaborated with the US-based Center for Media Literacy (CML) to launch a media
      literacy initiative framed as a strategic defense against misinformation. The
      initiative included a report titled Building Resiliency: Media Literacy as a Strategic
      Defense Strategy for the Transatlantic , authored by CML’s Tessa Jolls. It was
      accompanied by a series of webinars featuring military personnel, policy experts,
      and academics. On the surface, the initiative appeared to promote digital literacy
      and civic engagement. But a closer look reveals a clear ideological agenda. Funded
      and organized by NATO, the initiative positioned media literacy not as a means
      of empowering students to think critically about how power shapes media, but as
      a defense strategy to protect NATO member states from so-called “hostile actors.”
      The curriculum emphasized surveillance, resilience, and behavior modification
      over reflection, analysis, and democratic dialogue. Throughout their webinars,
      NATO representatives described the media environment as a battlefield, frequently
      using other war metaphors such as “hostile information activities” and “cognitive
      warfare.” Panelists argued that citizens in NATO countries were targets of foreign
      disinformation campaigns—and that media literacy could serve as a tool to inoculate
      them against ideological threats. A critical review of NATO’s media literacy initiative
      reveals several troubling themes. First, it frames media literacy as a protectionist
      project rather than an educational one. Students are portrayed less as thinkers
      to be empowered and more as civilians to be monitored, molded, and managed. In
      this model, education becomes a form of top-down, preemptive defense, relying
      on expert guidance and military oversight rather than democratic participation.
      Second, the initiative advances a distinctly neoliberal worldview. It emphasizes
      individual responsibility over structural analysis. In other words, misinformation
      is treated as a user error, rather than the result of flawed systems, corporate
      algorithms, or media consolidation. This framing conveniently absolves powerful
      actors, including NATO and Big Tech, of their role in producing or amplifying
      disinformation. Third, the initiative promotes a contradictory definition of empowerment.
      While the report and webinars often use the language of “citizen empowerment,”
      they ultimately advocate for surveillance, censorship, and ideological conformity.
      Panelists call for NATO to “dominate” the information space, and some even propose
      systems to monitor students’ attitudes and online behaviors. Rather than encouraging
      students to question power—including NATO itself—this approach rewards obedience
      and penalizes dissent. Finally, the initiative erases the influence of corporate
      power. Although it criticizes authoritarian regimes and “hostile actors,” it fails
      to examine the role that Western corporations, particularly tech companies, play
      in shaping media environments. This oversight is especially problematic given
      that many of these corporations are NATO’s partners. By ignoring the political
      economy of media, the initiative offers an incomplete and ideologically skewed
      version of media literacy. NATO’s foray into media literacy education represents
      a new frontier in militarized pedagogy. While claiming to promote democracy and
      resilience, its initiative advances a narrow, protectionist, and neoliberal approach
      that prioritizes NATO’s geopolitical goals over student empowerment. This should
      raise red flags for educators, policymakers, and advocates. Media literacy is
      not a neutral practice. The organizations that design and fund media literacy
      programs inevitably shape those programs’ goals and methods. When a military alliance
      like NATO promotes media education, it brings with it a strategic interest in
      ideological control. Educators must ask: What kind of media literacy are we teaching—and
      whose interests does it serve? If the goal is to produce informed, critically
      thinking citizens capable of questioning power in all its forms, then NATO’s approach
      falls short. Instead of inviting students to explore complex media systems, it
      simplifies them into a binary struggle between “us” and “them,” encouraging loyalty
      over literacy. True media literacy must begin with transparency about who and
      what is behind the curriculum. It must empower students to question all forms
      of influence—governmental, corporate, and military alike. And it must resist the
      creeping presence of militarism in our classrooms. As educators, we must defend
      the right to question, not just the messages we see, but the institutions that
      shape them. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      donation . By Nolan Higdon and Sydney Sullivan / Project Censored During President
      Donald Trump’s second term, education has remained a central battleground in American
      politics. Republicans claim that classrooms have become hotbeds of “woke” indoctrination,
      accusing educators of promoting progressive agendas and tolerating antisemitism
      . In contrast, Democrats argue that conservatives are systematically defunding
      and dismantling public and higher education precisely because it teaches values
      like diversity, equity, and inclusion . While these partisan skirmishes dominate
      headlines, they obscure a much deeper and more enduring issue that encompasses
      all of these issues and more: the influence of corporate and military power on
      public education. For decades, scholars have warned that corporations have steadily
      infiltrated the classroom—not to promote critical thinking or democratic values,
      but to cultivate ideologies that reinforce capitalism, nationalism, and militarism
      . Critical media literacy educators, in particular, have called attention to the
      convergence of tech firms and military entities in education, offering so-called
      “free” digital tools that double as Trojan horses for data collection and ideological
      control. One striking example is the rise of programs like NewsGuard , which uses
      public fears over fake news to justify increased surveillance of students’ online
      activity. Relatedly, in 2018, the Atlantic Council partnered with Meta to perform
      “fact-checking” on platforms such as Facebook.  In 2022, the US Marine Corps discussed
      developing media literacy trainings. It remains to be seen what training, if any,
      they will develop. However, what is known is that a large global player has entered
      the media literacy arena: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ). While
      NATO presents its initiatives as supportive of media literacy and democratic education,
      these efforts appear to be oriented more toward reinforcing alignment with its
      strategic and political priorities than to fostering critical civic engagement.
      NATO was created in 1949, during the Cold War, as a military alliance to contain
      communism. Although the war officially ended in 1991, NATO has expanded both its
      mission and membership. Today, it encompasses more than thirty member nations
      and continues to frame itself as a global force for peace, democracy, and security.
      But this self-image masks real conflicts of interest. NATO is deeply intertwined
      with powerful nation-states and corporate actors . It routinely partners with
      defense contractors, tech firms, think tanks , and Western governments—all of
      which have a vested interest in maintaining specific political and economic systems.
      These relationships raise concerns when NATO extends its reach into education.
      Can a military alliance—closely linked to the defense industry and state propaganda
      —credibly serve as a neutral force in media education? In 2022, NATO associates
      collaborated with the US-based Center for Media Literacy (CML) to launch a media
      literacy initiative framed as a strategic defense against misinformation. The
      initiative included a report titled Building Resiliency: Media Literacy as a Strategic
      Defense Strategy for the Transatlantic , authored by CML’s Tessa Jolls. It was
      accompanied by a series of webinars featuring military personnel, policy experts,
      and academics. On the surface, the initiative appeared to promote digital literacy
      and civic engagement. But a closer look reveals a clear ideological agenda. Funded
      and organized by NATO, the initiative positioned media literacy not as a means
      of empowering students to think critically about how power shapes media, but as
      a defense strategy to protect NATO member states from so-called “hostile actors.”
      The curriculum emphasized surveillance, resilience, and behavior modification
      over reflection, analysis, and democratic dialogue. Throughout their webinars,
      NATO representatives described the media environment as a battlefield, frequently
      using other war metaphors such as “hostile information activities” and “cognitive
      warfare.” Panelists argued that citizens in NATO countries were targets of foreign
      disinformation campaigns—and that media literacy could serve as a tool to inoculate
      them against ideological threats. A critical review of NATO’s media literacy initiative
      reveals several troubling themes. First, it frames media literacy as a protectionist
      project rather than an educational one. Students are portrayed less as thinkers
      to be empowered and more as civilians to be monitored, molded, and managed. In
      this model, education becomes a form of top-down, preemptive defense, relying
      on expert guidance and military oversight rather than democratic participation.
      Second, the initiative advances a distinctly neoliberal worldview. It emphasizes
      individual responsibility over structural analysis. In other words, misinformation
      is treated as a user error, rather than the result of flawed systems, corporate
      algorithms, or media consolidation. This framing conveniently absolves powerful
      actors, including NATO and Big Tech, of their role in producing or amplifying
      disinformation. Third, the initiative promotes a contradictory definition of empowerment.
      While the report and webinars often use the language of “citizen empowerment,”
      they ultimately advocate for surveillance, censorship, and ideological conformity.
      Panelists call for NATO to “dominate” the information space, and some even propose
      systems to monitor students’ attitudes and online behaviors. Rather than encouraging
      students to question power—including NATO itself—this approach rewards obedience
      and penalizes dissent. Finally, the initiative erases the influence of corporate
      power. Although it criticizes authoritarian regimes and “hostile actors,” it fails
      to examine the role that Western corporations, particularly tech companies, play
      in shaping media environments. This oversight is especially problematic given
      that many of these corporations are NATO’s partners. By ignoring the political
      economy of media, the initiative offers an incomplete and ideologically skewed
      version of media literacy. NATO’s foray into media literacy education represents
      a new frontier in militarized pedagogy. While claiming to promote democracy and
      resilience, its initiative advances a narrow, protectionist, and neoliberal approach
      that prioritizes NATO’s geopolitical goals over student empowerment. This should
      raise red flags for educators, policymakers, and advocates. Media literacy is
      not a neutral practice. The organizations that design and fund media literacy
      programs inevitably shape those programs’ goals and methods. When a military alliance
      like NATO promotes media education, it brings with it a strategic interest in
      ideological control. Educators must ask: What kind of media literacy are we teaching—and
      whose interests does it serve? If the goal is to produce informed, critically
      thinking citizens capable of questioning power in all its forms, then NATO’s approach
      falls short. Instead of inviting students to explore complex media systems, it

      weeks for touting its commitment to privacy and human rights, rolling out tools
      to limit surveillance and spyware. But behind the corporate messaging lies a much
      darker reality. The company has quietly brought in dozens of veterans from Unit
      8200, Israel’s shadowy military intelligence unit known for blackmail, mass surveillance,
      and targeted killings. Many of these hires took place as Israel escalated its
      war on Gaza, and as CEO Tim Cook publicly expressed support for Israel while disciplining
      employees for pro-Palestinian expressions. Apple’s deepening ties to Israel’s
      most controversial intelligence raise uncomfortable questions, not only about
      the company’s political loyalties, but also about how it handles vast troves of
      personal user data. A MintPress News investigation has identified dozens of Unit
      8200 operatives now working at Apple. The company’s hiring spree coincides with
      growing scrutiny of its ties to the Israeli government, including its policy of
      matching employee donations to groups such as Friends of the IDF and the Jewish
      National Fund, both of which play a role in the displacement of the Palestinian
      people. The intense pro-Israel bias at the corporation has led many former and
      current employees to speak out. This investigation is part of a series examining
      the close collaboration between Unit 8200 and Western tech and media companies.
      Previous investigations examined the links between Unit 8200 and social media
      giants like TikTok , Facebook and Google , and how former Unit 8200 spies are
      now responsible for writing much of America’s news about Israel/Palestine, holding
      top jobs at outlets like CNN and Axios. A Few (Dozen) Bad Apples Israel’s international
      reputation has taken a severe hit amid multiple spying scandals and ongoing attacks
      against its neighbors. During this same period, Apple has ramped up its recruitment
      of former Israeli intelligence personnel. The Silicon Valley giant has hired dozens
      of former agents from the controversial Israeli intelligence outfit, Unit 8200,
      raising questions about the corporation’s political direction. Nir Shkedi is among
      the most prominent examples. From 2008 to 2015, he served as a commander and Chief
      of Learning at Unit 8200, leading a team of approximately 120 operatives who developed
      new artificial intelligence tools to perform rapid data analysis. Unit 8200 is
      at the forefront of this technology, and is known to have used AI to auto-generate
      kill lists of tens of thousands of Gazans, including children. These tools helped
      the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) bypass what it called human targeting, “bottlenecks,”
      and strike huge numbers of Palestinians. Shkedi has been a physical design engineer
      at Apple’s Bay Area campus since 2022. Noa Goor is another senior Unit 8200 figure
      turned Apple employee. From 2015 to 2020, Goor rose to become a project manager
      and head of cybersecurity and big data development team at Unit 8200, where she,
      in her own words, “invent[ed] creative technological solutions for high priority
      intelligence goals” and “manag[ed] two strategically important cyber projects”
      for the IDF. One of the most important cyber projects Unit 8200 has launched in
      recent times is the September pager attack on Lebanon, an act that injured thousands
      of civilians and was widely condemned as an act of international terrorism, including
      by former CIA Director Leon Panetta . While Goor was not personally involved in
      that operation, Unit 8200 has spearheaded similarly nefarious actions for decades.
      In 2022, Goor was hired by Apple as a system-on-chip design engineer. Eli Yazovitsky
      , meanwhile, was directly recruited from Unit 8200. In 2015, he left a high-powered
      nine-year career as a manager in the military unit to join Apple, where he rose
      to become an engineering manager. He has since moved on to tech giant Qualcomm.
      Unit 8200 is Israel’s most elite—and most controversial—military intelligence
      unit. It serves as the backbone of both Israel’s burgeoning tech sector and its
      repressive surveillance apparatus. The unit has developed cutting-edge technology
      like facial recognition and voice-to-text software to surveil, repress, and target
      Palestinians. The vast amounts of data gathered on the Palestinian population,
      including their medical history, sex lives, and search histories, have been used
      for coercion and extortion. If a certain individual needed to travel across checkpoints
      for crucial medical treatment, permission could be suspended until they complied.
      Information about extramarital affairs or sexual orientation, especially homosexuality,
      is exploited as blackmail material. One former Unit 8200 agent recalled that he
      was instructed during his training to memorize different Arabic words for “gay”
      so that he could listen out for them in intercepted conversations. Internationally,
      Unit 8200 may be best known for its “former” agents who created the notorious
      Pegasus software, used by repressive governments around the world to spy on tens
      of thousands of prominent figures, including royals, heads of state, activists,
      and journalists. Among them was Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who
      was assassinated by Saudi operatives in Türkiye in 2018. While military service
      is mandatory for Jewish Israelis, few end up in Unit 8200 by accident. Described
      as “Israel’s Harvard,” parents spend fortunes on STEM-based extracurricular lessons
      for their children in the hopes that they will be selected to join the IDF’s most
      elite and selective unit. Those chosen are rewarded with lucrative careers in
      the tech industry upon completion of their service. Given Unit 8200’s documented
      history of violence, espionage, and surveillance, both domestically and internationally,
      it is worth asking whether tech giants should be hiring its alumni in such large
      numbers. Shkedi, Goor, and Yazovitsky are the most high-profile examples, but
      they are from alone. A closer look reveals that dozens of other Unit 8200 veterans
      have also secured key roles at Apple. Engineering and Hardware Design: Natanel
      Nissan , formerly head of data analysis at Unit 8200, joined Apple’s Tel Aviv
      office in 2022. Ofek Har-Even , a longtime officer and manager in the unit, has
      been a design verification engineer at Apple since 2022. Gal Sharon , a former
      intelligence systems operator and data analyst, has also worked as a physical
      design engineer since that same year. Mayan Hochler and Shai Buzgalo , both former
      Unit 8200 analysts and instructors, hold roles in physical design and validation
      engineering, respectively. Software and Cybersecurity: Ofer Tlusty , who served
      nearly six years in Unit 8200 as a security and intelligence analyst, has worked
      as a software engineer at Apple since 2021. Ofek Rafaeli , who served between
      2012 and 2016 and rose to project manager during Israel’s 2016 assault on Gaza,
      became a software engineer at Apple in 2023. Guy Levy, a former intelligence analyst,
      now also works as a software engineer. AI, Machine Learning, and Validation: Avital
      Kleiman , a six-year veteran of Unit 8200, is now a machine learning algorithm
      engineer at Apple. Niv Lev Ari , currently a validation engineer, notes in his
      LinkedIn profile that he received a letter of commendation from Unit 8200 commander
      Aviv Kochavi for his work in the unit. Other Technical Roles: Shahar Moshe , who
      worked as an intelligence specialist at Unit 8200 from 2012 to 2015, is now a
      design verification engineer. Gil Avniel , who spent over five years in the unit,
      currently serves as a network engineer. An Apple Rots From the Core The growing
      number of former Israeli intelligence operatives working at Apple does not seem
      to concern the company’s senior management. CEO Tim Cook is known to hold strongly
      pro-Israel views and has spearheaded the Silicon Valley giant’s collaboration
      with the Israeli state. Apple has acquired several Israeli tech firms and now
      operates three centers in the country, employing around 2,000 people. In 2014,
      Cook invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the company headquarters
      in Cupertino, CA, where, in front of the cameras, the two openly embraced. The
      following year, Cook accepted an invitation from President Reuven Rivlin to visit 
      Israel. “It is a great privilege to host you and your team here,” Rivlin said
      , “Even for me, as one who prefers to write with a pen and paper, it is clear
      what a great miracle you have created when I look at my staff, and my grandchildren.”
      Effusive praise for the Apple CEO has also come in the form of honors from pro-Israel
      organizations. In 2018, the Anti-Defamation League presented Cook with its inaugural
      Courage Against Hate Award at its Never Is Now Summit on anti-Semitism and Hate,
      where the organization described him as a “visionary leader in the business community.”
      In the wake of the October 7, 2023, attacks, Cook sent out a company-wide email
      expressing his solidarity with Israel. “Like so many of you, I am devastated by
      the horrific attacks in Israel and the tragic reports coming out of the region,”
      he wrote , My heart goes out to the victims, those who have lost loved ones, and
      all of the innocent people who are suffering as a result of this violence.” Yet,
      according to Apples4Ceasefire—a group of former and current employees opposing
      Israeli actions in Gaza—he has yet to say anything publicly about the mass devastation
      caused by the Israeli response to October 7. Indeed, the Silicon Valley corporation
      has a policy of matching employee donations to groups such as Friends of the IDF,
      which raises money to buy equipment for IDF soldiers, and the Jewish National
      Fund, an organization that participates in the theft and destruction of Palestinian
      land. Under Cook’s leadership, Apple employees have been disciplined or even fired
      for wearing pins, bracelets, or keffiyehs in support of the Palestinian people.
      Nevertheless, groups such as Apples4Ceasefire continue to speak out about what
      they describe as Apple’s complicity in genocide. The Unit 8200 Tech Takeover To
      be fair, Apple is far from the only tech or media company to hire large numbers
      of former Unit 8200 operatives. A 2022 MintPress exposé revealed hundreds of Israeli
      intelligence veterans working at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. Perhaps
      the most notable of these is Emi Palmor, a former Israeli justice ministry official
      who sits on Facebook’s 21-person Oversight Board . Described by Mark Zuckerberg
      as his platform’s “supreme court,” the board ultimately decides what content is
      allowed or removed from the world’s largest social network. Facebook has worked
      closely with the Israeli government to censor or deplatform Palestinian content
      and accounts. Even TikTok, often seen as a more open platform, has been hiring
      former Israeli spies to help manage its operations, according to a November investigation
      by MintPress. Reut Medalion, for example, served as a Unit 8200 intelligence commander
      and led its cybersecurity operations team. In December 2023, during the peak of
      Israel’s attack on Gaza, Medalion moved to New York City to accept a job as global
      incident manager for TikTok’s trust and safety division. Considering the events
      going on in the world at the time, it’s worth asking what sorts of “global incidents”
      she was brought in to manage. After MintPress exposed Medalion’s past to a worldwide
      audience, she deleted her entire digital footprint from the internet. Former Israeli
      intelligence operatives have also found their way into American newsrooms, shaping
      coverage of the Middle East. A recent MintPress investigation uncovered a network
      of former Unit 8200 operatives working in some of the most influential newsrooms
      in the United States. Among them is Axios correspondent Barak Ravid, whose Middle
      Eastern coverage won him the prestigious White House Press Correspondents’ Award.
      Until at least 2023, Ravid was a member of Unit 8200. CNN has also hired at least
      two former agents to produce their news coverage, one of whom, Tal Heinrich, now
      serves as the official spokesperson for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Given this pattern,
      Silicon Valley’s partiality towards Israel should not come as no surprise. From
      tech giants like Google and Amazon to social media powerhouses like TikTok and
      Facebook, the field is filled with former Israeli spies. Apple is no exception,
      having hired dozens, if not more, Unit 8200 operatives to run its platforms and
      shape the company. This investigation does not claim that the Israeli state is
      deliberately infiltrating Silicon Valley. However, what it does unquestionably
      suggest is that the outlook and general biases of these entities are strongly
      pro-Israel. What does it say about Silicon Valley’s culture that individuals with
      well-documented ties to a controversial foreign spy agency are considered ideal
      hires? It is unthinkable that former intelligence agents of Hezbollah, Iran’s
      Ministry of Intelligence, or Russia’s FSB or GRU would be hired en masse, and
      trusted with our most sensitive data. Yet, when it comes to Israel (or U.S. surveillance
      agencies ), the answer is different. Many of these employees are not even “former”
      agents, and are directly recruited from Unit 8200 while still in active service,
      despite Israeli law explicitly prohibiting the group’s members from identifying
      themselves or divulging their alliances. Thus, in this light, it appears that
      those like Apples4Ceasefire struggling to end the company’s double standards are
      fighting an uphill battle. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted

    one_sentence_summary: Apple's recent hiring of veterans from Israel's military intelligence
      unit, Unit 8200, amid its public commitment to privacy and human rights, raises
      serious concerns about the company's true stance on surveillance and its political
      affiliations, particularly during the escalation of the conflict in Gaza.
    paragraph_summary: The article from MintPress News, written by Alan MacLeod, highlights
      the troubling reality behind Apple's public commitment to privacy and human rights.
      Despite its corporate messaging, Apple has been hiring numerous veterans from
      Israel's Unit 8200, a military intelligence unit known for its controversial practices,
      including mass surveillance and targeted killings. This hiring trend coincided
      with Israel's intensified military actions in Gaza and CEO Tim Cook's public support
      for Israel, while the company has been criticized for suppressing pro-Palestinian
      sentiments among employees. The investigation raises significant concerns about
      Apple's political affiliations and the handling of user data, especially given
      its financial support for organizations linked to the displacement of Palestinians.
      The article is part of a broader examination of the connections between Unit 8200
      and various Western tech and media companies, revealing a pattern of influence
      that extends to major news outlets.

      we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it
      but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News Apple has made headlines in recent
      weeks for touting its commitment to privacy and human rights, rolling out tools
      to limit surveillance and spyware. But behind the corporate messaging lies a much
      darker reality. The company has quietly brought in dozens of veterans from Unit
      8200, Israel’s shadowy military intelligence unit known for blackmail, mass surveillance,
      and targeted killings. Many of these hires took place as Israel escalated its
      war on Gaza, and as CEO Tim Cook publicly expressed support for Israel while disciplining
      employees for pro-Palestinian expressions. Apple’s deepening ties to Israel’s
      most controversial intelligence raise uncomfortable questions, not only about
      the company’s political loyalties, but also about how it handles vast troves of
      personal user data. A MintPress News investigation has identified dozens of Unit
      8200 operatives now working at Apple. The company’s hiring spree coincides with
      growing scrutiny of its ties to the Israeli government, including its policy of
      matching employee donations to groups such as Friends of the IDF and the Jewish
      National Fund, both of which play a role in the displacement of the Palestinian
      people. The intense pro-Israel bias at the corporation has led many former and
      current employees to speak out. This investigation is part of a series examining
      the close collaboration between Unit 8200 and Western tech and media companies.
      Previous investigations examined the links between Unit 8200 and social media
      giants like TikTok , Facebook and Google , and how former Unit 8200 spies are
      now responsible for writing much of America’s news about Israel/Palestine, holding
      top jobs at outlets like CNN and Axios. A Few (Dozen) Bad Apples Israel’s international
      reputation has taken a severe hit amid multiple spying scandals and ongoing attacks
      against its neighbors. During this same period, Apple has ramped up its recruitment
      of former Israeli intelligence personnel. The Silicon Valley giant has hired dozens
      of former agents from the controversial Israeli intelligence outfit, Unit 8200,
      raising questions about the corporation’s political direction. Nir Shkedi is among
      the most prominent examples. From 2008 to 2015, he served as a commander and Chief
      of Learning at Unit 8200, leading a team of approximately 120 operatives who developed
      new artificial intelligence tools to perform rapid data analysis. Unit 8200 is
      at the forefront of this technology, and is known to have used AI to auto-generate
      kill lists of tens of thousands of Gazans, including children. These tools helped
      the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) bypass what it called human targeting, “bottlenecks,”
      and strike huge numbers of Palestinians. Shkedi has been a physical design engineer
      at Apple’s Bay Area campus since 2022. Noa Goor is another senior Unit 8200 figure
      turned Apple employee. From 2015 to 2020, Goor rose to become a project manager
      and head of cybersecurity and big data development team at Unit 8200, where she,
      in her own words, “invent[ed] creative technological solutions for high priority
      intelligence goals” and “manag[ed] two strategically important cyber projects”
      for the IDF. One of the most important cyber projects Unit 8200 has launched in
      recent times is the September pager attack on Lebanon, an act that injured thousands
      of civilians and was widely condemned as an act of international terrorism, including
      by former CIA Director Leon Panetta . While Goor was not personally involved in
      that operation, Unit 8200 has spearheaded similarly nefarious actions for decades.
      In 2022, Goor was hired by Apple as a system-on-chip design engineer. Eli Yazovitsky
      , meanwhile, was directly recruited from Unit 8200. In 2015, he left a high-powered
      nine-year career as a manager in the military unit to join Apple, where he rose
      to become an engineering manager. He has since moved on to tech giant Qualcomm.
      Unit 8200 is Israel’s most elite—and most controversial—military intelligence
      unit. It serves as the backbone of both Israel’s burgeoning tech sector and its
      repressive surveillance apparatus. The unit has developed cutting-edge technology
      like facial recognition and voice-to-text software to surveil, repress, and target
      Palestinians. The vast amounts of data gathered on the Palestinian population,
      including their medical history, sex lives, and search histories, have been used
      for coercion and extortion. If a certain individual needed to travel across checkpoints
      for crucial medical treatment, permission could be suspended until they complied.
      Information about extramarital affairs or sexual orientation, especially homosexuality,
      is exploited as blackmail material. One former Unit 8200 agent recalled that he
      was instructed during his training to memorize different Arabic words for “gay”
      so that he could listen out for them in intercepted conversations. Internationally,
      Unit 8200 may be best known for its “former” agents who created the notorious
      Pegasus software, used by repressive governments around the world to spy on tens
      of thousands of prominent figures, including royals, heads of state, activists,
      and journalists. Among them was Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who
      was assassinated by Saudi operatives in Türkiye in 2018. While military service
      is mandatory for Jewish Israelis, few end up in Unit 8200 by accident. Described
      as “Israel’s Harvard,” parents spend fortunes on STEM-based extracurricular lessons
      for their children in the hopes that they will be selected to join the IDF’s most
      elite and selective unit. Those chosen are rewarded with lucrative careers in
      the tech industry upon completion of their service. Given Unit 8200’s documented
      history of violence, espionage, and surveillance, both domestically and internationally,
      it is worth asking whether tech giants should be hiring its alumni in such large
      numbers. Shkedi, Goor, and Yazovitsky are the most high-profile examples, but
      they are from alone. A closer look reveals that dozens of other Unit 8200 veterans
      have also secured key roles at Apple. Engineering and Hardware Design: Natanel
      Nissan , formerly head of data analysis at Unit 8200, joined Apple’s Tel Aviv
      office in 2022. Ofek Har-Even , a longtime officer and manager in the unit, has
      been a design verification engineer at Apple since 2022. Gal Sharon , a former
      intelligence systems operator and data analyst, has also worked as a physical
      design engineer since that same year. Mayan Hochler and Shai Buzgalo , both former
      Unit 8200 analysts and instructors, hold roles in physical design and validation
      engineering, respectively. Software and Cybersecurity: Ofer Tlusty , who served
      nearly six years in Unit 8200 as a security and intelligence analyst, has worked
      as a software engineer at Apple since 2021. Ofek Rafaeli , who served between
      2012 and 2016 and rose to project manager during Israel’s 2016 assault on Gaza,
      became a software engineer at Apple in 2023. Guy Levy, a former intelligence analyst,
      now also works as a software engineer. AI, Machine Learning, and Validation: Avital
      Kleiman , a six-year veteran of Unit 8200, is now a machine learning algorithm
      engineer at Apple. Niv Lev Ari , currently a validation engineer, notes in his
      LinkedIn profile that he received a letter of commendation from Unit 8200 commander
      Aviv Kochavi for his work in the unit. Other Technical Roles: Shahar Moshe , who
      worked as an intelligence specialist at Unit 8200 from 2012 to 2015, is now a
      design verification engineer. Gil Avniel , who spent over five years in the unit,
      currently serves as a network engineer. An Apple Rots From the Core The growing
      number of former Israeli intelligence operatives working at Apple does not seem
      to concern the company’s senior management. CEO Tim Cook is known to hold strongly
      pro-Israel views and has spearheaded the Silicon Valley giant’s collaboration
      with the Israeli state. Apple has acquired several Israeli tech firms and now
      operates three centers in the country, employing around 2,000 people. In 2014,
      Cook invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the company headquarters
      in Cupertino, CA, where, in front of the cameras, the two openly embraced. The
      following year, Cook accepted an invitation from President Reuven Rivlin to visit 
      Israel. “It is a great privilege to host you and your team here,” Rivlin said
      , “Even for me, as one who prefers to write with a pen and paper, it is clear
      what a great miracle you have created when I look at my staff, and my grandchildren.”
      Effusive praise for the Apple CEO has also come in the form of honors from pro-Israel
      organizations. In 2018, the Anti-Defamation League presented Cook with its inaugural
      Courage Against Hate Award at its Never Is Now Summit on anti-Semitism and Hate,
      where the organization described him as a “visionary leader in the business community.”
      In the wake of the October 7, 2023, attacks, Cook sent out a company-wide email
      expressing his solidarity with Israel. “Like so many of you, I am devastated by
      the horrific attacks in Israel and the tragic reports coming out of the region,”
      he wrote , My heart goes out to the victims, those who have lost loved ones, and
      all of the innocent people who are suffering as a result of this violence.” Yet,
      according to Apples4Ceasefire—a group of former and current employees opposing
      Israeli actions in Gaza—he has yet to say anything publicly about the mass devastation
      caused by the Israeli response to October 7. Indeed, the Silicon Valley corporation
      has a policy of matching employee donations to groups such as Friends of the IDF,
      which raises money to buy equipment for IDF soldiers, and the Jewish National
      Fund, an organization that participates in the theft and destruction of Palestinian
      land. Under Cook’s leadership, Apple employees have been disciplined or even fired
      for wearing pins, bracelets, or keffiyehs in support of the Palestinian people.
      Nevertheless, groups such as Apples4Ceasefire continue to speak out about what
      they describe as Apple’s complicity in genocide. The Unit 8200 Tech Takeover To
      be fair, Apple is far from the only tech or media company to hire large numbers
      of former Unit 8200 operatives. A 2022 MintPress exposé revealed hundreds of Israeli
      intelligence veterans working at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. Perhaps
      the most notable of these is Emi Palmor, a former Israeli justice ministry official
      who sits on Facebook’s 21-person Oversight Board . Described by Mark Zuckerberg
      as his platform’s “supreme court,” the board ultimately decides what content is
      allowed or removed from the world’s largest social network. Facebook has worked
      closely with the Israeli government to censor or deplatform Palestinian content
      and accounts. Even TikTok, often seen as a more open platform, has been hiring
      former Israeli spies to help manage its operations, according to a November investigation
      by MintPress. Reut Medalion, for example, served as a Unit 8200 intelligence commander
      and led its cybersecurity operations team. In December 2023, during the peak of
      Israel’s attack on Gaza, Medalion moved to New York City to accept a job as global
      incident manager for TikTok’s trust and safety division. Considering the events
      going on in the world at the time, it’s worth asking what sorts of “global incidents”
      she was brought in to manage. After MintPress exposed Medalion’s past to a worldwide
      audience, she deleted her entire digital footprint from the internet. Former Israeli
      intelligence operatives have also found their way into American newsrooms, shaping
      coverage of the Middle East. A recent MintPress investigation uncovered a network
      of former Unit 8200 operatives working in some of the most influential newsrooms
      in the United States. Among them is Axios correspondent Barak Ravid, whose Middle
      Eastern coverage won him the prestigious White House Press Correspondents’ Award.
      Until at least 2023, Ravid was a member of Unit 8200. CNN has also hired at least
      two former agents to produce their news coverage, one of whom, Tal Heinrich, now
      serves as the official spokesperson for Prime Minister Netanyahu. Given this pattern,
      Silicon Valley’s partiality towards Israel should not come as no surprise. From
      tech giants like Google and Amazon to social media powerhouses like TikTok and
      Facebook, the field is filled with former Israeli spies. Apple is no exception,
      having hired dozens, if not more, Unit 8200 operatives to run its platforms and
      shape the company. This investigation does not claim that the Israeli state is

    text: 'President Donald Trump signs the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on the South
      Lawn of the White House, Friday, July 4, 2025, during the 4th of July picnic.
      (Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok) In one of the scariest moments in

      a tax-deductible donation . By Conor Smyth / Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting
      (FAIR) President Donald Trump has just signed into law what will go down as perhaps
      the most significant legislative achievement of his second term in office. Dubbed
      the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , the legislation is set to extend most of the
      tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term, while making deep cuts to social programs
      and gutting Biden-era climate provisions, among other sweeping changes ( FAIR.org
      , 7/9/25 ). The bill will have a remarkably regressive distributional impact.
      While top incomes will balloon by thousands of dollars, lower-income Americans
      will actually see their incomes decline. One analysis from before the bill’s final
      passage found that its major provisions would reduce incomes for the bottom 20%
      by about 2%. Tax cuts, after all, are only one part of the bill. More relevant
      to lower-income Americans is that this bill will deliver the largest cuts to Medicaid
      and food stamps in US history. Such a historic weakening of the safety net—the
      programs that support the finances of lower-income Americans—should warrant not
      only major attention, but significant scrutiny from national media outlets. And
      yet, at the New York Times , the approach has been to distract and obscure above
      all else. ‘Defined by staggering debt’ One manifestation of this approach has
      been the Times ’ insistence on elevating the bill’s effect on the debt as a foremost
      concern. In the week or so leading up to the bill’s passage, in fact, both an
      editorial ( 6/27/25 ) and an episode of the Times ’ flagship podcast the Daily
      ( 7/2/25 ) were dedicated entirely to a discussion of the national debt. The Daily
      episode went as far as claiming, “The legislation is defined by the staggering
      amount of debt that it’s creating.” It then warned of the potential for a debt
      “doom loop,” whereby rising debt raises borrowing costs and forces the government
      to issue more debt in order to pay for its existing debt load. Meanwhile, the
      Times editorial board opted to focus more heavily on the costs already being imposed
      by high federal debt. In a piece titled “The National Debt Is Already Causing
      Bigger Problems Than People Realize,” the board highlighted the “staggering amount
      of money” the government puts towards interest payments each year. The board’s
      solution: The government needs to raise taxes, especially on the wealthy, and
      it needs to make long-term changes in Social Security and Medicare, the major
      drivers of spending growth. In other words, at a time when the Republican Party
      is gutting the safety net in epic fashion, the New York Times is coyly hinting
      that Social Security and Medicare will need to be cut. ‘Enough to repair every
      bridge’ Across both the editorial and the podcast episode, the primary reason
      put forward by the Times for concern over the national debt was the borrowing
      costs associated with it. But is the bill’s effect on borrowing costs—the amount
      of money the federal government will have to spend to pay off the interest on
      its debts—genuinely that significant of a concern? The Times editorial board seems
      to think so. Warning of the ill effects of increasing borrowing costs, the board
      observed: The House version of Mr. Trump’s bill, already approved by that chamber,
      would increase interest payments on the debt by an average of $55 billion a year
      over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The increase
      alone is enough money to fully repair every bridge in the United States. This
      comparison is useful to a degree. It exposes the priorities of the Trump administration,
      which seems to value tax cuts for the wealthy above delivering basic public goods.
      But the comparison ultimately obscures more than it illuminates. The reality is
      that $55 billion is a relatively small sum for the US government. It represents
      only about 0.8% of the 2024 federal budget, and 0.2% of US GDP. High cost of high
      interest rates The total amount the federal government pays in interest—the amount
      it pays in excess of what it borrowed when it pays back loans—is of course much
      larger: The Times relays that interest payments are on pace to surpass $1 trillion
      this year, representing around 15% of last year’s federal budget. As the editorial
      board notes, this level of spending on interest payments crowds out other, more
      useful spending by the government. In other words, it does impose a not-insignificant
      cost. What the board de-emphasizes or ignores, however, is that high interest
      payments are really just a symptom of other more fundamental policy choices. On
      the one hand, they reflect the political decision to rely on the blunt instrument
      of interest rates to combat the pandemic-era spike in inflation. The result has
      been a rise in interest rates on ten-year government bonds, from under 1% in 2020
      to above 4% today. This was not an inevitable development. Other methods exist
      for combating inflation. But these methods were sidelined in favor of a regressive,
      debt-inflating approach. Would you know this by reading the Times editorial? Absolutely
      not. The incredibly low tax rate On the other hand, high interest payments also
      reflect the political decision to run up the US debt load through tax cuts for
      the wealthy. This history of tax cuts is discussed by the editorial board, but
      it is framed as more of a secondary issue. Little would readers know that the
      crowding-out effect imposed by high interest payments, which the Times depicts
      climbing above the cost of Social Security in coming years, is dwarfed by the
      crowding-out effect of low tax revenue. For such a rich country, the US collects
      incredibly little in taxes. Its tax revenue registers a meager 29% of GDP, compared
      to 42% in Canada, 52% in France and 62% in Norway. Meanwhile, interest payments
      as a percentage of GDP are set to double over the next 30 years, reaching about
      6% of GDP in the 2050s. That’s not even half the revenue deficit the US faces
      versus Canada—and Canada’s a low-tax country compared to France and Norway! The
      Times nonetheless has run no editorial in recent months decrying the US for being
      such a low-tax country. Even in its editorial about interest payments, a breakdown
      of the pitiful state of US tax collection by international standards is nowhere
      to be found. Instead, we get a muddled denunciation of the bill’s irresponsible
      contribution to burdensome borrowing costs. But, again, the bill’s contribution
      is tiny. Yes, interest payments are projected to reach 6% of GDP by the 2050s,
      but they will hit 5% even in the absence of this bill. With this single percentage
      of GDP boost in borrowing costs, the bill imposes a cost in 30 years that is a
      fraction of the cost of our tax deficit versus Canada today. ‘People benefit from
      working’ This is not to say that the Big Beautiful Bill will not impose Major
      Gratuitous Pain. But it is to say that such pain will not be found in an analysis
      of its impact on borrowing costs. Rather, where we should look to see clear evidence
      of negative effects is the savings side of the bill, where Republicans have enacted
      brutal cuts to the social safety net, cuts that the economist James Galbraith
      calls “the direct result of bipartisan scaremongering over deficits and debt.”
      The Times editorial board has run one editorial ( 5/23/25 ) on the bill’s cuts
      to the safety net. Published over a month before the bill’s passage, the piece
      was headlined “Republicans Can’t Hide Medicaid Cuts in a ‘Big, Beautiful’ Bill.”
      As it pointed out, the Republican bill would reverse the progress that has been
      made over the past decade or so in expanding health insurance access to more Americans.
      Oddly, however, the editorial extended an olive branch to the GOP, conceding:
      We are sympathetic to the idea that some government benefits should be tied to
      employment. People benefit from working, and society benefits when more people
      are working. Explaining the decision to insert this concession into the piece,
      editorial director David Leonhardt ( New York Times , 7/1/25 ) has since elaborated:
      I actually understand why, at a top-line way, people would want to put work requirements
      on a federal program, and actually I do think there are federal programs that
      should have work requirements. I’m a pretty big skeptic of universal basic income,
      of the idea that we’re just going to have the federal government give people lots
      of money outright. I don’t think it’s worked very well. I think it’s hugely expensive.
      This is a baffling explanation. As worded in the editorial, it appears that the
      board is expressing sympathy for work requirements for some existing government
      benefits, and justifying them with reference to the value of work, despite work
      requirements’ long history of doing nothing to increase employment. Yet Leonhardt
      gives no example of a current government program that should be saddled with a
      work requirement. Instead, he merely expresses his opposition to universal basic
      income, using conservative arguments against the policy in doing so. This level
      of clarity, however, may be all we can expect from the Times . Unnoted cutbacks
      At least as notable as the contents of the editorials published by the Times on
      the Big Beautiful Bill is what the Times has failed to highlight about the legislation.
      After all, the paper has run just two editorials on what is probably the most
      regressive major piece of legislation in at least a generation. What have these
      missed? A lot. For one, the largest cuts to food stamps in history are entirely
      absent from the Times editorial board’s critiques of the bill. That millions would
      lose access to food stamps and tens of millions would see their benefits cut is
      apparently an afterthought for the board. It evidently does not warrant the denunciation
      that somewhat higher borrowing costs require. Decimation of clean energy provisions
      and heavy new restrictions on student loans likewise appear a grand total of zero
      times in the Times ’ editorials on the bill. This is the sort of resistance that
      the most prominent establishment newspaper in the country has to offer. ‘Big ugly
      battle’ The situation at the Daily has been better, though it had only a rather
      low bar to clear. Through the day the bill was signed into law, the show published
      three episodes on the legislation. The first ( 6/5/25 ), titled “The Big Ugly
      Battle Over the Big Beautiful Bill,” touched on the bill’s attacks on climate
      provisions in its first half, and devoted its second half to a conversation about
      cuts to Medicaid. Food stamps, by contrast, were mentioned in just two sentences.
      And student loans didn’t make a single appearance. The following episode ( 7/2/25
      ), discussed above, centered on the debt, but the third episode ( 7/4/25 ) dedicated
      additional airtime to cuts to the safety net, again including a discussion of
      Medicaid cuts in the second half of the episode. Its first half also centered
      the serious negative impacts of the legislation, mostly focusing on the array
      of tax cuts in the bill, but framing the overall impact as wildly regressive:
      The most important thing to know about this package is that it delivers its greatest
      benefits to the wealthy, and it extracts its greatest cuts on the poor. The largest
      cuts to food stamps in American history, however, garnered no airtime. Same goes
      for the massive pullback in student loans. A ripple in a tsunami Unfortunately,
      this poor coverage is not limited to Times editorials and the Daily . As it turns
      out, the news section of the Times has been similarly lacking in serious coverage.
      The paper’s US Politics section is case in point. From the start of June through
      July 4, when Trump signed his bill into law, this section of the Times featured
      a total of seven articles that mentioned “food stamp(s),” “SNAP” or “food aid”
      in either their headline or subhead. For “Medicaid,” “health cuts” and “Obamacare,”
      the number was ten. But few of these articles bore headlines straightforwardly
      reporting the facts of what’s projected to happen to millions of Americans as
      a result of cuts to food stamps and healthcare spending. In total, only two headlines,
      both about healthcare, really fit this description: “GOP Bill Has $1.1 Trillion
      in Health Cuts and 11.8 Million Losing Care, CBO Says” ( 6/29/25 ) “Millions Would
      Lose Their Obamacare Coverage Under Trump’s Bill” ( 6/5/25 ) Other headlines mentioned
      cuts, but some didn’t even reference that information. For instance, one headline
      ( 6/3/25 ) read, “Trump Administration Backs Off Effort to Collect Data on Food
      Stamp Recipients.” Amazingly, at least in the US Politics section of the paper,
      zero headlines included the phrase “student loans,” despite substantial retrenchment
      in student loan policy. The term “safety net” appeared in the headline or subhead
      of only six articles. With around 800 articles appearing in the Times ’ US Politics
      section during this timeframe, coverage of historic cuts to crucial safety net
      programs resembled a ripple in a tsunami. ‘Fair to criticize Democrats’ Nonetheless,
      when Times editorial director David Leonhardt was asked whether he thinks “Americans
      who will be impacted by these cuts understand what’s happening,” given the lack
      of public outcry so far, he gave credit to Republicans for succeeding in minimizing
      public opposition, and blamed Democrats for failing to make a bigger deal out
      of the bill: I also think it’s fair to criticize the Democratic Party and activists
      who are aligned with the Democratic Party for not figuring out ways to make a
      bigger deal out of these cuts. To some extent, they’ve allowed the Republican
      cynical strategy of staying away from town halls to work better than it might
      have. The role of corporate media, and more particularly of the New York Times
      , may never have even crossed Leonhardt’s mind. But, of course, the Times is a
      critical player in US politics. With around 12 million subscribers and millions
      of daily listeners to the Daily , the outlet has incredible reach. If it wanted
      to, the Times could play a significant role in raising public awareness of this
      bill. The problem is that it seems completely uninterested in adopting this role.
      I would argue, therefore, that the paltry public outcry is fundamentally a result
      of editorial decisions, not least those made at the Times . By refusing to cover
      cuts to the social safety net with more than minimal urgency, the Times has done
      a good deal to deprive the Democratic Party and other opponents of the legislation
      of the sort of informational environment in which public opposition to harmful
      policies can be effectively mobilized. Through inaction, through poor coverage,
      the Times is making a political choice to undermine opposition to some of the
      Trump administration’s most damaging policies. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

      (FAIR) President Donald Trump has just signed into law what will go down as perhaps
      the most significant legislative achievement of his second term in office. Dubbed
      the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , the legislation is set to extend most of the
      tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term, while making deep cuts to social programs
      and gutting Biden-era climate provisions, among other sweeping changes ( FAIR.org
      , 7/9/25 ). The bill will have a remarkably regressive distributional impact.
      While top incomes will balloon by thousands of dollars, lower-income Americans
      will actually see their incomes decline. One analysis from before the bill’s final
      passage found that its major provisions would reduce incomes for the bottom 20%
      by about 2%. Tax cuts, after all, are only one part of the bill. More relevant
      to lower-income Americans is that this bill will deliver the largest cuts to Medicaid
      and food stamps in US history. Such a historic weakening of the safety net—the
      programs that support the finances of lower-income Americans—should warrant not
      only major attention, but significant scrutiny from national media outlets. And
      yet, at the New York Times , the approach has been to distract and obscure above
      all else. ‘Defined by staggering debt’ One manifestation of this approach has
      been the Times ’ insistence on elevating the bill’s effect on the debt as a foremost
      concern. In the week or so leading up to the bill’s passage, in fact, both an
      editorial ( 6/27/25 ) and an episode of the Times ’ flagship podcast the Daily
      ( 7/2/25 ) were dedicated entirely to a discussion of the national debt. The Daily
      episode went as far as claiming, “The legislation is defined by the staggering
      amount of debt that it’s creating.” It then warned of the potential for a debt
      “doom loop,” whereby rising debt raises borrowing costs and forces the government
      to issue more debt in order to pay for its existing debt load. Meanwhile, the
      Times editorial board opted to focus more heavily on the costs already being imposed
      by high federal debt. In a piece titled “The National Debt Is Already Causing
      Bigger Problems Than People Realize,” the board highlighted the “staggering amount
      of money” the government puts towards interest payments each year. The board’s
      solution: The government needs to raise taxes, especially on the wealthy, and
      it needs to make long-term changes in Social Security and Medicare, the major
      drivers of spending growth. In other words, at a time when the Republican Party
      is gutting the safety net in epic fashion, the New York Times is coyly hinting
      that Social Security and Medicare will need to be cut. ‘Enough to repair every
      bridge’ Across both the editorial and the podcast episode, the primary reason
      put forward by the Times for concern over the national debt was the borrowing
      costs associated with it. But is the bill’s effect on borrowing costs—the amount
      of money the federal government will have to spend to pay off the interest on
      its debts—genuinely that significant of a concern? The Times editorial board seems
      to think so. Warning of the ill effects of increasing borrowing costs, the board
      observed: The House version of Mr. Trump’s bill, already approved by that chamber,
      would increase interest payments on the debt by an average of $55 billion a year
      over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The increase
      alone is enough money to fully repair every bridge in the United States. This
      comparison is useful to a degree. It exposes the priorities of the Trump administration,
      which seems to value tax cuts for the wealthy above delivering basic public goods.
      But the comparison ultimately obscures more than it illuminates. The reality is
      that $55 billion is a relatively small sum for the US government. It represents
      only about 0.8% of the 2024 federal budget, and 0.2% of US GDP. High cost of high
      interest rates The total amount the federal government pays in interest—the amount
      it pays in excess of what it borrowed when it pays back loans—is of course much
      larger: The Times relays that interest payments are on pace to surpass $1 trillion
      this year, representing around 15% of last year’s federal budget. As the editorial
      board notes, this level of spending on interest payments crowds out other, more
      useful spending by the government. In other words, it does impose a not-insignificant
      cost. What the board de-emphasizes or ignores, however, is that high interest
      payments are really just a symptom of other more fundamental policy choices. On
      the one hand, they reflect the political decision to rely on the blunt instrument
      of interest rates to combat the pandemic-era spike in inflation. The result has
      been a rise in interest rates on ten-year government bonds, from under 1% in 2020
      to above 4% today. This was not an inevitable development. Other methods exist
      for combating inflation. But these methods were sidelined in favor of a regressive,
      debt-inflating approach. Would you know this by reading the Times editorial? Absolutely
      not. The incredibly low tax rate On the other hand, high interest payments also
      reflect the political decision to run up the US debt load through tax cuts for
      the wealthy. This history of tax cuts is discussed by the editorial board, but
      it is framed as more of a secondary issue. Little would readers know that the
      crowding-out effect imposed by high interest payments, which the Times depicts
      climbing above the cost of Social Security in coming years, is dwarfed by the
      crowding-out effect of low tax revenue. For such a rich country, the US collects
      incredibly little in taxes. Its tax revenue registers a meager 29% of GDP, compared
      to 42% in Canada, 52% in France and 62% in Norway. Meanwhile, interest payments
      as a percentage of GDP are set to double over the next 30 years, reaching about
      6% of GDP in the 2050s. That’s not even half the revenue deficit the US faces
      versus Canada—and Canada’s a low-tax country compared to France and Norway! The
      Times nonetheless has run no editorial in recent months decrying the US for being
      such a low-tax country. Even in its editorial about interest payments, a breakdown
      of the pitiful state of US tax collection by international standards is nowhere
      to be found. Instead, we get a muddled denunciation of the bill’s irresponsible
      contribution to burdensome borrowing costs. But, again, the bill’s contribution
      is tiny. Yes, interest payments are projected to reach 6% of GDP by the 2050s,
      but they will hit 5% even in the absence of this bill. With this single percentage
      of GDP boost in borrowing costs, the bill imposes a cost in 30 years that is a
      fraction of the cost of our tax deficit versus Canada today. ‘People benefit from
      working’ This is not to say that the Big Beautiful Bill will not impose Major
      Gratuitous Pain. But it is to say that such pain will not be found in an analysis
      of its impact on borrowing costs. Rather, where we should look to see clear evidence
      of negative effects is the savings side of the bill, where Republicans have enacted
      brutal cuts to the social safety net, cuts that the economist James Galbraith
      calls “the direct result of bipartisan scaremongering over deficits and debt.”

      was headlined “Republicans Can’t Hide Medicaid Cuts in a ‘Big, Beautiful’ Bill.”

      minutes, DC Studios, 2025 Editor’s Note: This article contains very mild spoilers
      . “Truth, justice, and the American way.” Those words are the long-time tagline
      of the DC comics character, Superman. They are not as prominent today as they
      have been in the past, but for those us, like me, who were great fans of DC comics
      in the 1970s and 1980s, they still defined Superman. They were also one of several
      reasons why, although my youthful passion for comic books leaned much more toward
      DC than its rival Marvel in those days, I didn’t care much for Superman. I liked
      the idealism he was supposed to represent, but his simplistic presentation and,
      more than anything, his deference to authority was a message my young and rebellious
      self was profoundly uncomfortable with. So how is it that in 2025, James Gunn’s
      new movie, Superman , has delighted me and many others by striking the biggest
      cultural blow to date against the United States’ mindless support of Israel, even
      as it commits war crimes and guns down innocent Palestinians on a daily basis?
      The dynamics of this movie are fascinating to watch, but the responses are much
      more important. ‘ Boravia’ is Israel , and is the bad guy Since Superman premiered,
      there has been a lot of chatter about it. The film broadly tells the story of
      Superman intervening against Boravia—which, both in the movie and in the comic
      book lore it is drawn from is presented as an Eastern European country—conquering
      its neighbor Jarhanpur—clearly depicted as an economically and physically ravaged
      country populated by people of color, many of whom are visibly Muslim. The scenario
      is inescapably evocative of Palestine. “Superman has gone woke” is one extremely
      popular attack on the film. That one is rooted in Superman ’s clear message supporting
      the rights of immigrants, but it also goes hand-in-hand with the complaint that
      the character has been warped by the “liberal media” to condemn Israel. Even leaving
      aside the notion that Superman, as a character, ever represented anything other
      than kindness and caring for all, even if in a highly pro-American way, the arguments
      are silly. Anyone who is familiar with the character would recognize Superman’s
      simple argument when he is criticized for stopping the surrogate for Israel in
      this film, Boravia, from slaughtering innocent and helpless civilians: “People
      were going to die!” Superman’s strength as a character is his idealism, which
      often spills over into extreme naivete, and his determination to treat all life
      as precious and equal. That’s what the crowd whining that “Superman has gone woke”
      just can’t grasp. Since Israel, Palestine, or any other country—save the United
      States, of course—is not mentioned in Superman , the metaphor of Boravia can be
      interpreted, or denied, at the viewer’s whim. But to do so, one has to ignore
      the unambiguous evidence in the film. James Gunn, who wrote and directed Superman
      , insists that Boravia and its neighboring country Jarhanpur, are not direct references
      to Israel and Palestine , but his explanation is very telling. “When I wrote this
      the Middle Eastern conflict wasn’t happening. So I tried to do little things to
      move it away from that, but it doesn’t have anything to do with the Middle East…
      [the movie depicts an] invasion by a much more powerful country run by a despot
      into a country that’s problematic in terms of its political history, but has totally
      no defense against the other country,” which he said “really is fictional.” Just
      from the statement that “the Middle Eastern conflict wasn’t happening,” we can
      tell that Gunn is not deeply learned in Israel and Palestine, although what he
      probably meant was that October 7 had not yet happened (he started writing the
      film in late 2022) and neither had the overt genocide in Gaza. As such, it may
      be fair to take him at his word that he was referencing a broader idea. But it’s
      an inescapable reality that the powerful country vs a helpless people describes
      Israel and the Palestinians, especially in Gaza. Sure, in addition to Israel and
      Palestine there are a few parallels with Russia and Ukraine. But that allegory
      doesn’t really fit since Boravia was said to be a close U.S. ally. Plus Ukraine,
      while certainly not the military power Russia is, is clearly far from helpless
      in the face of Russian aggression. The deep relationship between the Boravian
      dictator (who speaks with a thick Russian or Eastern European accent and looks
      like a caricature mix of Benjamin Netanyahu and David Ben-Gurion) and the American
      corporate sector resembles Netanyahu, even while his alienation from the American
      political sector might evoke Putin a bit more. But the Israel-Palestine metaphor
      is clearly there. It may have been one among several examples of the political
      dynamic in Gunn’s head, but what emerges on film is unmistakably influenced by
      Israel, even if not solely so. Gunn likely did not want to be too on the nose
      with his allegory, although he pretty clearly failed at that effort. More importantly,
      this movie is the foundation for what he and his backers at Warner Bros./Discovery
      hope will be a multi-billion-dollar franchise to rival that of the Marvel Cinematic
      Universe. He wants the political debate to enhance the film and its legacy, not
      to overwhelm it, so some degree of space to be evasive about politics is prudent.
      More important than the writer’s intentions, though, is that the political conflict
      depicted was so quickly seen for what it is. Profound culture shift In the past,
      even the very recent past, it would have been unfathomable for an American summer
      blockbuster film to show Israel, even a metaphorical Israel, as an invading, corrupt
      country whose neighbors were in such terror they had to pray for a superhero to
      save them, or all hope would be lost. A writer would have come to the studio with
      a script like that, even one where the allusion to Israel was obscured to a much
      greater degree, and it would have been tossed out. There might be fear of backlash,
      or it simply might be that this concept would be seen as too challenging for Americans
      who still hold on to the mythical image of Israel as either the poor victim of
      the ravenous Arab and Muslim hordes or the plucky little state that rose to become
      a military power and key American ally. But that didn’t happen here. The fact
      that Gunn wrote this movie is notable enough. But Warner/Discovery spent $225
      million to make it and anticipates another $125 million in advertising. That’s
      a significant investment. Moreover, they have two more high-budget films in the
      works, eight more in development, as well as two more television series in production
      and five more in pre-production. If Superman failed at the box office or caused
      a backlash that might lead to boycotts of DC media, it would be a disaster. But
      there hasn’t been a hint of trepidation or pressure on Gunn to soften this message.
      Warner Bros./Discovery CEO David Zaslav is known for his frugality, his willingness
      to scrap projects just for tax breaks, and for a relatively conservative approach.
      He obviously didn’t see this as much of a risk. A movie painting Israel in a villainous
      light reflects the change in generations as well. After all, the older audience,
      the folks still denying the real nature of Israel, is not the target of this film.
      Nor am I, as a man in his late 50s. It’s younger people, and they see Israel differently.
      No going back to an idealized Israel More than just reflecting that shift, a movie
      like Superman entrenches it culturally in a way that all the political activism,
      analysis, protests, and even exposure of the truth can’t. It normalizes the view
      of Israel as an aggressor state. That’s why it provokes denial from the likes
      of far-right Israel backer pundit Ben Shapiro and hysteria from other pro-Israel
      zealots who don’t deny the reality of the movie. Consider the words of the far-right,
      racist Israeli rapper known as Hatzel (The Shadow): “Instead of presenting a character
      who defends the weak and fights for justice, they turned it into a disgusting
      political caricature, where Israel (under a different name) is portrayed as a
      fascist state, a warmonger, and a close ally of the U.S., which supplies advanced
      weaponry to fight ‘poor and miserable farmers (the good Palestinians) with pitchforks
      and stones.’ And Superman? He comes to save them from bloodthirsty Israel. This
      is literally a film of incitement against us… And I will tell you here, clearly:
      The liberal Jews in America are the main contributors to anti-Semitism in the
      U.S…There is no greater enemy to an Israeli than the progressive American Jew.”
      The bile and hate of this racist activist are typical of the responses from the
      pro-Israel and Israeli far-right. But as much as they might rant, they can’t avoid
      the fact that the world now sees what Israel does every day, and that a more realistic
      understanding of Israel is becoming not just a debating point or a political issue
      but a part of the cultural zeitgeist. It’s not just about Israel. Superman goes
      to great lengths to present the hero as an independent actor, following only his
      own ethical code. The other superheroes in the film are sponsored by a huge corporation.
      They eventually come around and help Superman, but it takes a while. This might
      have been what pleased me most. The second blockbuster movie about Superman, back
      in 1980, ended with Superman flying through space carrying an American flag. But
      the U.S. comes off very badly in this movie. Superman is betrayed by the U.S.
      and handed over to his nemesis, Lex Luthor, who imprisons him. He is told he has
      no rights since he is an alien (i.e., immigrant). The U.S. also continues to back
      Boravia throughout the movie, and Superman is criticized for interfering in the
      murderous Boravian operation without American authorization. As more of the nefarious
      plot is uncovered, the U.S. government stands by doing nothing and never taking
      responsibility for its actions. Only the superheroes are working to save the day.
      Superman doesn’t only challenge the long-held, false image of innocent Israel,
      it also challenges Americans’ fecklessness, the ease with which its government
      is manipulated, and its blind, greedy, self-serving arrogance. Of course, it treads
      lightly on this point; again, there is only so much Gunn wanted to dive into political
      issues. It is, after all, a light-hearted fantasy movie that is expected to launch
      a series that will bring in a ton of money. But Superman proves there is no going
      back to the idealization of Israel that was kick-started back in 1960 when Paul
      Newman romanticized Israel’s creation in the film Exodus , and boomed after the
      1967 war. The delusion about Israel’s colonialist birth and apartheid life has
      been shattered by the exposure of its genocidal present. And a movie like Superman
      ingrains that shattered image into our culture. This, like Superman himself, might
      just provide a bit of hope in these dark times. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Mitchell Plitnick discusses the upcoming
      2025 film "Superman," directed by James Gunn, highlighting its unexpected cultural
      impact regarding U.S. support for Israel amidst ongoing conflicts. While Superman
      has historically embodied the ideals of "truth, justice, and the American way,"
      Plitnick reflects on how the character's simplistic portrayal and deference to
      authority once alienated him as a young fan. However, the film's narrative, which
      features Superman combating the fictional nation of Boravia—symbolically representing
      Israel as it oppresses the impoverished, diverse nation of Jarhanpur—has resonated
      with audiences and sparked significant discourse. The article emphasizes the film's
      potential to challenge prevailing narratives surrounding U.S. foreign policy and
      the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

      has historically embodied the ideals of "truth, justice, and the American way,"
      Plitnick reflects on how the character's simplistic portrayal and deference to
      authority once alienated him as a young fan. However, the film's narrative, which
      features Superman combating the fictional nation of Boravia—symbolically representing
      Israel as it oppresses the impoverished, diverse nation of Jarhanpur—has resonated
      with audiences and sparked significant discourse. The article emphasizes the film's
      potential to challenge prevailing narratives surrounding U.S. foreign policy and
      the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

      / Mondoweiss Speaking about Palestine is speaking about resistance in the heart
      of horror. That is how Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation
      of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, summed it up at an emergency
      conference in Bogotá, Colombia. The same Albanese who is currently facing sanctions
      imposed by the U.S. government for, according to them, making antisemitic remarks,
      after repeatedly denouncing the brutalities committed by Israel against the Palestinian
      people. Despite these accusations, Albanese remains firm in her denunciations.
      She reiterated on several occasions that we must not allow these actions to distract
      us from what truly matters: the genocide that, for the past twenty months, has
      escalated against the people of Gaza, and the massive human rights violations
      taking place across Palestine, which have left more than 60,000 people dead, most
      of them women and children. “The global majority [also known as the Global South]
      has been the driving force behind actions against Israel’s genocide, with South
      Africa and Colombia playing key roles in this process,” she told Mondoweiss during
      a press conference on the first day of the Emergency Conference for Gaza , convened
      by the governments of Colombia and South Africa. “These actions have led to the
      creation of spaces for sanctions and resistance. What we’ve been insisting on
      all along is that more and more countries must join these efforts.” The Hague
      Group coordinated this Emergency Conference, which brought together representatives
      from over 30 states, including China, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, Turkey, and Qatar.
      Initially formed by Colombia and South Africa, the group seeks to establish specific
      sanctions against Israel that, according to Colombia’s Vice Minister for Multilateral
      Affairs, Mauricio Jaramillo Jassir, aim to move beyond discourse and into action.
      Heads of state and their representatives emphasized that these sanctions are not
      retaliatory but are in full compliance with international humanitarian law. They
      are part of the international community’s commitment to ending the genocide. One
      of the central calls made was for more nations to join this effort and uphold
      their duty to defend human rights. All 30 participating states unanimously agreed
      that “the era of impunity must end— and that international law must be enforced.”
      To begin this effort, 12 states from across the world — Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba,
      Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Namibia, Nicaragua, Oman, Saint Vincent and
      the Grenadines, and South Africa — committed to implementing six key points: 1.
      Prevent the provision or transfer of arms, munitions, military fuel, related military
      equipment, and dual-use items to Israel, as appropriate, to ensure that our industry
      does not contribute the tools to enable or facilitate genocide, war crimes, crimes
      against humanity, and other violations of international law. 2. Prevent the transit,
      docking, and servicing of vessels at any port, if applicable, within our territorial
      jurisdiction, while being fully compliant with applicable international law, including
      UNCLOS, in all cases where there is a clear risk of the vessel being used to carry
      arms, munitions, military fuel, related military equipment, and dual-use items
      to Israel, to ensure that our territorial waters and ports do not serve as conduits
      for activities that enable or facilitate genocide, war crimes, crimes against
      humanity, and other violations of international law. 3. Prevent the carriage of
      arms, munitions, military fuel, related military equipment, and dual-use items
      to Israel on vessels bearing our flag, while being fully compliant with applicable
      international law, including UNCLOS, ensuring full accountability, including de-flagging,
      for non-compliance with this prohibition, not to render aid or assistance in maintaining
      the situation created by Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian
      Territory. 4. Commence an urgent review of all public contracts, in order to prevent
      public institutions and public funds, where applicable, from supporting Israel’s
      illegal occupation of the Palestinian Territory which may entrench its unlawful
      presence in the territory, to ensure that our nationals, and companies and entities
      under our jurisdiction, as well as our authorities, do not act in any way that
      would entail recognition or provide aid or assistance in maintaining the situation
      created by Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 5.
      Comply with our obligations to ensure accountability for the most serious crimes
      under international law through robust, impartial and independent investigations
      and prosecutions at national or international levels, in compliance with our obligation
      to ensure justice for all victims and the prevention of future crimes. 6. Support
      universal jurisdiction mandates, as and where applicable in our legal constitutional
      frameworks and judiciaries, to ensure justice for all victims and the prevention
      of future crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Both Jaramillo and Zane
      Dangor, Director-General of South Africa’s Department of International Relations
      and Cooperation, emphasized that these actions must not be seen as reprisals,
      but rather as part of an international effort to break the global silence that
      has enabled atrocities in Palestine. This decision is aligned with Colombian President
      Gustavo Petro’s renewed order to halt all coal exports from Colombia to Israel:
      “My government was betrayed, and that betrayal, among other things, cast doubt
      on my order to stop exporting coal to Israel. We are the world’s fifth-largest
      coal exporter, which means the country of life is helping to kill humanity. Colombian
      coal is still being shipped to Israel. We prohibited it, and yet we are being
      tricked into violating that decision. We cannot allow Colombian coal to be turned
      into bombs that help Israel kill children.” In his closing speech, Petro reaffirmed
      that Colombia would break all arms trade relations with Israel and would continue
      to support the Palestinian people’s right to resist. The legitimacy of the Hague
      Group and these decisions has also been backed by several multilateral organizations
      that have denounced the genocide. As Varsha Gandikota-Nellutla, Executive Secretary
      of the Hague Group, stated: “The International Criminal Court (ICC) has already
      clearly denounced the genocide. The United Nations has stated that Gaza is the
      hungriest place on Earth. What we lack now is not clarity, it’s courage. We need
      the bravery to take the necessary actions”. These words were echoed by Palestinian
      Foreign Minister Riyad Mansour, who emphasized that, together with the Madrid
      Group (a coalition of over 20 European and Arab countries also taking action against
      Israel and led by Spain), they could be the key to breaking Israel’s siege of
      horror: “This will not be an exercise in theatrical politics. The time has come
      for concrete, effective action to stop the crimes and end the profiteering from
      genocide. We will defeat these crimes against humanity and give the children who
      are still alive in Palestine a future full of promise, independence, and dignity.
      Recognizing Palestine is not a symbolic gesture, it is a concrete act of resistance
      against colonial expansion”. His statement was followed by that of Palestinian-American
      doctor Thaer Ahmad, who worked in Nasser Hospital in Gaza and left the territory
      two months ago. In his testimony, he said he is certain that official death tolls
      do not even come close to reality, that Gaza is currently hell on Earth, and that
      every day the genocide continues brings devastating consequences for Palestinian
      children: “How can we look ourselves in the mirror? When this ends, if it ends,
      what will we say? ‘Sorry, we did everything we could’? They can’t afford to keep
      waiting for vague responses. They are surviving genocide every day. So now, how
      do we ensure that the effort to erase Palestinians from history does not succeed?”
      Although the agreed-upon actions are significant, even the attending delegations
      acknowledge that their efforts will not be enough. Broader and more forceful measures
      are required. Yet, one day earlier, standing at the podium of Colombia’s Ministry
      of Foreign Affairs, Francesca Albanese reaffirmed the historic importance of this
      event. She stated it could be: “A historical turning point that ends, with concrete
      measures, the genocide-based economy that has sustained Israel. I came to this
      meeting believing that the narrative is shifting. Hope must be a discipline that
      we all preserve.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of

      donation . By Sharon Zhang / Truthout Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) is taking
      on the “retirement crisis” in the U.S. with a new bill aimed at guaranteeing pensions
      or solid retirement plans for every worker in America. On Thursday, Sanders introduced
      the Pensions for All Act, which would require corporations to provide a retirement
      plan equivalent to or better than the pensions plan offered to members of Congress.
      “If we are serious about addressing the retirement crisis in America, corporations
      must be required to offer all of their workers a traditional pension plan that
      guarantees a monthly income in retirement,” Sanders said in a statement. “And
      if corporations refuse to offer a decent retirement plan, their workers must be
      allowed to receive the same type of pension that every member of Congress receives.”
      “If we can guarantee a defined benefit pension plan for members of Congress, we
      can and we must provide that same level of retirement security to every worker
      in America,” he went on. Congress’s retirement plan, Federal Employees’ Retirement
      System (FERS), offers a far higher contribution into retirement than most employers’
      retirement plans, while also giving out higher payments in retirement. Meanwhile,
      Congress has enabled growing inequality in retirement accounts, with research
      finding that the gap between the average amounts in the accounts of the top 10
      percent and the working class has grown drastically in recent decades. Research
      has found that pensions could play a major role in reducing poverty. But corporations
      have worked to massively gut pensions. According to data from the Department of
      Labor , only 9 percent of workers have a pension now, compared to 44 percent of
      workers in 1975. This has led to an affordability crisis for retirement-age Americans
      and seniors, with more than half of seniors living off less than $25,000 a year
      and no retirement savings. Over a fifth of seniors are living in poverty, a far
      worse rate than in other wealthy countries, Sanders’s office points out. The bill,
      introduced to build upon Sanders’s legislation to strengthen and increase Social
      Security benefits , has been endorsed by several unions and progressive organizations.
      “We’ve gone from being a country that promised security and dignity in old age
      to being a country that forces people to work until they’re in the grave,” said
      United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain in a statement in support of the legislation.
      “Pensions have long been the bedrock of retirement for working-class people, but
      corporate greed has eroded that foundation. The billionaire class gutted pensions
      in pursuit of profit, and Washington let it happen.” Indeed, instead of making
      it easier for Americans to retire, Republicans have proposed raising the minimum
      age for benefits like Medicare and Social Security in recent years. Meanwhile,
      this month, Republicans passed a bill that will slash Medicaid and other crucial
      anti-poverty programs, which will make it even harder for Americans to save for
      retirement. Right-wing figures have openly said that they are against the idea
      of Americans being able to retire at all, effectively saying that Americans should
      work until they die. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      on the “retirement crisis” in the U.S. with a new bill aimed at guaranteeing pensions
      or solid retirement plans for every worker in America. On Thursday, Sanders introduced
      the Pensions for All Act, which would require corporations to provide a retirement
      plan equivalent to or better than the pensions plan offered to members of Congress.
      “If we are serious about addressing the retirement crisis in America, corporations
      must be required to offer all of their workers a traditional pension plan that
      guarantees a monthly income in retirement,” Sanders said in a statement. “And
      if corporations refuse to offer a decent retirement plan, their workers must be
      allowed to receive the same type of pension that every member of Congress receives.”
      “If we can guarantee a defined benefit pension plan for members of Congress, we
      can and we must provide that same level of retirement security to every worker
      in America,” he went on. Congress’s retirement plan, Federal Employees’ Retirement
      System (FERS), offers a far higher contribution into retirement than most employers’
      retirement plans, while also giving out higher payments in retirement. Meanwhile,
      Congress has enabled growing inequality in retirement accounts, with research
      finding that the gap between the average amounts in the accounts of the top 10
      percent and the working class has grown drastically in recent decades. Research
      has found that pensions could play a major role in reducing poverty. But corporations
      have worked to massively gut pensions. According to data from the Department of
      Labor , only 9 percent of workers have a pension now, compared to 44 percent of
      workers in 1975. This has led to an affordability crisis for retirement-age Americans
      and seniors, with more than half of seniors living off less than $25,000 a year
      and no retirement savings. Over a fifth of seniors are living in poverty, a far
      worse rate than in other wealthy countries, Sanders’s office points out. The bill,
      introduced to build upon Sanders’s legislation to strengthen and increase Social
      Security benefits , has been endorsed by several unions and progressive organizations.
      “We’ve gone from being a country that promised security and dignity in old age
      to being a country that forces people to work until they’re in the grave,” said
      United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain in a statement in support of the legislation.
      “Pensions have long been the bedrock of retirement for working-class people, but
      corporate greed has eroded that foundation. The billionaire class gutted pensions
      in pursuit of profit, and Washington let it happen.” Indeed, instead of making
      it easier for Americans to retire, Republicans have proposed raising the minimum
      age for benefits like Medicare and Social Security in recent years. Meanwhile,
      this month, Republicans passed a bill that will slash Medicaid and other crucial
      anti-poverty programs, which will make it even harder for Americans to save for
      retirement. Right-wing figures have openly said that they are against the idea
      of Americans being able to retire at all, effectively saying that Americans should
      work until they die. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      donation . By Eric Ross / TomDispatch In recent months, nuclear weapons have reemerged
      in global headlines. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan approached the brink
      of a full-scale war, a confrontation that could have become an extinction-level
      event, with the potential to claim up to two billion lives worldwide. The instability
      of a global order structured on nuclear apartheid has also come into sharp relief
      in the context of the recent attacks on Iran by Israel and the United States.
      That system has entrenched a dangerous double standard, creating perverse incentives
      for the proliferation of world-destroying weaponry, already possessed by nine
      countries . Many of those nations use their arsenals to exercise imperial impunity,
      while non-nuclear states increasingly feel compelled to pursue nuclear weapons
      in the name of national security and survival. Meanwhile, the largest nuclear
      powers show not the slightest signs of responsibility or restraint. The United
      States, Russia, and China are investing heavily in the “modernization” and expansion
      of their arsenals, fueling a renewed arms race. And that escalation comes amid
      growing global instability contributing to a Manichean world of antagonistic armed
      blocs, reminiscent of the Cold War at its worst. The nuclear threat endangers
      not only global peace and security but the very continuity of the human species,
      not to speak of the simple survival of life on Earth. How, you might wonder, could
      we ever have arrived at such a precarious situation? The current crisis coincides
      with the 80th anniversary of the Trinity Test, the first detonation of an atomic
      weapon that would soon obliterate the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
      and so inaugurate the atomic age. So many years later, it’s worth critically reassessing
      the decisions that conferred on humanity such a power of self-annihilation. After
      all, we continue to live with the fallout of the choices made (and not made),
      including those of the scientists who created the bomb. That history also serves
      as a reminder that alternative paths were available then and that another world
      remains possible today. A Tale of Two Laboratories In the summer of 1945, scientists
      and technicians at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico worked feverishly
      to complete the construction of the atomic bomb. Meanwhile, their colleagues at
      the University of Chicago’s Metallurgical Laboratory mounted a final, ultimately
      unsuccessful effort to prevent its use. The alarm spreading in Chicago stemmed
      from a sobering realization. The Manhattan Project that they had joined on the
      basis of a belief that they were in an existential arms race with Nazi Germany
      had, by then, revealed itself to be a distinctly one-sided contest. Until then,
      the specter of a possible German atomic bomb had conferred a sense of urgency
      and a veneer of moral legitimacy on what many scientists otherwise recognized
      as a profoundly unethical undertaking. Prior to the fall of Berlin, Allied intelligence
      had already begun to cast serious doubt on Germany’s progress toward developing
      an atomic weapon. By April 1945, with the Nazi regime in a state of collapse and
      Japan’s defeat imminent, the threat that served as the original justification
      for the bomb’s development had all but vanished. No longer represented as a plausible
      deterrent, the bomb now stood poised to become what Los Alamos Director J. Robert
      Oppenheimer would describe shortly after the war as “weapons of terror, of surprise,
      of aggression… [used] against an essentially defeated enemy.” By that point, it
      was evident that the bomb would be used not to deter Germany but to destroy Japan,
      and not as the final act of World War II but as the opening salvo of what would
      become the Cold War. The true target of the first atomic bomb wasn’t, in fact,
      Tokyo, but Moscow, with the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki sacrificed on the
      altar of American global imperial ambition. For the scientists at Chicago, that
      new context demanded new thinking. In June 1945, a committee of physicists led
      by James Franck submitted a report to Secretary of War Henry Stimson warning of
      the profound political and ethical consequences of employing such a bomb without
      exhausting all other alternatives. “We believe,” the Franck Report stated , “that
      the use of nuclear bombs for an early, unannounced attack against Japan [would
      be] inadvisable.” The report instead proposed a demonstration before international
      observers, arguing that such a display could serve as a gesture of goodwill and
      might avert the need to use the bombs altogether. One of that report’s signatories,
      Leo Szilard , who had been among the bomb’s earliest advocates , further sought
      to prevent what he had come to recognize as the catastrophic potential outcome
      of their creation. With Germany defeated, he felt a personal responsibility for
      reversing the course he had helped set in motion. Echoing concerns articulated
      in the Franck Report, he drafted a petition to be circulated among the scientists.
      While acknowledging that the bomb might offer short-term military and political
      advantages against Japan, he warned that its deployment would ultimately prove
      morally indefensible and strategically self-defeating, a position which would
      also be held by six of the seven U.S. five-star generals and admirals of that
      moment. Szilard emphasized that the atomic bomb wasn’t just a more powerful weapon
      but a fundamental transformation in the nature of warfare, an instrument of annihilation.
      He already feared Americans might come to regret that their own government had
      sown the seeds of global destruction by legitimizing the sudden obliteration of
      Japanese cities, a precedent that would render a heavily industrialized, densely
      populated country like the United States especially vulnerable. Moreover, he concluded
      that using such weapons of unimaginable destructive power without sufficient military
      justification would severely undermine American credibility in future arms control
      efforts. He observed that the development of the bomb under conditions of extreme
      wartime secrecy had created an abjectly anti-democratic situation, one in which
      the public was denied any opportunity to deliberate on such an irrevocable and
      consequential decision. As Eugene Rabinowitch , a co-author of the Franck Report
      (who would later co-found The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists ), would note soon
      after, the scientists in Chicago were growing increasingly uneasy in the face
      of escalating secrecy: “Many scientists began to wonder: against whom was this
      extreme secrecy directed? What was the sense of keeping our success secret from
      the Japanese? Would it have helped them to know that we had an atomic bomb ready?”
      Rabinowitch concluded that the only “danger” posed by such a disclosure was that
      the Chicago scientists might be proven right, and Japan might surrender. “Since
      there was no justifiable reason to hold the bomb secret from the Japanese,” he
      argued, “many scientists felt that the purpose of deepened secrecy was to keep
      the knowledge of the bomb… from the American people.” In other words, officials
      in Washington were concerned that a successful demonstration might deprive them
      of the coveted opportunity to use the bomb and assert their newly acquired monopoly
      (however temporary) on unprecedented power. The Road to Trinity and the Cult of
      Oppenheimer Seventy scientists at Chicago endorsed the Szilard Petition. By then,
      however, their influence on the project had distinctly diminished. Despite their
      early contributions , notably the achievement of the first self-sustained nuclear
      chain reaction in December 1942, the project’s center of gravity had shifted to
      Los Alamos. Recognizing this, Szilard sought to circulate the petition among his
      colleagues there, too, hoping to invoke a shared sense of scientific responsibility
      and awaken their moral conscience in the critical weeks leading up to the first
      test of the weapon. Why did that effort fail? Why was there so little dissent,
      debate, or resistance at Los Alamos given the growing scientific opposition, bordering
      on revolt, that had emerged in Chicago? One answer lies in Oppenheimer himself.
      In popular culture and historical scholarship, his legacy is often framed as that
      of a tragic figure: the reluctant architect of the atomic age, an idealist drawn
      into the ethically fraught task of creating a weapon of mass destruction compelled
      by the perceived exigencies of an existential war. Yet the myth of him as a Promethean
      figure who suffered for unleashing the fundamental forces of nature onto a society
      unprepared to bear responsibility for it obscures the extent of his complicity.
      Far from being a passive participant, in the final months of the Manhattan Project,
      he emerged as a willing collaborator in the coordination of the coming atomic
      bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When Oppenheimer and physicist Edward Teller
      (who would come to be known as “the father of the hydrogen bomb”) received Szilard’s
      petition, neither shared it. While Oppenheimer offered no response, Teller provided
      a striking explanation : “The things we are working on are so terrible that no
      amount of protesting or fiddling with politics will save our souls.” He further
      rejected the idea that he held any authority to influence the bomb’s use. “You
      may think it is a crime to continue to work,” he conceded, “but I feel that I
      should do the wrong thing if I tried to say how to tie the little toe of the ghost
      to the bottle from which we just helped it escape.” Teller later claimed to be
      in “absolute agreement” with the petition, but added that “Szilard asked me to
      collect signatures… I felt I could not do so without first seeking Oppenheimer’s
      permission more directly. I did so and Oppenheimer talked me out of it, saying
      that we as scientists have no business meddling in political pressure of that
      kind… I am ashamed to say that he managed to talk me out of [it].” Teller’s explanation
      was likely self-serving given his later acrimonious rift with Oppenheimer over
      the hydrogen bomb. Yet further evidence indicates that Oppenheimer actively sought
      to suppress debate and dissent. Physicist Robert Wilson recalled that upon arriving
      at Los Alamos in 1943, he raised concerns about the broader implications of their
      work and the “terrible problems” it might create, particularly given the exclusion
      of the Soviet Union, then an ally. The Los Alamos director, Wilson remembered,
      “didn’t want to talk about that sort of thing” and would instead redirect the
      conversation to technical matters. When Wilson helped organize a meeting to discuss
      the future trajectory of the project in the wake of Germany’s defeat, Oppenheimer
      cautioned him against it, warning that “he would get into trouble by calling such
      a meeting.” The meeting nonetheless proceeded, with Oppenheimer in attendance,
      though his presence proved stifling. “He participated very much, dominating the
      meeting,” Wilson remembered. Oppenheimer pointed to the upcoming San Francisco
      Conference to establish the United Nations and insisted that political questions
      would be addressed there by those with greater expertise, implying that scientists
      had no role to play in such matters and ought to abstain from influencing the
      applications of their work. Reflecting on his mindset at the time, Oppenheimer
      explained , “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and
      do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical
      success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb.” In a similar vein, his
      oft-quoted remark that “the physicists have known sin” was frequently misinterpreted.
      He was not referring, he insisted, to the “sin” of the destruction of Hiroshima
      and Nagasaki, but to pride for “intervening explicitly and heavy-handedly in the
      course of human history.” When situated within this broader context of a professed
      commitment to scientific detachment, Oppenheimer’s behavior becomes more intelligible.
      In practice, however, his stated ideals stood in stark contrast to his conduct.
      While he claimed to reject political engagement, he ultimately intervened in precisely
      such a manner, using his position to advocate forcefully for the bomb’s immediate
      military use against Japan without prior warning. He emerged as a leading opponent
      of any prospective demonstration, cautioning that it would undermine the psychological
      impact of the bomb’s use, which could only be realized through a sudden, unannounced
      detonation on a relatively untouched, non-military target like the city of Hiroshima.
      This position stood in sharp contrast to that of the Chicago scientists, of whom
      only 15% supported using the bomb in such a manner. That climate of deference
      fostered a culture of complicity, where questions of social responsibility were
      subordinated to uncritical faith in authority. Reflecting on that dynamic , physicist
      Rudolf Peierls acknowledged, “I knew that Oppenheimer was on a committee and was
      briefing with the high-ups. I felt there were two things one could rely on: Oppenheimer
      to put the reasonable ideas across, and that one could trust people. After all,
      we are not terrorists at heart or anything… Both these statements might now be
      somewhat optimistic.” Ultimately, the only member of Los Alamos to register dissent
      was Joseph Rotblat , who quietly resigned on ethical grounds after learning in
      November 1944 that there was no active Nazi atomic bomb program . His departure
      remained a personal act of conscience , however, rather than an effort to initiate
      a broader moral reckoning within the scientific community. “Remember Your Humanity”
      The legacy of Oppenheimer, a burden we all now carry, lies in his mistaking proximity
      to power for power itself. Rather than using his influence to restrain the bomb’s
      use, he exercised what authority he had to facilitate its most catastrophic outcome,
      entrusting its consequences to political leaders who soon revealed their recklessness.
      In doing so, he helped lay the groundwork for what President Dwight D. Eisenhower
      would, in his farewell address to Congress in 1961, warn against as “the disastrous
      rise of misplaced power.” Yet we are not doomed. This history should also remind
      us that the development and use of nuclear weapons was not inevitable. There were
      those who spoke out and a different path might well have been possible. While
      we cannot know exactly how events would have unfolded had dissent been amplified
      rather than suppressed, we can raise our own voices now to demand a safer, saner
      future. Our collective survival may well depend on it. How much longer a world
      armed with nuclear weapons can endure remains uncertain. The only viable path
      forward lies in renewing a commitment to, as Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell
      urged, “ remember your humanity , and forget the rest.” With ever more nations
      developing increasingly powerful arsenals, one thing remains clear: as the Doomsday
      Clock moves ever closer to midnight, there is no time to waste. Editor’s Note

      the U.S., Russia, and China—who are modernizing and expanding their nuclear capabilities,
      reminiscent of Cold War dynamics. The ongoing arms race and geopolitical instability
      pose severe threats not only to global peace but to the survival of humanity itself,

      Tokyo, but Moscow, with the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki sacrificed on the
      altar of American global imperial ambition. For the scientists at Chicago, that
      new context demanded new thinking. In June 1945, a committee of physicists led
      by James Franck submitted a report to Secretary of War Henry Stimson warning of
      the profound political and ethical consequences of employing such a bomb without
      exhausting all other alternatives. “We believe,” the Franck Report stated , “that
      the use of nuclear bombs for an early, unannounced attack against Japan [would
      be] inadvisable.” The report instead proposed a demonstration before international
      observers, arguing that such a display could serve as a gesture of goodwill and
      might avert the need to use the bombs altogether. One of that report’s signatories,
      Leo Szilard , who had been among the bomb’s earliest advocates , further sought
      to prevent what he had come to recognize as the catastrophic potential outcome
      of their creation. With Germany defeated, he felt a personal responsibility for
      reversing the course he had helped set in motion. Echoing concerns articulated
      in the Franck Report, he drafted a petition to be circulated among the scientists.
      While acknowledging that the bomb might offer short-term military and political
      advantages against Japan, he warned that its deployment would ultimately prove
      morally indefensible and strategically self-defeating, a position which would
      also be held by six of the seven U.S. five-star generals and admirals of that
      moment. Szilard emphasized that the atomic bomb wasn’t just a more powerful weapon
      but a fundamental transformation in the nature of warfare, an instrument of annihilation.
      He already feared Americans might come to regret that their own government had
      sown the seeds of global destruction by legitimizing the sudden obliteration of
      Japanese cities, a precedent that would render a heavily industrialized, densely
      populated country like the United States especially vulnerable. Moreover, he concluded
      that using such weapons of unimaginable destructive power without sufficient military
      justification would severely undermine American credibility in future arms control
      efforts. He observed that the development of the bomb under conditions of extreme
      wartime secrecy had created an abjectly anti-democratic situation, one in which
      the public was denied any opportunity to deliberate on such an irrevocable and
      consequential decision. As Eugene Rabinowitch , a co-author of the Franck Report
      (who would later co-found The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists ), would note soon
      after, the scientists in Chicago were growing increasingly uneasy in the face
      of escalating secrecy: “Many scientists began to wonder: against whom was this
      extreme secrecy directed? What was the sense of keeping our success secret from
      the Japanese? Would it have helped them to know that we had an atomic bomb ready?”
      Rabinowitch concluded that the only “danger” posed by such a disclosure was that
      the Chicago scientists might be proven right, and Japan might surrender. “Since
      there was no justifiable reason to hold the bomb secret from the Japanese,” he
      argued, “many scientists felt that the purpose of deepened secrecy was to keep
      the knowledge of the bomb… from the American people.” In other words, officials
      in Washington were concerned that a successful demonstration might deprive them
      of the coveted opportunity to use the bomb and assert their newly acquired monopoly
      (however temporary) on unprecedented power. The Road to Trinity and the Cult of
      Oppenheimer Seventy scientists at Chicago endorsed the Szilard Petition. By then,
      however, their influence on the project had distinctly diminished. Despite their
      early contributions , notably the achievement of the first self-sustained nuclear
      chain reaction in December 1942, the project’s center of gravity had shifted to
      Los Alamos. Recognizing this, Szilard sought to circulate the petition among his
      colleagues there, too, hoping to invoke a shared sense of scientific responsibility
      and awaken their moral conscience in the critical weeks leading up to the first
      test of the weapon. Why did that effort fail? Why was there so little dissent,
      debate, or resistance at Los Alamos given the growing scientific opposition, bordering
      on revolt, that had emerged in Chicago? One answer lies in Oppenheimer himself.
      In popular culture and historical scholarship, his legacy is often framed as that
      of a tragic figure: the reluctant architect of the atomic age, an idealist drawn
      into the ethically fraught task of creating a weapon of mass destruction compelled
      by the perceived exigencies of an existential war. Yet the myth of him as a Promethean
      figure who suffered for unleashing the fundamental forces of nature onto a society
      unprepared to bear responsibility for it obscures the extent of his complicity.
      Far from being a passive participant, in the final months of the Manhattan Project,
      he emerged as a willing collaborator in the coordination of the coming atomic
      bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When Oppenheimer and physicist Edward Teller
      (who would come to be known as “the father of the hydrogen bomb”) received Szilard’s
      petition, neither shared it. While Oppenheimer offered no response, Teller provided
      a striking explanation : “The things we are working on are so terrible that no
      amount of protesting or fiddling with politics will save our souls.” He further
      rejected the idea that he held any authority to influence the bomb’s use. “You
      may think it is a crime to continue to work,” he conceded, “but I feel that I
      should do the wrong thing if I tried to say how to tie the little toe of the ghost
      to the bottle from which we just helped it escape.” Teller later claimed to be
      in “absolute agreement” with the petition, but added that “Szilard asked me to
      collect signatures… I felt I could not do so without first seeking Oppenheimer’s
      permission more directly. I did so and Oppenheimer talked me out of it, saying
      that we as scientists have no business meddling in political pressure of that
      kind… I am ashamed to say that he managed to talk me out of [it].” Teller’s explanation
      was likely self-serving given his later acrimonious rift with Oppenheimer over
      the hydrogen bomb. Yet further evidence indicates that Oppenheimer actively sought
      to suppress debate and dissent. Physicist Robert Wilson recalled that upon arriving
      at Los Alamos in 1943, he raised concerns about the broader implications of their
      work and the “terrible problems” it might create, particularly given the exclusion
      of the Soviet Union, then an ally. The Los Alamos director, Wilson remembered,
      “didn’t want to talk about that sort of thing” and would instead redirect the
      conversation to technical matters. When Wilson helped organize a meeting to discuss
      the future trajectory of the project in the wake of Germany’s defeat, Oppenheimer
      cautioned him against it, warning that “he would get into trouble by calling such
      a meeting.” The meeting nonetheless proceeded, with Oppenheimer in attendance,
      though his presence proved stifling. “He participated very much, dominating the
      meeting,” Wilson remembered. Oppenheimer pointed to the upcoming San Francisco
      Conference to establish the United Nations and insisted that political questions
      would be addressed there by those with greater expertise, implying that scientists
      had no role to play in such matters and ought to abstain from influencing the
      applications of their work. Reflecting on his mindset at the time, Oppenheimer
      explained , “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and
      do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical
      success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb.” In a similar vein, his
      oft-quoted remark that “the physicists have known sin” was frequently misinterpreted.
      He was not referring, he insisted, to the “sin” of the destruction of Hiroshima
      and Nagasaki, but to pride for “intervening explicitly and heavy-handedly in the
      course of human history.” When situated within this broader context of a professed
      commitment to scientific detachment, Oppenheimer’s behavior becomes more intelligible.
      In practice, however, his stated ideals stood in stark contrast to his conduct.
      While he claimed to reject political engagement, he ultimately intervened in precisely
      such a manner, using his position to advocate forcefully for the bomb’s immediate
      military use against Japan without prior warning. He emerged as a leading opponent
      of any prospective demonstration, cautioning that it would undermine the psychological
      impact of the bomb’s use, which could only be realized through a sudden, unannounced
      detonation on a relatively untouched, non-military target like the city of Hiroshima.
      This position stood in sharp contrast to that of the Chicago scientists, of whom
      only 15% supported using the bomb in such a manner. That climate of deference
      fostered a culture of complicity, where questions of social responsibility were
      subordinated to uncritical faith in authority. Reflecting on that dynamic , physicist
      Rudolf Peierls acknowledged, “I knew that Oppenheimer was on a committee and was
      briefing with the high-ups. I felt there were two things one could rely on: Oppenheimer
      to put the reasonable ideas across, and that one could trust people. After all,
      we are not terrorists at heart or anything… Both these statements might now be
      somewhat optimistic.” Ultimately, the only member of Los Alamos to register dissent
      was Joseph Rotblat , who quietly resigned on ethical grounds after learning in
      November 1944 that there was no active Nazi atomic bomb program . His departure
      remained a personal act of conscience , however, rather than an effort to initiate
      a broader moral reckoning within the scientific community. “Remember Your Humanity”
      The legacy of Oppenheimer, a burden we all now carry, lies in his mistaking proximity
      to power for power itself. Rather than using his influence to restrain the bomb’s
      use, he exercised what authority he had to facilitate its most catastrophic outcome,
      entrusting its consequences to political leaders who soon revealed their recklessness.
      In doing so, he helped lay the groundwork for what President Dwight D. Eisenhower
      would, in his farewell address to Congress in 1961, warn against as “the disastrous
      rise of misplaced power.” Yet we are not doomed. This history should also remind
      us that the development and use of nuclear weapons was not inevitable. There were
      those who spoke out and a different path might well have been possible. While
      we cannot know exactly how events would have unfolded had dissent been amplified
      rather than suppressed, we can raise our own voices now to demand a safer, saner
      future. Our collective survival may well depend on it. How much longer a world
      armed with nuclear weapons can endure remains uncertain. The only viable path
      forward lies in renewing a commitment to, as Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell
      urged, “ remember your humanity , and forget the rest.” With ever more nations
      developing increasingly powerful arsenals, one thing remains clear: as the Doomsday
      Clock moves ever closer to midnight, there is no time to waste. Editor’s Note

    paragraph_summary: In a recent analysis by Eric Ross for TomDispatch, the resurgence
      of nuclear weapons in global discourse is highlighted, particularly in light of
      the dangerous tensions between nuclear-armed nations like India and Pakistan,
      which nearly escalated into a catastrophic conflict. The article critiques the
      existing global nuclear order, characterized by a double standard that favors
      nuclear-armed states while pressuring non-nuclear countries to pursue their own
      arsenals for security. This situation is exacerbated by the major nuclear powers—namely
      the U.S., Russia, and China—who are modernizing and expanding their nuclear capabilities,
      reminiscent of Cold War dynamics. The ongoing arms race and geopolitical instability
      pose severe threats not only to global peace but to the survival of humanity itself,
      marking a critical moment as we approach the 80th anniversary of the first atomic
      bomb test.

      in the past when a candidate to become New York City’s mayor prompted as much
      fervor in some quarters and as much fear and loathing in others as Zohran Mamdani,
      but I do not recall it. In the 100–odd days until the city votes Nov. 4, we—New
      Yorkers and the rest of us—are in for political warfare that could turn out to
      be epochal. This will be a riveting campaign season; in my read it is unlikely
      to be a pretty one. Mamdani, who has served in the state legislature since 2020,
      wowed New York City and the rest of the country when, on July 1, he trounced the
      Democratic field to win the party’s nomination to run for mayor this autumn. The
      Democratic establishment, which had put its money on Andrew Cuomo (literally and
      figuratively), was stunned. Cuomo, a machine pol who resigned as governor of New
      York four years ago amid accusations of sexual harassment, was considered a shoo-in
      and, reflecting this, ran a campaign we can kindly describe as complacent. Then
      came the blow: Mamdani, with more than 50,000 volunteers campaigning for him,
      took 56% of the vote in the Democratic primary, to Cuomo’s 44%. Figures don’t
      always lie and liars don’t always figure. Mamdani is a true phenom, an energetic
      33–year-old full of policy proposals that address the real problems of real people.
      A free bus system, a freeze on rents in half the city’s apartments, supermarkets
      run by the city, a properly redistributive tax regime to address the near to obscene
      inequality New Yorkers endure: These are good ideas, ideas with obvious appeal
      to Democratic voters, ideas expressive of his commitment to dynamic change. Mamdani,
      I have to add right off, also takes a principled position against the Israelis’
      shocking barbarities in Gaza and then America’s support of them. But one’s strengths
      are at times also one’s vulnerabilities, as Mamdani is about to discover. On Monday,
      July 14, Cuomo announced in a brief video that, rather than step aside after his
      punishing defeat, he will stay in the race as an independent with the all-but-stated
      intent of preventing New York from falling “in the hands of the far left,” as
      The New York Times idiotically put it in a piece reviewing Cuomo’s renewed campaign
      . Cuomo, whose term as governor reeked of opportunism and corruptibility if not
      proven corruption, is now the unseemly front end of an attack on Mamdani that
      is unlikely to relent until this race is decided. Wall Street and the banks, hedge-fund
      billionaires, major corporations, New York real estate developers, the Israel
      lobby, corporate media, the Democratic mainstream: These are all lining up to
      make sure Zohran Mamdani does not win come Nov. 4. He’s a Marxist, a socialist,
      a Communist, a lunatic, of course an anti–Semite. Zionist extremists and their
      sympathizers charge that Mamdani, a Muslim, will impose Shariah law on New York
      City. President Trump has wondered aloud whether he should have Mamdani arrested,
      or whether he, Mamdani, should be stripped of his citizenship . Financial and
      corporate interests spent $22 million on Cuomo’s failed primary campaign. There
      is every indication they will spend more this time. Let us, then, view this in
      the large: The battle has been joined between Democratic Party elites and the
      voters they are increasingly committed to suppressing, between money and democratic
      process, between power and the forces for change that gather as we speak not only
      in New York but across the country. We have been here before, of course. But the
      risk that the Democrats will destroy themselves as they attempt to destroy Zohran
      Mamdani is in my estimation greater than ever. ■ Here is Mamdani on “Meet the
      Press” Sunday, July 1, just after his victory: We can beat anyone that’s in this
      race because what we’ve shown is that this is a campaign that has the support
      of more than 400,000 New Yorkers. For too long, politicians have pretended to
      simply be bystanders to a cost-of-living crisis. They’ve actually exacerbated
      it. And our vision is one that will respond to it and make this a city affordable
      for every New Yorker. And Mamdani when asked about the Gaza crisis in an interview
      with Politico during his campaign in April: I think what is incumbent to do is
      to stop subsidizing a genocide. And that’s what we’ve seen over more than a year.
      And it’s what we’ve seen intensify right now with Donald Trump. And it is hard
      for me to explain to my constituents, who live in the largest public housing development
      in North America, in Queensbridge, why they have to live in substandard conditions
      because the government refuses to fund public housing, all while we continue to
      find billions of dollars to drop bombs that kill tens of thousands of Palestinians
      over more than a year now. And the sheer number of children that have been killed
      does not even capture the level of trauma for those that have survived. And that
      is a responsibility for us to speak up against, as the people who are financing
      it. It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s… it’s a political candidate who says what
      he means and what he means reflects the realities facing Americans in this, the
      third decade of our troubled new century. I could not help noticing a couple of
      things in the news as Mamdani’s victory sank in. One, there has been a spate of
      worry recently as various studies have come out indicating a radical shift in
      public opinion about Israel, Palestinians, and the former’s campaign of terror
      against the latter in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Gallup and the Pew Research
      Center each weighed in this past spring to show roughly similar results—this shift
      most marked among Democrats. Peter Beinart, who, among much else, opinionates
      at The New York Times, put it succinctly in a July 6 commentary . A dozen years
      ago Democrats polled by the Gallup Organization favored Israel over the Palestinians
      by a margin of 36 percentage points. “This February,” he writes, “Gallup found
      that Democrats sympathized with Palestinians over Israel by a margin of 36 percentage
      points.” How’s that for symmetry? The headline atop Beinart’s column was, “Democrats
      Need to Understand That Opinions on Israel Are Changing Fast.” I thought Beinart’s
      commentary was O.K. so far as it went, but his headline writer seemed to me far
      off the mark. Of course mainstream Democrats understand that opinions on Israel
      are changing fast. It is impossible to imagine otherwise. At issue here—and I
      detect what concerns Beinart subliminally—is that Democrats understand very well
      that opinions on Israel are changing fast and are utterly indifferent to this
      marked change in sentiment. Two, just as I was putting these events side-by-side
      in my mind—the opinion polls on Israel, Mamdani’s brilliant rise to political
      prominence and the instantly frenetic response among various elites, The Grayzone
      published a six-minute segment concerning the annual retreat of the great and
      good that Allen & Co., a long-influential merchant bank that keeps well out of
      the public eye, has run for many years. Here is Max Blumenthal, The Grayzone’s
      editor, on the occasion. The segment was published Tuesday, July 15: Chuck Schumer,
      the Democratic minority leader [in the Senate] is heading for Sun Valley, Idaho,
      this week to meet with Hollywood elites and Big Tech elites in a semi-secret,
      off-the-record retreat.… and they’re basically all conspiring to determine who
      will be the next Democratic… I wouldn’t say “conspiring,” but they’re discussing,
      one of the agenda items, is who the Democrats will put forward as their next candidate….
      This is how it works. I don’t see anything wrong with “conspiring,” myself. And
      in this brief clip Blumenthal has certainly captured “how it works.” They are
      demonstrating how it works in New York as we speak. Bill Ackman, the billionaire
      hedge-fund manager, promises hundreds of millions of dollars to support Eric Adams,
      New York’s current mayor, as the man to take down Mamdani. Adams, of course, faced
      federal corruption charges until President Trump ordered the case thrown out.
      My question is how long this kind of anti-democratic ugliness can remain how it
      works. Voters in New York, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a margin of
      six to one, have just told their party they favor a candidate who promises imaginative
      change. They have announced, to step back a short distance, that they want America
      to be something new, another kind of America. But there is no reply from the party’s
      upper reaches. You would think these elites would listen and learn at this point,
      but they show no inclination to do either. They continue to cast Mamdani as some
      kind of anti–Israel radical — lots of Islamophobia going around since he won the
      primary — but his position on the genocide in Gaza is in line with those polling
      numbers and appears to have contributed to his support even among New York Jews.
      What we are looking at, to stay in the context Mamdani affords us, is Sun Valley
      vs. Queensbridge, the working– and middle-class district Mamdani represents. This
      is the unholy symmetry of American politics in this, the third decade of our new
      century. I do not suggest this is any kind of new opposition. Neither is the mainstream
      Democrats’ effort to sink Mamdani’s ship anything we haven’t seen before. They
      did it to Bernie Sanders — twice, indeed, in 2016 and again in 2020 — and, with
      the assistance of the Israeli lobbies, they did it to Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush,
      legislators from New York and Missouri respectively, when monied interests and
      the lobbies destroyed them in primary contests last year. But Mamdani is a case
      of another order, in my interpretation. He is too exciting to too many voters,
      in a word. His ideas resonate too well beyond New York’s five boroughs. He stands—in
      his early thirties as against his early eighties—too effectively for another idea
      of America. The gang-up against him is too easily legible. This puts the party’s
      elites and all the interests behind them in a bind. They cannot afford to allow
      Mamdani to take City Hall in New York, and I conclude with the greatest reluctance
      they won’t. A win for Mamdani in November would change the complexion of American
      politics too drastically. At the same time, given the national attention his campaign
      has attracted, Mamdani has more or less instantly acquired a totemic significance
      in American political culture. Stopping him this autumn would almost certainly
      be an undemocratic mess. To the extent the Democrats succeed in destroying this
      man, they will also destroy themselves. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

    one_sentence_summary: Zohran Mamdani's candidacy for New York City mayor is generating
      intense excitement and fear, suggesting a politically charged and potentially
      transformative campaign season ahead.
    paragraph_summary: Zohran Mamdani has emerged as a significant figure in New York
      City's political landscape after winning the Democratic nomination for mayor,
      surprising many, including the Democratic establishment that had backed former
      governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state legislator, garnered 56% of
      the primary vote with the support of over 50,000 volunteers, marking a pivotal
      moment in the upcoming election set for November 4. His campaign is characterized
      by ambitious policy proposals aimed at addressing pressing issues such as transportation,
      housing, and economic inequality, positioning him as a transformative candidate
      in a highly charged political environment. As the election approaches, the campaign
      is expected to be intense and contentious, reflecting the deep divisions within
      the city's political sphere.

      wowed New York City and the rest of the country when, on July 1, he trounced the
      Democratic field to win the party’s nomination to run for mayor this autumn. The
      Democratic establishment, which had put its money on Andrew Cuomo (literally and
      figuratively), was stunned. Cuomo, a machine pol who resigned as governor of New
      York four years ago amid accusations of sexual harassment, was considered a shoo-in
      and, reflecting this, ran a campaign we can kindly describe as complacent. Then
      came the blow: Mamdani, with more than 50,000 volunteers campaigning for him,
      took 56% of the vote in the Democratic primary, to Cuomo’s 44%. Figures don’t
      always lie and liars don’t always figure. Mamdani is a true phenom, an energetic
      33–year-old full of policy proposals that address the real problems of real people.
      A free bus system, a freeze on rents in half the city’s apartments, supermarkets
      run by the city, a properly redistributive tax regime to address the near to obscene
      inequality New Yorkers endure: These are good ideas, ideas with obvious appeal
      to Democratic voters, ideas expressive of his commitment to dynamic change. Mamdani,
      I have to add right off, also takes a principled position against the Israelis’
      shocking barbarities in Gaza and then America’s support of them. But one’s strengths
      are at times also one’s vulnerabilities, as Mamdani is about to discover. On Monday,
      July 14, Cuomo announced in a brief video that, rather than step aside after his
      punishing defeat, he will stay in the race as an independent with the all-but-stated
      intent of preventing New York from falling “in the hands of the far left,” as
      The New York Times idiotically put it in a piece reviewing Cuomo’s renewed campaign
      . Cuomo, whose term as governor reeked of opportunism and corruptibility if not
      proven corruption, is now the unseemly front end of an attack on Mamdani that
      is unlikely to relent until this race is decided. Wall Street and the banks, hedge-fund
      billionaires, major corporations, New York real estate developers, the Israel
      lobby, corporate media, the Democratic mainstream: These are all lining up to
      make sure Zohran Mamdani does not win come Nov. 4. He’s a Marxist, a socialist,
      a Communist, a lunatic, of course an anti–Semite. Zionist extremists and their
      sympathizers charge that Mamdani, a Muslim, will impose Shariah law on New York
      City. President Trump has wondered aloud whether he should have Mamdani arrested,
      or whether he, Mamdani, should be stripped of his citizenship . Financial and
      corporate interests spent $22 million on Cuomo’s failed primary campaign. There
      is every indication they will spend more this time. Let us, then, view this in
      the large: The battle has been joined between Democratic Party elites and the
      voters they are increasingly committed to suppressing, between money and democratic
      process, between power and the forces for change that gather as we speak not only
      in New York but across the country. We have been here before, of course. But the
      risk that the Democrats will destroy themselves as they attempt to destroy Zohran
      Mamdani is in my estimation greater than ever. ■ Here is Mamdani on “Meet the
      Press” Sunday, July 1, just after his victory: We can beat anyone that’s in this
      race because what we’ve shown is that this is a campaign that has the support
      of more than 400,000 New Yorkers. For too long, politicians have pretended to
      simply be bystanders to a cost-of-living crisis. They’ve actually exacerbated
      it. And our vision is one that will respond to it and make this a city affordable
      for every New Yorker. And Mamdani when asked about the Gaza crisis in an interview
      with Politico during his campaign in April: I think what is incumbent to do is
      to stop subsidizing a genocide. And that’s what we’ve seen over more than a year.
      And it’s what we’ve seen intensify right now with Donald Trump. And it is hard
      for me to explain to my constituents, who live in the largest public housing development
      in North America, in Queensbridge, why they have to live in substandard conditions
      because the government refuses to fund public housing, all while we continue to
      find billions of dollars to drop bombs that kill tens of thousands of Palestinians
      over more than a year now. And the sheer number of children that have been killed
      does not even capture the level of trauma for those that have survived. And that
      is a responsibility for us to speak up against, as the people who are financing
      it. It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s… it’s a political candidate who says what
      he means and what he means reflects the realities facing Americans in this, the
      third decade of our troubled new century. I could not help noticing a couple of
      things in the news as Mamdani’s victory sank in. One, there has been a spate of
      worry recently as various studies have come out indicating a radical shift in
      public opinion about Israel, Palestinians, and the former’s campaign of terror
      against the latter in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Gallup and the Pew Research
      Center each weighed in this past spring to show roughly similar results—this shift
      most marked among Democrats. Peter Beinart, who, among much else, opinionates
      at The New York Times, put it succinctly in a July 6 commentary . A dozen years
      ago Democrats polled by the Gallup Organization favored Israel over the Palestinians
      by a margin of 36 percentage points. “This February,” he writes, “Gallup found
      that Democrats sympathized with Palestinians over Israel by a margin of 36 percentage
      points.” How’s that for symmetry? The headline atop Beinart’s column was, “Democrats
      Need to Understand That Opinions on Israel Are Changing Fast.” I thought Beinart’s
      commentary was O.K. so far as it went, but his headline writer seemed to me far
      off the mark. Of course mainstream Democrats understand that opinions on Israel
      are changing fast. It is impossible to imagine otherwise. At issue here—and I
      detect what concerns Beinart subliminally—is that Democrats understand very well
      that opinions on Israel are changing fast and are utterly indifferent to this
      marked change in sentiment. Two, just as I was putting these events side-by-side
      in my mind—the opinion polls on Israel, Mamdani’s brilliant rise to political
      prominence and the instantly frenetic response among various elites, The Grayzone
      published a six-minute segment concerning the annual retreat of the great and
      good that Allen & Co., a long-influential merchant bank that keeps well out of
      the public eye, has run for many years. Here is Max Blumenthal, The Grayzone’s
      editor, on the occasion. The segment was published Tuesday, July 15: Chuck Schumer,
      the Democratic minority leader [in the Senate] is heading for Sun Valley, Idaho,
      this week to meet with Hollywood elites and Big Tech elites in a semi-secret,
      off-the-record retreat.… and they’re basically all conspiring to determine who
      will be the next Democratic… I wouldn’t say “conspiring,” but they’re discussing,
      one of the agenda items, is who the Democrats will put forward as their next candidate….
      This is how it works. I don’t see anything wrong with “conspiring,” myself. And
      in this brief clip Blumenthal has certainly captured “how it works.” They are
      demonstrating how it works in New York as we speak. Bill Ackman, the billionaire
      hedge-fund manager, promises hundreds of millions of dollars to support Eric Adams,
      New York’s current mayor, as the man to take down Mamdani. Adams, of course, faced
      federal corruption charges until President Trump ordered the case thrown out.
      My question is how long this kind of anti-democratic ugliness can remain how it
      works. Voters in New York, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a margin of
      six to one, have just told their party they favor a candidate who promises imaginative
      change. They have announced, to step back a short distance, that they want America
      to be something new, another kind of America. But there is no reply from the party’s
      upper reaches. You would think these elites would listen and learn at this point,
      but they show no inclination to do either. They continue to cast Mamdani as some
      kind of anti–Israel radical — lots of Islamophobia going around since he won the
      primary — but his position on the genocide in Gaza is in line with those polling
      numbers and appears to have contributed to his support even among New York Jews.
      What we are looking at, to stay in the context Mamdani affords us, is Sun Valley
      vs. Queensbridge, the working– and middle-class district Mamdani represents. This
      is the unholy symmetry of American politics in this, the third decade of our new
      century. I do not suggest this is any kind of new opposition. Neither is the mainstream
      Democrats’ effort to sink Mamdani’s ship anything we haven’t seen before. They
      did it to Bernie Sanders — twice, indeed, in 2016 and again in 2020 — and, with
      the assistance of the Israeli lobbies, they did it to Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush,
      legislators from New York and Missouri respectively, when monied interests and
      the lobbies destroyed them in primary contests last year. But Mamdani is a case
      of another order, in my interpretation. He is too exciting to too many voters,
      in a word. His ideas resonate too well beyond New York’s five boroughs. He stands—in
      his early thirties as against his early eighties—too effectively for another idea
      of America. The gang-up against him is too easily legible. This puts the party’s
      elites and all the interests behind them in a bind. They cannot afford to allow
      Mamdani to take City Hall in New York, and I conclude with the greatest reluctance
      they won’t. A win for Mamdani in November would change the complexion of American
      politics too drastically. At the same time, given the national attention his campaign
      has attracted, Mamdani has more or less instantly acquired a totemic significance
      in American political culture. Stopping him this autumn would almost certainly
      be an undemocratic mess. To the extent the Democrats succeed in destroying this
      man, they will also destroy themselves. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

    one_sentence_summary: Zohran Mamdani's candidacy for New York City mayor is generating
      intense excitement and fear, suggesting a politically charged and potentially
      transformative campaign season ahead.
    paragraph_summary: Zohran Mamdani has emerged as a significant figure in New York
      City's political landscape after winning the Democratic nomination for mayor,
      surprising many, including the Democratic establishment that had backed former
      governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state legislator, garnered 56% of
      the primary vote with the support of over 50,000 volunteers, marking a pivotal
      moment in the upcoming election set for November 4. His campaign is characterized
      by ambitious policy proposals aimed at addressing pressing issues such as transportation,
      housing, and economic inequality, positioning him as a transformative candidate
      in a highly charged political environment. As the election approaches, the campaign
      is expected to be intense and contentious, reflecting the deep divisions within
      the city's political sphere.

      was revolutionary in its fight to free Europe’s economies and parliaments from
      the hereditary privileges and vested interests that survived from feudalism. To
      make their manufactures competitive in world markets, industrialists needed to
      end the land rent paid to Europe’s landed aristocracies, the economic rents extracted
      by trade monopolies, and interest paid to bankers who played no role in financing
      industry. These rentier incomes add to the economy’s price structure, raising
      the living wage and other business expenses, thus eating into profits. The 20
      th century saw the classical aim of clearing away these economic rents rolled
      back in Europe, the United States, and other Western countries. However, today,
      land and natural-resource rents in private hands are still rising and even receiving
      special tax advantages. Basic infrastructure and other natural monopolies are
      being privatized by the financial sector — which is largely responsible for carving
      up and de-industrializing economies on behalf of its real estate and monopoly
      customers, who pay out most of their rental income as interest to bankers and
      bondholders. What has survived from the policies by which Europe’s industrial
      powers and the United States built up their own manufacturing is free trade. Britain
      implemented free trade after a 30-year fight on behalf of its industry against
      the landed aristocracy, aimed at ending the protectionist agricultural tariffs,
      the Corn Laws, which had been enacted in 1815 to prevent opening the home market
      to low-priced food imports, which would have reduced farming rents. After repealing
      these laws in 1846 to lower the cost of living, Britain offered free-trade agreements
      to countries seeking access to its market in exchange for these countries not
      protecting their industry against British exports. The aim was to deter less industrialized
      countries from working up their own raw materials. In such countries, Europe’s
      foreign investors sought to buy rent-yielding natural resources headed by mineral
      and land rights, and basic infrastructure headed by railroads and canals. This
      created a diametric contrast between rent-avoidance in the industrial nations
      and rent-seeking in their colonies and other host countries, while European bankers
      used debt leverage to gain fiscal control of former colonies who had won independence
      in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Under pressure to pay the foreign debts that
      were run up to finance their trade deficits, development attempts, and deepening
      debt dependency, debtor countries were obliged to relinquish fiscal control of
      their economies to bondholders, banks, and creditor-nation governments, which
      pressed them to privatize their basic infrastructure monopolies. The effect was
      to prevent them from using revenue from their natural endowments to develop a
      broad economic base for prosperous development. Just as Britain, France, and Germany
      aimed to free their economies from feudalism’s legacy of the vested interests
      with rent extraction privileges, most of today’s Global Majority countries need
      to free themselves from the rent and debt overhead inherited from European colonialism
      and creditor control. By the 1950s these countries were being called “less developed”
      or, even more patronizingly, “developing.” But the combination of foreign debt
      and free trade has blocked them from developing along the balanced public/private
      lines that Western Europe and the United States followed. The tax policy and other
      legislation of these countries has been shaped by U.S. and European pressure to
      observe international trade and investment rules that perpetuate geopolitical
      domination by Western bankers and rent-extracting investors to control their national
      patrimony. The euphemism “host economy” is appropriate for these countries, because
      the Western economic penetration of them resembles a biological parasite feeding
      off its host. Seeking to maintain this relationship, the U.S. and European governments
      are blocking attempts by these countries to follow the path that Europe’s industrial
      nations and the United States took for their own economies with their 19 th -century
      political and fiscal reforms that empowered their own takeoff. Without these countries
      adopting fiscal and political reforms aimed at developing their own sovereignty
      and prospects for growth on the basis of their own national patrimony of land,
      natural resources and basic infrastructure, the world economy will remain bifurcated
      between Western rentier nations and their Global Majority hosts and held subject
      to neoliberal orthodoxy. The success of China’s model poses a threat to the neoliberal
      order When U.S. political leaders single out China as an existential enemy of
      the West, it is not as a military threat but for offering a successful economic
      alternative to today’s U.S.-sponsored neoliberal world order. That order was supposed
      to represent the End of History, succeeding through its logic of free trade, government
      deregulation, and international investment free of capital controls, while detouring
      away from industrial capitalism’s anti- rentier policies. We can now see the absurdity
      in this self-satisfying evangelical view that had emerged just as Western economies
      were deindustrializing, as a result of the dynamics of their neoliberal finance
      capitalism. The vested financial and other rentier interests are rejecting not
      only China but the logic of industrial capitalism as described by its own 19 th
      -century classical economists. Western neoliberal observers have closed their
      eyes to recognizing the ways in which China’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics”
      has achieved its success by a logic similar to that of the industrial capitalism
      advocated by classical economists to minimize rentier income. Most late 19 th
      -century economic writers expected industrial capitalism to evolve into socialism
      of one form or another, as the role of public investment and regulation increased.
      Freeing economies and their governments from control by landowners and creditors
      was the common denominator of the social-democratic socialism of John Stuart Mill,
      the libertarian socialism of Henry George focusing on the land tax, and the cooperative
      mutual-aid socialism of Peter Kropotkin, as well as Marxism. Where China has gone
      further than earlier socialist mixed-economy reforms has been in keeping money
      and credit creation in the hands of government, along with basic infrastructure
      and natural resources. Fear that other governments might follow China’s lead has
      led U.S. and other Western finance-capitalist ideologues to view China as a threat
      by providing a model for economic reforms that are precisely the opposite of what
      the 20 th century’s pro- rentier , anti-government ideology fought against. The
      foreign debt overhead owed to U.S. and other Western creditors, and enabled by
      the 1945-2025 international geopolitical rules designed by U.S. diplomats at Bretton
      Woods in 1944, obliges the Global South and other countries to recover their economic
      sovereignty by freeing themselves from their foreign (mainly dollarized) banking
      and financial burden. These countries have the same land-rent problem that Europe’s
      industrial capitalism faced, but their land and resource rents are mainly owned
      by multinational companies and other foreign appropriators of their oil and mineral
      rights, forests, and latifundia plantations, who extract resource rents by emptying
      out the world’s oil and mineral resources and cutting down its forests. Taxing
      economic rent is a precondition for economic sovereignty A precondition for Global
      South countries to gain economic autonomy is to follow the advice of the classical
      economists and tax the largest sources of rental income – land rent, monopoly
      rent, and financial returns – instead of letting them be sent abroad. Taxing these
      rents would help stabilize their balance of payments, while providing their governments
      with revenue to finance their infrastructure needs and the related social spending
      needed to subsidize their economic modernization. That is how Britain, France,
      Germany and the United States established their own industrial, agricultural,
      and financial supremacy. This is not a radical socialist policy; it always has
      been a central element of industrial capitalist development. Recapturing a country’s
      land and natural-resource rents as its fiscal base would enable it to avoid taxing
      labor and industry. A country would not need to formally nationalize its land
      and natural resources outright; it simply needs to tax the economic rent over
      and above actual “earned profits,” to cite the principle of Adam Smith and his
      19 th -century successors that this rent is the natural tax base. But neoliberal
      ideology calls such taxation of rent, and the regulation of monopolies or other
      market phenomena, an intrusive interference into the “free market.” This defense
      of rentier income inverts the classical definition of a free market. The classical
      economists defined a free market as one free from economic rent, not as one free
      for the extraction of economic rent, let alone as freedom for creditor-nation
      governments to create a “rules-based order” to facilitate foreign rent extraction
      and stifle the development of financially and trade-dependent host countries.
      Debt remission is a precondition for economic sovereignty The fight by countries
      to free themselves from their foreign debt overhead is much harder than Europe’s
      19 th -century fight to end the privileges of its landed aristocracy (and less
      successfully, of its bankers), because it is international in scope, and is now
      confronted by a creditor-nation alliance to maintain the system of financial colonization
      created two centuries ago, as former colonies sought to finance their independence
      by borrowing from foreign bankers. Starting in the 1820s, newly independent countries
      like Haiti, Mexico, and other Latin America nations, as well as Greece, Tunisia,
      Egypt, and other former Ottoman colonies, won nominal political freedom from colonialist
      control. But to build up their own industry they had to take on foreign debt –
      on which they almost immediately defaulted, which enabled their creditors to establish
      monetary authorities in charge of their fiscal policy. The governments of these
      countries were turned into collection agents for international bankers by the
      late 19 th century. Financial dependency on bankers and bondholders replaced colonial
      dependency, obliging debtor countries to give fiscal priority to foreign creditors.
      World War II enabled many of these countries to accumulate substantial foreign
      monetary reserves as a result of supplying raw materials to the belligerents.
      But the post-war order designed by U.S. diplomats, based on free trade and free
      capital movements, drained these savings, and obliged the Global South and other
      countries to borrow to cover their trade deficits. The resulting foreign debts
      soon came to exceed the ability of these countries to pay – that is, to pay without
      surrendering to the destructive IMF demands for austerity that blocked the investment
      needed to raise their productivity and living standards. There was no way that
      they could meet their own development needs to invest in basic infrastructure
      and provide industrial and agricultural subsidies, public education, health care,
      and other basic social spending that is characterized by the leading industrial
      nations. This still remains the case. Their choice today, therefore, is between
      paying their foreign debts – at the cost of blocking their own development – or
      claiming that these debts are odious and insisting that they be written off. At
      issue is whether debtor countries will gain the sovereignty that is supposed to
      characterize an international economy of equals, free of foreign post-colonial
      control over their tax and trade policies, as well as their national patrimony.
      Their self-determination can only be achieved by joining together in a collective
      front. Donald Trump’s tariff aggression has catalyzed this process by drastically
      reducing the U.S. market for exports from debtor countries, preventing them from
      obtaining the dollars to pay their bonds and bank debts, so these won’t be paid
      in any event. The world is now busy de-dollarizing. The need to create an alternative
      to the U.S.-centered post-war order was expressed in 1955 at the Bandung Conference
      in Indonesia, and then later by the Non-Aligned Movement. But these countries
      lacked a critical mass of self-sufficiency among themselves to act together. Attempts
      to create a New International Economic Order in the 1960s faced the same problem.
      Countries were not industrially, agriculturally, or financially strong enough
      to “go it alone.” Today’s Western debt crisis, de-industrialization, and coercive
      weaponization of foreign trade and financial sanctions under the dollarized international
      financial system, capped by the “America First” tariff policy, have created an
      urgent need for countries to collectively seek economic sovereignty, to become
      independent from U.S. and European control of the international economy. The collective
      BRICS+, with Russia and China taking the lead, have just begun talking about making
      such an attempt. China’s success has made a global alternative attainable The
      great catalyst for countries to take control of their national development has
      been China. As indicated above, its industrial socialism has largely achieved
      the classical aim of industrial capitalism of minimizing rentier overhead, above
      all by publicly creating money to finance tangible growth. Keeping money and credit
      creation in government hands, via China’s state-owned banks, prevents financial
      and other rentier interests from taking over the economy and subjecting it to
      the financial overhead that has characterized Western economies. China’s successful
      alternative for allocating credit avoids making purely financial gains at the
      expense of tangible capital formation and living standards. That is why it is
      viewed as an existential threat to the current Western banking model. Western
      financial systems are overseen by central banks that have been made independent
      from the Treasury and government regulatory “interference.” Their role is to provide
      the commercial banking system’s liquidity as it creates interest-bearing debt,
      mainly for the purpose of making wealth financially by debt leveraging (asset-price
      inflation), not for productive capital formation. Capital gains – rising prices
      for housing and other real estate, stocks, and bonds – are much larger than GDP
      growth. They can be made easily and quickly by banks creating more credit to bid
      up prices for buyers of these assets. Instead of the financial system being industrialized,
      Western industrial corporations have become financialized, and that has occurred
      along lines that have deindustrialized the U.S. and European economies. Financialized
      wealth can be made without being part of the production process. Interest, late
      charges, other financial fees and capital gains are not a “product,” yet are counted
      as such in today’s GDP statistics. Carrying charges on the rising debt overhead
      are transfer payments to the finance sector, by labor and businesses, out of wages
      and profits earned by actual production. That shrinks the income available for
      spending on the products produced by labor and capital, leaving economies debt-ridden
      and deindustrialized. The strategy of creditor-rentier nations to prevent withdrawal
      from their global control The broadest strategy to block countries from avoiding
      the rentier burden has been to wage an ideological campaign from the educational
      system to mass media. The aim is to control the narrative in a way that depicts
      government as an oppressive Leviathan, an inherently bureaucratic autocracy. Western
      “democracy” is defined not so much politically as economically, as a free market
      whose resources are allocated by a banking and financial sector independent of
      regulatory oversight. Governments strong enough to limit financial and other rentier
      wealth in the public interest are demonized as autocracies or “planned economics”
      — as if shifting credit and resource allocation to the financial centers of Wall
      Street, London, Paris, and Japan does not result in an economy planned by the
      financial sector in its own interest, with the aim of creating monetary fortunes.
      Its aim is not to improve the overall economy and living standards. Global Majority
      officials and administrators who have studied economics at U.S. and European universities
      have been indoctrinated with a value-free (that is, rent-free) pro- rentier ideology
      to frame the way they think about how economies work. This narrative excludes
      consideration of how debt polarizes economies by growing exponentially at compound
      interest. Also excluded from mainstream economic logic is the classical contrast
      between productive and unproductive credit and investment, and the related distinction
      between earned income (wages and profits, the main components of value) and unearned
      income (economic rent). Beyond this ideological campaign, neoliberal diplomacy
      uses military force, regime change, and control of the main international bureaucracies
      associated with the United Nations, the IMF, and World Bank — and a more covert
      network of non-government organizations (NGOs) — to prevent countries from withdrawing
      from today’s pro- rentier fiscal rules and pro-creditor laws. The United States
      has taken the lead in using force and regime change against governments that would
      tax away or otherwise limit rent extraction. It should be noted that few early
      socialists (except anarchists) advocated violence in pursuit of their reforms.
      It has been the vested interests, unwilling to accept loss of the privileges that
      are the basis of their fortunes, who have not hesitated to use violence to defend
      their wealth and power against attempts at reform to check their privileges. To
      be sovereign, nations must create an alternative that enables them to be in charge
      of their own economic, monetary, and political development. But American diplomacy
      views any attempt to enact the necessary political and tax reforms and strong
      government regulatory authority as posing an existential threat to U.S. control
      over international finance and trade. This raises the question of whether it is
      possible to achieve reforms and a strong public economy without war. It is natural
      for countries to wonder whether they can achieve economic sovereignty without
      a revolution, such as the Soviet Union, China, and other countries that fought
      to end their domination by their foreign-supported landlords and creditors. The
      only way to protect economic sovereignty against military threats is to join an
      alliance for mutual support, since individual countries can be isolated in the
      way that Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran have been — or destroyed, like Libya. As Benjamin
      Franklin put matters, “If we don’t hang together, we will hang separately.” American
      writers characterize the attempt of other countries to join together to achieve
      economic sovereignty as a civilizational war. While this is indeed a civilizational
      contest, it is the United States and its allies that are waging aggression, against
      countries trying to withdraw from a system that has provided the United States
      and Europe with a huge inflow of economic rents and debt service from host countries
      subject to U.S.-backed diplomacy. How U.S.-centered financial colonialism replaced
      European colonial occupation After World War II, the era of settler-state colonialism
      gave way to financial colonialism, with the international economy dollarized under
      U.S. leadership. The Bretton Woods rules established by 1945 enabled multinational
      corporations to keep economic rents for land, natural resources and public infrastructure
      out of domestic fiscal reach. Governments were reduced to the role of acting as
      collection agents for foreign creditors and as protectors of foreign investors
      from democratic attempts to tax rentier wealth. The United States was able to
      weaponize world trade by monopolizing oil exports through U.S. and allied oil
      companies (the Seven Sisters), while U.S. and European agricultural protectionism
      and World Bank “aid” policy steered food-deficit countries to focus on tropical
      plantation crops instead of grain to feed themselves. President Bill Clinton’s
      1994 NAFTA free-trade agreement swamped Mexico’s market with low-priced U.S. farm
      exports (highly subsidized by strong government support). Mexican grain production
      plummeted, leaving it food-dependent. To block governments from taxing or even
      fining foreign investors to recover compensation for damages to their countries,
      today’s rentier powers have created Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) courts
      requiring governments to compensate foreign investors for increasing taxes or
      imposing regulations that reduce foreign-owned income. (I provide the details
      of this in Chapter 7 of my 2022 book The Destiny of Civilization .) This system
      blocks national sovereignty, including by preventing host countries from taxing
      the economic rent of their land and natural resources owned by foreigners. The
      effect is to make these resources part of the investor-nation economy, not their
      own. (The Saudi oil company Aramco, for instance, was not a corporately distinct
      corporate affiliate but a branch of Standard Oil of New York (ESSO). This legal
      nicety meant that its income and expenses were consolidated into the parent company’s
      U.S. balance sheet. That enabled it to receive a tax credit for the “depletion
      allowance” for oil, rendering the company effectively free of U.S. income tax,
      although it was Saudi oil that was being depleted.) Other nations permitted the
      United States to dictate the post-World War II order, with it promising generous
      aid to support free trade, peace, and post-colonial national sovereignty, as spelled
      out in the United Nations Charter. But the United States squandered its wealth
      on military spending abroad and financial wealth addiction at home. That has left
      America’s post-industrial power based mainly on its ability to harm other countries
      with chaos if they do not accept the U.S. “rules-based order” designed to extract
      tribute from them. The U.S. imposes protectionist tariffs and import quotas at
      will, and subsidizes agriculture and key technologies as potential global high-tech
      monopolies, while forbidding other countries from implementing such “socialist”
      or “autocratic” policies to become more competitive. The result is a double standard
      in which the U.S. “rules-based order” (its own rules) replaces adherence to international
      law. U.S. agricultural price support policy initiated under Franklin D. Roosevelt
      in the 1930s provides a good example of double standards. It made farming the
      most heavily subsidized and protected sector. It became the model for the European
      Economic Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced in 1962. However,
      U.S. diplomacy opposes the attempts of other countries, especially Global South
      countries, to impose their own protectionist subsidies and import quotas aimed
      at achieving self-sufficiency in basic food production — while U.S. “aid lending”
      and the World Bank have (as indicated above) supported the exportation of tropical
      plantation crops by Global South countries by lending for transportation and port
      development. U.S. policy has consistently opposed family-owned farming and land
      reform throughout Latin America and other Global South countries, often with violence.
      Moves toward a multipolar world order It is not surprising that, inasmuch as Russia
      has long been the United States’ main military adversary, it has taken the lead
      in protesting against the unipolar U.S. order. Advocating a multipolar alternative
      to the U.S. neoliberal order in June 2025, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
      described the post-colonial economic subjugation of the countries that achieved
      political independence from colonialist rule in the 19 th and 20 th centuries
      but which are now facing the next task needed to complete their liberation: Our
      African friends are paying more and more attention to the fact that their entire
      economies are still largely based on siphoning off natural resources from these
      countries. In fact, all value added is produced and pocketed by the former Western
      metropoles and other European Union and NATO members. … The West is using illegal
      unilateral sanctions, which increasingly become the harbinger of a military attack,
      as this has happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and is now happening in Iran,
      as well as the instruments of unfair competition, initiating tariff wars, seizing
      other countries’ sovereign assets and taking advantage of the role of their currencies
      and payment systems. The West itself has actually buried the globalization model,
      which it developed after the Cold War to promote its interests. Marco Rubio made
      the same point in the U.S. Senate hearings to confirm him as Donald Trump’s Secretary
      of State, explaining that the “postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is
      now a weapon being used against us.” Violating the rules of foreign trade and
      investment that the United States itself dictated in 1945, and yet another instance
      of Washington resorting to the “rules-based order” of its own rules, President
      Trump’s unilateral tariffs aimed both at shifting the New Cold War’s military
      costs onto other countries, which are expected to buy American arms and provide
      proxy armies, and at reviving the U.S.’s lost industrial power by forcing countries
      to relocate industries to the United States and to permit U.S. companies to extract
      monopoly rents by controlling the leading emerging technologies. The United States
      aims to impose monopoly rights and related rentier privileges uniquely favorable
      to itself on the entire world’s trade and investment. Trump’s “America First”
      diplomacy demands that other countries conduct their trade, payments and debt
      relationships in U.S. dollars, instead of their own currencies. The U.S. “rule
      of law” is one that permits unilateral U.S. demands to impose trade and financial
      sanctions dictating how and with whom foreign countries can trade and invest.
      They are threatened with economic chaos and confiscation of their dollar reserves
      if they do not boycott trade and investment relations with Russia, China, and
      other countries refusing to submit to U.S. control. The United States’ leverage
      to obtain these foreign concessions is no longer industrial leadership and financial
      strength, but its ability to cause chaos for other countries. Claiming to be the
      indispensable nation, the U.S.’s ability to disrupt trade is ending its former
      international monetary and diplomatic power. That power originally was based on
      U.S. holdings of the world’s largest monetary gold reserves in 1945, its status
      as the largest creditor nation and industrial economy, and, after 1971, its dollar
      hegemony, arising in large part as a result of its financial market being the
      safest for other nations to hold their official monetary reserves. The diplomatic
      inertia created by these former advantages no longer reflects the realities of
      2025. What U.S. officials do have is the ability to disrupt the world’s trade,
      supply chains, and financial arrangements, including the SWIFT system for international
      payments. The U.S. and European confiscation of $300 billion of Russia’s monetary
      deposits has darkened America’s reputation for financial safety, while its chronic
      trade and balance-of-payments deficits threaten to disrupt the international monetary
      system and free trade that made it the major beneficiary of the 1945-2025 world
      order. In keeping with the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference
      in other countries’ internal affairs that underlay the creation of the United
      Nations (the basic principle of international law grounded in the 1648 Peace of
      Westphalia), Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov described (in his speech cited above)
      the need “to establish foreign trade mechanisms [that] the West will be unable
      to control, such as transport corridors, alternative payment systems and supply
      chains.” As an example of how the United States had paralyzed the World Trade
      Organization, which it had created on the basis of free trade at a time when America
      was the world’s leading export power, he explained: When the Americans realized
      that the globalized system they had created – one built on fair competition, inviolable
      property rights, the presumption of innocence, and similar principles, and which
      had allowed them to dominate for decades – had also begun benefiting their rivals,
      primarily China, they took drastic action. As China started outplaying them on
      their own turf and by their own rules, Washington simply blocked the WTO’s Appellate
      Body. By artificially stripping it of a quorum, they rendered this key dispute
      settlement mechanism inactive – and it remains so to this day. The United States
      has been able to block foreign opposition to its nationalist policies by having
      veto power in the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank. Even without such power,
      U.S. diplomats have been able to block United Nations organizations from acting
      independently of U.S. wishes by refusing to appoint leaders or judges not primarily
      loyal to U.S. foreign policy. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), charged
      with keeping nuclear proliferation in check is the most recent notorious case
      in point. Iran published documents showing that the agency’s leader Rafael Grossi
      provided U.S. and Israeli intelligence with the names of Iranian scientists who
      were killed, and details of the Iranian nuclear refinement sites that were bombed.
      The U.S. veto has prevented the UN Security Council from condemning Israeli attacks
      on the Palestinian population. And when the International Criminal Court (ICC)
      brought charges against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for committing
      war crimes and crimes against humanity in a genocide against the Palestinians,
      U.S. officials imposed sanctions on the ICC and demanded the removal of the prosecutor.
      The world no longer is to be governed by international law, but by unilateral
      U.S. rules, subject to abrupt change depending on the vicissitudes of American
      economic or military power (or loss thereof). As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin
      described this new state of affairs in 2022, “Western countries have been saying
      for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations,” yet the
      “unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and unfree; it is false and hypocritical
      through and through.” The United States’ self-image depicts its long dominant
      world position as reflecting its democracy, free market, and equality of opportunity
      that has enabled its power elite, in their view, to acquire their status by being
      the economy’s most productive members, through their management and allocation
      of savings and credit. The reality is that the United States has become a rentier
      oligarchy, one that is increasingly hereditary. Its members’ fortunes are made
      mainly by acquiring rent-yielding assets (land, natural resources, and monopolies)
      on which they make capital gains, while paying most of their rent as interest
      to their bankers, who end up with much of these rents and have become the new
      oligarchy’s leading managerial class. Summary The real conflict over what kind
      of economic and political system the Global Majority will have is just gaining
      momentum. Global South countries and others have been driven so deeply into debt
      that they have been obliged to sell off their public infrastructure to pay its
      carrying charges. Recovering control of their natural resources and basic infrastructure
      requires the fiscal right to impose an economic-rent tax on their land, natural
      resources and monopolies, as well as the legal right to recover environmental
      cleanup costs caused by foreign oil and mining firms, and to implement financial
      cleanup costs ( i.e ., write offs and cancellation) of the foreign debt burden
      imposed by creditors who have not taken responsibility to ensure that their loans
      can be paid under existing conditions. U.S. evangelistic rhetoric describes the
      imminent political and economic fracture of the world economy as a “Clash of Civilizations”
      between democracies (i.e., countries that support U.S. policy) and autocracies
      (i.e., nations acting independently). It would be more accurate to describe this
      fracture as a fight by the United States and its European and other Western allies
      against civilization — assuming civilization entails, as it seems it must, the
      sovereign right of countries to enact their own laws and tax systems for the benefit
      of their own populations within an international system that has a common set
      of basic rules and values. What Western ideologues call democracy and free markets
      has turned out to be an aggressive rentier -financial imperialism. And what they
      call autocracy is a government strong enough to prevent economic polarization
      between a super-rich rentier class and an impoverished population at large, such
      as is occurring within the Western oligarchies themselves. Editor’s Note : A t

    paragraph_summary: During the 17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6, 2025,
      the Prime Minister addressed a session focused on Peace and Security and the Reform
      of Global Governance, emphasizing the need for a collaborative approach to tackle
      pressing global issues. The discussion highlighted the historical context of industrial
      capitalism, which aimed to liberate economies from feudal privileges and vested
      interests, particularly targeting the economic rents associated with land, trade
      monopolies, and banking. Despite past progress, the article notes that contemporary
      economies still grapple with rising land and resource rents, exacerbated by privatization
      trends driven by the financial sector. This situation undermines the manufacturing
      base established by earlier industrial policies, as free trade continues to dominate
      economic strategies, often at the expense of equitable growth and stability.

      was revolutionary in its fight to free Europe’s economies and parliaments from
      the hereditary privileges and vested interests that survived from feudalism. To
      make their manufactures competitive in world markets, industrialists needed to
      end the land rent paid to Europe’s landed aristocracies, the economic rents extracted
      by trade monopolies, and interest paid to bankers who played no role in financing
      industry. These rentier incomes add to the economy’s price structure, raising
      the living wage and other business expenses, thus eating into profits. The 20
      th century saw the classical aim of clearing away these economic rents rolled
      back in Europe, the United States, and other Western countries. However, today,
      land and natural-resource rents in private hands are still rising and even receiving
      special tax advantages. Basic infrastructure and other natural monopolies are
      being privatized by the financial sector — which is largely responsible for carving
      up and de-industrializing economies on behalf of its real estate and monopoly
      customers, who pay out most of their rental income as interest to bankers and
      bondholders. What has survived from the policies by which Europe’s industrial
      powers and the United States built up their own manufacturing is free trade. Britain
      implemented free trade after a 30-year fight on behalf of its industry against
      the landed aristocracy, aimed at ending the protectionist agricultural tariffs,
      the Corn Laws, which had been enacted in 1815 to prevent opening the home market
      to low-priced food imports, which would have reduced farming rents. After repealing
      these laws in 1846 to lower the cost of living, Britain offered free-trade agreements
      to countries seeking access to its market in exchange for these countries not
      protecting their industry against British exports. The aim was to deter less industrialized
      countries from working up their own raw materials. In such countries, Europe’s
      foreign investors sought to buy rent-yielding natural resources headed by mineral
      and land rights, and basic infrastructure headed by railroads and canals. This
      created a diametric contrast between rent-avoidance in the industrial nations
      and rent-seeking in their colonies and other host countries, while European bankers
      used debt leverage to gain fiscal control of former colonies who had won independence
      in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Under pressure to pay the foreign debts that
      were run up to finance their trade deficits, development attempts, and deepening
      debt dependency, debtor countries were obliged to relinquish fiscal control of
      their economies to bondholders, banks, and creditor-nation governments, which
      pressed them to privatize their basic infrastructure monopolies. The effect was
      to prevent them from using revenue from their natural endowments to develop a
      broad economic base for prosperous development. Just as Britain, France, and Germany
      aimed to free their economies from feudalism’s legacy of the vested interests
      with rent extraction privileges, most of today’s Global Majority countries need
      to free themselves from the rent and debt overhead inherited from European colonialism
      and creditor control. By the 1950s these countries were being called “less developed”
      or, even more patronizingly, “developing.” But the combination of foreign debt
      and free trade has blocked them from developing along the balanced public/private
      lines that Western Europe and the United States followed. The tax policy and other
      legislation of these countries has been shaped by U.S. and European pressure to
      observe international trade and investment rules that perpetuate geopolitical
      domination by Western bankers and rent-extracting investors to control their national
      patrimony. The euphemism “host economy” is appropriate for these countries, because
      the Western economic penetration of them resembles a biological parasite feeding
      off its host. Seeking to maintain this relationship, the U.S. and European governments
      are blocking attempts by these countries to follow the path that Europe’s industrial
      nations and the United States took for their own economies with their 19 th -century
      political and fiscal reforms that empowered their own takeoff. Without these countries
      adopting fiscal and political reforms aimed at developing their own sovereignty
      and prospects for growth on the basis of their own national patrimony of land,
      natural resources and basic infrastructure, the world economy will remain bifurcated
      between Western rentier nations and their Global Majority hosts and held subject
      to neoliberal orthodoxy. The success of China’s model poses a threat to the neoliberal
      order When U.S. political leaders single out China as an existential enemy of
      the West, it is not as a military threat but for offering a successful economic
      alternative to today’s U.S.-sponsored neoliberal world order. That order was supposed
      to represent the End of History, succeeding through its logic of free trade, government
      deregulation, and international investment free of capital controls, while detouring
      away from industrial capitalism’s anti- rentier policies. We can now see the absurdity
      in this self-satisfying evangelical view that had emerged just as Western economies
      were deindustrializing, as a result of the dynamics of their neoliberal finance
      capitalism. The vested financial and other rentier interests are rejecting not
      only China but the logic of industrial capitalism as described by its own 19 th
      -century classical economists. Western neoliberal observers have closed their
      eyes to recognizing the ways in which China’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics”
      has achieved its success by a logic similar to that of the industrial capitalism
      advocated by classical economists to minimize rentier income. Most late 19 th
      -century economic writers expected industrial capitalism to evolve into socialism
      of one form or another, as the role of public investment and regulation increased.
      Freeing economies and their governments from control by landowners and creditors
      was the common denominator of the social-democratic socialism of John Stuart Mill,
      the libertarian socialism of Henry George focusing on the land tax, and the cooperative
      mutual-aid socialism of Peter Kropotkin, as well as Marxism. Where China has gone
      further than earlier socialist mixed-economy reforms has been in keeping money
      and credit creation in the hands of government, along with basic infrastructure
      and natural resources. Fear that other governments might follow China’s lead has
      led U.S. and other Western finance-capitalist ideologues to view China as a threat
      by providing a model for economic reforms that are precisely the opposite of what
      the 20 th century’s pro- rentier , anti-government ideology fought against. The
      foreign debt overhead owed to U.S. and other Western creditors, and enabled by
      the 1945-2025 international geopolitical rules designed by U.S. diplomats at Bretton
      Woods in 1944, obliges the Global South and other countries to recover their economic
      sovereignty by freeing themselves from their foreign (mainly dollarized) banking
      and financial burden. These countries have the same land-rent problem that Europe’s
      industrial capitalism faced, but their land and resource rents are mainly owned
      by multinational companies and other foreign appropriators of their oil and mineral
      rights, forests, and latifundia plantations, who extract resource rents by emptying
      out the world’s oil and mineral resources and cutting down its forests. Taxing
      economic rent is a precondition for economic sovereignty A precondition for Global
      South countries to gain economic autonomy is to follow the advice of the classical
      economists and tax the largest sources of rental income – land rent, monopoly
      rent, and financial returns – instead of letting them be sent abroad. Taxing these
      rents would help stabilize their balance of payments, while providing their governments
      with revenue to finance their infrastructure needs and the related social spending
      needed to subsidize their economic modernization. That is how Britain, France,
      Germany and the United States established their own industrial, agricultural,
      and financial supremacy. This is not a radical socialist policy; it always has
      been a central element of industrial capitalist development. Recapturing a country’s
      land and natural-resource rents as its fiscal base would enable it to avoid taxing
      labor and industry. A country would not need to formally nationalize its land
      and natural resources outright; it simply needs to tax the economic rent over
      and above actual “earned profits,” to cite the principle of Adam Smith and his
      19 th -century successors that this rent is the natural tax base. But neoliberal
      ideology calls such taxation of rent, and the regulation of monopolies or other
      market phenomena, an intrusive interference into the “free market.” This defense
      of rentier income inverts the classical definition of a free market. The classical
      economists defined a free market as one free from economic rent, not as one free
      for the extraction of economic rent, let alone as freedom for creditor-nation
      governments to create a “rules-based order” to facilitate foreign rent extraction
      and stifle the development of financially and trade-dependent host countries.
      Debt remission is a precondition for economic sovereignty The fight by countries
      to free themselves from their foreign debt overhead is much harder than Europe’s
      19 th -century fight to end the privileges of its landed aristocracy (and less
      successfully, of its bankers), because it is international in scope, and is now
      confronted by a creditor-nation alliance to maintain the system of financial colonization
      created two centuries ago, as former colonies sought to finance their independence
      by borrowing from foreign bankers. Starting in the 1820s, newly independent countries
      like Haiti, Mexico, and other Latin America nations, as well as Greece, Tunisia,
      Egypt, and other former Ottoman colonies, won nominal political freedom from colonialist
      control. But to build up their own industry they had to take on foreign debt –
      on which they almost immediately defaulted, which enabled their creditors to establish
      monetary authorities in charge of their fiscal policy. The governments of these
      countries were turned into collection agents for international bankers by the
      late 19 th century. Financial dependency on bankers and bondholders replaced colonial
      dependency, obliging debtor countries to give fiscal priority to foreign creditors.
      World War II enabled many of these countries to accumulate substantial foreign
      monetary reserves as a result of supplying raw materials to the belligerents.
      But the post-war order designed by U.S. diplomats, based on free trade and free
      capital movements, drained these savings, and obliged the Global South and other
      countries to borrow to cover their trade deficits. The resulting foreign debts
      soon came to exceed the ability of these countries to pay – that is, to pay without
      surrendering to the destructive IMF demands for austerity that blocked the investment
      needed to raise their productivity and living standards. There was no way that
      they could meet their own development needs to invest in basic infrastructure
      and provide industrial and agricultural subsidies, public education, health care,
      and other basic social spending that is characterized by the leading industrial
      nations. This still remains the case. Their choice today, therefore, is between
      paying their foreign debts – at the cost of blocking their own development – or
      claiming that these debts are odious and insisting that they be written off. At
      issue is whether debtor countries will gain the sovereignty that is supposed to
      characterize an international economy of equals, free of foreign post-colonial
      control over their tax and trade policies, as well as their national patrimony.
      Their self-determination can only be achieved by joining together in a collective
      front. Donald Trump’s tariff aggression has catalyzed this process by drastically
      reducing the U.S. market for exports from debtor countries, preventing them from
      obtaining the dollars to pay their bonds and bank debts, so these won’t be paid
      in any event. The world is now busy de-dollarizing. The need to create an alternative
      to the U.S.-centered post-war order was expressed in 1955 at the Bandung Conference
      in Indonesia, and then later by the Non-Aligned Movement. But these countries
      lacked a critical mass of self-sufficiency among themselves to act together. Attempts
      to create a New International Economic Order in the 1960s faced the same problem.
      Countries were not industrially, agriculturally, or financially strong enough
      to “go it alone.” Today’s Western debt crisis, de-industrialization, and coercive
      weaponization of foreign trade and financial sanctions under the dollarized international
      financial system, capped by the “America First” tariff policy, have created an
      urgent need for countries to collectively seek economic sovereignty, to become
      independent from U.S. and European control of the international economy. The collective
      BRICS+, with Russia and China taking the lead, have just begun talking about making
      such an attempt. China’s success has made a global alternative attainable The
      great catalyst for countries to take control of their national development has
      been China. As indicated above, its industrial socialism has largely achieved
      the classical aim of industrial capitalism of minimizing rentier overhead, above
      all by publicly creating money to finance tangible growth. Keeping money and credit
      creation in government hands, via China’s state-owned banks, prevents financial
      and other rentier interests from taking over the economy and subjecting it to
      the financial overhead that has characterized Western economies. China’s successful
      alternative for allocating credit avoids making purely financial gains at the
      expense of tangible capital formation and living standards. That is why it is
      viewed as an existential threat to the current Western banking model. Western
      financial systems are overseen by central banks that have been made independent
      from the Treasury and government regulatory “interference.” Their role is to provide
      the commercial banking system’s liquidity as it creates interest-bearing debt,
      mainly for the purpose of making wealth financially by debt leveraging (asset-price
      inflation), not for productive capital formation. Capital gains – rising prices
      for housing and other real estate, stocks, and bonds – are much larger than GDP
      growth. They can be made easily and quickly by banks creating more credit to bid
      up prices for buyers of these assets. Instead of the financial system being industrialized,
      Western industrial corporations have become financialized, and that has occurred
      along lines that have deindustrialized the U.S. and European economies. Financialized
      wealth can be made without being part of the production process. Interest, late
      charges, other financial fees and capital gains are not a “product,” yet are counted
      as such in today’s GDP statistics. Carrying charges on the rising debt overhead
      are transfer payments to the finance sector, by labor and businesses, out of wages
      and profits earned by actual production. That shrinks the income available for
      spending on the products produced by labor and capital, leaving economies debt-ridden
      and deindustrialized. The strategy of creditor-rentier nations to prevent withdrawal
      from their global control The broadest strategy to block countries from avoiding
      the rentier burden has been to wage an ideological campaign from the educational
      system to mass media. The aim is to control the narrative in a way that depicts
      government as an oppressive Leviathan, an inherently bureaucratic autocracy. Western
      “democracy” is defined not so much politically as economically, as a free market
      whose resources are allocated by a banking and financial sector independent of
      regulatory oversight. Governments strong enough to limit financial and other rentier
      wealth in the public interest are demonized as autocracies or “planned economics”
      — as if shifting credit and resource allocation to the financial centers of Wall
      Street, London, Paris, and Japan does not result in an economy planned by the
      financial sector in its own interest, with the aim of creating monetary fortunes.
      Its aim is not to improve the overall economy and living standards. Global Majority
      officials and administrators who have studied economics at U.S. and European universities
      have been indoctrinated with a value-free (that is, rent-free) pro- rentier ideology
      to frame the way they think about how economies work. This narrative excludes
      consideration of how debt polarizes economies by growing exponentially at compound
      interest. Also excluded from mainstream economic logic is the classical contrast
      between productive and unproductive credit and investment, and the related distinction
      between earned income (wages and profits, the main components of value) and unearned
      income (economic rent). Beyond this ideological campaign, neoliberal diplomacy
      uses military force, regime change, and control of the main international bureaucracies
      associated with the United Nations, the IMF, and World Bank — and a more covert
      network of non-government organizations (NGOs) — to prevent countries from withdrawing
      from today’s pro- rentier fiscal rules and pro-creditor laws. The United States
      has taken the lead in using force and regime change against governments that would
      tax away or otherwise limit rent extraction. It should be noted that few early
      socialists (except anarchists) advocated violence in pursuit of their reforms.
      It has been the vested interests, unwilling to accept loss of the privileges that
      are the basis of their fortunes, who have not hesitated to use violence to defend
      their wealth and power against attempts at reform to check their privileges. To
      be sovereign, nations must create an alternative that enables them to be in charge
      of their own economic, monetary, and political development. But American diplomacy
      views any attempt to enact the necessary political and tax reforms and strong
      government regulatory authority as posing an existential threat to U.S. control
      over international finance and trade. This raises the question of whether it is
      possible to achieve reforms and a strong public economy without war. It is natural
      for countries to wonder whether they can achieve economic sovereignty without
      a revolution, such as the Soviet Union, China, and other countries that fought
      to end their domination by their foreign-supported landlords and creditors. The
      only way to protect economic sovereignty against military threats is to join an
      alliance for mutual support, since individual countries can be isolated in the
      way that Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran have been — or destroyed, like Libya. As Benjamin
      Franklin put matters, “If we don’t hang together, we will hang separately.” American
      writers characterize the attempt of other countries to join together to achieve
      economic sovereignty as a civilizational war. While this is indeed a civilizational
      contest, it is the United States and its allies that are waging aggression, against
      countries trying to withdraw from a system that has provided the United States
      and Europe with a huge inflow of economic rents and debt service from host countries
      subject to U.S.-backed diplomacy. How U.S.-centered financial colonialism replaced
      European colonial occupation After World War II, the era of settler-state colonialism
      gave way to financial colonialism, with the international economy dollarized under
      U.S. leadership. The Bretton Woods rules established by 1945 enabled multinational
      corporations to keep economic rents for land, natural resources and public infrastructure
      out of domestic fiscal reach. Governments were reduced to the role of acting as
      collection agents for foreign creditors and as protectors of foreign investors
      from democratic attempts to tax rentier wealth. The United States was able to
      weaponize world trade by monopolizing oil exports through U.S. and allied oil
      companies (the Seven Sisters), while U.S. and European agricultural protectionism
      and World Bank “aid” policy steered food-deficit countries to focus on tropical
      plantation crops instead of grain to feed themselves. President Bill Clinton’s
      1994 NAFTA free-trade agreement swamped Mexico’s market with low-priced U.S. farm
      exports (highly subsidized by strong government support). Mexican grain production
      plummeted, leaving it food-dependent. To block governments from taxing or even
      fining foreign investors to recover compensation for damages to their countries,
      today’s rentier powers have created Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) courts
      requiring governments to compensate foreign investors for increasing taxes or
      imposing regulations that reduce foreign-owned income. (I provide the details
      of this in Chapter 7 of my 2022 book The Destiny of Civilization .) This system
      blocks national sovereignty, including by preventing host countries from taxing
      the economic rent of their land and natural resources owned by foreigners. The
      effect is to make these resources part of the investor-nation economy, not their
      own. (The Saudi oil company Aramco, for instance, was not a corporately distinct
      corporate affiliate but a branch of Standard Oil of New York (ESSO). This legal
      nicety meant that its income and expenses were consolidated into the parent company’s
      U.S. balance sheet. That enabled it to receive a tax credit for the “depletion
      allowance” for oil, rendering the company effectively free of U.S. income tax,
      although it was Saudi oil that was being depleted.) Other nations permitted the
      United States to dictate the post-World War II order, with it promising generous
      aid to support free trade, peace, and post-colonial national sovereignty, as spelled
      out in the United Nations Charter. But the United States squandered its wealth
      on military spending abroad and financial wealth addiction at home. That has left
      America’s post-industrial power based mainly on its ability to harm other countries
      with chaos if they do not accept the U.S. “rules-based order” designed to extract
      tribute from them. The U.S. imposes protectionist tariffs and import quotas at
      will, and subsidizes agriculture and key technologies as potential global high-tech
      monopolies, while forbidding other countries from implementing such “socialist”
      or “autocratic” policies to become more competitive. The result is a double standard
      in which the U.S. “rules-based order” (its own rules) replaces adherence to international
      law. U.S. agricultural price support policy initiated under Franklin D. Roosevelt
      in the 1930s provides a good example of double standards. It made farming the
      most heavily subsidized and protected sector. It became the model for the European
      Economic Community’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) introduced in 1962. However,
      U.S. diplomacy opposes the attempts of other countries, especially Global South
      countries, to impose their own protectionist subsidies and import quotas aimed
      at achieving self-sufficiency in basic food production — while U.S. “aid lending”
      and the World Bank have (as indicated above) supported the exportation of tropical
      plantation crops by Global South countries by lending for transportation and port
      development. U.S. policy has consistently opposed family-owned farming and land
      reform throughout Latin America and other Global South countries, often with violence.
      Moves toward a multipolar world order It is not surprising that, inasmuch as Russia
      has long been the United States’ main military adversary, it has taken the lead
      in protesting against the unipolar U.S. order. Advocating a multipolar alternative
      to the U.S. neoliberal order in June 2025, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
      described the post-colonial economic subjugation of the countries that achieved
      political independence from colonialist rule in the 19 th and 20 th centuries
      but which are now facing the next task needed to complete their liberation: Our
      African friends are paying more and more attention to the fact that their entire
      economies are still largely based on siphoning off natural resources from these
      countries. In fact, all value added is produced and pocketed by the former Western
      metropoles and other European Union and NATO members. … The West is using illegal
      unilateral sanctions, which increasingly become the harbinger of a military attack,
      as this has happened in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and is now happening in Iran,
      as well as the instruments of unfair competition, initiating tariff wars, seizing
      other countries’ sovereign assets and taking advantage of the role of their currencies
      and payment systems. The West itself has actually buried the globalization model,
      which it developed after the Cold War to promote its interests. Marco Rubio made
      the same point in the U.S. Senate hearings to confirm him as Donald Trump’s Secretary
      of State, explaining that the “postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is
      now a weapon being used against us.” Violating the rules of foreign trade and
      investment that the United States itself dictated in 1945, and yet another instance
      of Washington resorting to the “rules-based order” of its own rules, President
      Trump’s unilateral tariffs aimed both at shifting the New Cold War’s military
      costs onto other countries, which are expected to buy American arms and provide
      proxy armies, and at reviving the U.S.’s lost industrial power by forcing countries
      to relocate industries to the United States and to permit U.S. companies to extract
      monopoly rents by controlling the leading emerging technologies. The United States
      aims to impose monopoly rights and related rentier privileges uniquely favorable
      to itself on the entire world’s trade and investment. Trump’s “America First”
      diplomacy demands that other countries conduct their trade, payments and debt
      relationships in U.S. dollars, instead of their own currencies. The U.S. “rule
      of law” is one that permits unilateral U.S. demands to impose trade and financial
      sanctions dictating how and with whom foreign countries can trade and invest.
      They are threatened with economic chaos and confiscation of their dollar reserves
      if they do not boycott trade and investment relations with Russia, China, and
      other countries refusing to submit to U.S. control. The United States’ leverage
      to obtain these foreign concessions is no longer industrial leadership and financial
      strength, but its ability to cause chaos for other countries. Claiming to be the
      indispensable nation, the U.S.’s ability to disrupt trade is ending its former
      international monetary and diplomatic power. That power originally was based on
      U.S. holdings of the world’s largest monetary gold reserves in 1945, its status
      as the largest creditor nation and industrial economy, and, after 1971, its dollar
      hegemony, arising in large part as a result of its financial market being the
      safest for other nations to hold their official monetary reserves. The diplomatic
      inertia created by these former advantages no longer reflects the realities of
      2025. What U.S. officials do have is the ability to disrupt the world’s trade,
      supply chains, and financial arrangements, including the SWIFT system for international
      payments. The U.S. and European confiscation of $300 billion of Russia’s monetary
      deposits has darkened America’s reputation for financial safety, while its chronic
      trade and balance-of-payments deficits threaten to disrupt the international monetary
      system and free trade that made it the major beneficiary of the 1945-2025 world
      order. In keeping with the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference
      in other countries’ internal affairs that underlay the creation of the United
      Nations (the basic principle of international law grounded in the 1648 Peace of
      Westphalia), Russia’s Foreign Minister Lavrov described (in his speech cited above)
      the need “to establish foreign trade mechanisms [that] the West will be unable
      to control, such as transport corridors, alternative payment systems and supply
      chains.” As an example of how the United States had paralyzed the World Trade
      Organization, which it had created on the basis of free trade at a time when America
      was the world’s leading export power, he explained: When the Americans realized
      that the globalized system they had created – one built on fair competition, inviolable
      property rights, the presumption of innocence, and similar principles, and which
      had allowed them to dominate for decades – had also begun benefiting their rivals,
      primarily China, they took drastic action. As China started outplaying them on
      their own turf and by their own rules, Washington simply blocked the WTO’s Appellate
      Body. By artificially stripping it of a quorum, they rendered this key dispute
      settlement mechanism inactive – and it remains so to this day. The United States
      has been able to block foreign opposition to its nationalist policies by having
      veto power in the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank. Even without such power,
      U.S. diplomats have been able to block United Nations organizations from acting
      independently of U.S. wishes by refusing to appoint leaders or judges not primarily
      loyal to U.S. foreign policy. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), charged
      with keeping nuclear proliferation in check is the most recent notorious case
      in point. Iran published documents showing that the agency’s leader Rafael Grossi
      provided U.S. and Israeli intelligence with the names of Iranian scientists who
      were killed, and details of the Iranian nuclear refinement sites that were bombed.
      The U.S. veto has prevented the UN Security Council from condemning Israeli attacks
      on the Palestinian population. And when the International Criminal Court (ICC)
      brought charges against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for committing
      war crimes and crimes against humanity in a genocide against the Palestinians,
      U.S. officials imposed sanctions on the ICC and demanded the removal of the prosecutor.
      The world no longer is to be governed by international law, but by unilateral
      U.S. rules, subject to abrupt change depending on the vicissitudes of American
      economic or military power (or loss thereof). As Russia’s President Vladimir Putin
      described this new state of affairs in 2022, “Western countries have been saying
      for centuries that they bring freedom and democracy to other nations,” yet the
      “unipolar world is inherently anti-democratic and unfree; it is false and hypocritical
      through and through.” The United States’ self-image depicts its long dominant
      world position as reflecting its democracy, free market, and equality of opportunity
      that has enabled its power elite, in their view, to acquire their status by being
      the economy’s most productive members, through their management and allocation
      of savings and credit. The reality is that the United States has become a rentier
      oligarchy, one that is increasingly hereditary. Its members’ fortunes are made
      mainly by acquiring rent-yielding assets (land, natural resources, and monopolies)
      on which they make capital gains, while paying most of their rent as interest
      to their bankers, who end up with much of these rents and have become the new
      oligarchy’s leading managerial class. Summary The real conflict over what kind
      of economic and political system the Global Majority will have is just gaining
      momentum. Global South countries and others have been driven so deeply into debt
      that they have been obliged to sell off their public infrastructure to pay its
      carrying charges. Recovering control of their natural resources and basic infrastructure
      requires the fiscal right to impose an economic-rent tax on their land, natural
      resources and monopolies, as well as the legal right to recover environmental
      cleanup costs caused by foreign oil and mining firms, and to implement financial
      cleanup costs ( i.e ., write offs and cancellation) of the foreign debt burden
      imposed by creditors who have not taken responsibility to ensure that their loans
      can be paid under existing conditions. U.S. evangelistic rhetoric describes the
      imminent political and economic fracture of the world economy as a “Clash of Civilizations”
      between democracies (i.e., countries that support U.S. policy) and autocracies
      (i.e., nations acting independently). It would be more accurate to describe this
      fracture as a fight by the United States and its European and other Western allies
      against civilization — assuming civilization entails, as it seems it must, the
      sovereign right of countries to enact their own laws and tax systems for the benefit
      of their own populations within an international system that has a common set
      of basic rules and values. What Western ideologues call democracy and free markets
      has turned out to be an aggressive rentier -financial imperialism. And what they
      call autocracy is a government strong enough to prevent economic polarization
      between a super-rich rentier class and an impoverished population at large, such
      as is occurring within the Western oligarchies themselves. Editor’s Note : A t

    paragraph_summary: During the 17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6, 2025,
      the Prime Minister addressed a session focused on Peace and Security and the Reform
      of Global Governance, emphasizing the need for a collaborative approach to tackle
      pressing global issues. The discussion highlighted the historical context of industrial
      capitalism, which aimed to liberate economies from feudal privileges and vested
      interests, particularly targeting the economic rents associated with land, trade
      monopolies, and banking. Despite past progress, the article notes that contemporary
      economies still grapple with rising land and resource rents, exacerbated by privatization
      trends driven by the financial sector. This situation undermines the manufacturing
      base established by earlier industrial policies, as free trade continues to dominate
      economic strategies, often at the expense of equitable growth and stability.

      including a company they launched last year that issues a stablecoin and could
      benefit from the GENIUS bill that is now awaiting the president’s signature. But
      a growing bloc of the party has joined Republicans in lining up behind the digital
      asset industry’s Washington agenda, a sign of crypto firms’ ascendance as a political

      Cook Blog A British-Israeli Jew, Yael Kahn, has been charged with causing “alarm
      or distress” for holding a placard referring to “Nazi Israel” at a London protest
      that opposed the continuing presence of Tzipi Hotovely, Israel’s genocide-justifying
      Israeli ambassador, in the UK. Kahn will appear in court tomorrow. There is a
      long tradition of Israeli and Jewish intellectuals, politicians and activists
      making just this sort of comparison between Israel and the Nazis. Many of these
      Jews were from the generation that lived through the Holocaust, and were presumably
      well-positioned to draw such a conclusion. Many decades ago the renowned Israeli
      philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz, nominated for the Israel Prize, warned that,
      after Israel began occupying the Palestinian territories in 1967, its soldiers
      had turned into “Judeo-Nazis”. Their behaviour has since got far, far worse than
      anything Liebowitz witnessed. In the early 1950s, Menachem Begin, who would later
      be elected prime minister of Israel, declared that “emergency regulations” adopted
      by the Israeli parliament – and used against Palestinians to this day – were “Nazi
      laws”. In 2010, Hajo Meyer, an Auschwitz survivor who went on to become a noted
      physicist, spoke at an event at the House of Commons in which he repeatedly compared
      Israel’s behaviour to that of the Nazis – a comparison that was used by the Israeli
      lobby and British media to smear Jeremy Corbyn, his friend, as an antisemite by
      association. What we have been seeing ever since is the gradual expansion of this
      twin-pronged demonisation campaign: both to oust a political leader that threatened
      the establishment with a mildly democratic socialist programme; and to silence
      critics of Israel, including critics who are Jewish and Israeli. Corbyn, the establishment
      may hope, has mostly been neutered by the smears – though the first poll since
      he teamed up with Zarah Sultana to form a so-far unnamed new party suggests he
      may be more of a nuisance than they expected. It shows the pair currently level-pegging
      with Labour at about 15 per cent of votes. But more pressing for the establishment
      has been extinguishing growing popular anger at Britain’s continuing complicity
      in Israel’s slaughter in Gaza, even as its genocidal nature becomes impossible
      to hide. Genocide and Holocaust scholars – including Israeli ones – are increasingly
      explicit on this point. You know how bad the Gaza genocide has got when even the
      New York Times is ready to publish a noted (Israeli) Holocaust scholar explaining
      why this is one. Omer Bartov: "Israel is literally trying to wipe out Palestinian
      existence in Gaza." More here: https://t.co/M6Rmhgpmiw pic.twitter.com/ZhesA62c7p
      — Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) July 15, 2025 The campaign to crush dissent
      began before the genocide. It was the establishment’s reaction to Corbyn becoming
      the first leader of one of the two main UK parties to give voice to widespread
      disquiet at Israel’s increasingly blatant violence towards the Palestinian people
      and its refusal to concede any kind of Palestinian state. The British establishment’s
      response was to impose a new definition of antisemitism – produced by an Israel
      lobby group, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) – that intentionally
      conflated criticism of Israel with hatred of Jews. One of the definition’s many
      Israel-related examples of antisemitism is “drawing comparisons of contemporary
      Israeli policy to that of the Nazis”. The IHRA definition, or rather mis-definition,
      of antisemitism has been widely adopted – either formally or informally – by British
      institutions, from the government and local councils to universities and the media.
      Though obscured, it is the implicit basis of the BBC’s refusal to allow its reporters
      – and guests – to make any allusion to Israel’s slaughter in Gaza as a genocide.
      The BBC behaves as if the Nazis had a monopoly on mass extermination – and so
      any reference to a genocide in Gaza equates it to the Holocaust and is therefore
      equivalent to antisemitism under the IHRA definition. Reminder: Whistleblower
      reveals that the BBC has DIRECT instructions to safeguard Israel’s image. pic.twitter.com/2si0p8K7Or
      — Matt Aldarab (@mattybach1) July 16, 2025 The Starmer government is wielding
      other British institutions against the public: most significantly, the police
      and the courts. The legal sphere is being used to crush any meaningful criticism
      of Israel – and the British government’s complicity in the Gaza genocide. In charging
      Kahn, the police are behaving as if the thoroughly discredited IHRA definition
      has actual legal standing. It doesn’t. But the government’s proscription this
      month of the direct action group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation
      – making it now equivalent to al-Qaeda or Islamic State – does. The implication
      is that any tangible form of action – or support for such action – to stop either
      arms firms in the UK or the British state arming the genocide amounts to terrorism.
      Activists and their supporters could spend 14 years in jail as a result. The government’s
      response is shocking – and is meant to be. It sends a chilling message that any
      opposition to Israel’s genocide is a highly risky endeavour that could leave one
      deprived of freedom and permanently tainted with a terrorism conviction. The government’s
      goal has been precisely to muddy the waters about where basic rights end and criminality
      begins. It is to make the public frightened to protest in any meaningful way against
      Israel’s oppression of Palestinians, whether it be its system of apartheid, its
      prolonged siege of Palestinian territory, its intensification of a long-standing
      ethnic cleansing programme, or now its genocide. The direction of travel is clear,
      as two Kent police officers showed by threatening this week to arrest an anti-genocide
      protester under the Terrorism Act for waving a Palestinian flag and holding a
      banner saying “Free Palestine”. This video shows Kent police threatening to arrest
      a protester under the Terrorism Act – leaving them facing up to 14 years in jail
      – simply for waving a Palestinian flag and calling Israel''s actions in Gaza a
      genocide. The direction of travel under Starmer is now clear. pic.twitter.com/qKz23CCtPq
      — Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) July 16, 2025 Whether the police officers’
      threats are backed by the law or not is largely beside the point. This is about
      creating a climate of fear. Hard-won democratic rights are evaporating – as the
      West digs in to support its most important surviving, militarised colonial outpost,
      created nearly 80 years ago to secure the Middle East’s oil wealth. The lengths
      western capitals are willing to go to prop up Israel, even as it shreds international
      law, tells us everything we need to know about where their real priorities lie.

      a protest in London against the presence of Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's ambassador

      — Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) July 16, 2025 Whether the police officers’
      threats are backed by the law or not is largely beside the point. This is about
      creating a climate of fear. Hard-won democratic rights are evaporating – as the
      West digs in to support its most important surviving, militarised colonial outpost,
      created nearly 80 years ago to secure the Middle East’s oil wealth. The lengths
      western capitals are willing to go to prop up Israel, even as it shreds international
      law, tells us everything we need to know about where their real priorities lie.

    paragraph_summary: Yael Kahn, a British-Israeli Jew, has been charged with causing
      "alarm or distress" for holding a placard that referred to "Nazi Israel" during
      a protest in London against the presence of Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's ambassador
      to the UK. This incident highlights a longstanding tradition among some Israeli
      and Jewish intellectuals who have drawn parallels between Israeli actions and
      those of the Nazis, a sentiment echoed by figures like philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz
      and Auschwitz survivor Hajo Meyer. The article discusses the historical context
      of these comparisons and the ongoing demonization of individuals who make such
      statements, particularly in relation to political figures like Jeremy Corbyn,
      who have faced backlash for their associations with critics of Israeli policies.

      to town halls and the courts , it’s a race now. The Trump administration is fighting
      to remain a step ahead of the growing popular backlash to its draconian cuts to
      social programs that millions of Americans depend on — at least until the administration
      operationalizes enough of the police state it’s practicing on immigrants to put
      down any such objection. Budget proposals and “Department of Government Efficiency”
      (DOGE) cuts switching out the public commons for a police state make the regime’s
      objectives clear. Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” budget signed into law July
      4, all that will be removed from Medicaid, food stamps, and student loans will
      be reallocated nearly dollar-for-dollar to the Pentagon, Immigration and Customs
      Enforcement (ICE) , and subsidies and tax cuts for the rich. The deeply unpopular
      White House is confronted with a second problem of its own making. It’s a trap
      already apparent during Donald Trump’s first term. In letting go federal employees
      or replacing them with incompetent sycophants, the administration is having difficulty
      running its political relay to the fascist finish line. As Homeland Security Secretary
      Kristi Noem’s failure to deploy federal search and rescue until more than 72 hours
      after the recent deadly Texas floods underscores, the incompetence on display
      is likely to blow back upon the administration time and again. Within only the
      last month: Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again”
      team used artificial intelligence to write a report plotting out a new vision
      for health policy that strips out childhood vaccines, ultra-processed foods, and
      pesticides. The report included false information and fake citations. David Richardson,
      the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) new head, shocked FEMA staff
      when he shared his surprise there was a hurricane season. Casey Means, a wellness
      influencer and Trump’s pick for surgeon general, never completed her medical residency.
      Against their Hippocratic oaths, Veterans Affairs doctors are now allowed to refuse
      to treat Democrats, the unmarried, or people of any characteristic not presently
      protected under law. The U.S. has long suffered the consequences of failing to
      offer access to well-run federal programs to all Americans. But the new administration’s
      rollbacks reach another order of abandonment, rejecting any notion of our shared
      fate. The solution isn’t the Democrats’ promise to run immigration camps more
      efficiently . Instead, everyday people in the U.S. need to return to thinking
      through shared problems together . We need to get back to the bedrock of a society
      — the kind of organizing that, despite its difficulties and contradictions, this
      past century helped produce a public commons and a public health infrastructure
      ostensibly dedicated to protecting us all. Thinking and planning aren’t abilities
      limited to the rich and their professional-managerial hires that a separate labor
      class acts on only by order of a paycheck. A Brief History of Public Health In
      aiming to turn the federal government into a corporate state that we, the people,
      have little say in, the Trump administration is trying to offload the state’s
      contributions to help a society it supposedly represents. Offload where? Depending
      on the administrative function, to the states, individual Americans , corporate
      governance, or the dumpster of history. This includes public health interventions
      nobody else can provide, however laudable individual efforts are in local mutual
      aid or philanthropic charity. The administration, for instance, appears intent
      on zeroing out the federal infectious disease program. During his own presidential
      campaign, RFK Jr. promised to end such research, mentioning the exact diseases
      with which the U.S. is now besieged. NBC News reported that he promised to order
      the National Institutes of Health “to take ‘a break’ from studying infectious
      diseases, like Covid-19 and measles, and pivoting the agency to the study of chronic
      diseases, like diabetes and obesity.” This zero-sum budgeting, which turns such
      research programs into an either-or proposition, emerges only with the intent
      of gutting the government. “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, God bless you all,”
      Kennedy said, according to NBC . “Thank you for public service. We’re going to
      give infectious disease a break for about eight years.” As Trump’s secretary of
      health, Kennedy has followed through: He’s accelerated huge cuts to the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other units focused on infectious
      disease. In late April, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) closed
      down the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Integrated Research
      Facility, which conducts experimental work on some of the world’s deadliest diseases,
      including, presently, Lassa fever, SARS-CoV-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis.
      Last month, Kennedy replaced all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on
      Immunization Practices (ACIP) largely with anti-vaxxers looking to industrialize
      wellness fads. The new ACIP fomented skepticism around influenza vaccines. Next
      generation vaccines for COVID and bird flu were scuttled. But infectious diseases
      have always been — and will always be — a social problem. Societies have to do
      something about them, over and over. Wishing away suddenly resurgent measles and
      tuberculosis helps make the infections resurgent. Pathogens, long humanity’s greatest
      source of mortality, have served as our surest fellow travelers, certainly back
      to the origins of modern humans 55,000 years ago at the end of the Middle Stone
      Age when a push in neurological and cultural development produced societies capable
      of the kinds of civilizational organization we now see all about us. When groups
      of humans began to settle into towns and later cities, the more acute infections,
      such as influenza and diphtheria, spilled over from wild waterfowl and newly domesticated
      livestock into humans, who now lived at population densities capable of supporting
      such fast and deadly pathogens over many multiple transmission events. As societies
      changed from there, so did the kinds of pathogens they supported. From the 1890s
      on, but especially since World War II, when large livestock and poultry monoculture
      began to be instituted, influenza entered a new phase — its Industrial Revolution.
      In the course of industrializing livestock production, agribusiness industrialized
      pathogens — increasing the deadliness of the viruses and bacteria, the rate of
      their evolution, and the speed and extent of their spread. Domesticated stock
      also served as sources for human diphtheria, measles, mumps, plague, pertussis,
      rotavirus A, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness, and visceral leishmaniasis. Ecological
      changes brought upon landscapes by human intervention reset circumstances in favor
      of malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever, among other diseases, spilling over
      into human populations from birds, wild primates, and other species. For most
      of its history , the cholera bacterium survived eating plankton in the Ganges
      Delta. Once humanity became urbanized and later integrated together by 19th-century
      transport, cholera found success in the world’s cities. The bacterium succeeded
      as long as municipalities drew drinking water from the same places they dumped
      their sewage. We can see such epidemiologies return when cities today stop protecting
      their water. The simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) infecting monkeys, chimps,
      and other non-human primates emerged from sub-Saharan forests when turn-of-the-century
      colonial logging broadened the wildlife-human interface. It appears HIV, one of
      the SIVs, evolved when logging expanded the market for butchered bushmeat. Logging
      roads also better integrated the deepest African forest with new regional cities.
      Subsistence farmers driven off their land were forced into faraway labor markets
      and, separated from their families, bought into the burgeoning sex trade for comfort.
      With this combination, SIVs successfully spilled over into humans and spread upon
      the global travel network.< Public Health as Social Struggle People responded
      to the new diseases in turn. We see different forms of collective choice organized
      at varying scales — from workplace to neighborhood and village to the state —
      undertaking different countermeasures against each new disease. The novel pathogens
      placed demands upon societies from imperial China to the Italian city-states and
      beyond to improve their medical technologies and public health interventions:
      quarantines, cordon sanitaire, isolation wards, contact tracing, community health
      officers, errand helpers, early health and unemployment insurance, and population
      statistics, among other new practices. In turn, a daisy chain of innovation in
      agricultural and industrial methods, accelerating demographic shifts, and new
      settlement reset regional ecologies, disconnecting and reconnecting pathogen and
      host populations. The new epidemiologies promoted new rounds of disease spillover.
      Sadly, the levels of disease control pursued have often been limited by the societal
      value placed upon who was thought to be infectious or suspiciously infection-free.
      Jews were burned at the stake for the sorcery of washing their hands. But it wasn’t
      just ancient prejudice. During the early days of the AIDS pandemic in the West,
      the “four H’s” were discriminated against as a matter of official epidemiology:
      homosexuals, Haitians, hemophiliacs, and heroin users. Even now the Trump administration
      is searching for diseases to pin on immigrants in order to rationalize sealing
      off the U.S.-Mexico border. That is, the modern state almost invariably has a
      class and a racial/ethnic character. It acts largely in favor of one group over
      others, including in matters of public health. It’s more complicated than that,
      of course. For philosopher Alain Badiou, class bears such pressure on social cohesion
      that the state is organized less around social binding than around its unbinding:
      how to mush together the system’s lucrative divide kept between rich and poor.
      Those of us outside the wealthy classes can arrive at the conclusion that the
      choice the state now makes isn’t our choice. If we decide so, what are our choices
      as a collectivity? What are we to do about an ongoing deadly pandemic — COVID-19
      — into which the state now no longer cares to intervene but continues to force
      people to be infected with in order to keep an extractive economy going in the
      interests of the wealthy? History offers multiple examples of methods by which
      those in power have been forced to act in the public’s interest — from public
      health’s very origins through ongoing efforts to push back against the Trump administration’s
      campaign to destroy health protections today. Accumulation Cycling Into Bunker
      Money But why are the bedrock basics of pandemic preparation and response such
      a source of societal friction? The U.S. is the world’s richest country in history
      by its nominal GDP , wealth concentration, and number of billionaires. Isn’t there
      plenty to go around, including enough to cover the basic measures that help reproduce
      the society upon which its wealth depends — from union contracts to pandemic preparedness?
      The abandonment is built in. World-systems theorists describe capitalism as a
      series of cycles of accumulation. Empires first turn money into capital, with
      which the state supporting these efforts builds out imperial infrastructure. When
      empires decline, the rich cash out: capital is turned back into money to hoard
      or invest elsewhere. The infrastructure is left to rot, be monetized, or sold
      off in a form of asset stripping. With the emergence of neoliberalism in the 1970s,
      the U.S.’s postwar empire began to sell off its infrastructure and public commons
      as a matter of organizational principle. That included the public health system
      — from disease surveillance to prevention and treatment. In 2018, Trust for America’s
      Health reported on the effective decline of health funding. The CDC’s budget then
      was $7.15 billion, which, adjusting for inflation, had remained flat from the
      previous decade. The report described the Public Health Emergency Preparedness
      (PHEP) cooperative agreement program as the only federal program that supports
      state and local health departments to prepare for and respond to emergencies.
      Except for one-time bumps for the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, core emergency preparedness
      funding had been cut by more than one-third (from $940 million in 2002 to $667
      million in 2017). Trust for America’s Health placed particular focus on pandemics
      and the need to fully fund the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the
      Hospital Preparedness Program, the Project BioShield Act, and PHEP. The report
      recommended increasing funding for public health at all levels of government —
      federal, state, and local. It called for preserving the Prevention and Public
      Health Fund; funding preparations for public health emergencies and pandemics;
      establishing a standing public health emergency response fund; and surge funding
      upon an emergency to avoid the delays that were apparent in the Ebola outbreak,
      the swine flu pandemic, Hurricane Sandy, and the Zika outbreak. Trust for America’s
      2024 report repeated the call for more funding, noting the added fiscal pressures
      the COVID pandemic presented, including on the Advanced Molecular Detection program,
      public health workforce and infrastructure, the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak
      Analytics, wastewater surveillance, vaccine coverage for people without insurance,
      and public health communication. The latest Trump budget instead cuts over $700
      million from PHEP, $370 million from global health, and $77 million from sexually
      transmitted diseases prevention. A new Annals of Internal Medicine report estimated
      the cuts to Medicaid, leading to as many as 7.6 million Americans losing their
      coverage, will kill over 16,000 Americans annually. More recent estimates place
      the lost coverage at 17 million Americans. There are signs the epochal asset stripping
      at this end of the cycle of accumulation is now accelerating by the month, including
      of government itself. The boy wonders that Elon Musk left behind at DOGE are still
      striking out essential services line item-by-line item. Are such destructive efforts
      unprecedented? Can the public health demolition be rolled back? Remembering Our
      Revolutionary Selves Political scientist Corey Robin spoke repeatedly of the first
      Trump administration’s deeply American nature. White supremacy, environmental
      destruction, and separating children from their parents in the name of scripture
      — from Native genocide and Black enslavement to Obama’s ICE — are indeed at the
      core of the country’s legacy, despite the present administration’s efforts to
      suppress such histories. Many people, however, including more recently Robin himself,
      have since been disabused of thinking of Trump’s autocratic bluster as just part
      of a historical continuity. In this second Trump administration, behavior, belief,
      and opportunity have folded together into the beginnings of actually acting out
      the most fascistic of fantasies. From day one in the White House in January 2017,
      Trump launched a long campaign — across tweets, speeches, ceremonies, and personnel
      appointments — to turn governance into a matter of orders rather than law, expertise,
      policy, or even lucrative optimization beyond his familial bourse. Both Trump
      administrations have always been in shambles. But like his real estate business
      and bankruptcy upon bankruptcy , a well-oiled machine is never the point. Competence
      isn’t enough. Liberals, philosopher Alain Badiou explained, mistakenly fetishize
      a smoothly operating capitalist parliamentarianism as the only means by which
      ideas about our collective fates can be formed and judged . Judged for whom? we
      need to ask. Congress has long been bought by capital. Sen. Cory Booker symbolically
      followed his record filibuster by voting in favor of industry-written cryptocurrency
      regulation and helping confirm Charles Kushner — Jared Kushner’s dad who has been
      convicted of illegal campaign donations, tax evasion, and witness tampering —
      as U.S. ambassador to France. If the outcome of keeping capitalism trucking is
      shared across the political class, fascism subjectivizes the future for ruler
      and ruled alike into an event horizon of no return, one ICE 1099-paid raid or
      stochastic assassination at a time. Fascism’s aim is to get millions to find their
      identities not in their neighbors’ well-being — the core of public health practice
      — but in bashing in their neighbors’ heads. In between these poles, in an age
      of shared internet isolation, the left must somehow support everyday people in
      finding new means by which to actualize their best ideas and interventions for
      all when once they were told by their liberal “betters” that they shouldn’t trust
      themselves. The public health infrastructure now rotting away was once a revolutionary
      project to which the labor movement and community organizations successfully bent
      the U.S. political class. Together, everyday people helped construct the better
      parts of the modern state that first neoliberalism and now Trumpism is winding
      down at this end of the cycle of accumulation. Working people can demand the public
      commons they deserve — but they need first to remember what they accomplished
      together over many decades against all odds. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, the authors discuss the Trump administration's
      ongoing struggle to manage public backlash against its severe cuts to social programs,
      which are being redirected to bolster military and immigration enforcement budgets.
      The administration's controversial budget, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill,"
      reallocates funds from essential services like Medicaid and food assistance to
      the Pentagon and tax breaks for the wealthy. As the administration attempts to
      implement a more authoritarian governance style, it faces challenges due to the
      incompetence of its appointed officials, highlighted by delays in disaster response
      following recent Texas floods. This situation reflects a broader pattern of mismanagement
      and public dissatisfaction that could jeopardize the administration's objectives.

      have always been — and will always be — a social problem. Societies have to do
      something about them, over and over. Wishing away suddenly resurgent measles and
      tuberculosis helps make the infections resurgent. Pathogens, long humanity’s greatest
      source of mortality, have served as our surest fellow travelers, certainly back
      to the origins of modern humans 55,000 years ago at the end of the Middle Stone
      Age when a push in neurological and cultural development produced societies capable
      of the kinds of civilizational organization we now see all about us. When groups
      of humans began to settle into towns and later cities, the more acute infections,
      such as influenza and diphtheria, spilled over from wild waterfowl and newly domesticated
      livestock into humans, who now lived at population densities capable of supporting
      such fast and deadly pathogens over many multiple transmission events. As societies
      changed from there, so did the kinds of pathogens they supported. From the 1890s
      on, but especially since World War II, when large livestock and poultry monoculture
      began to be instituted, influenza entered a new phase — its Industrial Revolution.
      In the course of industrializing livestock production, agribusiness industrialized
      pathogens — increasing the deadliness of the viruses and bacteria, the rate of
      their evolution, and the speed and extent of their spread. Domesticated stock
      also served as sources for human diphtheria, measles, mumps, plague, pertussis,
      rotavirus A, tuberculosis, sleeping sickness, and visceral leishmaniasis. Ecological
      changes brought upon landscapes by human intervention reset circumstances in favor
      of malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever, among other diseases, spilling over
      into human populations from birds, wild primates, and other species. For most
      of its history , the cholera bacterium survived eating plankton in the Ganges
      Delta. Once humanity became urbanized and later integrated together by 19th-century
      transport, cholera found success in the world’s cities. The bacterium succeeded
      as long as municipalities drew drinking water from the same places they dumped
      their sewage. We can see such epidemiologies return when cities today stop protecting
      their water. The simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) infecting monkeys, chimps,
      and other non-human primates emerged from sub-Saharan forests when turn-of-the-century
      colonial logging broadened the wildlife-human interface. It appears HIV, one of
      the SIVs, evolved when logging expanded the market for butchered bushmeat. Logging
      roads also better integrated the deepest African forest with new regional cities.
      Subsistence farmers driven off their land were forced into faraway labor markets
      and, separated from their families, bought into the burgeoning sex trade for comfort.
      With this combination, SIVs successfully spilled over into humans and spread upon
      the global travel network.< Public Health as Social Struggle People responded
      to the new diseases in turn. We see different forms of collective choice organized
      at varying scales — from workplace to neighborhood and village to the state —
      undertaking different countermeasures against each new disease. The novel pathogens
      placed demands upon societies from imperial China to the Italian city-states and
      beyond to improve their medical technologies and public health interventions:
      quarantines, cordon sanitaire, isolation wards, contact tracing, community health
      officers, errand helpers, early health and unemployment insurance, and population
      statistics, among other new practices. In turn, a daisy chain of innovation in
      agricultural and industrial methods, accelerating demographic shifts, and new
      settlement reset regional ecologies, disconnecting and reconnecting pathogen and
      host populations. The new epidemiologies promoted new rounds of disease spillover.
      Sadly, the levels of disease control pursued have often been limited by the societal
      value placed upon who was thought to be infectious or suspiciously infection-free.
      Jews were burned at the stake for the sorcery of washing their hands. But it wasn’t
      just ancient prejudice. During the early days of the AIDS pandemic in the West,
      the “four H’s” were discriminated against as a matter of official epidemiology:
      homosexuals, Haitians, hemophiliacs, and heroin users. Even now the Trump administration
      is searching for diseases to pin on immigrants in order to rationalize sealing
      off the U.S.-Mexico border. That is, the modern state almost invariably has a
      class and a racial/ethnic character. It acts largely in favor of one group over
      others, including in matters of public health. It’s more complicated than that,
      of course. For philosopher Alain Badiou, class bears such pressure on social cohesion
      that the state is organized less around social binding than around its unbinding:
      how to mush together the system’s lucrative divide kept between rich and poor.
      Those of us outside the wealthy classes can arrive at the conclusion that the
      choice the state now makes isn’t our choice. If we decide so, what are our choices
      as a collectivity? What are we to do about an ongoing deadly pandemic — COVID-19
      — into which the state now no longer cares to intervene but continues to force
      people to be infected with in order to keep an extractive economy going in the
      interests of the wealthy? History offers multiple examples of methods by which
      those in power have been forced to act in the public’s interest — from public
      health’s very origins through ongoing efforts to push back against the Trump administration’s
      campaign to destroy health protections today. Accumulation Cycling Into Bunker
      Money But why are the bedrock basics of pandemic preparation and response such
      a source of societal friction? The U.S. is the world’s richest country in history
      by its nominal GDP , wealth concentration, and number of billionaires. Isn’t there
      plenty to go around, including enough to cover the basic measures that help reproduce
      the society upon which its wealth depends — from union contracts to pandemic preparedness?
      The abandonment is built in. World-systems theorists describe capitalism as a
      series of cycles of accumulation. Empires first turn money into capital, with
      which the state supporting these efforts builds out imperial infrastructure. When
      empires decline, the rich cash out: capital is turned back into money to hoard
      or invest elsewhere. The infrastructure is left to rot, be monetized, or sold
      off in a form of asset stripping. With the emergence of neoliberalism in the 1970s,
      the U.S.’s postwar empire began to sell off its infrastructure and public commons
      as a matter of organizational principle. That included the public health system
      — from disease surveillance to prevention and treatment. In 2018, Trust for America’s
      Health reported on the effective decline of health funding. The CDC’s budget then
      was $7.15 billion, which, adjusting for inflation, had remained flat from the
      previous decade. The report described the Public Health Emergency Preparedness
      (PHEP) cooperative agreement program as the only federal program that supports
      state and local health departments to prepare for and respond to emergencies.
      Except for one-time bumps for the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, core emergency preparedness
      funding had been cut by more than one-third (from $940 million in 2002 to $667
      million in 2017). Trust for America’s Health placed particular focus on pandemics
      and the need to fully fund the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, the
      Hospital Preparedness Program, the Project BioShield Act, and PHEP. The report
      recommended increasing funding for public health at all levels of government —
      federal, state, and local. It called for preserving the Prevention and Public
      Health Fund; funding preparations for public health emergencies and pandemics;
      establishing a standing public health emergency response fund; and surge funding
      upon an emergency to avoid the delays that were apparent in the Ebola outbreak,
      the swine flu pandemic, Hurricane Sandy, and the Zika outbreak. Trust for America’s
      2024 report repeated the call for more funding, noting the added fiscal pressures
      the COVID pandemic presented, including on the Advanced Molecular Detection program,
      public health workforce and infrastructure, the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak
      Analytics, wastewater surveillance, vaccine coverage for people without insurance,
      and public health communication. The latest Trump budget instead cuts over $700
      million from PHEP, $370 million from global health, and $77 million from sexually
      transmitted diseases prevention. A new Annals of Internal Medicine report estimated
      the cuts to Medicaid, leading to as many as 7.6 million Americans losing their
      coverage, will kill over 16,000 Americans annually. More recent estimates place
      the lost coverage at 17 million Americans. There are signs the epochal asset stripping
      at this end of the cycle of accumulation is now accelerating by the month, including
      of government itself. The boy wonders that Elon Musk left behind at DOGE are still
      striking out essential services line item-by-line item. Are such destructive efforts
      unprecedented? Can the public health demolition be rolled back? Remembering Our
      Revolutionary Selves Political scientist Corey Robin spoke repeatedly of the first
      Trump administration’s deeply American nature. White supremacy, environmental
      destruction, and separating children from their parents in the name of scripture
      — from Native genocide and Black enslavement to Obama’s ICE — are indeed at the
      core of the country’s legacy, despite the present administration’s efforts to
      suppress such histories. Many people, however, including more recently Robin himself,
      have since been disabused of thinking of Trump’s autocratic bluster as just part
      of a historical continuity. In this second Trump administration, behavior, belief,
      and opportunity have folded together into the beginnings of actually acting out
      the most fascistic of fantasies. From day one in the White House in January 2017,
      Trump launched a long campaign — across tweets, speeches, ceremonies, and personnel
      appointments — to turn governance into a matter of orders rather than law, expertise,
      policy, or even lucrative optimization beyond his familial bourse. Both Trump
      administrations have always been in shambles. But like his real estate business
      and bankruptcy upon bankruptcy , a well-oiled machine is never the point. Competence
      isn’t enough. Liberals, philosopher Alain Badiou explained, mistakenly fetishize
      a smoothly operating capitalist parliamentarianism as the only means by which
      ideas about our collective fates can be formed and judged . Judged for whom? we
      need to ask. Congress has long been bought by capital. Sen. Cory Booker symbolically
      followed his record filibuster by voting in favor of industry-written cryptocurrency
      regulation and helping confirm Charles Kushner — Jared Kushner’s dad who has been
      convicted of illegal campaign donations, tax evasion, and witness tampering —
      as U.S. ambassador to France. If the outcome of keeping capitalism trucking is
      shared across the political class, fascism subjectivizes the future for ruler
      and ruled alike into an event horizon of no return, one ICE 1099-paid raid or
      stochastic assassination at a time. Fascism’s aim is to get millions to find their
      identities not in their neighbors’ well-being — the core of public health practice
      — but in bashing in their neighbors’ heads. In between these poles, in an age
      of shared internet isolation, the left must somehow support everyday people in
      finding new means by which to actualize their best ideas and interventions for
      all when once they were told by their liberal “betters” that they shouldn’t trust
      themselves. The public health infrastructure now rotting away was once a revolutionary
      project to which the labor movement and community organizations successfully bent
      the U.S. political class. Together, everyday people helped construct the better
      parts of the modern state that first neoliberalism and now Trumpism is winding
      down at this end of the cycle of accumulation. Working people can demand the public
      commons they deserve — but they need first to remember what they accomplished
      together over many decades against all odds. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, the authors discuss the Trump administration's
      ongoing struggle to manage public backlash against its severe cuts to social programs,
      which are being redirected to bolster military and immigration enforcement budgets.
      The administration's controversial budget, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill,"
      reallocates funds from essential services like Medicaid and food assistance to
      the Pentagon and tax breaks for the wealthy. As the administration attempts to
      implement a more authoritarian governance style, it faces challenges due to the
      incompetence of its appointed officials, highlighted by delays in disaster response
      following recent Texas floods. This situation reflects a broader pattern of mismanagement
      and public dissatisfaction that could jeopardize the administration's objectives.

      Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report Perhaps the biggest elephant in the room of American
      politics is the existence of a pedophilic blackmail network that involves some
      of the most powerful people in the country and the world. Despite efforts to get
      to the bottom of the Jeffrey Epstein case, which saw the trafficking and sexual
      exploitation of thousands of children, justice continues to be evaded and the
      cabal associated with Epstein — President Donald Trump notwithstanding — continues
      its conspiracy. Nick Bryant is a journalist and author who first published Epstein’s
      infamous “black book” in 2015 as well as Epstein’s flight logs. This information
      exposed the powerful names associated with Epstein and those who likely participated
      in his abhorrent pedophilic escapades as well as those who are likely controlled
      via Epstein’s extensive blackmail apparatus. Bryant joins host Chris Hedges on
      this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to discuss his work as well as the history
      of the Epstein case and what can be expected next. Trump has resorted to calling
      the entire matter a “hoax” and Attorney General Pam Bondi, despite promising to
      release the Epstein files, has recently balked at the idea that there is evidence
      of an Epstein client list. Bryant and Hedges discuss how there is already myriad
      evidence of Epstein’s crimes and relationships but efforts by the current administration
      could cloud the hope for justice. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES:

      Transcript Chris Hedges Following the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein in July 2019,
      federal authorities seized “hundreds—possibly thousands—of sexually suggestive
      photographs of girls who appear underage, as well as hand-labeled compact discs
      with titles like ‘Girl pics nude,’ and, with the names redacted, ‘Young [Name]
      + [Name],’” the New York Times wrote. The pictures and videos were held in the
      safe at Epstein’s New York mansion, which was the size of a closet. Business Insider
      quoted an FBI agent who said “hard drives” were also taken from the safe. The
      refusal by the Trump administration to release the files and videos amassed during
      investigations, should put to rest the absurd idea, embraced by Trump supporters
      and gullible liberals, that Trump will dismantle the Deep State. Trump is part
      of, and has long been part of, the repugnant cabal of politicians – Democrat and
      Republican – billionaires and celebrities who look at us, and often underage girls
      and boys, as commodities to exploit for profit or pleasure. The list of those
      who were in Epstein’s orbit is a who’s who of the rich and famous. They include
      not only Trump , but Bill Clinton , who allegedly took a trip to Thailand with
      Epstein, Prince Andrew , Bill Gates , hedge fund billionaire Glenn Dubin , former
      New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , former Secretary of the Treasury and former
      president of Harvard University Larry Summers , cognitive psychologist and author
      Stephen Pinker , Alan Dershowitz , billionaire and Victoria’s Secret CEO Leslie
      Wexner , the former Barclays banker Jes Staley , former Israeli prime minister
      Ehud Barak , the magician David Copperfield , actor Kevin Spacey , former CIA
      director Bill Burns , real estate mogul Mort Zuckerman , former Maine senator
      George Mitchell and disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , all of whom
      reveled in Epstein’s perpetual Bacchanalia . They also include law firms and high-priced
      attorneys, federal and state prosecutors, private investigators, personal assistants,
      publicists, servants and drivers. They include the numerous procurers and pimps,
      including Epstein’s girlfriend and daughter of Robert Maxwell , Ghislaine Maxwell.
      They include the media and politicians who ruthlessly discredited and silenced
      the victims, and strong armed anyone, including a handful of intrepid reporters,
      seeking to expose Epstein’s crimes and circle of accomplices. There is a lot that
      remains hidden. But there are some things we know. Epstein installed hidden cameras
      in his opulent residences and on his private Caribbean island, Little St. James,
      to capture his high-powered friends engaging in sexual romps and abuse of teenage
      and underage girls and boys. The recordings were blackmail gold. Were they part
      of an intelligence operation on behalf of the Israeli Mossad ? Or were they used
      to ensure that Epstein had a steady source of investors who funneled him millions
      of dollars to avoid being outed? Or were they used for both? He shuttled underage
      girls between New York and Palm Beach on his private jet the Lolita Express ,
      which was allegedly outfitted with a bed for group sex. His coterie of famous
      friends, including Clinton and Trump , are recorded as traveling on the jet numerous
      times. Joining me to discuss the Epstein case is the journalist Nick Bryant who
      uploaded Epstein’s Black Book on the internet in 2015 , which contained the names
      and private phone numbers of a host of powerful and wealthy patrons. He also uploaded
      Epstein’s flight logs from Epstein’s plane, which also contains the names of numerous
      perpetrators. It is probably fair to say that he has singlehandedly released more
      information about the Epstein case than any other single individual, including
      the Attorney General Pam Bondi. Let’s begin with, which I mentioned in the introduction,
      what we know they have. It is quite voluminous. Nick Bryant Well, as you said,
      Epstein’s safe was drilled the day after he was arrested. And there was a huge
      cache of child abuse material that was taken out of his safe. And I think that
      there were other items. I’ve been told that there was blackmail evidence also
      in the safe. So I think that in addition to a huge cache of child abuse material,
      was also blackmail material. And the FBI, the day after Epstein was arrested,
      and I believe the dark apparatus that deploys people like Epstein, they made sure
      that that safe was cleaned out real quickly. And that’s where we get into problems
      with what the Trump administration is saying and Pam Bondi. On February 26, she
      proclaimed that the Epstein files were on her desk and that she was going to open
      it up and there would be full transparency. And then she served us a nothing sandwich.
      There were no new revelations. And like you said, I put more incriminating information
      about Epstein and his network on the Internet in 2015 than she did in 2025. And
      I saw the black book. She included the black book that I put up on the Internet
      and everything was redacted. All the names. We just redacted numbers and then
      there’s lots of victims in the black book too, well over a hundred. And we redacted
      their last name and we redacted their numbers. So Pam Bondi said that she was
      going to go for full transparency and then she served us a nothing sandwich. And
      what she said is that she had been bamboozled by the FBI’s New York field office.
      So she was either inept or lying. And I’m a generous person, so I’m just going
      to go with inept. And then she said that there was a truckload of evidence on
      the Epstein case. And she said only matters of national security would be redacted.
      So now she has to tell us what a bunch of child molesters have to do with national
      security. So she keeps digging herself deeper and deeper into the hole. And she
      acted like that truckload of evidence had never been seen before by anyone. And
      I’m willing to wager everything that I have that that child abuse material and
      everything in Epstein’s safe was being looked at that day and the next day. And
      there were probably some analysts that didn’t even sleep because they wanted to
      know exactly what was in Epstein’s safe. So for her to come out and say that they’re
      looking at it now, it’s unbelievably disingenuous. And her crescendo of mendacity
      was the memo. And no one signed that memo that came out last week. Trump didn’t
      sign it. Bondi didn’t sign it. [Kash] Patel didn’t sign it. No one wanted to sign
      that memo to be held accountable. There are a couple of things about that memo
      that I agree with. I believe that there were more than 300 gigabytes of child
      abuse material taken out of Epstein’s safe. I also believe that there were well
      over a thousand victims because Jeffrey Epstein trafficked girls for 25 years.
      And then things that I strongly disagree with are that he did this by himself
      and that there wasn’t blackmail involved. And if he did this by himself, why is
      Ghislaine Maxwell in prison? And was he going to the island with just some friends
      occasionally? And why are all these girls listed on the flight logs? It is so
      disingenuous. And I think that the Trump administration really underestimated
      the intelligence of Americans and also their knowledge of this case because when
      they first released those documents, they must have felt that that would satiate
      people’s curiosity to understand the Epstein case. And it did not. And then there
      was a huge blowback. Chris Hedges But there was nothing in those documents that
      hadn’t already been released, is that correct? Nick Bryant Nothing new, no new
      revelations whatsoever. As I said, I released more revelations in 2015 than she
      did in 2025. Chris Hedges Do you believe that there is a client list? Nick Bryant
      I believe that there are files. I don’t believe that it was like the Jeffrey Epstein
      travel agency and he kept a list of his clients on his refrigerator with a magnet.
      I don’t believe that. But I believe that there’s definitely a tremendous amount
      of documentation and also video evidence that there are Epstein files and if the
      government really came clean with the Epstein files and what’s on the 300 gigabytes,
      think that we would really find out who the perpetrators are, who Epstein’s co-conspirators
      are. Although we do know a number of them already, we actually would have definitive
      proof. Chris Hedges Let’s talk a little about what we do know and I want you to
      talk about the affidavit that was about the woman under a pseudonym in California
      that was leveled against Trump but from what you released from what we know we
      do have some sense of what these video records may reveal can you talk about and
      that let’s begin with just the Trump case. Nick Bryant When I put the black book
      up on the Internet, the black book was ultimately perlined by Alfredo Rodriguez,
      who was Epstein’s house manager. And he tried to sell it to one of the attorneys
      that was launching civil suits at Epstein. And the attorney called the FBI. And
      the FBI did a sting and impounded the black book. And then I ultimately came by
      the black book through one of the attorneys. And Alfredo Rodriguez had circled
      a number of names in the black book of people that he thought were in cahoots
      with Trump. Chris Hedges With Trump or you mean with Epstein? Nick Bryant With
      Epstein. And then we also had the lawsuit documentation of Virginia Giuffre. Maxwell
      sued her for defamation and she counter sued and Virginia named a number of her
      perpetrators in a lawsuit. And this is where we can get double corroboration.
      For example, Alfredo Rodriguez circled Ghislaine Maxwell, who was definitely a
      perpetrator and a pimp. And Giuffre named her as a perpetrator and a pimp. Alfredo
      Rodriguez circled Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel, and Virginia
      Giuffre named him as a perpetrator and a rather nasty character. Les Wexner’s
      name is circled by Rodriguez and Virginia Giuffre named him as a perpetrator.
      Alan Dershowitz’s name is circled and Virginia Giuffre named him as a perpetrator.
      And Bill Richardson’s name is circled and Giuffre named him as a perpetrator.
      He’s the former New Mexico governor and he was also the Clinton’s energy czar
      and Jean-Luc Brunel’s name is circled and he and Epstein put together, started
      a modeling agency called MC2 and Brunel… Chris Hedges Let me just interrupt Nick
      because it was copied on Trump’s modeling agency. Nick Bryant Yes, yes. And that
      agency, Jean-Luc Brunel was buying girls in Eastern Europe, not renting them,
      but actually buying them. And he was bringing them into the United States. And
      according to Virginia Giuffre’s affidavit that she swore in 2015, Epstein and
      Brunel had some kind of connection with the State Department or some mechanism
      in the government where they were able to get either visas or passports for these
      girls who some of them were well, Virginia says they’re as young as 12 and there’s
      another report that [says] they’re 11 and 12. But then I know of therapists who
      have counseled Epstein victims and we can get into that later. And actually a
      lot of those victims were or a number of those victims were under the age of 10.
      Donald Trump’s name is also circled, but I haven’t found any corroboration that
      he was a pedophilic perpetrator. There was a case launched by Katie Johnson, who’s
      in California, and she said that she had been abused by Trump and Epstein. And
      there was an accompanying affidavit by a woman named Tiffany Doe who said that
      she recruited her. But it’s very difficult to know what exactly went on there
      because she, I guess, was threatened and Lisa Bloom represented her. And from
      what I’ve been told, she was deposited in a hotel. And this is when Trump and
      Hillary [Clinton] were in the homestretch and she was deposited in a hotel. And
      then Lisa Bloom picked her up the next morning and said, we’re going to go to
      a press conference and she wasn’t ready for that. Now that’s what I’ve been told.
      Chris Hedges Now, Nick, she was 13 and Katie Johnson is a pseudonym. In the affidavit,
      she said that apparently Trump liked to watch Epstein’s orgies while he got a
      hand job, that he complained about the oral sex given to him by apparently this
      13 year old and a 12 year old, is that right? Nick Bryant There was a young girl
      named Maria and I don’t think we ever found out her age, but she would have been
      around 12 or 13. Here’s the problem with that. I spent three years looking for
      Katie Johnson. And I ultimately found her. And I’ve sent her some emails. I found
      her about a year and a half ago and I sent her some emails and she will not respond
      to me. And she’s put together a decent life for herself. She’s selling real estate
      in the Southwest. She’s got a boyfriend. You can see how her life’s unfolded on
      Facebook. And she goes to Europe with her boyfriend occasionally. So she’s put
      together a really comfortable life for herself. And she doesn’t want to talk to
      anybody about it. Chris Hedges Didn’t she get, I don’t know to which point this
      is alleged, but wasn’t she paid off? Nick Bryant We don’t know. It was more the
      threats that, it was the threats and then the press conference that really decided
      that when she decided that she was going to recant everything that she said. Unfortunately,
      because of how she was handled, it’s very difficult to know exactly what went
      on. And that’s why I looked for her for three years, I really wanted to know her
      story, but she wouldn’t get back to me. So I don’t know what to make of that,
      of the affidavit. Chris Hedges Alright, but the charge is out there but let’s
      talk a little bit about what we do know about Dershowitz, for instance, who makes
      these claims that he only traveled on the Lolita Express with his wife. You know
      the flight logs are exposing that to be untrue. But what do we do know about what
      happened with these powerful men did within this Epstein orbit? Nick Bryant Well,
      Dershowitz has long been a misogynist, for sure. And what happened with Dershowitz
      is Virginia Giuffre submitted an affidavit and said that she had been molested
      by him up to approximately six times. And then Dershowitz went on an offensive
      against her two attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell. And Cassell had been
      a former federal judge. Dershowitz was pounding on his chest saying “I’m gonna
      get their licenses to practice law. I’m gonna make sure that they never practice
      law again. I only fly with my wife. She flies everywhere with me!” Well, then
      I got the logs and actually Dershowitz is taking lots of flights with girls like
      “Tatiana” and “Claire” and his wife is noticeably absent from those flight logs.
      And in the Gawker article I wrote, he was asked, what about this girl? What about
      that girl? And his steel trap mind became rather rusty because he couldn’t remember
      those girls. And actually, when we asked him what the third, there was another,
      a third girl that was, her last name was unknown and he decided to diffuse it
      with humor. He said, that could have been my mother. So with Dershowitz, and he’s
      lobbied for the age of consent to be 14, regardless of someone’s partner, which
      is pretty horrible. But he believes in that. And I think that there’s somewhere
      where he’s written that child pornography should be legal or child abuse material
      should be legal. So Alan Dershowitz doesn’t seem to be an ethical bellwether.
      And his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein demonstrates that they were very,
      very close. And there was a Vanity Fair article about Epstein in 2001 and Dershowitz
      is extolling the virtues of Jeffrey Epstein. And he says, and then he gets really
      quaint at the end. He goes, “if Jeffrey Epstein didn’t have any money, I would
      still eat hot dogs with him at Coney Island.” Chris Hedges Well, let’s talk about
      Trump because Trump had a 15 year relationship with Epstein. I mean, according
      to Trump’s biographer, they were very close for a long time. Nick Bryant According
      to Michael Wolff, yes, they were very close. And we don’t really know what caused
      the chasm. Michael Wolff says it was a real estate deal that went awry. Other
      people say that it was, Epstein was trying to procure underage girls at Mar-a-Lago.
      So it’s hard to know what caused that divide. But yes, they were very, very good
      friends. Chris Hedges But Nick, I mean, Wolff claims that they shared women. Nick
      Bryant And Wolff also claims that he saw pictures of topless underage girls on
      Trump’s lap too. So these are the things that Michael Wolff has said and he’s
      got a lot of recordings, but he hasn’t made them public. So it’s going to be interesting.
      When I had the black book in 2012, no one wanted to touch it. No one. And I went
      to every publication in New York City and I was talking to editors and publishers
      and no one wanted to touch it. And then when we published it in 2015, I mean the
      floodgates opened and there have been tons of ink dumped on stories about the
      black book since then. Now, Wolff is saying that he has all these recordings,
      but no one in the mainstream media is willing to touch it, which you think at
      this point, someone in the mainstream media would go for it. So that’s a little
      perplexing to me, but I also know that I’ve been writing about this realm for
      22 years and the mainstream media gets very, very tenuous when these types of
      subjects are brought up. Chris Hedges Well, let me tell you why. Because the people
      who run these organizations circulate among these groups. These are their friends.
      That’s how stories got killed at the New York Times. The real estate developers
      who were all socializing with [A.G.] Sulzberger, when he was the publisher when
      I was there, complained about Sydney Schanberg’s writing about evicting people
      and destroying rent stabilized [apartments] and Sydney got fired. I mean, so we
      have to be clear that the reason the media has been so reticent about reporting
      on any of this is because this is their social circle. Nick Bryant And according
      to a number of things that I’ve read, six corporations own 90% of the media in
      our country. How hard would it be to, I mean, because I’ve been at this for a
      long time, it’s very easy to compromise people. There’s three things that make
      people really stupid: one is greed, one is arrogance, and one is sex. And a number
      of our politicians and a number of our captains of industry have those three in
      spades. So how hard would it be to compromise someone at the top of one of these
      mega corporations? And then there’s also the Sherman Antitrust Act. These titanic
      media conglomerates could be broken up within a week if we really wanted to use
      the Sherman Antitrust Act because they are what the Sherman Antitrust Act was
      actually conceived for and the government refuses to break up these titanic conglomerates.
      So I have a tendency to think that there might be some kind of symbiosis there
      where the government and the media agree on certain things and not to cover certain
      things. I’m sure that you saw that at the New York Times, especially with the
      war in Iraq. Chris Hedges Yeah. Let’s talk about what we know. Describe for me
      the world around Epstein and how it worked and what to the extent we know Epstein
      did, we know we had cameras all over the place. I think there was a report of
      somebody walking into a room in his New York mansion was just filled with video
      monitors from every room in the mansion but describe to us how that world worked
      and what these powerful figures, Clinton and others, did within it. Nick Bryant
      Well, we got to go back to the Palm Beach Police Department. There was a 14 year
      old girl that told her stepmother that she’d been molested by Jeffrey Epstein.
      And the 14 year old girl took her to the Palm Beach Police Department and she
      told the Palm Beach Police Department. And the Palm Beach Police Department really
      didn’t know much about Epstein. They just thought that he was a multimillionaire
      philanthropic type. They didn’t have a beat on him at all. And the girl described
      the interior of his home and also described his anatomy. And that was enough for
      them to start launching an investigation. And there was a girl named Haley Robson
      who had recruited this girl. And then she was plundering various high schools
      for other underage girls. And she had been used by Epstein when she was a minor
      too and Epstein would give her $200 or $300 for every victim that she recruited.
      The Palm Beach Police Department ultimately found 23 victims of Jeffrey Epstein,
      and they had the statements of five, but then they had corroborating statements
      of 17 people. So they were going to arrest Jeffrey Epstein on five counts of unlawful
      sexual activity with a minor and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation,
      which could have put Jeffrey Epstein in prison for the rest of his life on just
      those counts, but then they knew of 17 other underage victims and that case got
      taken away from them and it was given to a grand jury in Florida. And I don’t
      know if your audience is familiar with how grand juries work, but a special prosecutor
      is chosen to oversee a grand jury and it’s not adversarial. Grand jurors are just
      citizens that have shown up for jury duty and they’ve been filed into a grand
      jury. And the special prosecutor shows them the evidence that he deems or she
      deems is important and calls the witnesses that he or she deems is important.
      And there was a New York Supreme Court judge who said that special prosecutors
      have so much power over grand jurors that they could get them to indict a ham
      sandwich. So what happened with that Epstein case was there were only two victims
      that were called. One had been 14 when she was molested by Epstein and now she
      was 16. And one had been 16 when she was molested by Epstein multiple times and
      now she was 18. And they were skewered by this special prosecutor, just skewered.
      And that grand jury didn’t indict Jeffrey Epstein on a single count of child abuse.
      And what’s very strange is it indicted him on one count of adult pandering. The
      only two victims that testified had been minors. And I’ve got the transcripts
      of, actually, that grand jury and people can go to my website, EpsteinJustice.com
      or the website that I’m the director of a 501(c)(3) called Epstein Justice. I
      show just how ridiculous that grand jury… the grand jurors and the special prosecutor
      are calling these girls prostitutes. I mean, the poor girl was molested when she
      was 14 and it really scarred her. And that’s what people don’t understand is if
      you get molested when you’re 14, it can scar you for the rest of your life. I
      mean, it can really be damaging, just once it can be damaging. So Michael Ryder,
      who was the chief of the Palm Beach Police Department, he is the real hero in
      this story. He would not back down. I mean, and he took lots of threats and there
      was a lot of pressure put on him, but he’s a good guy and he’s an honest guy and
      he’s an ethical guy. He wouldn’t back down. And then he went to the Department
      of Justice and said, he called that grand jury the greatest miscarriage of justice
      in modern times. And he went to the Department of Justice and Alexander Acosta
      was the U.S. Attorney for the District of Southern Florida at that time. And Alexander
      Acosta and the Department of Justice acted like they were going to impanel a grand
      jury, but then there was radio silence. And what they were doing was working out
      a deal with Epstein and his dream team of lawyers, which included Alan Dershowitz
      and Ken Starr, that was so perfidious that it’s kind of mind boggling. And I’ll
      get into it. So they worked out a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein
      and then they sealed it. Now there’s a law called the Victim Crime Right Act and
      according to that law, victims of crimes get to follow the adjudication of their
      perpetrator and actually get to confront their perpetrator, but the Department
      of Justice bypassed all of that and sealed that agreement. And then it was appealed
      and the judge in Florida, Judge [Kenneth] Marra, ultimately wanted to unseal it,
      but then the feds appealed his decision. And it was decided in the 11th Circuit.
      And the 11th Circuit said, this should be unsealed. These documents should be
      unsealed. And it’s a treasure trove. I’ve got emails between Assistant U.S. Attorney
      A. Marie Villafaña and Jay Lefkowitz, who’s one of Epstein’s attorneys. And the
      deal that they put together was so dirty, A. Marie Villafaña, in an email, says
      to Jay Lefkowitz, there’s one magistrate that will sign off on this and we have
      to go before him. So they eventually got their magistrate. But what happened with
      that deal is not only were the victims given, they weren’t given any kind of say
      into what happened to Jeffrey Epstein, but that document gave blanket immunity
      to all of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators. Blanket immunity, everyone. Chris
      Hedges But they didn’t name them, did they? Nick Bryant They named a number of
      them. Yeah. Chris Hedges There were four that were named and then others who are
      unnamed, is that correct? Nick Bryant Yes, there were four that were named. But
      it’s very definitive. It gave blanket immunity to everybody, anybody that was
      associated with Jeffrey Epstein. So after that, Epstein was required, the feds
      made a deal with the state and Epstein was supposed to get 18 months and then
      he served 13. And he would go out during the day and he would actually molest
      underage girls while he was ostensibly… Chris Hedges He only had to be in the
      cell at night? Nick Bryant At night, yes. So he would molest underage girls when
      he was ostensibly incarcerated. And that deal is so dirty. And then Alexander
      Acosta was getting vetted by the Trump administration. He was the U.S. attorney
      for the Southern District. He was getting vetted by the Trump administration as
      Labor Secretary. And he was asked, why did you go so light on Epstein? And he
      said, I was told that Jeffrey Epstein was intelligence and I had to stand down.
      It was above my pay grade. And now, there’s only, and I looked into this and I’ve
      talked to various legal scholars, there’s only two people in the government that
      can tell a US attorney to stand down. One is the attorney general and one is the
      president. And this was in 2007. So the attorney general was Alberto R. Gonzales
      and the president was George Bush II. And I can’t imagine that an attorney general
      is going to tell a US attorney to cover up a nationwide pedophile network without
      getting the okay from his boss, the president. He’s not gonna go out on a limb
      like that. So the Epstein case was covered up at the very apex of the Bush II
      administration. And then the Obama administration continued the coverup and the
      Biden administration and also the Trump administration. Chris Hedges Let’s talk
      a little bit about how it worked. He had his private island. He had a huge opulent
      mansion in New York. He had a large ranch, I think it was in New Mexico. He had
      his Florida residence. He would host these opulent dinners. And by the way, none
      of us really understand why he got all the money he did. He got quite a bit of
      money from Wexner from Victoria’s Secret. There’s been, of course, allegations
      that he had a homosexual relationship with Wexner, I don’t know. But he himself
      didn’t seem to do much. I don’t think he ever finished college, right? He was
      a college dropout or something but he amassed millions upon millions from this
      wealthy clientele. But just talk a little bit how it worked with the island, with
      the people visiting him, just the logistics of it. Nick Bryant When I wrote a
      book called The Franklin Scandal , and the Epstein Scandal is very much a carbon
      copy of the Franklin Scandal in many ways. It was about a nationwide pedophile
      network that was covered up. And there isn’t any books about stuff like this.
      Well, now there is, there’s The Franklin Scandal . But I was trying to wrap my
      head around this whole thing, I mean, a nationwide network trafficking all these
      children, blackmail, intelligence. It has all the stuff that Epstein has. And
      I eventually got a blackmail photographer to talk. And he was very honest with
      me at certain points. And then he became rather unctuous later. But I believe
      that he was telling me the truth early on for the most part. But he told me, I
      said, how does this work? And he said, well, once you’re compromised, it’s like
      you’re on a yacht. It’s a beautiful yacht and it’s a beautiful day and you can
      have anything you want on that yacht. But if you decide to get off that yacht,
      the people on the yacht are going to make sure that you drown. And there’s zero
      incentive. Once someone is compromised, there’s zero incentive for them to get
      off the yacht. And actually being compromised is going to help their career. Dennis
      Hastert is a perfect example. He had been a pederast going back 30 or 40 years.
      And his assent in the House of Representatives was meteoric. And he was the Speaker
      of the House for seven years, even though he had this very dark background. According
      to Sibel Edmonds, she’s an FBI whistleblower, the FBI was aware of Dennis Hastert’s
      shadow life when he was Speaker of the House. So that was obviously a situation
      where they were told to stand down, like Alexander Acosta was told to stand down
      because he was compromised. Chris Hedges Well if you’re compromised, you’re controlled.
      This is what [J. Edgar] Hoover at the FBI did. He had files on everyone and he
      used those files to maintain his own power. Nick Bryant And I think that there’s
      a dark malignant corner of our intelligence. I hate to call it the CIA, but it
      might be some dark malignant corner of the CIA that compromises people. And, kompromat
      is not something that’s new. And our media refuses to talk about it, which I find
      kind of mind boggling because it’s so obvious. There was a Tennessee representative,
      US representative, named Tim Burchett came out about a year and a half ago and
      said, my colleagues are being compromised in honey traps. And actually I had dinner
      with him about four months ago. And I was just amazed that a sitting congressman,
      U.S. congressman would come out and say that my colleagues are being compromised.
      And I was amazed by that type of integrity because I’ve known it for quite some
      time. But kompromat is as old as our republic. Alexander Hamilton was having an
      affair with a 23-year-old. And she was married and her husband was blackmailing
      Alexander Hamilton. And there was a muckraking journalist that came across this
      story and outed Alexander Hamilton as having this affair. And [Thomas] Jefferson
      and Hamilton had a lot of antipathy towards each other. So this muckraking journalist
      felt that he would get some kind of position in Jefferson’s administration. And
      when Jefferson refused, he wrote a story about Jefferson having sex with one of
      his slaves, Sally Hemings. And DNA has shown that there’s definitely, that there
      was a relationship between Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. So when we’re talking
      about kompromat, it’s been going on forever, but it was certainly at the heart
      of our republic. And then there’s one example that I really like to use as far
      as being compromised. [Former United States Senator] Larry Craig was in Washington,
      D.C. for 25 years, and he was a very conservative, anti-gay, family values guy.
      And actually, I think he had the worst record of voting for gay rights in the
      Senate. And I wrote a book called Confessions of a D.C. Madam: The Politics of
      Sex, Lies, and Blackmail , and I wrote it with a guy [Henry Vinson] who ran the
      largest escort service in Washington, D.C.. And he was sending escorts to Craig
      all the time. And then there was a documentary called Outrage . It was made by
      an eminent documentary maker, Kirby Dick. And he looked at closeted politicians
      and how they vote against gay rights. And Craig came up in that movie and Kirby
      interviewed a number of people that had liaisons with Craig and that weren’t involved
      with Henry Vinson. So Craig was in Washington, D.C. for 25 years as a hardcore
      conservative, getting escorts from all over. And what happened to him, he was
      in a bathroom in Minneapolis. And there’s, I guess, like a signaling system for
      gay people in bathrooms where one slaps his foot against the ground and then the
      other one realizes that he’s hot to trot. And so that happened to Craig. He got
      arrested in an airport in Minneapolis for soliciting a vice squad cop. So here’s
      a US senator that’s trying to pick people up in bathrooms. How hard would it be
      to compromise that guy? I mean, a kid, for extra credit, with a smartphone could
      compromise Larry Craig. And I’m from Minneapolis, and I go back to Minneapolis
      about once a year. And I was sitting on a commode in a bathroom, and there was
      a guy in the stall next to me, and he was slapping his foot on the ground. I mean,
      really hard. And I thought to myself, he had some kind of neurological disorder.
      But I’m just glad, I was about to say, can I help you? And I’m just glad that
      I didn’t say that. So when we talk about blackmail, we’ve got multiple examples
      of blackmail. Chris Hedges So who? If these people are compromised, I know it’s
      speculation. I mean, Ghislaine Maxwell’s father, very close ties to the Mossad,
      Robert Maxwell, Ehud Barak, I think he, what is he, recorded 36 times visiting
      Epstein, to the extent that who’s blackmailing who? How is it working? Nick Bryant
      So over the years, I’ve talked to people about kompromat and blackmailing. And
      from what I understand, the three countries that are the bellwethers of blackmail
      are the United States, Israel and the U.K. One would think that Russia would be
      in that mix. Chris Hedges Russia’s pretty high up there. Ask anybody who’s served
      as a diplomat in Moscow. Nick Bryant Absolutely and one would think that Russia
      would be in that mix too. But the people that I’ve talked to about it have said
      that those are the top three: US, Israel, and the UK. So blackmail has been integral
      to our political system and with The Franklin Scandal , with Confessions of a
      D.C. Madam , with Epstein, there was a CIA asset who, when I wrote Confessions
      of a D.C. Madam , there was a CIA asset and we were able to show that it was a
      CIA asset, who was getting gay escorts from Henry Vinson. And we’re talking mid
      80s, he was spending up to $25,000 a month on gay escorts. And his home was wired
      for audiovisual blackmail. And he was definitely a CIA asset. With Epstein, people
      say, was he working for the Mossad? And my reply on that is generally Epstein
      very well might have been working with the Mossad, but I can’t imagine the CIA
      letting the Mossad compromise American politicians on American soil without getting
      a cut of that intelligence. And when I think of the Mossad and I think of the
      CIA, I kind of think of the Genovese crime family and the Gambino crime family.
      They’re always working together. And I think what we have with these intelligence
      services is very large crime families. Although there are people in these intelligence
      services that know nothing about the darker side. I should say that. I have met
      people in the CIA that, or who have worked for the CIA that I think are pretty
      decent. And it’s so compartmentalized there that although one of them had gone
      to a pretty high level, he was not aware of, like MK Ultra, he was not aware of
      that at all. Chris Hedges Let’s talk, Nick, before we close here, about what all
      this means, why it’s important. It has, of course, created divisions within the
      MAGA base who feel betrayed. Why is this important? And what’s going to happen
      next? You know, there were reports once that Ronald Reagan, from his time in Hollywood,
      there was a video of him, I don’t know, having a sexual romp, which the Reagan
      administration managed to quite effectively destroy that may be rumor, I can’t
      remember where I read it, but let’s talk about what all this means. Nick Bryant
      What this means is that with some dark malignant corner of our intelligence, and
      we know about the CIA fomenting coups and releasing mosquitoes with dengue fever
      over Cuba. I mean, the CIA has done a lot of nasty things to a lot of different
      countries. We’ve imposed like [former President of Chile Augusto] Pinochet, the
      Shah [of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi], [Former President of the Republic of Indonesia]
      Suharto, the CIA had their hand in all of that. And those guys are pretty genocidal,
      especially Suharto. Americans have come to accept that. And we’ve been lied to
      a lot. I think we were lied to about the genesis of COVID. I do believe that it
      came out of that Wuhan lab. And actually, there have been a number of scientists
      that have said that it did. And the government has more or less conceded that
      we were lied to about that. No heads rolled. We were lied to about the financial
      meltdown. No heads rolled. And we were lied to about the Iraq war. Blatant lies.
      That actually could have been exposed in real time. But no heads rolled. This
      is different. Chris Hedges Let’s be clear, Nick, those few of us who tried were
      rather ruthlessly pushed aside, to put it mildly. Nick Bryant Yes, it didn’t work
      out very well for you when you tried to tell the truth about Iraq. But molesting
      children, that’s something completely different. Molesting American children.
      That’s something that’s completely different. I think that Americans have learned
      a lot about malfeasance from the CIA over the years, but this is something that
      just is very troubling. And I just think that Americans, they can eat a lot of
      lies but about child sexual abuse and the government’s involvement, they cannot
      eat that lie because when you cover up a crime, you’re aiding and abetting that
      crime. So in the very least, our government is aiding and abetting child trafficking.
      And if you look at the numbers of the abuse that happens in the United States,
      I’m using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) numbers. According to the CDC, 25%
      of underage girls and 5% of underage boys have been molested. And people in the
      field think it’s slightly conservative for underage girls and way too conservative
      for underage boys. But if you just go with the CDC numbers, you’ve got over 50
      million Americans that have been molested when they were underage. And the Department
      of Health and Human Services commissioned a study and that study found that between
      240,000 and 325,000 women and children are trafficked in the United States every
      year. And this is where it gets kind of mind blowing is if we just go with 240,000,
      if we go with the lowest number of the Department of Health and Human Services
      report, there’s a federal human trafficking report that comes out every year.
      And in 2023, which is the latest one, it found that 664 individuals in the United
      States had been charged with child trafficking. And there’s millions of hours
      of child abuse material that infests the internet. And last year, there were 1,375
      individuals that were convicted for making child abuse material and disseminating
      it. So you’ve got millions of Americans that have been molested, that have been
      trafficked. And this is something that people can identify with because it’s so
      ubiquitous in our society. One in four girls have been molested when they were
      underage. So this is something that, regardless of what the CIA has done in the
      past or intelligence has done in the past, this is something that can’t be overlooked.
      And Trump said that he was going to be transparent about this. And that memo that
      they released last week is, I mean, completely fabricated, completely fabricated.
      And I mean, there are some MAGA people that will drink the Kool-Aid, but there’s
      a lot of good people that believed in Trump and they cannot abide by that document.
      They cannot sign off on those lies and that document because that document is
      saying that all these victims of Jeffrey Epstein, all of them, or most of them,
      when they say that they were abused by other people, are lying. And the Epstein
      Victims Compensation Fund was established to give settlements to women that had
      been trafficked and molested by Jeffrey Epstein. 225 women have applied and 150
      settlements have been awarded and 12 women have declined settlements because if
      you get, and David Boies is one of the architects of the victim compensation program,
      I believe he’s a very dirty lawyer, but anyway, he oversaw this and he represented
      a number of these victims. But if you get a settlement from that fund or that
      program, you’ve got to sign an NDA [non-disclosure agreement] and you cannot name
      any other of your perpetrators. So that’s another example of if these girls didn’t
      have other perpetrators, why did they have to sign an NDA where they can’t name
      additional perpetrators? And this is where it gets really ominous. Well, I mean,
      the whole thing is ominous, but it even gets more ominous. I’ve been involved
      in, I’ve been an activist with anti-child trafficking for a number of years, as
      soon as I realized how endemic it was. And the National Center on Sexual Exploitation
      has like a global summit every year, and I’ve spoken at three of those. And I
      spoke at a number of conferences. And over the years, I’ve gotten to know a lot
      of therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists that work with victims of sexual abuse.
      And one of them is an eminent psychologist. Everyone in that field would know
      her name. And she had a client who described the interior of Epstein’s home and
      a number of things about Epstein that she possibly couldn’t have known unless
      she was there. But she was trafficked by Epstein when she was under 10 years old.
      And the psychologist tried to get her compensation from that fund and the fund
      wouldn’t give it to her. And that happened with another therapist that I know
      who believes that she is counseling or has a client of someone who was trafficked
      by Epstein when she was under 10 years old. And that’s another really, really
      egregious side of the media. The media has decided that the youngest victim is
      14, which is really bad, but they’re not going to report on victims under the
      age of 14. And Virginia Giuffre said that these pedophilic orgies definitely had
      girls that were 12. Chris Hedges And let’s mention that she committed suicide.
      I think her father claims, but anyway, she committed suicide. I just want to close
      with Epstein’s death. We don’t have any footage, despite what has been said there.
      The cameras were not working in his cell block, so we don’t know what happened.
      The former New York medical examiner who was hired by his brother and oversaw
      the autopsy claimed that his injuries were consistent with a homicide. Let’s just
      close with that. What happened to Epstein himself. Nick Bryant Well, I mean, there
      were a lot of anomalies that night where cameras weren’t working. You know, the
      Bureau of Prisons took a lot of heat for that. And if they had cogent video of
      that night in Epstein’s cell, they would have released it at that point. What
      was released by the Trump administration was a joke. I mean, even if it wasn’t
      edited, it was still a joke. Chris Hedges Well, it wasn’t anywhere near his cell,
      right? Nick Bryant No, no. But here’s the thing about that. I’ve been approached
      by various news outlets to talk about Jeffrey Epstein’s death, and I generally
      decline because that’s something that you can go around in circles with. What
      I want with Jeffrey Epstein is I want justice for the victims and I want the government
      to come clean. And I started an organization, a 501(c)(3) called Epstein Justice.
      Your audience can go to EpsteinJustice.com . And we have webinars every month.
      And we provide people with the tools that they can use to start putting pressure
      on their legislators. And there was a, let me see if I can find it here. There
      was a motion, House Resolution 3633 that was offered by Representative [Ro] Khanna
      that would require the Attorney General to preserve and release any records related
      to Jeffrey Epstein. Representative [Michelle] Fischbach voted no. Representative
      [Ralph] Norman voted yes. Representative [Erin] Houchin voted no. Representative
      [Nick] Langworthy voted no. Representative Austin Scott voted no, Representative
      [Morgan] Griffith voted no, Representative [Brian] Jack voted no, and then the
      chairperson, Representative [Virginia] Foxx, voted no. It was defeated, it was
      a seven to five defeat. We can name these representatives. These representatives
      are trying to impede our knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein and we’re going to address
      those representatives. And actually, in our next webinar, which is on July 22nd,
      we’re going to show how these representatives have impeded. We got to start calling
      people out individually. Chris Hedges What about Ghislaine Maxwell? She’s serving
      a 20-year sentence. She must know a lot, but she hasn’t spoken. Nick Bryant Well,
      she built the machine, or certainly helped build the machine that destroyed a
      lot of girls. We’re getting mixed messages from what’s happening with Ghislaine
      Maxwell. I mean, for her to only be sentenced to 20 years is a joke because child
      trafficking is a heavy sentence in the federal system. It’s 15 years to life.
      And Ghislaine Maxwell was guilty of multiple counts of child trafficking, but
      she was only indicted on one. And she was given 20 years, but she was indicted
      on two conspiracies. No one else was indicted. I mean, that just shows you how
      screwy this whole thing is. And she was moved in, if you’re an exemplary inmate
      and you’re getting pretty close to the end of your sentence, you’re often moved
      into a dormitory style living, which is very easy, much easier than the bars and
      the cells. She was moved into dormitory living very, very quickly. So she’s been
      treated about as cush as a prisoner can possibly be treated. And she knows a lot.
      I believe that she was told to keep her mouth shut and eat some time and then
      she’ll be taken care of or be able to keep all the money. With the Franklin Scandal,
      you had one of the pimps kept his mouth shut, did about 10 years for crimes that
      weren’t related to child abuse. And then he had a no-show job waiting for him
      in Alexander, Virginia at a BMW dealership. And the other one committed suicide.
      And I think the other one, his name was Craig Spence, it’s speculated on the internet
      that he was suicided. I have a tendency to think that Craig Spence was given a
      deal that he could either kill himself or else the dark malignant corner of intelligence
      that he worked for and compromised people with would kill him. I think that he
      was given that alternative. And because he was a guy that was too used to creature
      comforts and living the high life. And I think Epstein was too. I think Epstein
      was, I don’t think he would have gone gently into that good night, which would
      definitely have been a motive to kill him. Chris Hedges And we should be clear
      that, according to [Michael] Wolff anyway, Trump was considering giving Ghislaine
      Maxwell a pardon. Nick Bryant According to Wolff, I haven’t seen any information
      other than what’s coming from Michael Wolff about that. What’s interesting about
      Maxwell’s adjudication is that it’s been brought to the Supreme Court. She’s been
      denied at every appellate level. And the Department of Justice has put her case
      on suspension twice. So we have no idea what’s going on there, whether the Department
      of Justice is building a bigger case for her against her, although it’s really
      difficult to build a much more airtight case against her, ironclad case. But the
      Department of Justice has suspended the vote, or whether or not the Supreme Court
      is going to listen to the Ghislaine Maxwell case twice. So that is something,
      it could be there’s a huge turnover in the judiciary because of the Trump administration
      or it could be something ominous. We just have to find out. We have to wait and
      see and then we’ll find out. Chris Hedges Great. Thanks, Nick. I want to thank

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, journalist Nick
      Bryant discusses the ongoing implications of the Jeffrey Epstein case, highlighting
      the existence of a pedophilic blackmail network involving powerful individuals
      in America and beyond. Despite the extensive evidence of Epstein's trafficking
      and exploitation of children, including his infamous "black book" and flight logs
      published by Bryant, justice remains elusive as efforts to investigate are hindered
      by political interests. Hedges and Bryant express concern over the current administration's
      reluctance to pursue justice, with figures like Donald Trump dismissing the matter
      as a "hoax." Hedges emphasizes the critical need for support to sustain independent
      journalism amidst increasing challenges to its survival.

      Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report Perhaps the biggest elephant in the room of American
      politics is the existence of a pedophilic blackmail network that involves some
      of the most powerful people in the country and the world. Despite efforts to get
      to the bottom of the Jeffrey Epstein case, which saw the trafficking and sexual
      exploitation of thousands of children, justice continues to be evaded and the
      cabal associated with Epstein — President Donald Trump notwithstanding — continues
      its conspiracy. Nick Bryant is a journalist and author who first published Epstein’s
      infamous “black book” in 2015 as well as Epstein’s flight logs. This information
      exposed the powerful names associated with Epstein and those who likely participated
      in his abhorrent pedophilic escapades as well as those who are likely controlled
      via Epstein’s extensive blackmail apparatus. Bryant joins host Chris Hedges on
      this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to discuss his work as well as the history
      of the Epstein case and what can be expected next. Trump has resorted to calling
      the entire matter a “hoax” and Attorney General Pam Bondi, despite promising to
      release the Epstein files, has recently balked at the idea that there is evidence
      of an Epstein client list. Bryant and Hedges discuss how there is already myriad
      evidence of Epstein’s crimes and relationships but efforts by the current administration
      could cloud the hope for justice. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES:

      Transcript Chris Hedges Following the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein in July 2019,
      federal authorities seized “hundreds—possibly thousands—of sexually suggestive
      photographs of girls who appear underage, as well as hand-labeled compact discs
      with titles like ‘Girl pics nude,’ and, with the names redacted, ‘Young [Name]
      + [Name],’” the New York Times wrote. The pictures and videos were held in the
      safe at Epstein’s New York mansion, which was the size of a closet. Business Insider
      quoted an FBI agent who said “hard drives” were also taken from the safe. The
      refusal by the Trump administration to release the files and videos amassed during
      investigations, should put to rest the absurd idea, embraced by Trump supporters
      and gullible liberals, that Trump will dismantle the Deep State. Trump is part
      of, and has long been part of, the repugnant cabal of politicians – Democrat and
      Republican – billionaires and celebrities who look at us, and often underage girls
      and boys, as commodities to exploit for profit or pleasure. The list of those
      who were in Epstein’s orbit is a who’s who of the rich and famous. They include
      not only Trump , but Bill Clinton , who allegedly took a trip to Thailand with
      Epstein, Prince Andrew , Bill Gates , hedge fund billionaire Glenn Dubin , former
      New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , former Secretary of the Treasury and former
      president of Harvard University Larry Summers , cognitive psychologist and author
      Stephen Pinker , Alan Dershowitz , billionaire and Victoria’s Secret CEO Leslie
      Wexner , the former Barclays banker Jes Staley , former Israeli prime minister
      Ehud Barak , the magician David Copperfield , actor Kevin Spacey , former CIA
      director Bill Burns , real estate mogul Mort Zuckerman , former Maine senator
      George Mitchell and disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , all of whom
      reveled in Epstein’s perpetual Bacchanalia . They also include law firms and high-priced
      attorneys, federal and state prosecutors, private investigators, personal assistants,
      publicists, servants and drivers. They include the numerous procurers and pimps,
      including Epstein’s girlfriend and daughter of Robert Maxwell , Ghislaine Maxwell.
      They include the media and politicians who ruthlessly discredited and silenced
      the victims, and strong armed anyone, including a handful of intrepid reporters,
      seeking to expose Epstein’s crimes and circle of accomplices. There is a lot that
      remains hidden. But there are some things we know. Epstein installed hidden cameras
      in his opulent residences and on his private Caribbean island, Little St. James,
      to capture his high-powered friends engaging in sexual romps and abuse of teenage
      and underage girls and boys. The recordings were blackmail gold. Were they part
      of an intelligence operation on behalf of the Israeli Mossad ? Or were they used
      to ensure that Epstein had a steady source of investors who funneled him millions
      of dollars to avoid being outed? Or were they used for both? He shuttled underage
      girls between New York and Palm Beach on his private jet the Lolita Express ,
      which was allegedly outfitted with a bed for group sex. His coterie of famous
      friends, including Clinton and Trump , are recorded as traveling on the jet numerous
      times. Joining me to discuss the Epstein case is the journalist Nick Bryant who
      uploaded Epstein’s Black Book on the internet in 2015 , which contained the names
      and private phone numbers of a host of powerful and wealthy patrons. He also uploaded
      Epstein’s flight logs from Epstein’s plane, which also contains the names of numerous
      perpetrators. It is probably fair to say that he has singlehandedly released more
      information about the Epstein case than any other single individual, including
      the Attorney General Pam Bondi. Let’s begin with, which I mentioned in the introduction,
      what we know they have. It is quite voluminous. Nick Bryant Well, as you said,
      Epstein’s safe was drilled the day after he was arrested. And there was a huge
      cache of child abuse material that was taken out of his safe. And I think that
      there were other items. I’ve been told that there was blackmail evidence also
      in the safe. So I think that in addition to a huge cache of child abuse material,
      was also blackmail material. And the FBI, the day after Epstein was arrested,
      and I believe the dark apparatus that deploys people like Epstein, they made sure
      that that safe was cleaned out real quickly. And that’s where we get into problems
      with what the Trump administration is saying and Pam Bondi. On February 26, she
      proclaimed that the Epstein files were on her desk and that she was going to open
      it up and there would be full transparency. And then she served us a nothing sandwich.
      There were no new revelations. And like you said, I put more incriminating information
      about Epstein and his network on the Internet in 2015 than she did in 2025. And
      I saw the black book. She included the black book that I put up on the Internet
      and everything was redacted. All the names. We just redacted numbers and then
      there’s lots of victims in the black book too, well over a hundred. And we redacted
      their last name and we redacted their numbers. So Pam Bondi said that she was
      going to go for full transparency and then she served us a nothing sandwich. And
      what she said is that she had been bamboozled by the FBI’s New York field office.
      So she was either inept or lying. And I’m a generous person, so I’m just going
      to go with inept. And then she said that there was a truckload of evidence on
      the Epstein case. And she said only matters of national security would be redacted.
      So now she has to tell us what a bunch of child molesters have to do with national
      security. So she keeps digging herself deeper and deeper into the hole. And she
      acted like that truckload of evidence had never been seen before by anyone. And
      I’m willing to wager everything that I have that that child abuse material and
      everything in Epstein’s safe was being looked at that day and the next day. And
      there were probably some analysts that didn’t even sleep because they wanted to
      know exactly what was in Epstein’s safe. So for her to come out and say that they’re
      looking at it now, it’s unbelievably disingenuous. And her crescendo of mendacity
      was the memo. And no one signed that memo that came out last week. Trump didn’t
      sign it. Bondi didn’t sign it. [Kash] Patel didn’t sign it. No one wanted to sign
      that memo to be held accountable. There are a couple of things about that memo
      that I agree with. I believe that there were more than 300 gigabytes of child
      abuse material taken out of Epstein’s safe. I also believe that there were well
      over a thousand victims because Jeffrey Epstein trafficked girls for 25 years.
      And then things that I strongly disagree with are that he did this by himself
      and that there wasn’t blackmail involved. And if he did this by himself, why is
      Ghislaine Maxwell in prison? And was he going to the island with just some friends
      occasionally? And why are all these girls listed on the flight logs? It is so
      disingenuous. And I think that the Trump administration really underestimated
      the intelligence of Americans and also their knowledge of this case because when
      they first released those documents, they must have felt that that would satiate
      people’s curiosity to understand the Epstein case. And it did not. And then there
      was a huge blowback. Chris Hedges But there was nothing in those documents that
      hadn’t already been released, is that correct? Nick Bryant Nothing new, no new
      revelations whatsoever. As I said, I released more revelations in 2015 than she
      did in 2025. Chris Hedges Do you believe that there is a client list? Nick Bryant
      I believe that there are files. I don’t believe that it was like the Jeffrey Epstein
      travel agency and he kept a list of his clients on his refrigerator with a magnet.
      I don’t believe that. But I believe that there’s definitely a tremendous amount
      of documentation and also video evidence that there are Epstein files and if the
      government really came clean with the Epstein files and what’s on the 300 gigabytes,
      think that we would really find out who the perpetrators are, who Epstein’s co-conspirators
      are. Although we do know a number of them already, we actually would have definitive
      proof. Chris Hedges Let’s talk a little about what we do know and I want you to
      talk about the affidavit that was about the woman under a pseudonym in California
      that was leveled against Trump but from what you released from what we know we
      do have some sense of what these video records may reveal can you talk about and
      that let’s begin with just the Trump case. Nick Bryant When I put the black book
      up on the Internet, the black book was ultimately perlined by Alfredo Rodriguez,
      who was Epstein’s house manager. And he tried to sell it to one of the attorneys
      that was launching civil suits at Epstein. And the attorney called the FBI. And
      the FBI did a sting and impounded the black book. And then I ultimately came by
      the black book through one of the attorneys. And Alfredo Rodriguez had circled
      a number of names in the black book of people that he thought were in cahoots
      with Trump. Chris Hedges With Trump or you mean with Epstein? Nick Bryant With
      Epstein. And then we also had the lawsuit documentation of Virginia Giuffre. Maxwell
      sued her for defamation and she counter sued and Virginia named a number of her
      perpetrators in a lawsuit. And this is where we can get double corroboration.
      For example, Alfredo Rodriguez circled Ghislaine Maxwell, who was definitely a
      perpetrator and a pimp. And Giuffre named her as a perpetrator and a pimp. Alfredo
      Rodriguez circled Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel, and Virginia
      Giuffre named him as a perpetrator and a rather nasty character. Les Wexner’s
      name is circled by Rodriguez and Virginia Giuffre named him as a perpetrator.
      Alan Dershowitz’s name is circled and Virginia Giuffre named him as a perpetrator.
      And Bill Richardson’s name is circled and Giuffre named him as a perpetrator.
      He’s the former New Mexico governor and he was also the Clinton’s energy czar
      and Jean-Luc Brunel’s name is circled and he and Epstein put together, started
      a modeling agency called MC2 and Brunel… Chris Hedges Let me just interrupt Nick
      because it was copied on Trump’s modeling agency. Nick Bryant Yes, yes. And that
      agency, Jean-Luc Brunel was buying girls in Eastern Europe, not renting them,
      but actually buying them. And he was bringing them into the United States. And
      according to Virginia Giuffre’s affidavit that she swore in 2015, Epstein and
      Brunel had some kind of connection with the State Department or some mechanism
      in the government where they were able to get either visas or passports for these
      girls who some of them were well, Virginia says they’re as young as 12 and there’s
      another report that [says] they’re 11 and 12. But then I know of therapists who
      have counseled Epstein victims and we can get into that later. And actually a
      lot of those victims were or a number of those victims were under the age of 10.
      Donald Trump’s name is also circled, but I haven’t found any corroboration that
      he was a pedophilic perpetrator. There was a case launched by Katie Johnson, who’s
      in California, and she said that she had been abused by Trump and Epstein. And
      there was an accompanying affidavit by a woman named Tiffany Doe who said that
      she recruited her. But it’s very difficult to know what exactly went on there
      because she, I guess, was threatened and Lisa Bloom represented her. And from
      what I’ve been told, she was deposited in a hotel. And this is when Trump and
      Hillary [Clinton] were in the homestretch and she was deposited in a hotel. And
      then Lisa Bloom picked her up the next morning and said, we’re going to go to
      a press conference and she wasn’t ready for that. Now that’s what I’ve been told.
      Chris Hedges Now, Nick, she was 13 and Katie Johnson is a pseudonym. In the affidavit,
      she said that apparently Trump liked to watch Epstein’s orgies while he got a
      hand job, that he complained about the oral sex given to him by apparently this
      13 year old and a 12 year old, is that right? Nick Bryant There was a young girl
      named Maria and I don’t think we ever found out her age, but she would have been
      around 12 or 13. Here’s the problem with that. I spent three years looking for
      Katie Johnson. And I ultimately found her. And I’ve sent her some emails. I found
      her about a year and a half ago and I sent her some emails and she will not respond
      to me. And she’s put together a decent life for herself. She’s selling real estate
      in the Southwest. She’s got a boyfriend. You can see how her life’s unfolded on
      Facebook. And she goes to Europe with her boyfriend occasionally. So she’s put
      together a really comfortable life for herself. And she doesn’t want to talk to
      anybody about it. Chris Hedges Didn’t she get, I don’t know to which point this
      is alleged, but wasn’t she paid off? Nick Bryant We don’t know. It was more the
      threats that, it was the threats and then the press conference that really decided
      that when she decided that she was going to recant everything that she said. Unfortunately,
      because of how she was handled, it’s very difficult to know exactly what went
      on. And that’s why I looked for her for three years, I really wanted to know her
      story, but she wouldn’t get back to me. So I don’t know what to make of that,
      of the affidavit. Chris Hedges Alright, but the charge is out there but let’s
      talk a little bit about what we do know about Dershowitz, for instance, who makes
      these claims that he only traveled on the Lolita Express with his wife. You know
      the flight logs are exposing that to be untrue. But what do we do know about what
      happened with these powerful men did within this Epstein orbit? Nick Bryant Well,
      Dershowitz has long been a misogynist, for sure. And what happened with Dershowitz
      is Virginia Giuffre submitted an affidavit and said that she had been molested
      by him up to approximately six times. And then Dershowitz went on an offensive
      against her two attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell. And Cassell had been
      a former federal judge. Dershowitz was pounding on his chest saying “I’m gonna
      get their licenses to practice law. I’m gonna make sure that they never practice
      law again. I only fly with my wife. She flies everywhere with me!” Well, then
      I got the logs and actually Dershowitz is taking lots of flights with girls like
      “Tatiana” and “Claire” and his wife is noticeably absent from those flight logs.
      And in the Gawker article I wrote, he was asked, what about this girl? What about
      that girl? And his steel trap mind became rather rusty because he couldn’t remember
      those girls. And actually, when we asked him what the third, there was another,
      a third girl that was, her last name was unknown and he decided to diffuse it
      with humor. He said, that could have been my mother. So with Dershowitz, and he’s
      lobbied for the age of consent to be 14, regardless of someone’s partner, which
      is pretty horrible. But he believes in that. And I think that there’s somewhere
      where he’s written that child pornography should be legal or child abuse material
      should be legal. So Alan Dershowitz doesn’t seem to be an ethical bellwether.
      And his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein demonstrates that they were very,
      very close. And there was a Vanity Fair article about Epstein in 2001 and Dershowitz
      is extolling the virtues of Jeffrey Epstein. And he says, and then he gets really
      quaint at the end. He goes, “if Jeffrey Epstein didn’t have any money, I would
      still eat hot dogs with him at Coney Island.” Chris Hedges Well, let’s talk about
      Trump because Trump had a 15 year relationship with Epstein. I mean, according
      to Trump’s biographer, they were very close for a long time. Nick Bryant According
      to Michael Wolff, yes, they were very close. And we don’t really know what caused
      the chasm. Michael Wolff says it was a real estate deal that went awry. Other
      people say that it was, Epstein was trying to procure underage girls at Mar-a-Lago.
      So it’s hard to know what caused that divide. But yes, they were very, very good
      friends. Chris Hedges But Nick, I mean, Wolff claims that they shared women. Nick
      Bryant And Wolff also claims that he saw pictures of topless underage girls on
      Trump’s lap too. So these are the things that Michael Wolff has said and he’s
      got a lot of recordings, but he hasn’t made them public. So it’s going to be interesting.
      When I had the black book in 2012, no one wanted to touch it. No one. And I went
      to every publication in New York City and I was talking to editors and publishers
      and no one wanted to touch it. And then when we published it in 2015, I mean the
      floodgates opened and there have been tons of ink dumped on stories about the
      black book since then. Now, Wolff is saying that he has all these recordings,
      but no one in the mainstream media is willing to touch it, which you think at
      this point, someone in the mainstream media would go for it. So that’s a little
      perplexing to me, but I also know that I’ve been writing about this realm for
      22 years and the mainstream media gets very, very tenuous when these types of
      subjects are brought up. Chris Hedges Well, let me tell you why. Because the people
      who run these organizations circulate among these groups. These are their friends.
      That’s how stories got killed at the New York Times. The real estate developers
      who were all socializing with [A.G.] Sulzberger, when he was the publisher when
      I was there, complained about Sydney Schanberg’s writing about evicting people
      and destroying rent stabilized [apartments] and Sydney got fired. I mean, so we
      have to be clear that the reason the media has been so reticent about reporting
      on any of this is because this is their social circle. Nick Bryant And according
      to a number of things that I’ve read, six corporations own 90% of the media in
      our country. How hard would it be to, I mean, because I’ve been at this for a
      long time, it’s very easy to compromise people. There’s three things that make
      people really stupid: one is greed, one is arrogance, and one is sex. And a number
      of our politicians and a number of our captains of industry have those three in
      spades. So how hard would it be to compromise someone at the top of one of these
      mega corporations? And then there’s also the Sherman Antitrust Act. These titanic
      media conglomerates could be broken up within a week if we really wanted to use
      the Sherman Antitrust Act because they are what the Sherman Antitrust Act was
      actually conceived for and the government refuses to break up these titanic conglomerates.
      So I have a tendency to think that there might be some kind of symbiosis there
      where the government and the media agree on certain things and not to cover certain
      things. I’m sure that you saw that at the New York Times, especially with the
      war in Iraq. Chris Hedges Yeah. Let’s talk about what we know. Describe for me
      the world around Epstein and how it worked and what to the extent we know Epstein
      did, we know we had cameras all over the place. I think there was a report of
      somebody walking into a room in his New York mansion was just filled with video
      monitors from every room in the mansion but describe to us how that world worked
      and what these powerful figures, Clinton and others, did within it. Nick Bryant
      Well, we got to go back to the Palm Beach Police Department. There was a 14 year
      old girl that told her stepmother that she’d been molested by Jeffrey Epstein.
      And the 14 year old girl took her to the Palm Beach Police Department and she
      told the Palm Beach Police Department. And the Palm Beach Police Department really
      didn’t know much about Epstein. They just thought that he was a multimillionaire
      philanthropic type. They didn’t have a beat on him at all. And the girl described
      the interior of his home and also described his anatomy. And that was enough for
      them to start launching an investigation. And there was a girl named Haley Robson
      who had recruited this girl. And then she was plundering various high schools
      for other underage girls. And she had been used by Epstein when she was a minor
      too and Epstein would give her $200 or $300 for every victim that she recruited.
      The Palm Beach Police Department ultimately found 23 victims of Jeffrey Epstein,
      and they had the statements of five, but then they had corroborating statements
      of 17 people. So they were going to arrest Jeffrey Epstein on five counts of unlawful
      sexual activity with a minor and one count of lewd and lascivious molestation,
      which could have put Jeffrey Epstein in prison for the rest of his life on just
      those counts, but then they knew of 17 other underage victims and that case got
      taken away from them and it was given to a grand jury in Florida. And I don’t
      know if your audience is familiar with how grand juries work, but a special prosecutor
      is chosen to oversee a grand jury and it’s not adversarial. Grand jurors are just
      citizens that have shown up for jury duty and they’ve been filed into a grand
      jury. And the special prosecutor shows them the evidence that he deems or she
      deems is important and calls the witnesses that he or she deems is important.
      And there was a New York Supreme Court judge who said that special prosecutors
      have so much power over grand jurors that they could get them to indict a ham
      sandwich. So what happened with that Epstein case was there were only two victims
      that were called. One had been 14 when she was molested by Epstein and now she
      was 16. And one had been 16 when she was molested by Epstein multiple times and
      now she was 18. And they were skewered by this special prosecutor, just skewered.
      And that grand jury didn’t indict Jeffrey Epstein on a single count of child abuse.
      And what’s very strange is it indicted him on one count of adult pandering. The
      only two victims that testified had been minors. And I’ve got the transcripts
      of, actually, that grand jury and people can go to my website, EpsteinJustice.com
      or the website that I’m the director of a 501(c)(3) called Epstein Justice. I
      show just how ridiculous that grand jury… the grand jurors and the special prosecutor
      are calling these girls prostitutes. I mean, the poor girl was molested when she
      was 14 and it really scarred her. And that’s what people don’t understand is if
      you get molested when you’re 14, it can scar you for the rest of your life. I
      mean, it can really be damaging, just once it can be damaging. So Michael Ryder,
      who was the chief of the Palm Beach Police Department, he is the real hero in
      this story. He would not back down. I mean, and he took lots of threats and there
      was a lot of pressure put on him, but he’s a good guy and he’s an honest guy and
      he’s an ethical guy. He wouldn’t back down. And then he went to the Department
      of Justice and said, he called that grand jury the greatest miscarriage of justice
      in modern times. And he went to the Department of Justice and Alexander Acosta
      was the U.S. Attorney for the District of Southern Florida at that time. And Alexander
      Acosta and the Department of Justice acted like they were going to impanel a grand
      jury, but then there was radio silence. And what they were doing was working out
      a deal with Epstein and his dream team of lawyers, which included Alan Dershowitz
      and Ken Starr, that was so perfidious that it’s kind of mind boggling. And I’ll
      get into it. So they worked out a non-prosecution agreement with Jeffrey Epstein
      and then they sealed it. Now there’s a law called the Victim Crime Right Act and
      according to that law, victims of crimes get to follow the adjudication of their
      perpetrator and actually get to confront their perpetrator, but the Department
      of Justice bypassed all of that and sealed that agreement. And then it was appealed
      and the judge in Florida, Judge [Kenneth] Marra, ultimately wanted to unseal it,
      but then the feds appealed his decision. And it was decided in the 11th Circuit.
      And the 11th Circuit said, this should be unsealed. These documents should be
      unsealed. And it’s a treasure trove. I’ve got emails between Assistant U.S. Attorney
      A. Marie Villafaña and Jay Lefkowitz, who’s one of Epstein’s attorneys. And the
      deal that they put together was so dirty, A. Marie Villafaña, in an email, says
      to Jay Lefkowitz, there’s one magistrate that will sign off on this and we have
      to go before him. So they eventually got their magistrate. But what happened with
      that deal is not only were the victims given, they weren’t given any kind of say
      into what happened to Jeffrey Epstein, but that document gave blanket immunity
      to all of Jeffrey Epstein’s co-conspirators. Blanket immunity, everyone. Chris
      Hedges But they didn’t name them, did they? Nick Bryant They named a number of
      them. Yeah. Chris Hedges There were four that were named and then others who are
      unnamed, is that correct? Nick Bryant Yes, there were four that were named. But
      it’s very definitive. It gave blanket immunity to everybody, anybody that was
      associated with Jeffrey Epstein. So after that, Epstein was required, the feds
      made a deal with the state and Epstein was supposed to get 18 months and then
      he served 13. And he would go out during the day and he would actually molest
      underage girls while he was ostensibly… Chris Hedges He only had to be in the
      cell at night? Nick Bryant At night, yes. So he would molest underage girls when
      he was ostensibly incarcerated. And that deal is so dirty. And then Alexander
      Acosta was getting vetted by the Trump administration. He was the U.S. attorney
      for the Southern District. He was getting vetted by the Trump administration as
      Labor Secretary. And he was asked, why did you go so light on Epstein? And he
      said, I was told that Jeffrey Epstein was intelligence and I had to stand down.
      It was above my pay grade. And now, there’s only, and I looked into this and I’ve
      talked to various legal scholars, there’s only two people in the government that
      can tell a US attorney to stand down. One is the attorney general and one is the
      president. And this was in 2007. So the attorney general was Alberto R. Gonzales
      and the president was George Bush II. And I can’t imagine that an attorney general
      is going to tell a US attorney to cover up a nationwide pedophile network without
      getting the okay from his boss, the president. He’s not gonna go out on a limb
      like that. So the Epstein case was covered up at the very apex of the Bush II
      administration. And then the Obama administration continued the coverup and the
      Biden administration and also the Trump administration. Chris Hedges Let’s talk
      a little bit about how it worked. He had his private island. He had a huge opulent
      mansion in New York. He had a large ranch, I think it was in New Mexico. He had
      his Florida residence. He would host these opulent dinners. And by the way, none
      of us really understand why he got all the money he did. He got quite a bit of
      money from Wexner from Victoria’s Secret. There’s been, of course, allegations
      that he had a homosexual relationship with Wexner, I don’t know. But he himself
      didn’t seem to do much. I don’t think he ever finished college, right? He was
      a college dropout or something but he amassed millions upon millions from this
      wealthy clientele. But just talk a little bit how it worked with the island, with
      the people visiting him, just the logistics of it. Nick Bryant When I wrote a
      book called The Franklin Scandal , and the Epstein Scandal is very much a carbon
      copy of the Franklin Scandal in many ways. It was about a nationwide pedophile
      network that was covered up. And there isn’t any books about stuff like this.
      Well, now there is, there’s The Franklin Scandal . But I was trying to wrap my
      head around this whole thing, I mean, a nationwide network trafficking all these
      children, blackmail, intelligence. It has all the stuff that Epstein has. And
      I eventually got a blackmail photographer to talk. And he was very honest with
      me at certain points. And then he became rather unctuous later. But I believe
      that he was telling me the truth early on for the most part. But he told me, I
      said, how does this work? And he said, well, once you’re compromised, it’s like
      you’re on a yacht. It’s a beautiful yacht and it’s a beautiful day and you can
      have anything you want on that yacht. But if you decide to get off that yacht,
      the people on the yacht are going to make sure that you drown. And there’s zero
      incentive. Once someone is compromised, there’s zero incentive for them to get
      off the yacht. And actually being compromised is going to help their career. Dennis
      Hastert is a perfect example. He had been a pederast going back 30 or 40 years.
      And his assent in the House of Representatives was meteoric. And he was the Speaker
      of the House for seven years, even though he had this very dark background. According
      to Sibel Edmonds, she’s an FBI whistleblower, the FBI was aware of Dennis Hastert’s
      shadow life when he was Speaker of the House. So that was obviously a situation
      where they were told to stand down, like Alexander Acosta was told to stand down
      because he was compromised. Chris Hedges Well if you’re compromised, you’re controlled.
      This is what [J. Edgar] Hoover at the FBI did. He had files on everyone and he
      used those files to maintain his own power. Nick Bryant And I think that there’s
      a dark malignant corner of our intelligence. I hate to call it the CIA, but it
      might be some dark malignant corner of the CIA that compromises people. And, kompromat
      is not something that’s new. And our media refuses to talk about it, which I find
      kind of mind boggling because it’s so obvious. There was a Tennessee representative,
      US representative, named Tim Burchett came out about a year and a half ago and
      said, my colleagues are being compromised in honey traps. And actually I had dinner
      with him about four months ago. And I was just amazed that a sitting congressman,
      U.S. congressman would come out and say that my colleagues are being compromised.
      And I was amazed by that type of integrity because I’ve known it for quite some
      time. But kompromat is as old as our republic. Alexander Hamilton was having an
      affair with a 23-year-old. And she was married and her husband was blackmailing
      Alexander Hamilton. And there was a muckraking journalist that came across this
      story and outed Alexander Hamilton as having this affair. And [Thomas] Jefferson
      and Hamilton had a lot of antipathy towards each other. So this muckraking journalist
      felt that he would get some kind of position in Jefferson’s administration. And
      when Jefferson refused, he wrote a story about Jefferson having sex with one of
      his slaves, Sally Hemings. And DNA has shown that there’s definitely, that there
      was a relationship between Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. So when we’re talking
      about kompromat, it’s been going on forever, but it was certainly at the heart
      of our republic. And then there’s one example that I really like to use as far
      as being compromised. [Former United States Senator] Larry Craig was in Washington,
      D.C. for 25 years, and he was a very conservative, anti-gay, family values guy.
      And actually, I think he had the worst record of voting for gay rights in the
      Senate. And I wrote a book called Confessions of a D.C. Madam: The Politics of
      Sex, Lies, and Blackmail , and I wrote it with a guy [Henry Vinson] who ran the
      largest escort service in Washington, D.C.. And he was sending escorts to Craig
      all the time. And then there was a documentary called Outrage . It was made by
      an eminent documentary maker, Kirby Dick. And he looked at closeted politicians
      and how they vote against gay rights. And Craig came up in that movie and Kirby
      interviewed a number of people that had liaisons with Craig and that weren’t involved
      with Henry Vinson. So Craig was in Washington, D.C. for 25 years as a hardcore
      conservative, getting escorts from all over. And what happened to him, he was
      in a bathroom in Minneapolis. And there’s, I guess, like a signaling system for
      gay people in bathrooms where one slaps his foot against the ground and then the
      other one realizes that he’s hot to trot. And so that happened to Craig. He got
      arrested in an airport in Minneapolis for soliciting a vice squad cop. So here’s
      a US senator that’s trying to pick people up in bathrooms. How hard would it be
      to compromise that guy? I mean, a kid, for extra credit, with a smartphone could
      compromise Larry Craig. And I’m from Minneapolis, and I go back to Minneapolis
      about once a year. And I was sitting on a commode in a bathroom, and there was
      a guy in the stall next to me, and he was slapping his foot on the ground. I mean,
      really hard. And I thought to myself, he had some kind of neurological disorder.
      But I’m just glad, I was about to say, can I help you? And I’m just glad that
      I didn’t say that. So when we talk about blackmail, we’ve got multiple examples
      of blackmail. Chris Hedges So who? If these people are compromised, I know it’s
      speculation. I mean, Ghislaine Maxwell’s father, very close ties to the Mossad,
      Robert Maxwell, Ehud Barak, I think he, what is he, recorded 36 times visiting
      Epstein, to the extent that who’s blackmailing who? How is it working? Nick Bryant
      So over the years, I’ve talked to people about kompromat and blackmailing. And
      from what I understand, the three countries that are the bellwethers of blackmail
      are the United States, Israel and the U.K. One would think that Russia would be
      in that mix. Chris Hedges Russia’s pretty high up there. Ask anybody who’s served
      as a diplomat in Moscow. Nick Bryant Absolutely and one would think that Russia
      would be in that mix too. But the people that I’ve talked to about it have said
      that those are the top three: US, Israel, and the UK. So blackmail has been integral
      to our political system and with The Franklin Scandal , with Confessions of a
      D.C. Madam , with Epstein, there was a CIA asset who, when I wrote Confessions
      of a D.C. Madam , there was a CIA asset and we were able to show that it was a
      CIA asset, who was getting gay escorts from Henry Vinson. And we’re talking mid
      80s, he was spending up to $25,000 a month on gay escorts. And his home was wired
      for audiovisual blackmail. And he was definitely a CIA asset. With Epstein, people
      say, was he working for the Mossad? And my reply on that is generally Epstein
      very well might have been working with the Mossad, but I can’t imagine the CIA
      letting the Mossad compromise American politicians on American soil without getting
      a cut of that intelligence. And when I think of the Mossad and I think of the
      CIA, I kind of think of the Genovese crime family and the Gambino crime family.
      They’re always working together. And I think what we have with these intelligence
      services is very large crime families. Although there are people in these intelligence
      services that know nothing about the darker side. I should say that. I have met
      people in the CIA that, or who have worked for the CIA that I think are pretty
      decent. And it’s so compartmentalized there that although one of them had gone
      to a pretty high level, he was not aware of, like MK Ultra, he was not aware of
      that at all. Chris Hedges Let’s talk, Nick, before we close here, about what all
      this means, why it’s important. It has, of course, created divisions within the
      MAGA base who feel betrayed. Why is this important? And what’s going to happen
      next? You know, there were reports once that Ronald Reagan, from his time in Hollywood,
      there was a video of him, I don’t know, having a sexual romp, which the Reagan
      administration managed to quite effectively destroy that may be rumor, I can’t
      remember where I read it, but let’s talk about what all this means. Nick Bryant
      What this means is that with some dark malignant corner of our intelligence, and
      we know about the CIA fomenting coups and releasing mosquitoes with dengue fever
      over Cuba. I mean, the CIA has done a lot of nasty things to a lot of different
      countries. We’ve imposed like [former President of Chile Augusto] Pinochet, the
      Shah [of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi], [Former President of the Republic of Indonesia]
      Suharto, the CIA had their hand in all of that. And those guys are pretty genocidal,
      especially Suharto. Americans have come to accept that. And we’ve been lied to
      a lot. I think we were lied to about the genesis of COVID. I do believe that it
      came out of that Wuhan lab. And actually, there have been a number of scientists
      that have said that it did. And the government has more or less conceded that
      we were lied to about that. No heads rolled. We were lied to about the financial
      meltdown. No heads rolled. And we were lied to about the Iraq war. Blatant lies.
      That actually could have been exposed in real time. But no heads rolled. This
      is different. Chris Hedges Let’s be clear, Nick, those few of us who tried were
      rather ruthlessly pushed aside, to put it mildly. Nick Bryant Yes, it didn’t work
      out very well for you when you tried to tell the truth about Iraq. But molesting
      children, that’s something completely different. Molesting American children.
      That’s something that’s completely different. I think that Americans have learned
      a lot about malfeasance from the CIA over the years, but this is something that
      just is very troubling. And I just think that Americans, they can eat a lot of
      lies but about child sexual abuse and the government’s involvement, they cannot
      eat that lie because when you cover up a crime, you’re aiding and abetting that
      crime. So in the very least, our government is aiding and abetting child trafficking.
      And if you look at the numbers of the abuse that happens in the United States,
      I’m using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) numbers. According to the CDC, 25%
      of underage girls and 5% of underage boys have been molested. And people in the
      field think it’s slightly conservative for underage girls and way too conservative
      for underage boys. But if you just go with the CDC numbers, you’ve got over 50
      million Americans that have been molested when they were underage. And the Department
      of Health and Human Services commissioned a study and that study found that between
      240,000 and 325,000 women and children are trafficked in the United States every
      year. And this is where it gets kind of mind blowing is if we just go with 240,000,
      if we go with the lowest number of the Department of Health and Human Services
      report, there’s a federal human trafficking report that comes out every year.
      And in 2023, which is the latest one, it found that 664 individuals in the United
      States had been charged with child trafficking. And there’s millions of hours
      of child abuse material that infests the internet. And last year, there were 1,375
      individuals that were convicted for making child abuse material and disseminating
      it. So you’ve got millions of Americans that have been molested, that have been
      trafficked. And this is something that people can identify with because it’s so
      ubiquitous in our society. One in four girls have been molested when they were
      underage. So this is something that, regardless of what the CIA has done in the
      past or intelligence has done in the past, this is something that can’t be overlooked.
      And Trump said that he was going to be transparent about this. And that memo that
      they released last week is, I mean, completely fabricated, completely fabricated.
      And I mean, there are some MAGA people that will drink the Kool-Aid, but there’s
      a lot of good people that believed in Trump and they cannot abide by that document.
      They cannot sign off on those lies and that document because that document is
      saying that all these victims of Jeffrey Epstein, all of them, or most of them,
      when they say that they were abused by other people, are lying. And the Epstein
      Victims Compensation Fund was established to give settlements to women that had
      been trafficked and molested by Jeffrey Epstein. 225 women have applied and 150
      settlements have been awarded and 12 women have declined settlements because if
      you get, and David Boies is one of the architects of the victim compensation program,
      I believe he’s a very dirty lawyer, but anyway, he oversaw this and he represented
      a number of these victims. But if you get a settlement from that fund or that
      program, you’ve got to sign an NDA [non-disclosure agreement] and you cannot name
      any other of your perpetrators. So that’s another example of if these girls didn’t
      have other perpetrators, why did they have to sign an NDA where they can’t name
      additional perpetrators? And this is where it gets really ominous. Well, I mean,
      the whole thing is ominous, but it even gets more ominous. I’ve been involved
      in, I’ve been an activist with anti-child trafficking for a number of years, as
      soon as I realized how endemic it was. And the National Center on Sexual Exploitation
      has like a global summit every year, and I’ve spoken at three of those. And I
      spoke at a number of conferences. And over the years, I’ve gotten to know a lot
      of therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists that work with victims of sexual abuse.
      And one of them is an eminent psychologist. Everyone in that field would know
      her name. And she had a client who described the interior of Epstein’s home and
      a number of things about Epstein that she possibly couldn’t have known unless
      she was there. But she was trafficked by Epstein when she was under 10 years old.
      And the psychologist tried to get her compensation from that fund and the fund
      wouldn’t give it to her. And that happened with another therapist that I know
      who believes that she is counseling or has a client of someone who was trafficked
      by Epstein when she was under 10 years old. And that’s another really, really
      egregious side of the media. The media has decided that the youngest victim is
      14, which is really bad, but they’re not going to report on victims under the
      age of 14. And Virginia Giuffre said that these pedophilic orgies definitely had
      girls that were 12. Chris Hedges And let’s mention that she committed suicide.
      I think her father claims, but anyway, she committed suicide. I just want to close
      with Epstein’s death. We don’t have any footage, despite what has been said there.
      The cameras were not working in his cell block, so we don’t know what happened.
      The former New York medical examiner who was hired by his brother and oversaw
      the autopsy claimed that his injuries were consistent with a homicide. Let’s just
      close with that. What happened to Epstein himself. Nick Bryant Well, I mean, there
      were a lot of anomalies that night where cameras weren’t working. You know, the
      Bureau of Prisons took a lot of heat for that. And if they had cogent video of
      that night in Epstein’s cell, they would have released it at that point. What
      was released by the Trump administration was a joke. I mean, even if it wasn’t
      edited, it was still a joke. Chris Hedges Well, it wasn’t anywhere near his cell,
      right? Nick Bryant No, no. But here’s the thing about that. I’ve been approached
      by various news outlets to talk about Jeffrey Epstein’s death, and I generally
      decline because that’s something that you can go around in circles with. What
      I want with Jeffrey Epstein is I want justice for the victims and I want the government
      to come clean. And I started an organization, a 501(c)(3) called Epstein Justice.
      Your audience can go to EpsteinJustice.com . And we have webinars every month.
      And we provide people with the tools that they can use to start putting pressure
      on their legislators. And there was a, let me see if I can find it here. There
      was a motion, House Resolution 3633 that was offered by Representative [Ro] Khanna
      that would require the Attorney General to preserve and release any records related
      to Jeffrey Epstein. Representative [Michelle] Fischbach voted no. Representative
      [Ralph] Norman voted yes. Representative [Erin] Houchin voted no. Representative
      [Nick] Langworthy voted no. Representative Austin Scott voted no, Representative
      [Morgan] Griffith voted no, Representative [Brian] Jack voted no, and then the
      chairperson, Representative [Virginia] Foxx, voted no. It was defeated, it was
      a seven to five defeat. We can name these representatives. These representatives
      are trying to impede our knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein and we’re going to address
      those representatives. And actually, in our next webinar, which is on July 22nd,
      we’re going to show how these representatives have impeded. We got to start calling
      people out individually. Chris Hedges What about Ghislaine Maxwell? She’s serving
      a 20-year sentence. She must know a lot, but she hasn’t spoken. Nick Bryant Well,
      she built the machine, or certainly helped build the machine that destroyed a
      lot of girls. We’re getting mixed messages from what’s happening with Ghislaine
      Maxwell. I mean, for her to only be sentenced to 20 years is a joke because child
      trafficking is a heavy sentence in the federal system. It’s 15 years to life.
      And Ghislaine Maxwell was guilty of multiple counts of child trafficking, but
      she was only indicted on one. And she was given 20 years, but she was indicted
      on two conspiracies. No one else was indicted. I mean, that just shows you how
      screwy this whole thing is. And she was moved in, if you’re an exemplary inmate
      and you’re getting pretty close to the end of your sentence, you’re often moved
      into a dormitory style living, which is very easy, much easier than the bars and
      the cells. She was moved into dormitory living very, very quickly. So she’s been
      treated about as cush as a prisoner can possibly be treated. And she knows a lot.
      I believe that she was told to keep her mouth shut and eat some time and then
      she’ll be taken care of or be able to keep all the money. With the Franklin Scandal,
      you had one of the pimps kept his mouth shut, did about 10 years for crimes that
      weren’t related to child abuse. And then he had a no-show job waiting for him
      in Alexander, Virginia at a BMW dealership. And the other one committed suicide.
      And I think the other one, his name was Craig Spence, it’s speculated on the internet
      that he was suicided. I have a tendency to think that Craig Spence was given a
      deal that he could either kill himself or else the dark malignant corner of intelligence
      that he worked for and compromised people with would kill him. I think that he
      was given that alternative. And because he was a guy that was too used to creature
      comforts and living the high life. And I think Epstein was too. I think Epstein
      was, I don’t think he would have gone gently into that good night, which would
      definitely have been a motive to kill him. Chris Hedges And we should be clear
      that, according to [Michael] Wolff anyway, Trump was considering giving Ghislaine
      Maxwell a pardon. Nick Bryant According to Wolff, I haven’t seen any information
      other than what’s coming from Michael Wolff about that. What’s interesting about
      Maxwell’s adjudication is that it’s been brought to the Supreme Court. She’s been
      denied at every appellate level. And the Department of Justice has put her case
      on suspension twice. So we have no idea what’s going on there, whether the Department
      of Justice is building a bigger case for her against her, although it’s really
      difficult to build a much more airtight case against her, ironclad case. But the
      Department of Justice has suspended the vote, or whether or not the Supreme Court
      is going to listen to the Ghislaine Maxwell case twice. So that is something,
      it could be there’s a huge turnover in the judiciary because of the Trump administration
      or it could be something ominous. We just have to find out. We have to wait and
      see and then we’ll find out. Chris Hedges Great. Thanks, Nick. I want to thank

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, journalist Nick
      Bryant discusses the ongoing implications of the Jeffrey Epstein case, highlighting
      the existence of a pedophilic blackmail network involving powerful individuals
      in America and beyond. Despite the extensive evidence of Epstein's trafficking
      and exploitation of children, including his infamous "black book" and flight logs
      published by Bryant, justice remains elusive as efforts to investigate are hindered
      by political interests. Hedges and Bryant express concern over the current administration's
      reluctance to pursue justice, with figures like Donald Trump dismissing the matter
      as a "hoax." Hedges emphasizes the critical need for support to sustain independent
      journalism amidst increasing challenges to its survival.

    text: 'Illustration by MintPress News In one of the scariest moments in modern history,
      we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it
      but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News While it continues its conflict with
      its neighbors, Israel is fighting another war just as intensely, spending gigantic
      amounts of money bombarding Europe with messaging justifying their actions, and
      scaremongering Europeans that Iranian nuclear missiles will soon be turning their
      cities into rubble. A MintPress study has found that, since it struck Iran on
      June 13, the Israeli Government Advertising Agency has paid for tens of millions
      of advertisements on YouTube alone. In clear breach of Google’s policies, these
      ads justify and lionize the attack as a necessary defense of Western civilization,
      and claim that Israel is carrying out “one of the largest humanitarian missions
      in the world” in Gaza. The countries most targeted by this campaign include the
      United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Greece. Information War “A fanatical
      regime firing missiles at civilians, while racing towards nuclear weapons. While
      Iran deliberately targets cities, Israel acts with precision to dismantle this
      threat.” Thus starts one Israeli government ad that hundreds of thousands of YouTube
      viewers in Europe have been compelled to watch. “Terror architects behind the
      elimination of Israel plan: eliminated. Israel targets only military and terror
      sites, not civilians. But the threat remains,” the voiceover continues, over ominous
      music and high-tech graphics. “We will finish the mission for our people, for
      humanity. Israel does what must be done,” it concludes. “Iran’s ballistic missile
      program isn’t just a threat to Israel, it is a threat to Europe and the Western
      world,” another , seen by 1.5 million viewers in just three weeks, claims. “Iran
      is developing missiles with ranges of approximately 4000 km. That places Europe
      within the regime’s striking distance,” it adds, as graphics show virtually the
      entire continent turning blood red, signifying a nuclear attack. “This isn’t tomorrow’s
      threat. It is today’s reality. The threat posed by the Iranian regime must be
      stopped. Israel does what must be done.” Ominous messages like these, translated
      into multiple languages, have reached tens of millions of people across Europe.
      Other Israeli government ads take a different tack, attempting to present Israel
      as a virtuous victim and an unwilling participant in war. As one commercial notes:
      Imagine this: you are holding your newborn in a hospital room. Then the air raid
      sirens go off. Iran fires ballistic missiles at hospitals, at innocent Israelis.
      Patients, doctors, newborn babies: deliberately targeted. While Iran aims at families
      and children, Israel responds with precision, striking military sites. This is
      not a war of choice. Those who target civilians and hospitals become the target.”
      The claims made in such videos are often highly questionable. For example, around
      935 Iranians were killed in Israeli strikes, compared to just 28 Israelis, suggesting
      Israel is far less careful to avoid civilian deaths than its opponent. Indeed,
      since October 2023, Israel has repeatedly and deliberately targeted hospitals.
      The World Health Organization has documented at least 697 Israeli strikes on medical
      facilities. Ninety-four percent of Gaza’s hospitals have been destroyed or damaged,
      and more than 1,400 medical personnel have been killed . This includes Dr. Adnan
      al-Bursh, head of orthopedics at al-Shifa Hospital, who was reportedly raped to
      death by Israeli prison guards. According to UNICEF, Israel has killed or injured
      over 50,000 Palestinian children. An American nurse who worked in Gaza told MintPress
      News that IDF soldiers regularly shoot boys in the genitals to prevent them from
      reproducing. Despite this, Israeli advertising presents the country as the savior
      of the Palestinian people. One Ministry of Foreign Affairs video , set to epic,
      inspiring music, describes Israel as undertaking “One of the largest humanitarian
      operations in the world right now.” “This is what real aid looks like. Smiles
      don’t lie. Hamas does,” it concludes. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special
      rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, called the commercial “scandalous”
      and directly challenged YouTube: “How can this be allowed?” The video has been
      translated into Italian, French, German, and Greek, and has been viewed by nearly
      seven million people on YouTube alone. Transparently Inorganic All referenced
      videos appear in the Google Ads Transparency Center as paid content from the Israeli
      Government Advertising Agency, and there is strong evidence that few, if any,
      of their millions of views are organic. The five versions of the “Gaza Humanitarian
      Aid” video, for example, collectively have only a few thousand “likes”—barely
      1% of what would be generally expected of videos with this amount of views—and
      only two comments in total. The difference between organic and paid content is
      clearer in videos that Israel has not promoted. Other videos on Israel’s Ministry
      of Foreign Affairs YouTube channel receive only tens of views per day, not millions,
      which strongly suggests that close to 100% of their traffic is paid advertising.
      The scale of this public relations operation is difficult to overstate. Even as
      the Israeli government hikes taxes and slashes domestic spending, its foreign
      PR budget has grown by more than 2,000%, the Foreign Ministry receiving $150 million
      more for public diplomacy. Much of that money is evidently being spent on ads.
      In the past month, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has uploaded videos
      that have topped 45 million views on YouTube alone. The countries most targeted
      include the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Greece. Greece is a particularly
      noteworthy case. Over the past 12 months, the Israeli government advertising agency
      has funded 65 separate YouTube ad campaigns targeting the country. The Greek version
      of a recent ad —titled “An efficient system is in place, delivering aid where
      it’s needed”—presents Israel as a benevolent bringer of life to Gaza and has garnered
      over 1 million views in just four days, equivalent to nearly 10% of Greece’s entire
      population. The video currently has no comments and fewer than 3,000 likes. The
      Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs uploads its videos in English, French, German,
      Italian, and Greek. Countries that do not speak these languages—such as Slovakia,
      Denmark, and the Netherlands—are still targeted, though users there generally
      receive the English version. Israel has avoided targeting nations whose governments
      have formally condemned its actions, such as Ireland or Spain, spending nothing
      to reach those populations. The Netanyahu administration, evidently, has decided
      to attempt to shore up support in allied countries, even as their populations
      increasingly turn against Israel. While many of these figures might shock readers,
      this investigation only examined the advertising campaign of a single organization,
      the Israeli Government Advertising Agency, and on a single platform, YouTube.
      It does not include other Israeli government and non-governmental groups, nor
      the myriad organizations collectively comprising the pro-Israel lobby in the West.
      Israel has also attempted to influence the debate on other platforms, including
      Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. What is presented here is merely the
      thinnest slice of a much broader operation. Israel and Silicon Valley Some videos
      the Israeli government has released attempt to portray Israel in a positive light,
      but instead perpetuate racist stereotypes about Western civilization and its supposed
      superiority. In one ad, Benjamin Netanyahu states (emphasis added): I want to
      assure the civilized world, we will not let the world’s most dangerous regime
      get the world’s most dangerous weapons. The increasing range of Iran’s ballistic
      missiles would bring that nuclear nightmare to the cities of Europe and eventually
      to America .” Thus, the Israeli prime minister implies that Iran’s threat matters
      only if it endangers the so-called “civilized world,” that is, Europe and North
      America. “Never again is now. Today, Israel has shown that we have learned the
      lessons of history,” Netanyahu continues, directly comparing the 12-Day War (which
      Israel started) to the Holocaust. “When enemies vow to destroy you, believe them.
      When enemies build weapons of mass death, stop them. As the Bible teaches us,
      when someone comes to kill you, rise and act first.” Google’s advertising rules
      explicitly prohibit commercials that “display shocking content or promote hatred,
      intolerance, discrimination, or violence.” Yet many of the ads described here
      explicitly justify Israeli aggression. MintPress News contacted Google to ask
      how much the Israeli government’s advertising agency spent on ads, how many impressions
      those ads generated, whether the company had a response to Albanese’s comments,
      and whether the videos violated its policies. Google did not answer the first
      three questions and reiterated that it has “strict ad policies that govern the
      types of ads we allow on our platform.” “These policies are publicly available,
      and we enforce them consistently and without bias. If we find ads that violate
      those policies, we swiftly remove them,” the company added, implying that it does
      not consider the ads a violation of its standards. Few who have studied Google’s
      connections to the Israeli government will be surprised that the Silicon Valley
      giant grants enormous leeway to the Netanyahu administration. Former CEO Eric
      Schmidt is known as one of Israel’s most vocal supporters. Google has been financially
      invested in Israel since at least 2006, when it opened its first offices in Tel
      Aviv. In 2012, at a meeting with Netanyahu himself, Schmidt declared that “the
      decision to invest in Israel was one of the best that Google has ever made.” Company
      co-founder Sergey Brin has also come to the defense of Israel, denouncing the
      United Nations as “transparently anti-Semitic” and telling Google staff that using
      the word “genocide” to describe Israeli actions in Gaza is “deeply offensive to
      many Jewish people who have suffered actual genocides.” Earlier this year, with
      the Israeli economy in dire straits following its 18-month campaign against its
      neighbors, Schmidt’s company came to the rescue, injecting billions into Israel
      in a record-setting acquisition. Google purchased local cybersecurity firm Wiz
      for $32 billion. The monumental sum paid—equivalent to 65 times Wiz’s annual revenue
      and boosting the Israeli economy by 0.6%—left some analysts wondering if the deal
      had more to do with underwriting the Israeli economy than making a shrewd business
      investment. It also raises questions about the safety of Google users’ most sensitive
      personal data, given that Wiz was founded and continues to be staffed by former
      Israeli spies from the intelligence group, Unit 8200. Google has a long history
      of working closely with Israeli intelligence. A 2022 MintPress News investigation
      identified at least 99 former Unit 8200 agents employed by Google. Among them
      is Gavriel Goidel, head of strategy and operations for Google Research. Goidel
      joined Google in 2022 after a six-year career in military intelligence, during
      which he rose to become Head of Learning at Unit 8200. There, he led a large team
      of operatives who sifted through intelligence data to “understand patterns of
      hostile activists,” according to his own account . The Turning Tide Google is
      far from the only tech giant recruiting Israeli spies to run their most politically
      sensitive departments. The same study found that hundreds of former Unit 8200
      intelligence agents are employed at companies such as Meta (formerly Facebook),
      Microsoft, and Amazon. And a significant amount of what America reads about the
      Middle East is also written by ex-Israeli spies. A MintPress investigation from
      earlier this year uncovered a network of Unit 8200 alums working in top newsrooms
      across America. Wikipedia is another key theater of war for the Israeli state.
      A project overseen by future Prime Minister Naftali Bennett deployed thousands
      of young Israelis to monitor and edit the online encyclopedia, removing troublesome
      facts and framing articles more favorably in Israel’s favor. Those who made the
      most edits would receive rewards, including free hot air balloon rides. The Ministry
      of Foreign Affairs has also launched a campaign to harass and intimidate American
      students, establishing a “task force” to carry out psychological operations aimed
      at, in its own words, “inflicting economic and employment consequences” against
      pro-Palestine protestors. While Foreign Minister Eli Cohen heads the task force,
      it stresses that its actions “should not have the signature of the State of Israel
      on it.” Amid mounting criticism, the Israeli government has sought to turn the
      tide by inviting influencers for direct talks with Netanyahu. In April, the Israeli
      prime minister met face-to-face with conservative internet personalities, including

      Seth Mandel; and Mollie Hemingway, where they discussed how best to sell war with
      Iran to Western publics, and how to counter anti-Zionist sentiment online. Other
      social media personalities report having been offered large sums of money in exchange
      for a few words of support for Israel. In terms of turning the tide of European
      public opinion, Israel has its work cut out for it. A recent YouGov survey found
      the country was widely reviled across the continent. More than 20 times as many
      Italians, for instance, hold “very unfavorable” (43%) views of Israel than “very
      favorable” ones (2%). Even in Germany, where popular support for Israel is highest,
      only 21% said they hold favorable opinions of the state (including only 4% highly
      favorable), with 65% displaying open opposition (including 32% who strongly dislike
      it). A massive plurality of Britons, meanwhile, agreed with the statement: “Israel
      treats the Palestinians like the Nazis treated the Jews.” Forty-eight percent
      answered in the affirmative, as opposed to just 13% who disagreed. This is despite
      European governments offering full-throated support to Israel, and even criminalizing
      pro-Palestine protests and persecuting journalists who oppose Western support
      for Tel Aviv. The government of Israel is spending millions of dollars daily on
      gigantic advertising campaigns aimed at turning the tide of public opinion. To
      that end, it is developing a PR network as sophisticated as the advanced weapons
      systems it uses on its neighbors. On YouTube alone, its paid advertising, translated
      into five languages, has reached at least 45 million people in the past month.
      Whether this strategy will ultimately prove effective remains unclear. After all,
      it is difficult to convince the public to support a genocide. Editor’s Note :

    one_sentence_summary: Israel is waging a significant propaganda campaign in Europe,
      spending millions on advertisements that justify its military actions and portray
      its operations in Gaza as a humanitarian mission, despite violating Google's advertising
      policies.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses Israel's extensive advertising campaign
      in Europe, aimed at justifying its military actions against Iran and portraying
      them as a defense of Western civilization. Following an attack on Iran, the Israeli
      Government Advertising Agency has invested heavily in YouTube ads that breach
      Google's policies, depicting Israel's operations in Gaza as humanitarian missions
      while framing Iran as a significant threat due to its missile program. The campaign
      targets several European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, with
      messaging that emphasizes the dangers posed by Iran and positions Israel as a
      protector of both its own people and Western interests.

      we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it
      but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News While it continues its conflict with
      its neighbors, Israel is fighting another war just as intensely, spending gigantic
      amounts of money bombarding Europe with messaging justifying their actions, and
      scaremongering Europeans that Iranian nuclear missiles will soon be turning their
      cities into rubble. A MintPress study has found that, since it struck Iran on
      June 13, the Israeli Government Advertising Agency has paid for tens of millions
      of advertisements on YouTube alone. In clear breach of Google’s policies, these
      ads justify and lionize the attack as a necessary defense of Western civilization,
      and claim that Israel is carrying out “one of the largest humanitarian missions
      in the world” in Gaza. The countries most targeted by this campaign include the
      United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Greece. Information War “A fanatical
      regime firing missiles at civilians, while racing towards nuclear weapons. While
      Iran deliberately targets cities, Israel acts with precision to dismantle this
      threat.” Thus starts one Israeli government ad that hundreds of thousands of YouTube
      viewers in Europe have been compelled to watch. “Terror architects behind the
      elimination of Israel plan: eliminated. Israel targets only military and terror
      sites, not civilians. But the threat remains,” the voiceover continues, over ominous
      music and high-tech graphics. “We will finish the mission for our people, for
      humanity. Israel does what must be done,” it concludes. “Iran’s ballistic missile
      program isn’t just a threat to Israel, it is a threat to Europe and the Western
      world,” another , seen by 1.5 million viewers in just three weeks, claims. “Iran
      is developing missiles with ranges of approximately 4000 km. That places Europe
      within the regime’s striking distance,” it adds, as graphics show virtually the
      entire continent turning blood red, signifying a nuclear attack. “This isn’t tomorrow’s
      threat. It is today’s reality. The threat posed by the Iranian regime must be
      stopped. Israel does what must be done.” Ominous messages like these, translated
      into multiple languages, have reached tens of millions of people across Europe.
      Other Israeli government ads take a different tack, attempting to present Israel
      as a virtuous victim and an unwilling participant in war. As one commercial notes:
      Imagine this: you are holding your newborn in a hospital room. Then the air raid
      sirens go off. Iran fires ballistic missiles at hospitals, at innocent Israelis.
      Patients, doctors, newborn babies: deliberately targeted. While Iran aims at families
      and children, Israel responds with precision, striking military sites. This is
      not a war of choice. Those who target civilians and hospitals become the target.”
      The claims made in such videos are often highly questionable. For example, around
      935 Iranians were killed in Israeli strikes, compared to just 28 Israelis, suggesting
      Israel is far less careful to avoid civilian deaths than its opponent. Indeed,
      since October 2023, Israel has repeatedly and deliberately targeted hospitals.
      The World Health Organization has documented at least 697 Israeli strikes on medical
      facilities. Ninety-four percent of Gaza’s hospitals have been destroyed or damaged,
      and more than 1,400 medical personnel have been killed . This includes Dr. Adnan
      al-Bursh, head of orthopedics at al-Shifa Hospital, who was reportedly raped to
      death by Israeli prison guards. According to UNICEF, Israel has killed or injured
      over 50,000 Palestinian children. An American nurse who worked in Gaza told MintPress
      News that IDF soldiers regularly shoot boys in the genitals to prevent them from
      reproducing. Despite this, Israeli advertising presents the country as the savior
      of the Palestinian people. One Ministry of Foreign Affairs video , set to epic,
      inspiring music, describes Israel as undertaking “One of the largest humanitarian
      operations in the world right now.” “This is what real aid looks like. Smiles
      don’t lie. Hamas does,” it concludes. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special
      rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, called the commercial “scandalous”
      and directly challenged YouTube: “How can this be allowed?” The video has been
      translated into Italian, French, German, and Greek, and has been viewed by nearly
      seven million people on YouTube alone. Transparently Inorganic All referenced
      videos appear in the Google Ads Transparency Center as paid content from the Israeli
      Government Advertising Agency, and there is strong evidence that few, if any,
      of their millions of views are organic. The five versions of the “Gaza Humanitarian
      Aid” video, for example, collectively have only a few thousand “likes”—barely
      1% of what would be generally expected of videos with this amount of views—and
      only two comments in total. The difference between organic and paid content is
      clearer in videos that Israel has not promoted. Other videos on Israel’s Ministry
      of Foreign Affairs YouTube channel receive only tens of views per day, not millions,
      which strongly suggests that close to 100% of their traffic is paid advertising.
      The scale of this public relations operation is difficult to overstate. Even as
      the Israeli government hikes taxes and slashes domestic spending, its foreign
      PR budget has grown by more than 2,000%, the Foreign Ministry receiving $150 million
      more for public diplomacy. Much of that money is evidently being spent on ads.
      In the past month, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has uploaded videos
      that have topped 45 million views on YouTube alone. The countries most targeted
      include the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Greece. Greece is a particularly
      noteworthy case. Over the past 12 months, the Israeli government advertising agency
      has funded 65 separate YouTube ad campaigns targeting the country. The Greek version
      of a recent ad —titled “An efficient system is in place, delivering aid where
      it’s needed”—presents Israel as a benevolent bringer of life to Gaza and has garnered
      over 1 million views in just four days, equivalent to nearly 10% of Greece’s entire
      population. The video currently has no comments and fewer than 3,000 likes. The
      Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs uploads its videos in English, French, German,
      Italian, and Greek. Countries that do not speak these languages—such as Slovakia,
      Denmark, and the Netherlands—are still targeted, though users there generally
      receive the English version. Israel has avoided targeting nations whose governments
      have formally condemned its actions, such as Ireland or Spain, spending nothing
      to reach those populations. The Netanyahu administration, evidently, has decided
      to attempt to shore up support in allied countries, even as their populations
      increasingly turn against Israel. While many of these figures might shock readers,
      this investigation only examined the advertising campaign of a single organization,
      the Israeli Government Advertising Agency, and on a single platform, YouTube.
      It does not include other Israeli government and non-governmental groups, nor
      the myriad organizations collectively comprising the pro-Israel lobby in the West.
      Israel has also attempted to influence the debate on other platforms, including
      Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. What is presented here is merely the
      thinnest slice of a much broader operation. Israel and Silicon Valley Some videos
      the Israeli government has released attempt to portray Israel in a positive light,
      but instead perpetuate racist stereotypes about Western civilization and its supposed
      superiority. In one ad, Benjamin Netanyahu states (emphasis added): I want to
      assure the civilized world, we will not let the world’s most dangerous regime
      get the world’s most dangerous weapons. The increasing range of Iran’s ballistic
      missiles would bring that nuclear nightmare to the cities of Europe and eventually
      to America .” Thus, the Israeli prime minister implies that Iran’s threat matters
      only if it endangers the so-called “civilized world,” that is, Europe and North
      America. “Never again is now. Today, Israel has shown that we have learned the
      lessons of history,” Netanyahu continues, directly comparing the 12-Day War (which
      Israel started) to the Holocaust. “When enemies vow to destroy you, believe them.
      When enemies build weapons of mass death, stop them. As the Bible teaches us,
      when someone comes to kill you, rise and act first.” Google’s advertising rules
      explicitly prohibit commercials that “display shocking content or promote hatred,
      intolerance, discrimination, or violence.” Yet many of the ads described here
      explicitly justify Israeli aggression. MintPress News contacted Google to ask
      how much the Israeli government’s advertising agency spent on ads, how many impressions
      those ads generated, whether the company had a response to Albanese’s comments,
      and whether the videos violated its policies. Google did not answer the first
      three questions and reiterated that it has “strict ad policies that govern the
      types of ads we allow on our platform.” “These policies are publicly available,
      and we enforce them consistently and without bias. If we find ads that violate
      those policies, we swiftly remove them,” the company added, implying that it does
      not consider the ads a violation of its standards. Few who have studied Google’s
      connections to the Israeli government will be surprised that the Silicon Valley
      giant grants enormous leeway to the Netanyahu administration. Former CEO Eric
      Schmidt is known as one of Israel’s most vocal supporters. Google has been financially
      invested in Israel since at least 2006, when it opened its first offices in Tel
      Aviv. In 2012, at a meeting with Netanyahu himself, Schmidt declared that “the
      decision to invest in Israel was one of the best that Google has ever made.” Company
      co-founder Sergey Brin has also come to the defense of Israel, denouncing the
      United Nations as “transparently anti-Semitic” and telling Google staff that using
      the word “genocide” to describe Israeli actions in Gaza is “deeply offensive to
      many Jewish people who have suffered actual genocides.” Earlier this year, with
      the Israeli economy in dire straits following its 18-month campaign against its
      neighbors, Schmidt’s company came to the rescue, injecting billions into Israel
      in a record-setting acquisition. Google purchased local cybersecurity firm Wiz
      for $32 billion. The monumental sum paid—equivalent to 65 times Wiz’s annual revenue
      and boosting the Israeli economy by 0.6%—left some analysts wondering if the deal
      had more to do with underwriting the Israeli economy than making a shrewd business
      investment. It also raises questions about the safety of Google users’ most sensitive
      personal data, given that Wiz was founded and continues to be staffed by former
      Israeli spies from the intelligence group, Unit 8200. Google has a long history
      of working closely with Israeli intelligence. A 2022 MintPress News investigation
      identified at least 99 former Unit 8200 agents employed by Google. Among them
      is Gavriel Goidel, head of strategy and operations for Google Research. Goidel
      joined Google in 2022 after a six-year career in military intelligence, during
      which he rose to become Head of Learning at Unit 8200. There, he led a large team
      of operatives who sifted through intelligence data to “understand patterns of
      hostile activists,” according to his own account . The Turning Tide Google is
      far from the only tech giant recruiting Israeli spies to run their most politically
      sensitive departments. The same study found that hundreds of former Unit 8200
      intelligence agents are employed at companies such as Meta (formerly Facebook),
      Microsoft, and Amazon. And a significant amount of what America reads about the
      Middle East is also written by ex-Israeli spies. A MintPress investigation from
      earlier this year uncovered a network of Unit 8200 alums working in top newsrooms
      across America. Wikipedia is another key theater of war for the Israeli state.
      A project overseen by future Prime Minister Naftali Bennett deployed thousands
      of young Israelis to monitor and edit the online encyclopedia, removing troublesome
      facts and framing articles more favorably in Israel’s favor. Those who made the
      most edits would receive rewards, including free hot air balloon rides. The Ministry
      of Foreign Affairs has also launched a campaign to harass and intimidate American
      students, establishing a “task force” to carry out psychological operations aimed
      at, in its own words, “inflicting economic and employment consequences” against
      pro-Palestine protestors. While Foreign Minister Eli Cohen heads the task force,
      it stresses that its actions “should not have the signature of the State of Israel
      on it.” Amid mounting criticism, the Israeli government has sought to turn the
      tide by inviting influencers for direct talks with Netanyahu. In April, the Israeli
      prime minister met face-to-face with conservative internet personalities, including
      Tim Pool; Dave Rubin; Sean Spicer; Bethany Mandel; David Harris Jr.; Jessica Krause;
      Seth Mandel; and Mollie Hemingway, where they discussed how best to sell war with
      Iran to Western publics, and how to counter anti-Zionist sentiment online. Other
      social media personalities report having been offered large sums of money in exchange
      for a few words of support for Israel. In terms of turning the tide of European
      public opinion, Israel has its work cut out for it. A recent YouGov survey found
      the country was widely reviled across the continent. More than 20 times as many
      Italians, for instance, hold “very unfavorable” (43%) views of Israel than “very
      favorable” ones (2%). Even in Germany, where popular support for Israel is highest,
      only 21% said they hold favorable opinions of the state (including only 4% highly
      favorable), with 65% displaying open opposition (including 32% who strongly dislike
      it). A massive plurality of Britons, meanwhile, agreed with the statement: “Israel
      treats the Palestinians like the Nazis treated the Jews.” Forty-eight percent
      answered in the affirmative, as opposed to just 13% who disagreed. This is despite
      European governments offering full-throated support to Israel, and even criminalizing
      pro-Palestine protests and persecuting journalists who oppose Western support
      for Tel Aviv. The government of Israel is spending millions of dollars daily on
      gigantic advertising campaigns aimed at turning the tide of public opinion. To
      that end, it is developing a PR network as sophisticated as the advanced weapons
      systems it uses on its neighbors. On YouTube alone, its paid advertising, translated
      into five languages, has reached at least 45 million people in the past month.
      Whether this strategy will ultimately prove effective remains unclear. After all,
      it is difficult to convince the public to support a genocide. Editor’s Note :

      Syrian government targets on Wednesday, hitting the Syrian Defense Ministry and
      near the presidential palace in Damascus, killing at least three people and wounding
      34. The heavy Israeli attack came despite a US push to reach a normalization deal
      between Israel and the al-Qaeda-linked Syrian government that took power in Damascus
      following the regime change that ousted former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
      in December 2024. According to a report from Axios , Israel carried out the airstrikes
      despite pressure from the US to “stand down,” which was conveyed by US Ambassador
      to Turkey Tom Barrack in a call with Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.
      “We told the Israelis to stand down and take a breath,” a US official told the
      outlet. Huge explosions were seen in Damascus as Israel bombed Syria’s defence
      ministry during a live Al Jazeera broadcast nearby. pic.twitter.com/Fe7N6xH02I
      — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) July 16, 2025 Israel carried out the airstrikes
      following clashes in the southern Syrian city of Suwayda. Several days ago, fighting
      broke out between the Druze minority and Bedouin tribes, with forces from the
      HTS-led Syrian government intervening on the side of the Bedouins and also committing
      summary executions of Druze civilians. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz justified
      the heavy strikes in Damascus by claiming Israel was looking to protect the Druze,
      and he suggested that more attacks will come. “The warnings in Damascus have ended
      – now painful blows will come,” Katz wrote on X. “The IDF will continue to operate
      forcefully in Suwayda to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until their
      complete withdrawal.” Katz also shared a video on X of a live news broadcast that
      caught the bombing of the Defense Ministry on camera. “The painful blows have
      begun,” he said. According to a report from Israel’s Channel 12, Israel is planning
      a “prolonged” military operation in Syria following the Damascus attacks. Israeli
      strikes were also reported in Suwayda and in the countryside of Deraa, which is
      also located in southern Syria. While Israel is framing its attacks as support
      for the Druze, Israel’s real motive is likely that it doesn’t want to agree to
      a normalization deal with Syria since it would have to give up territory it has
      captured in its invasion of southern Syria, which was launched after the ousting
      of Assad. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated the
      regime change and took credit for helping set it in motion. The new Syrian government
      under the leadership of former al-Qaeda leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has been very deferential
      toward Israel and has not launched any attacks on Israel despite the invasion
      and frequent Israeli airstrikes against Syrian territory. Damascus has also been
      engaged in talks with Israel about a normalization deal. Editor’s Note : A t a

      following clashes in the southern Syrian city of Suwayda. Several days ago, fighting
      broke out between the Druze minority and Bedouin tribes, with forces from the
      HTS-led Syrian government intervening on the side of the Bedouins and also committing
      summary executions of Druze civilians. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz justified
      the heavy strikes in Damascus by claiming Israel was looking to protect the Druze,
      and he suggested that more attacks will come. “The warnings in Damascus have ended
      – now painful blows will come,” Katz wrote on X. “The IDF will continue to operate
      forcefully in Suwayda to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until their
      complete withdrawal.” Katz also shared a video on X of a live news broadcast that
      caught the bombing of the Defense Ministry on camera. “The painful blows have
      begun,” he said. According to a report from Israel’s Channel 12, Israel is planning
      a “prolonged” military operation in Syria following the Damascus attacks. Israeli
      strikes were also reported in Suwayda and in the countryside of Deraa, which is
      also located in southern Syria. While Israel is framing its attacks as support
      for the Druze, Israel’s real motive is likely that it doesn’t want to agree to
      a normalization deal with Syria since it would have to give up territory it has
      captured in its invasion of southern Syria, which was launched after the ousting
      of Assad. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrated the
      regime change and took credit for helping set it in motion. The new Syrian government
      under the leadership of former al-Qaeda leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has been very deferential
      toward Israel and has not launched any attacks on Israel despite the invasion
      and frequent Israeli airstrikes against Syrian territory. Damascus has also been
      engaged in talks with Israel about a normalization deal. Editor’s Note : A t a

    one_sentence_summary: Israel conducted significant airstrikes on Syrian government
      sites in Damascus, resulting in casualties, despite US efforts to facilitate a
      normalization deal between Israel and the newly established Syrian government
      following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad.
    paragraph_summary: In a significant escalation of military conflict, Israel conducted
      heavy airstrikes on Syrian government targets in Damascus, including the Defense
      Ministry and areas near the presidential palace, resulting in at least three fatalities
      and 34 injuries. This attack occurred despite U.S. efforts to broker a normalization
      deal between Israel and the new Syrian government, which is linked to al-Qaeda
      and emerged following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. U.S. officials
      had urged Israel to refrain from military action, but Israeli Defense Minister
      Israel Katz defended the strikes as necessary for the protection of the Druze
      minority amid recent clashes in southern Syria. Katz indicated that further military
      operations would follow, signaling a potential escalation in the region.

      By Julia Conley / Common Dreams A leading scholar of the Holocaust and genocide
      warned Tuesday the continued “silence” of many in his field of study regarding
      Israel’s massacre of Palestinians in Gaza “has made a mockery of the slogan ‘never
      again’ ‘ ” as he outlined in a New York Times opinion piece how he came to conclude
      that Israel is committing genocide in the besieged enclave. “I’m a Genocide Scholar,”
      reads the essay’s headline. “I Know It When I See It.” Like a number of other
      experts who were at first reluctant to designate the assault on Gaza a genocide—the
      term coined by Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin in 1944—Brown University professor
      of Holocaust and Genocide Studies Omer Bartov gradually came to recognize Israel’s
      campaign of targeted starvation, bombings on civilian infrastructure, forced displacement,
      and other attacks as genocidal violence as he watched the early months of the
      war in late 2023 and early 2024. By May 2024, he wrote at the Times , “it appeared
      no longer possible to deny that the pattern of [Israel Defense Forces] operations
      was consistent with the statements denoting genocidal intent made by Israeli leaders
      in the days after the Hamas attack,” including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
      threat to turn Gaza into “rubble” and his call for Israeli citizens to remember
      “what Amalek did to you”—a reference to the biblical passage calling on the Israelites
      to “kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings” in their fight against an
      ancient enemy. At that point, about 1 million Palestinians had been ordered to
      the so-called “safe zone” of al-Mawasi—which was then targeted in numerous attacks
      . Months after one top Israeli official called for the “ total annihilation ”
      of Gaza—home to more than 2 million people—Bartov concluded that the government’s
      “actions could be understood only as the implementation of the expressed intent
      to make the Gaza Strip uninhabitable for its Palestinian population.” He wrote
      that his interpretation of Israel’s actions is now that Netanyahu’s government
      wants “to force the population to leave the strip altogether” and “debilitate
      the enclave through bombings and severe deprivation of food, clean water, sanitation,
      and medical aid to such an extent that it is impossible for Palestinians in Gaza
      to maintain or reconstitute their existence as a group.” “My inescapable conclusion
      has become that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,”
      wrote Bartov, noting that his assessment is that of an expert who grew up in a
      Zionist home, spent the first half of his life in Israel, and served in the IDF
      as well as researching the Holocaust and other war crimes. “This was a painful
      conclusion to reach, and one that I resisted as long as I could,” wrote Bartov.
      “But I have been teaching classes on genocide for a quarter of a century. I can
      recognize one when I see one.” He added that his conclusion is supported by the
      destruction of an estimated 174,000 buildings, or 70% of those in Gaza; the killing
      of more than 58,000 people, nearly a third of whom have been children and nearly
      900 of whom were under one year old; and the extermination of more than 2,000
      families in their entirety. CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour noted that Bartov spoke
      to her last December about his conclusion that Israel is committing genocide.
      “If you look at the pattern of what the IDF has been doing, not only has it been
      moving the population around, every safe zone… tends to get also bombed and shelled,”
      he said at the time. “But also systematically destroying universities, schools,
      mosques, museums, and hospitals, of course—anything that makes for the health
      and also the culture of a group, and therefore, by now we have a population that
      is being completely debilitated.” In a new op-ed for @nytimes , professor of Holocaust
      and genocide studies @bartov_omer explains why he believes "Israel is committing
      genocide against the Palestinian people," something Israel denies: https://t.co/PQOctG5hhr
      Back in December, I spoke with Professor Bartov about… pic.twitter.com/UebDmM57k4
      — Christiane Amanpour (@amanpour) July 15, 2025 Bartov published his essay as
      the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said
      it had recorded the deaths of 875 Palestinians who were killed while seeking aid,
      with the vast majority killed at or around aid hubs set up by the Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF), a U.S.- and Israel-backed privatized aid group that has been
      rejected by the U.N. due to its lack of neutrality. “The latest deadly incident
      happened at around 9:00 am on Monday, July 14, when reports indicated that the
      Israeli military shelled and fired towards Palestinians seeking food at the GHF
      site in As Shakoush area, northwestern Rafah,” said the OHCHR on Monday of an
      attack that killed at least two people and injured nine others—days after a hospital
      in Rafah received more than 130 patients, the majority of whom suffered gunshot
      wounds they’d sustained while trying to access food distribution sites. Last May,
      former Human Rights Watch executive director Aryeh Neier—who was also reluctant
      to apply the term “genocide” to Israel’s attack on Gaza— said Israel’s “sustained
      policy of obstructing the movement of humanitarian assistance into the territory”
      was what finally convinced him the assault is a genocide. While backing the militarized
      GHF aid operation, Israel has continued to block humanitarian assistance from
      entering Gaza through crossings and has prevented experienced aid groups from
      distributing food to starving Palestinians. Israel “has always insisted that any
      threat to its security must be seen as potentially leading to another Auschwitz”
      and has portrayed its attack on Gaza—which it and its allies in the U.S. and other
      Western countries have persistently claimed it is targeting Hamas—as a fight against
      an enemy comparable to the Nazis. “The daily scenes of horror in Gaza, from which
      the Israeli public is shielded by its own media’s self-censorship, expose the
      lies of Israeli propaganda that this is a war of defense against a Nazi-like enemy,”
      wrote Bartov. Progressive political strategist Waleed Shahid suggested Bartov’s
      conclusions flew in the face of recent comments by U.S. Senate Minority Leader
      Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who in March said the term “genocide” as it related to
      Gaza should be rejected as antisemitism. Chuck Schumer, 3/16/25: “A lot of the
      slogans that people use either are or slide into antisemitism. The one that bothers
      me the most is genocide.” Israeli scholar of genocide: “My inescapable conclusion
      has become that Israel is committing genocide.” https://t.co/6UekcZ3QKz — Waleed
      Shahid (@_waleedshahid) July 15, 2025 Bartov warned that the refusal of many Holocaust
      scholars and the political establishment in the U.S.—the largest international
      funder of the IDF—to confront the reality of Israel’s attack on Gaza could ultimately
      make it impossible “to continue teaching and researching the Holocaust in the
      same manner we did before.” “Just as worrisome is the prospect that the study
      of genocide as a whole will not survive the accusations of antisemitism, leaving
      us without the crucial community of scholars and international jurists to stand
      in the breach at a time when the rise of intolerance, racial hatred, populism,
      and authoritarianism is threatening the values that were at the core of these
      scholarly, cultural, and political endeavors of the 20th century,” wrote Bartov.
      He expressed hope that “a new generation of Israelis will face their future without
      sheltering in the shadow of the Holocaust, even as they will have to bear the
      stain of the genocide in Gaza perpetrated in their name.” “Israel,” he added,
      “will have to learn to live without falling back on the Holocaust as justification
      for inhumanity.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said on 14 July that Hungary will not participate
      in financing US weapons for Ukraine, even if Washington formally proposes the
      initiative to the EU. “I would like to emphasize that Hungarian money, Hungarian
      weapons, and Hungarian soldiers will not be sent to Ukraine. Nothing will be sent
      there,” Szijjártó stated during a press conference in Budapest following a meeting
      with Moroccan Minister of Industry and Trade Ryad Mezzour. Despite this, he expressed
      support for US President Donald Trump’s so-called peace efforts, stating: “No
      one has done as much for peace in Ukraine as Trump.” He added that these efforts
      “could have been much more successful in recent months if they hadn’t been obstructed
      by European and Ukrainian leaders.” Szijjártó’s remarks came shortly after Trump
      announced on 14 July that the US would deliver Patriot air defense missiles to
      Ukraine, saying the EU would cover the full cost. “We will send them Patriots,
      which they desperately need … The EU is going to pay us 100 percent for that,
      and that’s the way we want it,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews. Trump
      framed the weapons transfer as part of a broader strategy to pressure Moscow into
      negotiations, but did not specify how many systems would be delivered. “Putin
      really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then bombs everybody in the
      evening. But there’s a little bit of a problem there. I don’t like it,” he said.
      The announcement coincided with the arrival of Trump’s special envoy, retired
      Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, in Kiev. Ukrainian officials confirmed that discussions
      would center on weapons, sanctions on Russia, and deepening ties with Washington.

      Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said on 14 July that Hungary will not participate
      in financing US weapons for Ukraine, even if Washington formally proposes the
      initiative to the EU. “I would like to emphasize that Hungarian money, Hungarian
      weapons, and Hungarian soldiers will not be sent to Ukraine. Nothing will be sent
      there,” Szijjártó stated during a press conference in Budapest following a meeting
      with Moroccan Minister of Industry and Trade Ryad Mezzour. Despite this, he expressed
      support for US President Donald Trump’s so-called peace efforts, stating: “No
      one has done as much for peace in Ukraine as Trump.” He added that these efforts
      “could have been much more successful in recent months if they hadn’t been obstructed
      by European and Ukrainian leaders.” Szijjártó’s remarks came shortly after Trump
      announced on 14 July that the US would deliver Patriot air defense missiles to
      Ukraine, saying the EU would cover the full cost. “We will send them Patriots,
      which they desperately need … The EU is going to pay us 100 percent for that,
      and that’s the way we want it,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews. Trump
      framed the weapons transfer as part of a broader strategy to pressure Moscow into
      negotiations, but did not specify how many systems would be delivered. “Putin
      really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then bombs everybody in the
      evening. But there’s a little bit of a problem there. I don’t like it,” he said.
      The announcement coincided with the arrival of Trump’s special envoy, retired
      Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, in Kiev. Ukrainian officials confirmed that discussions
      would center on weapons, sanctions on Russia, and deepening ties with Washington.

      One week after the Department of Justice (DOJ) released a document stating that
      there was never a Jeffrey Epstein “client list” — a supposed list of child sex
      predators and traffickers that is the center of a conspiracy theory that right-wingers
      have promoted for years — President Donald Trump, who benefited from that conspiracy
      theory, has expressed frustration that his MAGA base isn’t moving on. The refusal
      of Trump’s base to believe the DOJ and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s newest assessment
      of the Epstein files is visibly frustrating the president, who has lashed out
      at his followers on social media and derided reporters for questioning the new
      narrative. Believers in the Epstein “client list” conspiracy theory allege that
      Epstein, a financier and former friend of Trump’s, used the list as political
      leverage against public figures, including liberal and left-leaning individuals.
      Members of Trump’s own administration, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy
      FBI Director Dan Bongino, played a role in spreading the theory prior to assuming
      their posts . Trump, who was president when Epstein was arrested and subsequently
      died in jail, wasn’t a direct promoter of the conspiracy theory. But he did discuss
      it in interviews, including in September 2024, at the height of the presidential
      campaign season. “I’d certainly take a look at it,” Trump said in regards to releasing
      the files relating to Epstein , adding that he’d be “inclined” to release such
      a list and would have “no problem” with doing so. He also called it “very interesting”
      that the supposed list had not yet been made public, implying that the Biden administration
      was purposefully keeping the names hidden. Earlier this month, however, the DOJ
      announced that there is no Epstein “client list,” that there was “no credible
      evidence” of a blackmail conspiracy, and that Epstein indeed died by suicide while
      in jail, contradicting years of questions regarding the official narrative that
      Trump had benefited from. The document is also a stark departure from what Bondi
      had stated earlier this year. In an interview in February, when asked if an Epstein
      list would be released , Bondi responded affirmatively, saying it was on her desk
      waiting for review. Last week, however, she claimed that her response did not
      mean that the client list was real — instead, she was referring to files relating
      to Epstein , she said. Since that time, Trump’s supporters have taken issue with
      the DOJ’s conclusions, with some revolting against him on social media. Some of
      Trump’s allies in Congress, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia),
      have also expressed skepticism over the administration’s new line. “I have to
      be honest, it’s just a red line that it crosses for many people,” Greene said
      in an interview on Monday . The loyal MAGA base Trump relied on for so many years
      now appears to be “genuinely fractured,” read an assessment of the situation from
      Politico published this week . Days after the DOJ document was released, a reporter
      asked Bondi to comment during a cabinet meeting at the White House. Trump, visibly
      upset over the question, interjected. “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?
      This guy’s been talked about for years. Are people still talking about this guy,
      this creep? That is unbelievable. Do you want to waste the time?” he asked . A
      few days later, Trump told his base it was time to move on. “We have a PERFECT
      Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people’ are trying to hurt
      it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social
      post . Trump peddled a new conspiracy theory within that same post, baselessly
      claiming that several figures (including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and others)
      had written the Epstein files themselves in an effort to hurt him. Let’s “not
      waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,” Trump
      added. Democrats are pouncing on the situation. The Democratic National Committee
      (DNC), for example, has created a new profile on X to remind viewers daily that
      the supposed Epstein list hasn’t been released. Tim Hogan, the DNC’s senior adviser
      for messaging, has called for the Trump administration to be more transparent.
      Said Hogan : Trump administration officials are either lying about the file and
      keeping it covered up to protect themselves, or they lied about its existence
      in a shameless political ploy to get elected. Either way, it is disgusting, and
      they have to be held accountable. Democratic lawmakers have also spoken out about
      the matter. “Either [Trump] and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance
      of these Epstein files to help his campaign, or something is there! Put up or
      Shut up,” wrote Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Texas) . “Democrats didn’t put the Jeffrey
      Epstein thing into the public domain,” Speaker of the House Hakeem Jeffries said
      at a press conference on Monday . “This was a conspiracy that Donald Trump, Pam
      Bondi and these MAGA extremists have been fanning the flames of for the last several
      years, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.” The fracturing of Trump’s
      MAGA base is somewhat evident in recent polls. According to a new Economist /YouGov
      poll published Tuesday morning , 79 percent of all U.S. voters want the Epstein
      files to be publicly released, including 83 percent of voters who backed Trump
      in 2024. Among those voters, there appears to be skepticism with the Trump administration’s
      handling of the files, with nearly 6 in 10 (59 percent) of them saying the government
      is covering up evidence. Trump’s approval rating among those who voted for him
      last year is still high, with 84 percent backing him and 13 percent disapproving.
      But that’s a shift from the start of this summer , when 87 percent of his voters
      approved of his job performance and only 10 percent didn’t — and it’s a huge shift
      from the start of this year, when, in early February , 92 percent of Trump voters
      approved of his job performance and only 5 percent said they disapproved. Editor’s

      The Internal Revenue Service is building a computer program that would give deportation
      officers unprecedented access to confidential tax data. ProPublica has obtained
      a blueprint of the system, which would create an “on demand” process allowing
      Immigration and Customs Enforcement to obtain the home addresses of people it’s
      seeking to deport. Last month, in a previously undisclosed dispute, the acting
      general counsel at the IRS, Andrew De Mello, refused to turn over the addresses
      of 7.3 million taxpayers sought by ICE. In an email obtained by ProPublica, De
      Mello said he had identified multiple legal “deficiencies” in the agency’s request.
      Two days later, on June 27, De Mello was forced out of his job, people familiar
      with the dispute said. The addresses have not yet been released to ICE. De Mello
      did not respond to requests for comment, and the administration did not address
      questions sent by ProPublica about his departure. The Department of Government
      Efficiency began pushing the IRS to provide taxpayer data to immigration agents
      soon after President Donald Trump took office. The tax agency’s acting general
      counsel refused and was replaced by De Mello, who Trump administration officials
      viewed as more willing to carry out the president’s agenda. Soon after, the Department
      of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, and the IRS negotiated a “memorandum
      of understanding” that included specific legal guardrails to safeguard taxpayers’
      private information. In his email, De Mello said ICE’s request for millions of
      records did not meet those requirements, which include having a written assurance
      that each taxpayer whose address is being sought was under active criminal investigation.
      “There’s just no way ICE has 7 million real criminal investigations, that’s a
      fantasy,” said a former senior IRS official who had been advising the agency on
      this issue. The demands from the DHS were “unprecedented,” the official added,
      saying the agency was pressing the IRS to do what amounted to “a big data dump.”
      In the past, when law enforcement sought IRS data to support its investigations,
      agencies would give the IRS the full legal name of the target, an address on file
      and an explanation of why the information was relevant to a criminal inquiry.
      Such requests rarely involved more than a dozen people at a time, former IRS officials
      said. Danny Werfel, IRS commissioner during the Biden administration, said the
      privacy laws allowing federal investigators to obtain taxpayer data have never
      “been read to open the door to the sharing of thousands, tens of thousands, or
      hundreds of thousands of tax records for a broad-based enforcement initiative.”
      A spokesperson for the White House said the planned use of IRS data was legal
      and a means of fulfilling Trump’s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations
      of “illegal criminal aliens.” Taxpayer data is among the most confidential in
      the federal government and is protected by strict privacy laws, which have historically
      limited its transfer to law enforcement and other government agencies. Unauthorized
      disclosure of taxpayer return information is a felony that can carry a penalty
      of up to five years in prison. The system that the IRS is now creating would give
      ICE automated access to home addresses en masse, limiting the ability of IRS officials
      to consider the legality of transfers. IRS insiders who reviewed a copy of the
      blueprint said it could result in immigration agents raiding wrong or outdated
      addresses. “If this program is implemented in its current form, it’s extremely
      likely that incorrect addresses will be given to DHS and individuals will be wrongly
      targeted,” said an IRS engineer who examined the blueprints and who, like other
      officials, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The dispute
      that ended in De Mello’s ouster was the culmination of months of pressure on the
      IRS to turn over massive amounts of data in ways that would redefine the relationship
      between the agency and law enforcement and reduce taxpayers’ privacy, records
      and interviews show. In one meeting in late March between senior IRS and DHS officials,
      a top ICE official made a suggestion: Why doesn’t Homeland Security simply provide
      the name and state of its targets and have the IRS return the addresses of everyone
      who matches that criteria? The IRS lawyers were stunned. They feared they could
      face criminal liability if they handed over the addresses of individuals who were
      not under a criminal investigation. The conversation and news of deeper collaboration
      with ICE so disturbed career staff that it led to a series of departures in late
      March and early April across the IRS’ legal, IT and privacy offices. They were
      “pushing the boundaries of the law,” one official said. “Everyone at IRS felt
      the same way.” The Blueprint The technical blueprint obtained by ProPublica shows
      that engineers at the agency are preparing to give DHS what it wants: a system
      that enables massive automated data sharing. The goal is to launch the new system
      before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter said. The DHS effort
      to obtain IRS data comes as top immigration enforcement leaders face escalating
      White House pressure to deport some 3,000 people per day, according to reports
      . One federal agent tasked with assisting ICE on deportations said recent operations
      have been hamstrung by outdated addresses. Better information could dramatically
      speed up arrests. “Some of the leads that they were giving us were old,” said
      the agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to
      speak with the press. “They’re like from two administrations ago.” In early March,
      immigrants rights groups sued the IRS hoping to block the plan, arguing that the
      memorandum of understanding between DHS and the IRS is illegal. But a judge in
      early May ruled against them , saying the broader agreement complied with Section
      6103, the existing law regulating IRS data sharing. That opened the door for engineers
      to begin building the system. The judge did not address the technical blueprint,
      which didn’t exist at the time of the ruling. But the case is pending, which means
      the new system could still come under legal review. Until now, little was known
      about the push and pull between the two agencies or the exact technical mechanics
      behind the arrangement. The plan has been shrouded in secrecy even within the
      IRS, with details of its development withheld from regular communications. Several
      IRS engineers and lawyers have avoided working on the project out of concerns
      about personal legal risk. Asked about the new system, a spokesperson for IRS
      parent agency the Treasury Department said the memorandum of understanding, often
      called an MOU, “has been litigated and determined to be a lawful application of
      Section 6103, which provides for information sharing by the IRS in precise circumstances
      associated with law enforcement requests.” At a time when Trump is making threats
      to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens, the scope of
      information-sharing with the IRS could continue to grow, according to documents
      reviewed by ProPublica and sources familiar with the matter: DHS has been looking
      for ways to expand the agreement that could allow Homeland Security officials
      to seek IRS data on Americans being investigated for various crimes. Last month,
      an ICE attorney proposed updating the MOU to authorize new data requests on people
      “associated with criminal activities which may include United States citizens
      or lawful permanent residents,” according to a document seen by ProPublica. The
      status of this proposal is unclear. De Mello, at the time, rejected it and called
      for senior Treasury Department leadership to personally sign off on such a significant
      change. The White House described DHS’ work with the IRS as a good-faith effort
      to identify and deport those who are living in the country illegally. “ProPublica
      continues to degrade their already terrible reputation by suggesting we should
      turn a blind eye to criminal illegal aliens present in the United States for the
      sake of trying to collect tax payments from them,” White House spokesperson Abigail
      Jackson said in a statement after receiving questions about the blueprint from
      ProPublica. She pointed to the April MOU as giving the government the authority
      to create the new system and added, “This isn’t a surveillance system. … It’s
      part of President Trump’s promise to carry out the mass deportation of criminal
      illegal aliens — the promise that the American people elected him on and he is
      committed to fulfilling.” In a separate statement, a senior DHS official also
      cited the court’s approval of the MOU, saying that it “outlines a process to ensure
      that sensitive taxpayer information is protected while allowing law enforcement
      to effectively pursue criminal violations.” How the System Works The new system
      would represent a sea change, allowing law enforcement to request enormous swaths
      of confidential data in bulk through an automated, computerized process. The system,
      according to the blueprint and interviews with IRS engineers, would work like
      this: First, DHS would send the IRS a spreadsheet containing the names and previous
      addresses of the people it’s targeting. The request would include the date of
      a final removal order, a relevant criminal statute ICE is using to investigate
      the individual, and the tax period for which information is sought. If DHS fails
      to include any of this information, the system would reject the request. The system
      then attempts to match the information provided by the DHS to a specific taxpayer
      identification number, which is the primary method by which the IRS identifies
      an individual in its databases. If the system makes a match, it accesses the individual’s
      associated tax file and pulls the address listed during the most recent tax period.
      Then the system would produce a new spreadsheet enriched with taxpayer data that
      contains DHS’ targets’ last known addresses. The spreadsheet would include a record
      of names rejected for lack of required information and names for which it could
      not make a match. Tax and privacy experts say they worry about how such a powerful
      yet crude platform could make dangerous mistakes. Because the search starts with
      a name instead of a taxpayer identification number, it risks returning the address
      of an innocent person with the same name as or a similar address to that of one
      of ICE’s targets. The proposed system assumes the data provided by DHS is accurate
      and that each targeted individual is the subject of a valid criminal investigation.
      In effect, the IRS has no way to independently check the bases of these requests,
      experts told ProPublica. In addition, the blueprint does not limit the amount
      of data that can be transferred or how often DHS can request it. The system could
      easily be expanded to acquire all the information the IRS holds on taxpayers,
      said technical experts and IRS engineers who reviewed the documents. By shifting
      a single parameter, the program could return more information than just a target’s
      address, said an engineer familiar with the plan, including employer and familial
      relationships. Engineers based at IRS offices in Lanham, Maryland, and Dallas
      are developing the blueprint. “Gone Back on Its Word” For decades, the American
      government has encouraged everyone who makes an income in the U.S. to pay taxes
      — regardless of immigration status — with an implicit promise that their information
      would be protected. Now that same data may be used to locate and deport noncitizens.
      “For years, the IRS has told immigrants that it only cares that they pay their
      taxes,” said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group,
      which is seeking to block the data-sharing agreement in federal court. “By agreeing
      to share taxpayer data with ICE on a mass basis, the IRS has gone back on its
      word.” The push to share IRS data with DHS emerged while Elon Musk’s DOGE reshaped
      the engineering staff of the IRS. Sam Corcos, a Silicon Valley startup founder
      with no government experience, pushed out more than 50 IRS engineers and restructured
      the agency’s engineering priorities while he was the senior DOGE official at the
      agency. He later became chief information officer at Treasury. He has also led
      a separate IRS effort to create a master database using products from Silicon
      Valley giant Palantir Technologies, enabling the government to link and search
      large swaths of data. Corcos didn’t respond to a request for comment. The White
      House said DOGE is not part of the DHS-IRS pact. Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat
      on the Senate Committee on Finance, which oversees the IRS, told ProPublica the
      system being built was ripe for abuse. It “would allow an outside agency unprecedented
      access to IRS records for reasons that have nothing to do with tax administration,
      opening the door to endless fishing expeditions,” he said. The Treasury Inspector
      General for Tax Administration, the department’s internal watchdog, is already
      probing efforts by Trump and DOGE to obtain private taxpayer data and other sensitive
      information, ProPublica reported in April. The Trump administration continues
      to add government agencies to its deportation drive. DOGE and DHS are also working
      to build a national citizenship database, NPR reported last month . The database
      links information from the Social Security Administration and the DHS, ostensibly
      for the purpose of allowing state and local election officials to verify U.S.

      The Internal Revenue Service is building a computer program that would give deportation
      officers unprecedented access to confidential tax data. ProPublica has obtained
      a blueprint of the system, which would create an “on demand” process allowing
      Immigration and Customs Enforcement to obtain the home addresses of people it’s
      seeking to deport. Last month, in a previously undisclosed dispute, the acting
      general counsel at the IRS, Andrew De Mello, refused to turn over the addresses
      of 7.3 million taxpayers sought by ICE. In an email obtained by ProPublica, De
      Mello said he had identified multiple legal “deficiencies” in the agency’s request.
      Two days later, on June 27, De Mello was forced out of his job, people familiar
      with the dispute said. The addresses have not yet been released to ICE. De Mello
      did not respond to requests for comment, and the administration did not address
      questions sent by ProPublica about his departure. The Department of Government
      Efficiency began pushing the IRS to provide taxpayer data to immigration agents
      soon after President Donald Trump took office. The tax agency’s acting general
      counsel refused and was replaced by De Mello, who Trump administration officials
      viewed as more willing to carry out the president’s agenda. Soon after, the Department
      of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, and the IRS negotiated a “memorandum
      of understanding” that included specific legal guardrails to safeguard taxpayers’
      private information. In his email, De Mello said ICE’s request for millions of
      records did not meet those requirements, which include having a written assurance
      that each taxpayer whose address is being sought was under active criminal investigation.
      “There’s just no way ICE has 7 million real criminal investigations, that’s a
      fantasy,” said a former senior IRS official who had been advising the agency on
      this issue. The demands from the DHS were “unprecedented,” the official added,
      saying the agency was pressing the IRS to do what amounted to “a big data dump.”
      In the past, when law enforcement sought IRS data to support its investigations,
      agencies would give the IRS the full legal name of the target, an address on file
      and an explanation of why the information was relevant to a criminal inquiry.
      Such requests rarely involved more than a dozen people at a time, former IRS officials
      said. Danny Werfel, IRS commissioner during the Biden administration, said the
      privacy laws allowing federal investigators to obtain taxpayer data have never
      “been read to open the door to the sharing of thousands, tens of thousands, or
      hundreds of thousands of tax records for a broad-based enforcement initiative.”
      A spokesperson for the White House said the planned use of IRS data was legal
      and a means of fulfilling Trump’s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations
      of “illegal criminal aliens.” Taxpayer data is among the most confidential in
      the federal government and is protected by strict privacy laws, which have historically
      limited its transfer to law enforcement and other government agencies. Unauthorized
      disclosure of taxpayer return information is a felony that can carry a penalty
      of up to five years in prison. The system that the IRS is now creating would give
      ICE automated access to home addresses en masse, limiting the ability of IRS officials
      to consider the legality of transfers. IRS insiders who reviewed a copy of the
      blueprint said it could result in immigration agents raiding wrong or outdated
      addresses. “If this program is implemented in its current form, it’s extremely
      likely that incorrect addresses will be given to DHS and individuals will be wrongly
      targeted,” said an IRS engineer who examined the blueprints and who, like other

      to step up strikes deep inside Russia and even asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr
      Zelensky if his forces were capable of striking Moscow if the US provided longer-range

      conversation occurred during a July 4 phone call. “Volodymyr, can you hit Moscow? . . . Can
      you hit St Petersburg too?” Trump asked. Zelensky replied that his forces could
      “absolutely” strike the Russian cities if the US provided the necessary weapons.
      The report said that Trump signaled backing for the idea of providing long-range
      weapons in order to “make them [Russians] feel the pain” to pressure Moscow at
      the negotiating table. In comments to reporters, Trump later denied that he was
      considering providing Ukraine with long-range weapons and said that Zelensky “shouldn’t
      target Moscow.” The White House confirmed that the conversation about striking
      Moscow took place, but insisted Trump wasn’t encouraging Ukrainian attacks inside
      Russia. A White House official told the BBC that Trump was “merely asking a question,
      not encouraging further killing. He’s working tirelessly to stop the killing and
      end this war.” The FT report said that US officials have also provided Zelensky
      with a list of potential long-range weapons the US could supply. The Ukrainians
      have been asking for Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of over 1,000 miles,
      making them capable of hitting Moscow from Ukrainian territory. Last year, the
      Biden administration gave Ukraine the green light to use ATACMS missiles in strikes
      on Russian territory. The ATACMS have a range of about 190, which is not far enough
      to hit Moscow. Moscow has made clear that attacks on its territory risk nuclear
      escalation since it lowered the threshold for its use of nuclear weapons in response
      to the US backing ATACMS attacks on Russia. The revelation about the Trump-Zelensky
      call came after the US president announced a new plan to provide Ukraine with
      “billions of dollars” worth of weapons by selling arms to NATO countries that
      will then transfer them to the war-torn nation. He also threatened major tariffs
      on Russia and its trading partners if a peace deal isn’t reached in 50 days, an

    text: 'Palestine Action activists blockading Elbit Systems Instro Precision factory
      in Sandwich, Kent, on Nov. 6, 2023. (Palestine Action) In one of the scariest
      moments in modern history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog
      of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please
      consider a tax-deductible donation . By Craig Murray / Consortium News The activist
      group Palestine Action was designated a terrorist organization by the British
      government last month after it splashed red paint on a British war plane in protest
      of it assisting Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The non-violent group is in court challenging
      its designation by a violent government. The author, a former British diplomat,
      was in the courthouse and filed this report. This is the second and last installment
      of his two-part article. W hen we restarted at 2 p.m., Raza Husain noted that
      the secretary of state had submitted no argument as to why the proscription had
      to enter into force immediately. He continued that the statutory instrument proscribing
      Palestine Action was not to be viewed as having the same authority as primary
      legislation, and had undergone a very truncated parliamentary procedure. Amendment
      had not been possible. It was more properly characterised as an executive instrument
      subject to parliamentary veto. Judge Chamberlain agreed, and noted it had also
      included the Maniac Murder Cult and it had not been possible for Parliament to
      separate the groups. Ben Watson KC then rose to argue for the secretary of state.
      He stated that the proceedings amounted to a substantive challenge to the proscription
      itself. But it showed no serious issue to be heard. Parliament’s intentions are
      very plain in the Terrorism Act. It sets out clear procedures to add organisations
      to the list. These had been followed. The legislation sets out at section 5 the
      method for appeal against proscription, to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal
      Commission (POAC). The route for appeal is, in the first instance, to the secretary
      of state, and in the second instance to POAC. Judge Chamberlain intervened that
      when the legislation had been passed, there had been no mechanism by which a court
      could see secret intelligence. (The inference being this is why POAC was established).
      Such a mechanism now existed. At this stage, it was ambitious for Watson to argue
      that there is no serious issue to be tried by the court. Watson responded that
      there is fundamental uncertainty as to whether the court can do this. Chamberlain
      responded that fundamental uncertainty means there is an issue to consider. The
      kernel to be addressed today was, are the grounds arguable? If so, what is the
      balance of convenience? Watson responded that this case is still narrower than
      the PKK case. Here there are no fundamental grounds to claim that the order is
      wrong. Yet the court in the PKK case still concluded that proscription was an
      issue for Parliament. This was a constitutional point. Any appeal must go to the
      secretary of state first. The issues are precisely the same as in the Tamil Tigers
      case. All of this is finally in the territory of POAC. If interim relief were
      granted, the organisation would not currently be proscribed, and so POAC would
      not be able to look at the case. In instituting POAC as the route for appeal,
      Parliament had made no provision for interim relief pending appeal, so it plainly
      was not Parliament’s intention that such relief should be possible. This court
      has no power of judicial review of proscription. Parliament had provided an adequate
      route in POAC. The first appeal is to the secretary of state. Judge Chamberlain
      asked Watson to confirm that his argument was that if an organisation that clearly
      does not fall within the definition of terrorism were to be proscribed, they would
      have no remedy other than to appeal through the secretary of state, and would
      remain proscribed while they appealed? Watson concurred, and went on to argue
      that if there is an unassailable case that you are doing serious damage to property,
      then Article X freedom of speech protection is much diminished. Judge Chamberlain
      asked whether the chilling effect on Article X and XI of proscription — including
      on people not involved in criminal damage — might be serious. Watson replied that
      in the Tamil Tigers case it was ruled that the chilling effect on speech on Tamil
      self-determination does not have substantial weight against the suppression of
      terrorism. Watson said that it was difficult for Palestine Action to argue they
      were not trying to influence the government, when they had targeted an RAF base.
      There was no evidence that consultation with Israel and Elbit Systems by the secretary
      of state had amounted to improper influence. Judge Chamberlain concurred, stating
      that it was necessary to consult with the victims to assess damage. Watson agreed:
      it was important to take into account the views of foreign governments in the
      fight against terrorism. Any argument that the public consultation provision had
      not been properly enacted could not be sufficiently strong to void the proscription.
      Watson said that the fundamental kernel, that Palestine Action is engaged in terrorism
      as defined in the act, had not been challenged by the claimant. You cannot grant
      interim relief on the basis that the definition in the statute is too broad. The
      secretary of state has no obligation to consider the interests of the organisation
      that is being proscribed. There are no rules on who can make representations to
      the secretary of state nor when they should be heard. Parliament did not put in
      any judicial controls on the secretary of state. This was deliberate. Judge Chamberlain
      remarked that if the justification stands for not giving notice of proscription,
      that this would allow Palestine Action to make preparations to continue, then
      the same justification stands for not consulting on the question. Watson replied
      that the grounds for objecting to proscription are not substantial anyway, so
      there could never have been any worthwhile representations on behalf of Palestine
      Action in any consultation. Watson said that there was secret intelligence evidence
      about Palestine Action that could be tackled at a later stage through the special
      advocate process. In the meantime what they had was the secretary of state’s evidence
      and her statement to parliament. The police need to be able to implement the law
      of the land. The courts must not trespass on the rights of parliament, nor appear
      to do so. Judge Chamberlain, for the first time, seemed annoyed. “I am not going
      to worry about that” he said, “you have conceded that this court has jurisdiction”.
      Watson said that this was a grave matter of national security, where the courts
      conceded to the judgment of the executive. Judge Chamberlain backed down immediately.
      He said that national security consideration weighs heavily in the scale. “I cannot
      say that this does not impinge on national security if the secretary of state
      says so and that belief is rational.” Watson continued that POAC is the statutory
      scheme for appeal,. The public interest represented by the secretary of state
      outweighs any private interest of groups or individuals. Judge Chamberlain agreed.
      He said the order exists because the secretary of state believes it will provide
      the public with certain protections. If the order is suspended it will be denied
      that protection. The secretary of state had said that people will be able to continue
      to oppose Israel’s actions; they will be able to continue to describe those actions
      as genocide or other breaches of international humanitarian law. Judge Chamberlain
      then suggested that if someone who had once been a member of Palestine Action
      decided to spray paint on something, that would not make it any more or less lawful
      than it had been before. This time Watson refused to agree. He asserted that there
      can be no private right to do something criminal. Judge Chamberlain was now enthusiastically
      strolling around his own fantasy world where the police and prosecutors are kindly
      and reasonable. “There is no reason for anybody to regard somebody’s past association
      with a now proscribed organisation as blameworthy”, he suggested. Watson replied
      that the government’s determination is that the organisation is terrorist. So
      the existence of stigma is irrelevant. It already exists. The priority is national
      security. In conclusion, Watson spoke the chilling words that made me jump in
      my chair. Watson said precisely: “We accept of course that it is draconian and
      deliberately so.” (Say that to yourself out loud, and consider what kind of state
      it is where the government can openly say this in court.) Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh
      KC then rose to rebut. She quoted Andrew Feinstein, that the methods of Palestine
      Action were identical to those of anti-apartheid activists. Feinstein stated that
      the majority of Palestine Action activists he had encountered were not terrorists,
      but pacifists. All of the actions were capable of being protected under Article
      X and Article XI [of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)]. Not every
      act of damage to property is criminal. There are many examples of Palestine Action
      activists being acquitted. Judge Chamberlain interjected that they will only in
      future be illegal if under the aegis of Palestine Action. Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh
      Blinne retorted that Palestine Action protest outside arms factories regularly.
      If the same activists turn up to protest, they will be accused of being Palestine
      Action. The case of the Tamil Tigers is not apposite, she continued. The Tamil
      Tigers were engaged in armed action. The secretary of state had said that all
      actions of the Tamil Tigers had an axis to violence. That is absolutely not the
      case here. Statements in favour of Palestine Action before proscription would
      be interpreted by the police as giving suspicion of continuing support. What is
      Palestine Action, other than a loose network of people who want to see Elbit shut
      down? The secretary of state says that somehow people’s Article X and XI rights
      will magically be protected. This will not be the case. Palestine Action is not
      being proscribed on the grounds that it rejects the tenets of a democratic society.
      It rather opposes corporate complicity in fundamental breaches of international
      law. There is clear Strasbourg case law that you do not lose protection of the
      ECHR because of any violent act by another member of the same organisation. Timing
      and context are key. Palestine Action are attempting to prevent the most serious
      crime of all in the middle of a Genocide. In the case of the Christian Democrat
      Party of Moldova, the Strasbourg court had found it was wrong to ban them without
      notice just 21 days before an election. Context and timing are important. People
      were today protesting outside this court. Those continuing to protest this proscription
      in the next two weeks would be branded as terrorists, were interim relief not
      given now. Ben Watson now interjected – I am not sure on what basis – to say that
      the correct appeal against proscription was through POAC. Raza Husain Closes Raza
      Husain then closed for the claimant. He stated that Palestine Action were a group
      of people who put their bodies on the line between genocide and its planes and
      weapons. The secretary of state had been granted extra time to give evidence of
      what harm would arise if the interim relief were granted, and she had given nothing.
      The harm might be the deprivation of liberty to literally thousands of people.
      Arrests were foreseeable. This was a civil disobedience movement. There will be
      an I Am Spartacus wave. Civil disobedience is not illegal but has a long and honourable
      history in British society. It will carry on. The public interest is indeed engaged.
      It does not all fall on one side. Hundreds of thousands of people support Palestine
      Action. There was real and lasting damage to the right of the public to freedom
      of speech and to protest. That closed the hearing. It was now 3.15 p.m. on Friday,
      July 4. Judge Chamberlain said that he would attempt to return with his decision
      by 5.30 pm. Outside the drummers were still drumming and the dancers were still
      dancing. I gave a few more interviews. I really wasn’t feeling well at all at
      this stage. At 5.30 p.m. we were back in the court for Chamberlain to give his
      decision. He started by saying he had considered the likelihood of success of
      the appeal for judicial review, and had decided that the only ground where there
      was arguably a strong case to be heard was that of disproportionate interference
      with Article X and Article XI rights under the ECHR. Some of the other grounds
      may be plausible, but he was not in a position to judge that today. However, he
      considered that the claimant had not demonstrated that irreversible harm would
      be caused if interim relief were not granted. Therefore he was not suspending
      the proscription, which would come into force at midnight according to the secretary
      of state’s order. He assumed that the claimant would seek leave to appeal to the
      Court of Appeal. He would not grant leave to appeal. However the claimants could
      try to ask the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal, this evening before the proscription
      came into force. Chamberlain then disappeared through the door behind his chair.
      The legal team were left staring at his detailed judgment. His incredibly detailed
      judgment. It is 24 pages long, and runs to 104 paragraphs, many of which have
      sub-paragraphs. Let me try to offer a perspective. I have a reasonable claim not
      to be stupid. I topped the civil service exams in my year and became the U.K.’s
      youngest ambassador. It has taken me eight solid hours to write this article to
      this point, not including probably twice that in thinking time. Chamberlain’s
      judgment is over twice the length of this article so far. Produced in two hours,
      at the rate of almost one paragraph per minute? Plainly the bulk of it was written
      before the hearing – or written by somebody else. Just a thought. With the disturbing
      insight that this was all a charade, I joined the Palestine Action legal team
      who were having to digest this judgment and work out how to launch an appeal to
      the Court of Appeal after 6pm on a Friday evening. Otherwise the proscription
      took effect on the stroke of midnight. Despite being extremely experienced, nobody
      on the team had ever been through a similar procedure. Judges are not given to
      hanging around the courts out of hours, and indeed are strongly inclined to find
      reasons to wrap up proceedings in trials and hearings early on a Friday. And this
      was in the middle of both Wimbledon and a Test Match… Having such a large legal
      team finally made sense, as they all, including four barristers who had not spoken,
      scanned through the judgment looking to find grounds of appeal. Raza gave instructions
      to telephone the duty clerk of the Court of Appeal and find out if the duty judge
      were available. The question then was whether the duty judge would be prepared
      to sit and hear an appeal as a single judge, or would want a panel of three. The
      call was made, while we several times had to fend off security guards who were
      attempting to clear the building. Huda had been giving instructions via videolink,
      and it was only now that I discovered there was in fact someone from Palestine
      Action present with the team. One of the legal team said to me mischievously “If
      they ask you to leave, we can ask Huda to say that you are with Palestine Action
      – pause – she had better add until 11.59 p.m.”. Within five minutes of the call
      being made, a security guard came to us and told us we were to move to Court 4,
      the court of the lord chief Justice. We had to gather up all the files and move
      there, a long trek through the bowels of the building, and at one stage diving
      off on a shortcut up a staircase that nobody in the team knew existed (there are
      over 100 staircases in this extraordinary building). We entered Court 4 at around
      7 p.m. We were now in the grandest area of the building. Forgive me if I recycle
      a description of this courtroom I have used before: “It is very high, and lit
      by heavy mock-medieval chandeliers hung by long cast iron chains from a ceiling
      so high you can’t really see it. You expect Robin Hood to suddenly leap from the
      balconied gallery and swing across on the chandelier above you. The room is very
      gloomy; the murky dusk hovers menacingly above the lights like a miasma of despair;
      below them you peer through the weak light to make out the participants. A huge
      tiered oak dais occupies half the room, with the judges seated at its apex, their
      clerks at the next level down, and lower lateral wings reaching out, at one side
      to house journalists and at the other a huge dock for the prisoners, with a massy
      iron cage that looks left over from a production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
      This is in fact the most modern part of the construction; caging defendants in
      medieval style is a Blair-era introduction to the so-called process of law – as
      indeed is the Terrorism Act. All the walls are lined with high bookcases, housing
      thousands of leather-bound volumes of old cases. The stone floor peeks out for
      one yard between the judicial dais and the storied wooden pews, with six tiers
      of increasingly narrow seating. The back of each bench has a little ledge for
      those behind to place their papers. Watching people attempt to balance laptops
      on a five inch shelf is quite amusing.” Gareth turned to me and said that we were
      honoured to be in such a historic spot, which had already witnessed some of the
      world’s greatest miscarriages of justice. As we sat ourselves down, out of the
      door at the back of the dais appeared in all her majesty the lady justice of England
      and Wales, Lady Carr, who was flanked by Lord Justice Lewis and Lord Justice Edis.
      Evidently these three had just been hanging around the court at 7 p.m. on a Friday
      evening, and happened to be available to hear the request for permission to appeal.
      I had a moment of crystal clarity. I had spent the whole day participating in
      a charade, and even the wonderful legal team around me were at base also just
      participants in that charade. Lady Carr opened by grumbling loudly that there
      was very little time, they had not seen the supporting evidence, they had only
      just received Chamberlain’s judgment, and had no idea what were the purported
      grounds of appeal. She asked Raza Husain if he had grounds of appeal, and what
      were they? She reminded us that an appeal was not a rerun of the case but had
      to find specific errors in law by Judge Chamberlain. “Where do you say that he
      erred?” Raza Husain evidently had not been expecting to present the grounds of
      appeal instantly, and the team had only just finished reading the judgment and
      started thinking about how to appeal it when we had been called to Court 4. He
      was now instantly standing in front of the Court of Appeal. He extemporised that
      there were three grounds of appeal at least. The judge had erred in law in that
      he had failed to take into account the weight of mass arrests in assessing the
      balance of convenience argument. He had failed to insist upon evidence of the
      urgency of immediate imposition. He had failed to accord due weight to the failure
      of the secretary of state to consult before proscription. Lady Carr said that
      the court would hear an application for permission to appeal. Skeleton argument
      for the appeal must be submitted in one hour, by 8:15 p.m., and the court would
      hear oral arguments at 9 p.m. and endeavour to deliver judgment before midnight.
      This was somewhat confusing. They were granting a hearing for permission to appeal,
      not agreeing to hear an appeal. So if they granted permission, there would have
      to be a further stage of the actual appeal hearing. How could that be done if
      their decision on permission to appeal were not given much before midnight? There
      being no time to retire anywhere else, the legal team started beavering away immediately
      on the benches. At 9 p.m. we were listening to the appeal. Raza Husain said he
      would make five very brief points. 1) Civil disobedience had a long and honourable
      history in the U.K. 2) This was the first time a non-violent direct action group
      had been proscribed as terrorist. 3) Five U.N. special rapporteurs had written
      opposing the proscription. 4) Huda Ammori had been inspired by the suffragettes.
      5) Andrew Feinstein compared the methods of Palestine Action to the liberation
      struggle against apartheid. And there were five grounds of appeal. 1) The judge
      had erred in law in saying that there would not be substantial irreparable harm
      if the proscription were not delayed. There were undisputed consequences of arrest
      for expressing support for Palestine Action — this harm was deprivation of liberty,
      loss of employment and stigma. 2) The judge had afforded insufficient weight to
      the up to 14-year prison sentence for simply stating “I support Palestine Action”.
      3) The judge had given undue weight to national security considerations, where
      no evidence of urgency had been given. 4) Blinne took over for Ground 4. Chamberlain
      had erred in law in failing to take proper account of the impact of Articles X
      and XI of ECHR. Lady Carr interjected that Chamberlain did say there were Article
      X and XI grounds for the application for a judicial hearing against proscription.
      Blinne responded that however he had failed to give this sufficient weight against
      national security in the balance of convenience exercise, and that he had erred
      in saying that future evidence on this will be forthcoming from the secretary
      of state. He had to do the balance of convenience exercise on the evidence before
      him, today. If the proscription order came into account, it would have a chilling
      effect on protests outside Elbit factories, even from people unrelated to Palestine
      Action. It would chill free speech on Palestine. Any action for Palestine might
      be claimed by the police to be support for Palestine Action, and people would
      be jailed on remand. Palestine Action was an extremely loose organisation. What
      constituted support was extremely unclear in such a case, and there could be hundreds
      of arrests. 5) Raza Husain took over again for ground 5. The availability of an
      appeal to POAC does not oust judicial review. There were consequences for the
      common law right of free speech and for articles V and X of the ECHR. Ben Watson
      stood to respond for the secretary of state. He said Chamberlain’s judgment was
      measured and detailed. The claimant in this appeal had not challenged Chamberlain’s
      finding that the secretary of state had rightly designated Palestine Action as
      concerned with terrorism. They had not appealed against the crucial argument of
      the public interest in allowing the law of the land to take effect. Their criticism
      of the judge’s decision goes only to weight afforded to varying factors, on only
      one of the strands which the judge was balancing. The court could not give weight
      to the threat of mass flouting of the law. The claimant was merely attempting
      to relitigate matters which had been properly considered by the court. Chamberlain
      said that there was a serious issue to consider under Article X and XI. That is
      not the same as saying there was a strong case. The judge was not depending on
      future evidence, he was merely indicating that further evidence might come. Lord
      Justice Edis asked Watson how he responded to the argument that not all members
      of an organisation should be held responsible for the actions of an individual.
      Watson replied that Palestine Action were responsible for a long pattern of criminal
      activity. On rebuttal, Raza Husain said there had been no denial that the judge
      had failed to weigh the correct counterfactual against Article X and XI. Political
      speech on Palestine is protected speech. It attracts significant Article X protection
      and must continue to do so. Blinne added that the appeal is not about what will
      happen to people engaging in unlawful conduct, it is about what will happen to
      people who are engaging in conduct which would be perfectly lawful were it not
      for the proscription. That is how the effect on Article X must be measured. This
      was the first ever proscription of a non-violent movement. The harm was that it
      would criminalise the Article X protected actions of law-abiding people. That
      concluded the appeal, at about 9:30 pm. Judges’ Verdict In less than an hour the
      judges were back with their verdict . Again it was available in writing, and despite
      Lady Carr making a point of fussing about typos due to the haste, I quite simply
      do not believe that it was produced in under an hour. It contains 52 paragraphs,
      some of which have many sub-paragraphs. It is possible to make an argument that
      Judge Chamberlain had pre-written most of his judgment based on the documents
      and skeleton arguments that had been submitted in advance and only had to make
      some amendments to reflect the oral hearing. But the Court of Appeal were supposed
      not to have known they even had a case until 10 minutes before they sat. I simply
      do not buy the speed with which these judgements were produced. Lady Carr set
      about delivering the judgment. She said that these remarks were just for information;
      the written judgment was the actual judgment and anything she said did not vary
      that. The proscription had followed an attack on RAF Brize Norton. The order had
      been passed by each House of Parliament. Judge Chamberlain had refused to grant
      a stay of the proscription and had refused to give permission to appeal and had
      refused any stay pending an application to appeal. The merits of the decision
      to proscribe are not a matter for the Court of Appeal. Nor is the court looking
      into the claims of Palestine Action. The Court of Appeal is only considering whether
      Judge Chamberlain erred in law. On the principle of balance, Judge Chamberlain
      was right that the court must give great weight to national security and the executive’s
      approach to it. Judge Chamberlain was entitled to the view that individuals must
      obey the order while it was in force. It will remain lawful to express opposition
      to Israel or to Israel’s actions in Gaza. “No person will be prosecuted in relation
      to conduct before proscription”. There was no prospect of a successful appeal
      and permission to appeal was therefore refused. Raza Ali rose to request permission
      to appeal to the Supreme Court. Lady Carr responded that plainly that could not
      happen before midnight. A written application should be submitted by 2pm on Monday.
      There followed a horrible display by Lady Carr of sickly congratulation. In response
      to a correction by Blinne to the accents on her name in the judgment, Lady Carr
      gushed about her “lovely name.” She congratulated all the lawyers effusively on
      being brief and helpful, and said the case “upheld the best traditions of the
      bar”. What it upheld, of course, was a further step into authoritarianism. This
      was the next morning: an 83-year-old priest arrested for supporting Palestine
      Action. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    one_sentence_summary: Palestine Action, a non-violent activist group protesting
      against British military support for Israel, is challenging its recent designation
      as a terrorist organization by the UK government in court.
    paragraph_summary: On November 6, 2023, Palestine Action activists blockaded the
      Elbit Systems Instro Precision factory in Sandwich, Kent, following the group's
      recent designation as a terrorist organization by the British government after
      their protest against military support for Israel in Gaza. The group is currently
      challenging this designation in court, arguing that the government's proscription
      lacked a proper legal basis and had undergone an inadequate parliamentary process.
      During the court proceedings, it was noted that the proscription was treated as
      an executive instrument rather than primary legislation, and the judge acknowledged
      the government's failure to adequately separate Palestine Action from other groups
      listed. The case highlights tensions surrounding the definition of terrorism and
      the rights of activist organizations in the UK.

    text: 'Palestine Action activists blockading Elbit Systems Instro Precision factory
      in Sandwich, Kent, on Nov. 6, 2023. (Palestine Action) In one of the scariest
      moments in modern history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog
      of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please
      consider a tax-deductible donation . By Craig Murray / Consortium News The activist
      group Palestine Action was designated a terrorist organization by the British
      government last month after it splashed red paint on a British war plane in protest
      of it assisting Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The non-violent group is in court challenging
      its designation by a violent government. The author, a former British diplomat,
      was in the courthouse and filed this report. This is the second and last installment
      of his two-part article. W hen we restarted at 2 p.m., Raza Husain noted that
      the secretary of state had submitted no argument as to why the proscription had
      to enter into force immediately. He continued that the statutory instrument proscribing
      Palestine Action was not to be viewed as having the same authority as primary
      legislation, and had undergone a very truncated parliamentary procedure. Amendment
      had not been possible. It was more properly characterised as an executive instrument
      subject to parliamentary veto. Judge Chamberlain agreed, and noted it had also
      included the Maniac Murder Cult and it had not been possible for Parliament to
      separate the groups. Ben Watson KC then rose to argue for the secretary of state.
      He stated that the proceedings amounted to a substantive challenge to the proscription
      itself. But it showed no serious issue to be heard. Parliament’s intentions are
      very plain in the Terrorism Act. It sets out clear procedures to add organisations
      to the list. These had been followed. The legislation sets out at section 5 the
      method for appeal against proscription, to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal
      Commission (POAC). The route for appeal is, in the first instance, to the secretary
      of state, and in the second instance to POAC. Judge Chamberlain intervened that
      when the legislation had been passed, there had been no mechanism by which a court
      could see secret intelligence. (The inference being this is why POAC was established).
      Such a mechanism now existed. At this stage, it was ambitious for Watson to argue
      that there is no serious issue to be tried by the court. Watson responded that
      there is fundamental uncertainty as to whether the court can do this. Chamberlain
      responded that fundamental uncertainty means there is an issue to consider. The
      kernel to be addressed today was, are the grounds arguable? If so, what is the
      balance of convenience? Watson responded that this case is still narrower than
      the PKK case. Here there are no fundamental grounds to claim that the order is
      wrong. Yet the court in the PKK case still concluded that proscription was an
      issue for Parliament. This was a constitutional point. Any appeal must go to the
      secretary of state first. The issues are precisely the same as in the Tamil Tigers
      case. All of this is finally in the territory of POAC. If interim relief were
      granted, the organisation would not currently be proscribed, and so POAC would
      not be able to look at the case. In instituting POAC as the route for appeal,
      Parliament had made no provision for interim relief pending appeal, so it plainly
      was not Parliament’s intention that such relief should be possible. This court
      has no power of judicial review of proscription. Parliament had provided an adequate
      route in POAC. The first appeal is to the secretary of state. Judge Chamberlain
      asked Watson to confirm that his argument was that if an organisation that clearly
      does not fall within the definition of terrorism were to be proscribed, they would
      have no remedy other than to appeal through the secretary of state, and would
      remain proscribed while they appealed? Watson concurred, and went on to argue
      that if there is an unassailable case that you are doing serious damage to property,
      then Article X freedom of speech protection is much diminished. Judge Chamberlain
      asked whether the chilling effect on Article X and XI of proscription — including
      on people not involved in criminal damage — might be serious. Watson replied that
      in the Tamil Tigers case it was ruled that the chilling effect on speech on Tamil
      self-determination does not have substantial weight against the suppression of
      terrorism. Watson said that it was difficult for Palestine Action to argue they
      were not trying to influence the government, when they had targeted an RAF base.
      There was no evidence that consultation with Israel and Elbit Systems by the secretary
      of state had amounted to improper influence. Judge Chamberlain concurred, stating
      that it was necessary to consult with the victims to assess damage. Watson agreed:
      it was important to take into account the views of foreign governments in the
      fight against terrorism. Any argument that the public consultation provision had
      not been properly enacted could not be sufficiently strong to void the proscription.
      Watson said that the fundamental kernel, that Palestine Action is engaged in terrorism
      as defined in the act, had not been challenged by the claimant. You cannot grant
      interim relief on the basis that the definition in the statute is too broad. The
      secretary of state has no obligation to consider the interests of the organisation
      that is being proscribed. There are no rules on who can make representations to
      the secretary of state nor when they should be heard. Parliament did not put in
      any judicial controls on the secretary of state. This was deliberate. Judge Chamberlain
      remarked that if the justification stands for not giving notice of proscription,
      that this would allow Palestine Action to make preparations to continue, then
      the same justification stands for not consulting on the question. Watson replied
      that the grounds for objecting to proscription are not substantial anyway, so
      there could never have been any worthwhile representations on behalf of Palestine
      Action in any consultation. Watson said that there was secret intelligence evidence
      about Palestine Action that could be tackled at a later stage through the special
      advocate process. In the meantime what they had was the secretary of state’s evidence
      and her statement to parliament. The police need to be able to implement the law
      of the land. The courts must not trespass on the rights of parliament, nor appear
      to do so. Judge Chamberlain, for the first time, seemed annoyed. “I am not going
      to worry about that” he said, “you have conceded that this court has jurisdiction”.
      Watson said that this was a grave matter of national security, where the courts
      conceded to the judgment of the executive. Judge Chamberlain backed down immediately.
      He said that national security consideration weighs heavily in the scale. “I cannot
      say that this does not impinge on national security if the secretary of state
      says so and that belief is rational.” Watson continued that POAC is the statutory
      scheme for appeal,. The public interest represented by the secretary of state
      outweighs any private interest of groups or individuals. Judge Chamberlain agreed.
      He said the order exists because the secretary of state believes it will provide
      the public with certain protections. If the order is suspended it will be denied
      that protection. The secretary of state had said that people will be able to continue
      to oppose Israel’s actions; they will be able to continue to describe those actions
      as genocide or other breaches of international humanitarian law. Judge Chamberlain
      then suggested that if someone who had once been a member of Palestine Action
      decided to spray paint on something, that would not make it any more or less lawful
      than it had been before. This time Watson refused to agree. He asserted that there
      can be no private right to do something criminal. Judge Chamberlain was now enthusiastically
      strolling around his own fantasy world where the police and prosecutors are kindly
      and reasonable. “There is no reason for anybody to regard somebody’s past association
      with a now proscribed organisation as blameworthy”, he suggested. Watson replied
      that the government’s determination is that the organisation is terrorist. So
      the existence of stigma is irrelevant. It already exists. The priority is national
      security. In conclusion, Watson spoke the chilling words that made me jump in
      my chair. Watson said precisely: “We accept of course that it is draconian and
      deliberately so.” (Say that to yourself out loud, and consider what kind of state
      it is where the government can openly say this in court.) Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh
      KC then rose to rebut. She quoted Andrew Feinstein, that the methods of Palestine
      Action were identical to those of anti-apartheid activists. Feinstein stated that
      the majority of Palestine Action activists he had encountered were not terrorists,
      but pacifists. All of the actions were capable of being protected under Article
      X and Article XI [of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)]. Not every
      act of damage to property is criminal. There are many examples of Palestine Action
      activists being acquitted. Judge Chamberlain interjected that they will only in
      future be illegal if under the aegis of Palestine Action. Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh
      Blinne retorted that Palestine Action protest outside arms factories regularly.
      If the same activists turn up to protest, they will be accused of being Palestine
      Action. The case of the Tamil Tigers is not apposite, she continued. The Tamil
      Tigers were engaged in armed action. The secretary of state had said that all
      actions of the Tamil Tigers had an axis to violence. That is absolutely not the
      case here. Statements in favour of Palestine Action before proscription would
      be interpreted by the police as giving suspicion of continuing support. What is
      Palestine Action, other than a loose network of people who want to see Elbit shut
      down? The secretary of state says that somehow people’s Article X and XI rights
      will magically be protected. This will not be the case. Palestine Action is not
      being proscribed on the grounds that it rejects the tenets of a democratic society.
      It rather opposes corporate complicity in fundamental breaches of international
      law. There is clear Strasbourg case law that you do not lose protection of the
      ECHR because of any violent act by another member of the same organisation. Timing
      and context are key. Palestine Action are attempting to prevent the most serious
      crime of all in the middle of a Genocide. In the case of the Christian Democrat
      Party of Moldova, the Strasbourg court had found it was wrong to ban them without
      notice just 21 days before an election. Context and timing are important. People
      were today protesting outside this court. Those continuing to protest this proscription
      in the next two weeks would be branded as terrorists, were interim relief not
      given now. Ben Watson now interjected – I am not sure on what basis – to say that
      the correct appeal against proscription was through POAC. Raza Husain Closes Raza
      Husain then closed for the claimant. He stated that Palestine Action were a group
      of people who put their bodies on the line between genocide and its planes and
      weapons. The secretary of state had been granted extra time to give evidence of
      what harm would arise if the interim relief were granted, and she had given nothing.
      The harm might be the deprivation of liberty to literally thousands of people.
      Arrests were foreseeable. This was a civil disobedience movement. There will be
      an I Am Spartacus wave. Civil disobedience is not illegal but has a long and honourable
      history in British society. It will carry on. The public interest is indeed engaged.
      It does not all fall on one side. Hundreds of thousands of people support Palestine
      Action. There was real and lasting damage to the right of the public to freedom
      of speech and to protest. That closed the hearing. It was now 3.15 p.m. on Friday,
      July 4. Judge Chamberlain said that he would attempt to return with his decision
      by 5.30 pm. Outside the drummers were still drumming and the dancers were still
      dancing. I gave a few more interviews. I really wasn’t feeling well at all at
      this stage. At 5.30 p.m. we were back in the court for Chamberlain to give his
      decision. He started by saying he had considered the likelihood of success of
      the appeal for judicial review, and had decided that the only ground where there
      was arguably a strong case to be heard was that of disproportionate interference
      with Article X and Article XI rights under the ECHR. Some of the other grounds
      may be plausible, but he was not in a position to judge that today. However, he
      considered that the claimant had not demonstrated that irreversible harm would
      be caused if interim relief were not granted. Therefore he was not suspending
      the proscription, which would come into force at midnight according to the secretary
      of state’s order. He assumed that the claimant would seek leave to appeal to the
      Court of Appeal. He would not grant leave to appeal. However the claimants could
      try to ask the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal, this evening before the proscription
      came into force. Chamberlain then disappeared through the door behind his chair.
      The legal team were left staring at his detailed judgment. His incredibly detailed
      judgment. It is 24 pages long, and runs to 104 paragraphs, many of which have
      sub-paragraphs. Let me try to offer a perspective. I have a reasonable claim not
      to be stupid. I topped the civil service exams in my year and became the U.K.’s
      youngest ambassador. It has taken me eight solid hours to write this article to
      this point, not including probably twice that in thinking time. Chamberlain’s
      judgment is over twice the length of this article so far. Produced in two hours,
      at the rate of almost one paragraph per minute? Plainly the bulk of it was written
      before the hearing – or written by somebody else. Just a thought. With the disturbing
      insight that this was all a charade, I joined the Palestine Action legal team
      who were having to digest this judgment and work out how to launch an appeal to
      the Court of Appeal after 6pm on a Friday evening. Otherwise the proscription
      took effect on the stroke of midnight. Despite being extremely experienced, nobody
      on the team had ever been through a similar procedure. Judges are not given to
      hanging around the courts out of hours, and indeed are strongly inclined to find
      reasons to wrap up proceedings in trials and hearings early on a Friday. And this
      was in the middle of both Wimbledon and a Test Match… Having such a large legal
      team finally made sense, as they all, including four barristers who had not spoken,
      scanned through the judgment looking to find grounds of appeal. Raza gave instructions
      to telephone the duty clerk of the Court of Appeal and find out if the duty judge
      were available. The question then was whether the duty judge would be prepared
      to sit and hear an appeal as a single judge, or would want a panel of three. The
      call was made, while we several times had to fend off security guards who were
      attempting to clear the building. Huda had been giving instructions via videolink,
      and it was only now that I discovered there was in fact someone from Palestine
      Action present with the team. One of the legal team said to me mischievously “If
      they ask you to leave, we can ask Huda to say that you are with Palestine Action
      – pause – she had better add until 11.59 p.m.”. Within five minutes of the call
      being made, a security guard came to us and told us we were to move to Court 4,
      the court of the lord chief Justice. We had to gather up all the files and move
      there, a long trek through the bowels of the building, and at one stage diving
      off on a shortcut up a staircase that nobody in the team knew existed (there are
      over 100 staircases in this extraordinary building). We entered Court 4 at around
      7 p.m. We were now in the grandest area of the building. Forgive me if I recycle
      a description of this courtroom I have used before: “It is very high, and lit
      by heavy mock-medieval chandeliers hung by long cast iron chains from a ceiling
      so high you can’t really see it. You expect Robin Hood to suddenly leap from the
      balconied gallery and swing across on the chandelier above you. The room is very
      gloomy; the murky dusk hovers menacingly above the lights like a miasma of despair;
      below them you peer through the weak light to make out the participants. A huge
      tiered oak dais occupies half the room, with the judges seated at its apex, their
      clerks at the next level down, and lower lateral wings reaching out, at one side
      to house journalists and at the other a huge dock for the prisoners, with a massy
      iron cage that looks left over from a production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
      This is in fact the most modern part of the construction; caging defendants in
      medieval style is a Blair-era introduction to the so-called process of law – as
      indeed is the Terrorism Act. All the walls are lined with high bookcases, housing
      thousands of leather-bound volumes of old cases. The stone floor peeks out for
      one yard between the judicial dais and the storied wooden pews, with six tiers
      of increasingly narrow seating. The back of each bench has a little ledge for
      those behind to place their papers. Watching people attempt to balance laptops
      on a five inch shelf is quite amusing.” Gareth turned to me and said that we were
      honoured to be in such a historic spot, which had already witnessed some of the
      world’s greatest miscarriages of justice. As we sat ourselves down, out of the
      door at the back of the dais appeared in all her majesty the lady justice of England
      and Wales, Lady Carr, who was flanked by Lord Justice Lewis and Lord Justice Edis.
      Evidently these three had just been hanging around the court at 7 p.m. on a Friday
      evening, and happened to be available to hear the request for permission to appeal.
      I had a moment of crystal clarity. I had spent the whole day participating in
      a charade, and even the wonderful legal team around me were at base also just
      participants in that charade. Lady Carr opened by grumbling loudly that there
      was very little time, they had not seen the supporting evidence, they had only
      just received Chamberlain’s judgment, and had no idea what were the purported
      grounds of appeal. She asked Raza Husain if he had grounds of appeal, and what
      were they? She reminded us that an appeal was not a rerun of the case but had
      to find specific errors in law by Judge Chamberlain. “Where do you say that he
      erred?” Raza Husain evidently had not been expecting to present the grounds of
      appeal instantly, and the team had only just finished reading the judgment and
      started thinking about how to appeal it when we had been called to Court 4. He
      was now instantly standing in front of the Court of Appeal. He extemporised that
      there were three grounds of appeal at least. The judge had erred in law in that
      he had failed to take into account the weight of mass arrests in assessing the
      balance of convenience argument. He had failed to insist upon evidence of the
      urgency of immediate imposition. He had failed to accord due weight to the failure
      of the secretary of state to consult before proscription. Lady Carr said that
      the court would hear an application for permission to appeal. Skeleton argument
      for the appeal must be submitted in one hour, by 8:15 p.m., and the court would
      hear oral arguments at 9 p.m. and endeavour to deliver judgment before midnight.
      This was somewhat confusing. They were granting a hearing for permission to appeal,
      not agreeing to hear an appeal. So if they granted permission, there would have
      to be a further stage of the actual appeal hearing. How could that be done if
      their decision on permission to appeal were not given much before midnight? There
      being no time to retire anywhere else, the legal team started beavering away immediately
      on the benches. At 9 p.m. we were listening to the appeal. Raza Husain said he
      would make five very brief points. 1) Civil disobedience had a long and honourable
      history in the U.K. 2) This was the first time a non-violent direct action group
      had been proscribed as terrorist. 3) Five U.N. special rapporteurs had written
      opposing the proscription. 4) Huda Ammori had been inspired by the suffragettes.
      5) Andrew Feinstein compared the methods of Palestine Action to the liberation
      struggle against apartheid. And there were five grounds of appeal. 1) The judge
      had erred in law in saying that there would not be substantial irreparable harm
      if the proscription were not delayed. There were undisputed consequences of arrest
      for expressing support for Palestine Action — this harm was deprivation of liberty,
      loss of employment and stigma. 2) The judge had afforded insufficient weight to
      the up to 14-year prison sentence for simply stating “I support Palestine Action”.
      3) The judge had given undue weight to national security considerations, where
      no evidence of urgency had been given. 4) Blinne took over for Ground 4. Chamberlain
      had erred in law in failing to take proper account of the impact of Articles X
      and XI of ECHR. Lady Carr interjected that Chamberlain did say there were Article
      X and XI grounds for the application for a judicial hearing against proscription.
      Blinne responded that however he had failed to give this sufficient weight against
      national security in the balance of convenience exercise, and that he had erred
      in saying that future evidence on this will be forthcoming from the secretary
      of state. He had to do the balance of convenience exercise on the evidence before
      him, today. If the proscription order came into account, it would have a chilling
      effect on protests outside Elbit factories, even from people unrelated to Palestine
      Action. It would chill free speech on Palestine. Any action for Palestine might
      be claimed by the police to be support for Palestine Action, and people would
      be jailed on remand. Palestine Action was an extremely loose organisation. What
      constituted support was extremely unclear in such a case, and there could be hundreds
      of arrests. 5) Raza Husain took over again for ground 5. The availability of an
      appeal to POAC does not oust judicial review. There were consequences for the
      common law right of free speech and for articles V and X of the ECHR. Ben Watson
      stood to respond for the secretary of state. He said Chamberlain’s judgment was
      measured and detailed. The claimant in this appeal had not challenged Chamberlain’s
      finding that the secretary of state had rightly designated Palestine Action as
      concerned with terrorism. They had not appealed against the crucial argument of
      the public interest in allowing the law of the land to take effect. Their criticism
      of the judge’s decision goes only to weight afforded to varying factors, on only
      one of the strands which the judge was balancing. The court could not give weight
      to the threat of mass flouting of the law. The claimant was merely attempting
      to relitigate matters which had been properly considered by the court. Chamberlain
      said that there was a serious issue to consider under Article X and XI. That is
      not the same as saying there was a strong case. The judge was not depending on
      future evidence, he was merely indicating that further evidence might come. Lord
      Justice Edis asked Watson how he responded to the argument that not all members
      of an organisation should be held responsible for the actions of an individual.
      Watson replied that Palestine Action were responsible for a long pattern of criminal
      activity. On rebuttal, Raza Husain said there had been no denial that the judge
      had failed to weigh the correct counterfactual against Article X and XI. Political
      speech on Palestine is protected speech. It attracts significant Article X protection
      and must continue to do so. Blinne added that the appeal is not about what will
      happen to people engaging in unlawful conduct, it is about what will happen to
      people who are engaging in conduct which would be perfectly lawful were it not
      for the proscription. That is how the effect on Article X must be measured. This
      was the first ever proscription of a non-violent movement. The harm was that it
      would criminalise the Article X protected actions of law-abiding people. That
      concluded the appeal, at about 9:30 pm. Judges’ Verdict In less than an hour the
      judges were back with their verdict . Again it was available in writing, and despite
      Lady Carr making a point of fussing about typos due to the haste, I quite simply
      do not believe that it was produced in under an hour. It contains 52 paragraphs,
      some of which have many sub-paragraphs. It is possible to make an argument that
      Judge Chamberlain had pre-written most of his judgment based on the documents
      and skeleton arguments that had been submitted in advance and only had to make
      some amendments to reflect the oral hearing. But the Court of Appeal were supposed
      not to have known they even had a case until 10 minutes before they sat. I simply
      do not buy the speed with which these judgements were produced. Lady Carr set
      about delivering the judgment. She said that these remarks were just for information;
      the written judgment was the actual judgment and anything she said did not vary
      that. The proscription had followed an attack on RAF Brize Norton. The order had
      been passed by each House of Parliament. Judge Chamberlain had refused to grant
      a stay of the proscription and had refused to give permission to appeal and had
      refused any stay pending an application to appeal. The merits of the decision
      to proscribe are not a matter for the Court of Appeal. Nor is the court looking
      into the claims of Palestine Action. The Court of Appeal is only considering whether
      Judge Chamberlain erred in law. On the principle of balance, Judge Chamberlain
      was right that the court must give great weight to national security and the executive’s
      approach to it. Judge Chamberlain was entitled to the view that individuals must
      obey the order while it was in force. It will remain lawful to express opposition
      to Israel or to Israel’s actions in Gaza. “No person will be prosecuted in relation
      to conduct before proscription”. There was no prospect of a successful appeal
      and permission to appeal was therefore refused. Raza Ali rose to request permission
      to appeal to the Supreme Court. Lady Carr responded that plainly that could not
      happen before midnight. A written application should be submitted by 2pm on Monday.
      There followed a horrible display by Lady Carr of sickly congratulation. In response
      to a correction by Blinne to the accents on her name in the judgment, Lady Carr
      gushed about her “lovely name.” She congratulated all the lawyers effusively on
      being brief and helpful, and said the case “upheld the best traditions of the
      bar”. What it upheld, of course, was a further step into authoritarianism. This
      was the next morning: an 83-year-old priest arrested for supporting Palestine
      Action. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    one_sentence_summary: Palestine Action, a non-violent activist group protesting
      against British military support for Israel, is challenging its recent designation
      as a terrorist organization by the UK government in court.
    paragraph_summary: On November 6, 2023, Palestine Action activists blockaded the
      Elbit Systems Instro Precision factory in Sandwich, Kent, following the group's
      recent designation as a terrorist organization by the British government after
      their protest against military support for Israel in Gaza. The group is currently
      challenging this designation in court, arguing that the government's proscription
      lacked a proper legal basis and had undergone an inadequate parliamentary process.
      During the court proceedings, it was noted that the proscription was treated as
      an executive instrument rather than primary legislation, and the judge acknowledged
      the government's failure to adequately separate Palestine Action from other groups
      listed. The case highlights tensions surrounding the definition of terrorism and
      the rights of activist organizations in the UK.

      artificial intelligence company, despite the tech billionaire’s ongoing spat with
      President Donald Trump and his AI chatbot’s recent praise for Nazi leader Adolf
      Hitler. The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office announced contract
      awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and Musk’s xAI “to accelerate Department
      of Defense (DOD) adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address critical national
      security challenges.” Last week, xAI garnered sweeping condemnation after Grok,
      the chatbot built into Musk’s social media platform X—formerly known as Twitter—started
      spewing antisemitic content and calling itself “MechaHitler.” Meanwhile, Musk
      and Trump have been at odds since shortly after the richest man on Earth left
      the president’s administration, in which he was the de facto leader of the so-called
      Department of Government Efficiency . Musk’s involvement in the administration
      generated widespread concern, both because of DOGE’s efforts to gut the federal
      government and because his various companies get so much money from federal contracts.
      In a Monday statement about “Grok for Government,” xAI not only confirmed the
      new DOD contract but also said that its products will be “available to purchase
      via the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule. This allows every federal

      donation . By Marjorie Cohn / Truthout The day after Donald Trump welcomed indicted
      war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United States for
      the third time in less than six months, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed
      sanctions against UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine Francesca Albanese
      for her clear-eyed critiques of Israel’s genocide. In a July 9 press statement
      , Rubio charged that Albanese “has directly engaged with the International Criminal
      Court (ICC) in efforts to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute nationals
      of the United States or Israel, without the consent of those two countries.” He
      alleged that Albanese “has spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for
      terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West … including
      recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants”
      for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “No comment on mafia style
      intimidation techniques,” Albanese responded to the sanctions in a text message
      to Al Jazeera . “Busy reminding member states of their obligations to stop and
      punish genocide. And those who profit from it.” She queried why she had been sanctioned:
      “for having exposed a genocide? For having denounced the system? They never challenged
      me on the facts.” In the height of irony, war criminal Netanyahu nominated serial
      lawbreaker Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. But it is Albanese who deserves that
      prize. “The UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine deserves the Nobel Peace
      Prize, not the U.S. punitive pushback by way of targeted sanctions denying her
      entry into the country and freezing any American assets she may have,” Richard
      Falk, who served as UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine from 2008 to 2014,
      told Truthout. “This was an intimidating attack on Albanese, an unpaid civil servant,
      for her brave truth-telling and expert knowledge fully in accord with expectations
      of the job to report periodically to the UN Human Rights Council and the General
      Assembly,” Falk added. “Her well-documented reports have broken the mainstream
      silence in the West on Israel’s genocidal assault, carried out before the eyes
      and ears of the world, shocking many by its transparency and sadism over a period
      of more than 20 months. She has also exposed shameful patterns of U.S. complicity
      with Israeli criminality.” As they dined together in Washington, Netanyahu told
      Trump he had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination, which Netanyahu
      sent to the Nobel Committee 10 days after the U.S. bombed nuclear facilities in
      Iran, rewarded Trump for his unwavering support for the crimes of the Zionist
      regime in both Palestine and Iran. Trump has continued and increased Joe Biden’s
      financial, political, and diplomatic assistance to Israel’s (now) 21-month-long
      genocide in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which has killed more than 58,000
      Palestinians. Trump also dutifully complied with Netanyahu’s plea to bomb Iranian
      nuclear sites, dropping several 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs on Iran. U.S.
      participation in Israel’s international crimes is patently illegal . “Anatomy
      of a Genocide” On July 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Anatomy of a Genocide
      ” with the UN Human Rights Council. The summary begins, “After five months of
      military operations, Israel has destroyed Gaza.” That was one year ago. Not content
      with destroying Gaza, Israel continues to slaughter, starve, and displace the
      Palestinian people. In this report, Albanese thoroughly documents Israel’s commission
      of genocide which is prohibited by the Genocide Convention . She cites the International
      Court of Justice’s (ICJ’s) order that Israel prevent and punish genocide and ensure
      humanitarian aid, which Israel has ignored. Albanese finds that “Israel has strategically
      invoked the international humanitarian law framework as ‘humanitarian camouflage’
      to legitimize its genocidal violence in Gaza.” Israel, she charges, “appears to
      represent itself as conducting a ‘proportionate genocide.’” The crime of genocide,
      Albanese notes, entails “both individual and State responsibility.” Israel’s actions
      “have been driven by a genocidal logic integral to its settler-colonial project
      in Palestine, signalling a tragedy foretold,” Albanese continues. “[D]isplacing
      and erasing the Indigenous Arab presence,” she writes, “has been an inevitable
      part of the forming of Israel as a ‘Jewish State.’” Since illegally acquiring
      Palestinian territory by force in 1967, “Israel has advanced its settler-colonial
      project through military occupation, stripping the Palestinian people of their
      right to self-determination,” the report reads. “Genocide cannot be justified
      under any circumstances, including purported self-defence.” The ICJ has repeatedly
      held that Israel, as occupier, does not have a right to self-defense against the
      occupied Palestinians. Albanese recommends that UN member states immediately implement
      an arms embargo on Israel, and investigate and prosecute war crimes, crimes against
      humanity, and genocide under principles of universal jurisdiction . “Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure” On October 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure .” In it, she expands her analysis of Israel’s genocide beyond
      the July 1 report. She cites the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion of July 2024, finding
      Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and reaffirming that the
      unlawfulness of the occupation “vitiates [Israel’s] claims of purported self-defence.”
      Albanese writes that “the only lawful recourse available to Israel is its unconditional
      withdrawal from the whole of that territory.” When this report was filed, at least
      90 percent of Palestinians in Gaza had been forcibly displaced, “many more than
      10 times,” Albanese writes. Israeli officials and religious leaders “continue
      to encourage erasure and dispossession of Palestinians, setting new thresholds
      for acceptable violence against civilians. The Nakba, which has been ongoing since
      1948, has been deliberately accelerated.” “As Israeli leaders promised,” Albanese
      writes, “Gaza has been made unfit for human life.” She found “an intent to destroy
      [the] population [of Gaza] through starvation … Hungry crowds waiting for food
      have been massacred.” Indeed, between May 27, when the sham Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF) began operations, and July 7, the UN Human Rights Office documented
      798 killings “including 615 in the vicinity of the GHF sites and 183 presumably
      on the routes of aid convoys.” The deaths were mostly due to gunshot injuries
      received while trying to access aid. Albanese characterized “the pattern of targeting
      children” as “shocking.” Moreover, she concludes, “The overall aim is to humiliate
      and degrade Palestinians as a whole,” citing sadistic torture en masse, piling
      up decomposing bodies in the street, “young children left limbless before they
      could even crawl,” and the destruction of homes so the people have nowhere to
      return to. The report finds that “[c]ontinual, unproven attributions of Hamas
      affiliation … help disguise the systematic targeting of civilians, de facto erasing
      Palestinian civilian-ness altogether.” It states that “The State of Israel is
      predicated on the goal of Palestinian erasure; its entire political system is
      directed towards this goal.” Indeed, a centerpiece of the recent talks between
      Trump and Netanyahu was the complete ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.
      They referred to “Trump’s vision of relocating Gazans,” with Netanyahu claiming
      that they were “getting close to finding several countries” to accept Palestinians
      who want to leave the Gaza Strip, although no country has publicly agreed to do
      so. Netanyahu asserted that the plans for forced relocation would give the Palestinians
      the “ freedom to choose ” whether to leave Gaza. “Freedom to choose is so Orwellian,”
      Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at Jewish Currents, said on Democracy Now! “Palestinians
      have actually been … asking for the freedom to choose, the real freedom to choose,
      since 1948, because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza.”
      He added, “They were expelled from their homes in what’s now Israel … So, they
      do want the freedom to choose. They want the freedom to return to the places from
      which their families were expelled.” Albanese urges UN member states to initiate
      a full arms embargo and sanctions against Israel; formally recognize Israel as
      an apartheid state; support the deployment of an international protection force
      in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; develop a protective framework for Palestinians
      who are displaced outside Gaza; support independent and thorough criminal investigations
      of apartheid and genocide; investigate and prosecute corporations involved in
      crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; and ensure unhindered humanitarian
      aid to Gaza. She also urges the ICC prosecutor to investigate Israel genocide
      and apartheid. “From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide” Albanese’s
      most recent report, “ From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide ,” was
      filed on June 30. “Arms companies have turned near-record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry to unleash 85,000 tons of explosives — six times
      the power of Hiroshima — to destroy Gaza,” she said when presenting her report
      to the UN Human Rights Council. In the report, Albanese investigates the corporate
      machinery that sustains the Israeli settler-colonial project of displacement and
      replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory. As political leaders
      and states evade their obligations, “many corporate entities have profited from
      the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and now genocide,” the summary
      reads. The report lists more than 60 corporate entities , including weapons manufacturers,
      arms dealers, travel agents, real estate brokers, aerospace companies, tech firms,
      banks, asset management firms, pension funds, surveillance and incarceration technologies,
      charities, insurers, and universities. She mentions Lockheed Martin, Chevron,
      Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, Amazon, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Caterpillar, Airbnb,
      BlackRock, Palantir, Elbit, Allianz, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AXA,
      Drummond, BNP, HD Hyundai, and Volvo. Citing the Guiding Principles on Business
      and Human Rights, Albanese writes: “States have the primary obligation to prevent,
      investigate, punish and remedy human rights abuses by third parties, and may breach
      their obligations if they fail to do so.” The corporate sector, which has provided
      Israel with weapons and machinery to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places
      of worship, and productive assets, “has contributed to the creation of the conditions
      for Palestinian ethnic cleansing.” Corporations have sustained “Israeli expansion
      in occupied land while facilitating the replacement of Palestinians” and “turned
      the occupied Palestinian territory into a captive market.” Albanese analyzes how
      “the forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers
      and big tech” and “[a]rms companies have turned over near record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry that has devastated a virtually defenceless
      civilian population.” She urges member states to impose sanctions and a full arms
      embargo on Israel; suspend or prevent trade agreements and investment relations;
      and impose sanctions, including asset freezes, on entities and individuals participating
      in activities that may endanger Palestinians. Albanese urges corporate entities
      “to promptly cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly
      linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international
      crimes against the Palestinian people, in accordance with international corporate
      responsibilities and the law of self-determination” and pay reparations to the
      Palestinian people. In addition, she urges the ICC to investigate and prosecute
      corporate executives and/or corporate entities for international crimes. Finally,
      Albanese “urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to
      press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability
      at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can
      end these unspeakable crimes.” To Stand With Albanese Is to Stand With the Palestinian
      People July 9 marked the 20th anniversary of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions
      (BDS) movement, a nonviolent campaign launched by Palestinian civil society to
      hold Israel accountable under international law. “We decided that, at a minimum,
      in order for Palestinians to exercise our inalienable right as an indigenous people
      in our homeland to self-determination, three rights must be achieved,” BDS co-founder
      Omar Barghouti said in an interview with Mondoweiss. “An end to the military occupation,
      an end to the system of racial domination, segregation and apartheid, and the
      right of refugees to return and receive reparations.” Barghouti noted that before
      October 2023, not one country supported a military embargo of Israel. Now 53 states
      have official policies of military embargo. The Norwegian pension fund, the largest
      sovereign state fund in the world, divested from Israeli bonds and several companies
      that contribute to apartheid. Large churches throughout the U.S. are divesting
      from Israel, and U.S. universities are divesting in response to student encampments
      and mobilizations. There are corporate, academic, sports, and cultural boycotts
      as well. “Sanctioning Francesca Albanese confirms the U.S.’s brazen contempt for
      international law and the UN, betraying the vision of why it was established under
      U.S. guidance in 1945, as a beacon of light after the carnage and genocide of
      World War II,” Falk told Truthout . “These sanctions on Albanese carry defiance
      of international law to another level, by inverting justice and punishing those
      who dare document what the U.S. government insists on covering up. We should have
      learned by now that hiding genocide from legal and moral scrutiny compounds the
      tragedy and brings added shame to its governmental and corporate accomplices.”
      The Trump administration’s sanctioning of Albanese “is a blatant affront to the
      Palestinian people’s demand for justice, truth, and accountability; an act of
      support for and incitement to genocide; and an intervention designed to dismantle
      one of the core independent oversight mechanisms of the multilateral international
      system,” several organizations and individuals, including this writer, wrote in
      a public statement initiated by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.
      “To stand with Francesca Albanese is to stand with the Palestinian people in their
      quest for justice in the face of occupation, genocide, and war crimes — and to
      defend the universal values of international law.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment

    one_sentence_summary: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed sanctions on UN
      Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese for her critiques of Israel's actions, following
      a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. amidst rising
      tensions over accountability for alleged war crimes.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent development, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
      imposed sanctions on Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied
      Palestine, following her outspoken criticism of Israel's actions, which she describes
      as genocide. Rubio accused her of engaging with the International Criminal Court
      (ICC) to investigate U.S. and Israeli nationals and labeled her comments as antisemitic
      and supportive of terrorism. Albanese responded to the sanctions by questioning
      the rationale behind them, emphasizing her commitment to exposing genocide and
      holding accountable those who profit from it. The article highlights the irony
      of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominating Donald Trump for a Nobel
      Peace Prize while suggesting that Albanese, for her advocacy, is more deserving
      of such recognition.

      donation . By Marjorie Cohn / Truthout The day after Donald Trump welcomed indicted
      war criminal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United States for
      the third time in less than six months, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed
      sanctions against UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine Francesca Albanese
      for her clear-eyed critiques of Israel’s genocide. In a July 9 press statement
      , Rubio charged that Albanese “has directly engaged with the International Criminal
      Court (ICC) in efforts to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute nationals
      of the United States or Israel, without the consent of those two countries.” He
      alleged that Albanese “has spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for
      terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West … including
      recommending that the ICC, without a legitimate basis, issue arrest warrants”
      for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. “No comment on mafia style
      intimidation techniques,” Albanese responded to the sanctions in a text message
      to Al Jazeera . “Busy reminding member states of their obligations to stop and
      punish genocide. And those who profit from it.” She queried why she had been sanctioned:
      “for having exposed a genocide? For having denounced the system? They never challenged
      me on the facts.” In the height of irony, war criminal Netanyahu nominated serial
      lawbreaker Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. But it is Albanese who deserves that
      prize. “The UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine deserves the Nobel Peace
      Prize, not the U.S. punitive pushback by way of targeted sanctions denying her
      entry into the country and freezing any American assets she may have,” Richard
      Falk, who served as UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied Palestine from 2008 to 2014,
      told Truthout. “This was an intimidating attack on Albanese, an unpaid civil servant,
      for her brave truth-telling and expert knowledge fully in accord with expectations
      of the job to report periodically to the UN Human Rights Council and the General
      Assembly,” Falk added. “Her well-documented reports have broken the mainstream
      silence in the West on Israel’s genocidal assault, carried out before the eyes
      and ears of the world, shocking many by its transparency and sadism over a period
      of more than 20 months. She has also exposed shameful patterns of U.S. complicity
      with Israeli criminality.” As they dined together in Washington, Netanyahu told
      Trump he had nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination, which Netanyahu
      sent to the Nobel Committee 10 days after the U.S. bombed nuclear facilities in
      Iran, rewarded Trump for his unwavering support for the crimes of the Zionist
      regime in both Palestine and Iran. Trump has continued and increased Joe Biden’s
      financial, political, and diplomatic assistance to Israel’s (now) 21-month-long
      genocide in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which has killed more than 58,000
      Palestinians. Trump also dutifully complied with Netanyahu’s plea to bomb Iranian
      nuclear sites, dropping several 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs on Iran. U.S.
      participation in Israel’s international crimes is patently illegal . “Anatomy
      of a Genocide” On July 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Anatomy of a Genocide
      ” with the UN Human Rights Council. The summary begins, “After five months of
      military operations, Israel has destroyed Gaza.” That was one year ago. Not content
      with destroying Gaza, Israel continues to slaughter, starve, and displace the
      Palestinian people. In this report, Albanese thoroughly documents Israel’s commission
      of genocide which is prohibited by the Genocide Convention . She cites the International
      Court of Justice’s (ICJ’s) order that Israel prevent and punish genocide and ensure
      humanitarian aid, which Israel has ignored. Albanese finds that “Israel has strategically
      invoked the international humanitarian law framework as ‘humanitarian camouflage’
      to legitimize its genocidal violence in Gaza.” Israel, she charges, “appears to
      represent itself as conducting a ‘proportionate genocide.’” The crime of genocide,
      Albanese notes, entails “both individual and State responsibility.” Israel’s actions
      “have been driven by a genocidal logic integral to its settler-colonial project
      in Palestine, signalling a tragedy foretold,” Albanese continues. “[D]isplacing
      and erasing the Indigenous Arab presence,” she writes, “has been an inevitable
      part of the forming of Israel as a ‘Jewish State.’” Since illegally acquiring
      Palestinian territory by force in 1967, “Israel has advanced its settler-colonial
      project through military occupation, stripping the Palestinian people of their
      right to self-determination,” the report reads. “Genocide cannot be justified
      under any circumstances, including purported self-defence.” The ICJ has repeatedly
      held that Israel, as occupier, does not have a right to self-defense against the
      occupied Palestinians. Albanese recommends that UN member states immediately implement
      an arms embargo on Israel, and investigate and prosecute war crimes, crimes against
      humanity, and genocide under principles of universal jurisdiction . “Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure” On October 1, 2024, Albanese filed her report “ Genocide
      as Colonial Erasure .” In it, she expands her analysis of Israel’s genocide beyond
      the July 1 report. She cites the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion of July 2024, finding
      Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and reaffirming that the
      unlawfulness of the occupation “vitiates [Israel’s] claims of purported self-defence.”
      Albanese writes that “the only lawful recourse available to Israel is its unconditional
      withdrawal from the whole of that territory.” When this report was filed, at least
      90 percent of Palestinians in Gaza had been forcibly displaced, “many more than
      10 times,” Albanese writes. Israeli officials and religious leaders “continue
      to encourage erasure and dispossession of Palestinians, setting new thresholds
      for acceptable violence against civilians. The Nakba, which has been ongoing since
      1948, has been deliberately accelerated.” “As Israeli leaders promised,” Albanese
      writes, “Gaza has been made unfit for human life.” She found “an intent to destroy
      [the] population [of Gaza] through starvation … Hungry crowds waiting for food
      have been massacred.” Indeed, between May 27, when the sham Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF) began operations, and July 7, the UN Human Rights Office documented
      798 killings “including 615 in the vicinity of the GHF sites and 183 presumably
      on the routes of aid convoys.” The deaths were mostly due to gunshot injuries
      received while trying to access aid. Albanese characterized “the pattern of targeting
      children” as “shocking.” Moreover, she concludes, “The overall aim is to humiliate
      and degrade Palestinians as a whole,” citing sadistic torture en masse, piling
      up decomposing bodies in the street, “young children left limbless before they
      could even crawl,” and the destruction of homes so the people have nowhere to
      return to. The report finds that “[c]ontinual, unproven attributions of Hamas
      affiliation … help disguise the systematic targeting of civilians, de facto erasing
      Palestinian civilian-ness altogether.” It states that “The State of Israel is
      predicated on the goal of Palestinian erasure; its entire political system is
      directed towards this goal.” Indeed, a centerpiece of the recent talks between
      Trump and Netanyahu was the complete ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.
      They referred to “Trump’s vision of relocating Gazans,” with Netanyahu claiming
      that they were “getting close to finding several countries” to accept Palestinians
      who want to leave the Gaza Strip, although no country has publicly agreed to do
      so. Netanyahu asserted that the plans for forced relocation would give the Palestinians
      the “ freedom to choose ” whether to leave Gaza. “Freedom to choose is so Orwellian,”
      Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at Jewish Currents, said on Democracy Now! “Palestinians
      have actually been … asking for the freedom to choose, the real freedom to choose,
      since 1948, because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza.”
      He added, “They were expelled from their homes in what’s now Israel … So, they
      do want the freedom to choose. They want the freedom to return to the places from
      which their families were expelled.” Albanese urges UN member states to initiate
      a full arms embargo and sanctions against Israel; formally recognize Israel as
      an apartheid state; support the deployment of an international protection force
      in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; develop a protective framework for Palestinians
      who are displaced outside Gaza; support independent and thorough criminal investigations
      of apartheid and genocide; investigate and prosecute corporations involved in
      crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; and ensure unhindered humanitarian
      aid to Gaza. She also urges the ICC prosecutor to investigate Israel genocide
      and apartheid. “From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide” Albanese’s
      most recent report, “ From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide ,” was
      filed on June 30. “Arms companies have turned near-record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry to unleash 85,000 tons of explosives — six times
      the power of Hiroshima — to destroy Gaza,” she said when presenting her report
      to the UN Human Rights Council. In the report, Albanese investigates the corporate
      machinery that sustains the Israeli settler-colonial project of displacement and
      replacement of the Palestinians in the occupied territory. As political leaders
      and states evade their obligations, “many corporate entities have profited from
      the Israeli economy of illegal occupation, apartheid and now genocide,” the summary
      reads. The report lists more than 60 corporate entities , including weapons manufacturers,
      arms dealers, travel agents, real estate brokers, aerospace companies, tech firms,
      banks, asset management firms, pension funds, surveillance and incarceration technologies,
      charities, insurers, and universities. She mentions Lockheed Martin, Chevron,
      Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, Amazon, IBM, Hewlett Packard, Caterpillar, Airbnb,
      BlackRock, Palantir, Elbit, Allianz, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AXA,
      Drummond, BNP, HD Hyundai, and Volvo. Citing the Guiding Principles on Business
      and Human Rights, Albanese writes: “States have the primary obligation to prevent,
      investigate, punish and remedy human rights abuses by third parties, and may breach
      their obligations if they fail to do so.” The corporate sector, which has provided
      Israel with weapons and machinery to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places
      of worship, and productive assets, “has contributed to the creation of the conditions
      for Palestinian ethnic cleansing.” Corporations have sustained “Israeli expansion
      in occupied land while facilitating the replacement of Palestinians” and “turned
      the occupied Palestinian territory into a captive market.” Albanese analyzes how
      “the forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers
      and big tech” and “[a]rms companies have turned over near record profits by equipping
      Israel with cutting-edge weaponry that has devastated a virtually defenceless
      civilian population.” She urges member states to impose sanctions and a full arms
      embargo on Israel; suspend or prevent trade agreements and investment relations;
      and impose sanctions, including asset freezes, on entities and individuals participating
      in activities that may endanger Palestinians. Albanese urges corporate entities
      “to promptly cease all business activities and terminate relationships directly
      linked with, contributing to and causing human rights violations and international
      crimes against the Palestinian people, in accordance with international corporate
      responsibilities and the law of self-determination” and pay reparations to the
      Palestinian people. In addition, she urges the ICC to investigate and prosecute
      corporate executives and/or corporate entities for international crimes. Finally,
      Albanese “urges trade unions, lawyers, civil society and ordinary citizens to
      press for boycotts, divestments, sanctions, justice for Palestine and accountability
      at the international and domestic levels; together, the people of the world can
      end these unspeakable crimes.” To Stand With Albanese Is to Stand With the Palestinian
      People July 9 marked the 20th anniversary of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions
      (BDS) movement, a nonviolent campaign launched by Palestinian civil society to
      hold Israel accountable under international law. “We decided that, at a minimum,
      in order for Palestinians to exercise our inalienable right as an indigenous people
      in our homeland to self-determination, three rights must be achieved,” BDS co-founder
      Omar Barghouti said in an interview with Mondoweiss. “An end to the military occupation,
      an end to the system of racial domination, segregation and apartheid, and the
      right of refugees to return and receive reparations.” Barghouti noted that before
      October 2023, not one country supported a military embargo of Israel. Now 53 states
      have official policies of military embargo. The Norwegian pension fund, the largest
      sovereign state fund in the world, divested from Israeli bonds and several companies
      that contribute to apartheid. Large churches throughout the U.S. are divesting
      from Israel, and U.S. universities are divesting in response to student encampments
      and mobilizations. There are corporate, academic, sports, and cultural boycotts
      as well. “Sanctioning Francesca Albanese confirms the U.S.’s brazen contempt for
      international law and the UN, betraying the vision of why it was established under
      U.S. guidance in 1945, as a beacon of light after the carnage and genocide of
      World War II,” Falk told Truthout . “These sanctions on Albanese carry defiance
      of international law to another level, by inverting justice and punishing those
      who dare document what the U.S. government insists on covering up. We should have
      learned by now that hiding genocide from legal and moral scrutiny compounds the
      tragedy and brings added shame to its governmental and corporate accomplices.”
      The Trump administration’s sanctioning of Albanese “is a blatant affront to the
      Palestinian people’s demand for justice, truth, and accountability; an act of
      support for and incitement to genocide; and an intervention designed to dismantle
      one of the core independent oversight mechanisms of the multilateral international
      system,” several organizations and individuals, including this writer, wrote in
      a public statement initiated by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers.
      “To stand with Francesca Albanese is to stand with the Palestinian people in their
      quest for justice in the face of occupation, genocide, and war crimes — and to
      defend the universal values of international law.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment

    one_sentence_summary: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio imposed sanctions on UN
      Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese for her critiques of Israel's actions, following
      a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. amidst rising
      tensions over accountability for alleged war crimes.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent development, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
      imposed sanctions on Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on Occupied
      Palestine, following her outspoken criticism of Israel's actions, which she describes
      as genocide. Rubio accused her of engaging with the International Criminal Court
      (ICC) to investigate U.S. and Israeli nationals and labeled her comments as antisemitic
      and supportive of terrorism. Albanese responded to the sanctions by questioning
      the rationale behind them, emphasizing her commitment to exposing genocide and
      holding accountable those who profit from it. The article highlights the irony
      of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominating Donald Trump for a Nobel
      Peace Prize while suggesting that Albanese, for her advocacy, is more deserving
      of such recognition.

      President Trump on Monday met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White
      House and announced a plan to provide Ukraine with “billions of dollars” worth
      of US military equipment by selling US weapons to NATO countries that will be
      then transferred to the war-torn nation. The president also said that if a peace
      deal isn’t reached within 50 days, he will impose tariffs on Russia. A source
      told Axios that the US is expected to sell $10 billion worth of military equipment
      to NATO countries in the first wave. Explaining the weapons plan to reporters,
      Rutte said the idea was to ensure that the US, which he described as the “police
      agent” of the world, is able to maintain its military stockpiles while also providing
      a “massive” amount of weapons to Ukraine. “The US needs to make sure it can keep
      its hands on what the US needs to keep the whole world safe, because, in the end,
      you are the police agent of the whole world … but given that, the US has decided
      to indeed to massively supply Ukraine with what is necessary through NATO. Europeans
      [will be] 100% paying for that,” Rutte said. Trump and Rutte said that they’d
      gotten commitments from European countries to purchase US weapons for Ukraine.
      “I will say that I spoke with Germany, spoke with most of the larger countries,
      and they are really enthusiastic about this, and they’re willing to go really
      far,” Trump said. Trump and Rutte didn’t elaborate on the type of arms that would
      be sent, except to mention that more US-made Patriot air defense systems would
      be supplied to Ukraine. Sources told Axios that the weapons will also include
      long-range weapons that can strike deep inside Russia. Regarding tariffs, Trump
      threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Russia and “secondary tariffs” that would
      target Moscow’s trading partners, which include China and India. “We’re going
      to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” he said.
      While announcing measures to continue the proxy war, Trump is still trying to
      distance himself from the conflict, calling it a “Biden war” and a “Democrat war.”
      The president insisted that he still wants to bring the conflict to an end and
      that he hopes the new military aid and tariff threat will do that. “This is not
      Trump’s war. We’re here to get it finished and stopped,” he said. Trump also expressed
      frustration with Putin, saying that he has nice conversations with the leader,
      but that missiles keep targeting Ukrainian cities. “My conversations with him
      are very pleasant, and then the missiles go off at night,” he said. Russia has
      made clear that it won’t back down on its core demands for a peace deal: Ukrainian
      neutrality and the recognition of the four oblasts Moscow annexed in 2022 as Russian
      territory, which would require a Ukrainian withdrawal from the territory it still
      controls in those areas. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has refused to
      give up the territory and is unlikely to make concessions as long as the US and
      NATO continue to support his war effort. In the meantime, Russia continues to
      make gains on the battlefield and launch heavy missile and drone attacks across
      Ukraine. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to
      pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Ben
      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report Western corporate media coverage of the Global
      South-led organization BRICS is frequently dismissive and condescending. Bloomberg
      published an article claiming that BRICS is “little more than a meaningless acronym”.
      It appears that a lot of this criticism, nevertheless, is actually a coping mechanism,
      because evidence is piling up showing that the US government is very afraid of
      the rapid growth of BRICS . Donald Trump, in particular, is terrified of the possibility
      of BRICS challenging the global dominance of the US dollar. BRICS held a successful
      summit in Brazil in July, featuring for the first time the participation of 10
      members and 10 partner countries. Trump responded with furious denunciation, threatening
      to hit all BRICS countries with 10% tariffs . Trump then delivered an angry rant
      against BRICS at the White House, in a meeting with his cabinet on 8 July. What
      the US president said was deeply contradictory. It was like Schrödinger’s BRICS:
      the organization is not a threat, but also the biggest threat in the world, according
      to Trump. Trump simultaneously claimed that BRICS is “not a serious threat”, but
      also that it is trying to “destroy the dollar”, and that, if the United States
      lost the exorbitant privilege it receives as the issuer of the global reserve
      currency, it “would be like losing a war, a major world war; we would not be the
      same country any longer”. “The dollar is king, and we’re going to keep it that
      way!” Trump declared. These were Trump’s indignant remarks (emphasis added): They
      have to pay 10% if they’re in BRICS . Because BRICS was set up to hurt us. BRICS
      was set up to degenerate our dollar, and take our dollar as the standard, take
      it off as the standard. And that’s okay if they want to play that game, but I
      can play that game, too. So anybody that’s in BRICs is getting a 10% charge. …
      If they’re a member of BRICS, they’re going to have to pay a 10% tariff, just
      for that one thing. And they won’t be a member long. I thought BRICS was — you
      know, I said this about a year ago, and it largely broke up. But, you know, there
      are a couple of them hanging around, but I thought it largely broke up. BRICS
      is not, in my opinion, not a serious threat. But what they’re trying to do is
      destroy the dollar , so that another country can take over and be the standard.
      And we’re not going to lose the standard, at any time. If you have a smart president,
      you will never lose the standard. If you have a stupid president, like the last
      one, you would lose the standard. You wouldn’t have the dollar as [the standard].
      And if we lost the world standard dollar, that would be like losing a war, a major
      world war; we would not be the same country any longer. We’re not going to let
      that happen. The dollar — you never hear the expression “the dollar is king”?
      The dollar is king, and we’re going to keep it that way , ok? Trump is extremely
      “pissed” at BRICS and dedollarization Politico published an article, citing sources
      very close to the US president, that revealed that Trump is enraged about the
      expansion of BRICS and its push for global dedollarization. “You can tell the
      president is pissed every time he looks at the BRICS de-dollarization effort”,
      former top Trump aide Steve Bannon told Politico. The success of the BRICS summit
      in “Rio didn’t help”, Bannon added. Bannon served as CEO of Trump’s presidential
      campaign in 2016, and was the White House chief strategist in 2017. Bannon, who
      previously worked at major Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, is a far-right
      demagogue who proudly stated in 2018, “We’re at war with China” . Similar comments
      were made by a former State Department official, Leland Lazarus, who served as
      a special assistant to the commander of Southern Command, which oversees the US
      military’s operations in Latin America. Lazarus told Politico that Trump is using
      tariffs threats on BRICS countries “to try to peel off new members like Egypt,
      Ethiopia, and Indonesia”. Lazarus emphasized that Brazil’s closer relations with
      China, and their mutual moves to dedollarize and trade in their local currencies,
      “may be triggering alarms within Trump’s circle, especially among advisers who
      view global dollar supremacy as a pillar of U.S. power”. Another Trump ally, Mauricio
      Claver-Carone, who served as the Republican president’s special envoy to Latin
      America during his first term, told Politico that Trump had already been livid
      at Brazil’s left-wing President Lula da Silva, but “BRICS tipped the scale”. Trump
      attacks Brazil, a key player in the new multipolar world order The prominent role
      of Brazil in BRICS, as a major player in the new multipolar global order, has
      made it a target of US aggression. Following the Rio de Janeiro summit in July,
      Trump threatened to impose massive tariffs of 50% on Brazil . The US president
      is trying to make an example out of the Latin American nation, to punish Lula
      for challenging US global hegemony, moving closer to China, challenging the dollar,
      and promoting BRICS as a multipolar vanguard. Lula was one of the co-founders
      of BRICS in 2009 (back when it was BRIC). The Brazilian leftist leader has long
      advocated for the Global South-led organization to play a more important role
      in international affairs. The Brazilian president has strongly supported dedollarization
      , and has repeatedly called for the creation of a new global reserve currency,
      to replace the US dollar. Trump (and Elon Musk) blatantly meddles in Brazil’s
      internal affairs Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of economic warfare to meddle
      in Brazil’s internal political affairs. The US president’s goal is also to help
      Brazil’s far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is a loyal Trump ally.
      Trump hopes his tariffs will hurt the Brazilian economy and damage Lula’s image,
      to tip the scale in support of the Bolsonarista right as the 2026 election approaches.
      To justify this blatant US meddling in Brazil’s internal affairs, Trump absurdly
      claimed that there is a legal “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro. In reality, Bolsonaro
      is facing legal consequences because, after he lost the 2022 election, he tried
      to carry out a military coup in early 2023, to prevent the democratically elected
      Lula from assuming the presidency. Bolsonaro admitted in court that he met with
      Brazilian military leaders and discussed ways to hold on to power, even after
      the majority of the people of his country voted against him. Far-right political
      figures in the West have thrown their weight behind Bolsonaro. Another Bolsonaro
      ally is the world’s richest centibillionaire oligarch, Elon Musk. Musk despises
      Lula, not only because the Brazilian president is left wing and wants to significantly
      increase taxes on the ultra-rich and crack down on tax avoidance, but also because
      Lula has challenged Musk’s business interests in the massive South American nation.
      Musk has used the social media platform Twitter, which is his personal property,
      to promote anti-Lula and pro-Bolsonaro propaganda. Both Trump and Musk falsely
      allege that Lula and the Brazilian government are violating free speech, to justify
      their political meddling in the Latin American country’s internal affairs, and
      to support the far-right failed coup leader. This issue, however, has nothing
      to do with “free speech”. It is about the Brazilian government’s right to defend
      its sovereignty and resist flagrant interventionism by the US empire. US empire
      violates sovereignty of Brazil (and Latin America as a whole) There is a very
      long history of the US government supporting far-right coups d’etat against democratically
      elected left-wing leaders in Latin America — including Guatemala in 1954, Chile
      in 1973, Argentina in 1976, Haiti in 1991 and 2004, Honduras in 2009, Venezuela
      in 2002, 2014, 2017, and 2019, and many, many more. Following a US-backed far-right
      coup against Bolivia’s democratically elected socialist President Evo Morales
      in 2019, Musk declared on Twitter, “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it”.
      The US government has also been involved in numerous putsches in Brazil, going
      back to an infamous military coup in 1964. In 2016 and 2018, the US government
      backed two soft coups , or judicial coups, against Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff
      and Lula, both from the left-wing Workers’ Party. Dilma was impeached on false
      accusations of “corruption” in a 2016 regime-change operation. As Brazil’s leader,
      Dilma had strongly advocated for BRICS, Global South empowerment, good relations
      with China, and multipolarity — which made her the target of Washington’s wrath.
      Today, Dilma is president of the BRICS bank, the New Development Bank, where she
      has likewise advocated for dedollarization. In the lead-up to Brazil’s presidential
      election in 2018, Lula was leading in the polls , but he was imprisoned on fake
      accusations of “corruption”, by US-backed right-wing judges, who essentially installed
      Bolsonaro as president. In 2021, the Brazilian supreme court annulled the fake,
      politically motivated charges of “corruption” against Lula. The United Nations
      Human Rights Committee conducted an investigation into the situation in Brazil,
      led by experts on international law, and concluded in 2022 that the show trial
      against Lula had been illegitimate and violated his civil rights and due process.
      The US government was deeply involved in both of these right-wing political coups
      in Brazil, in 2016 and 2018. They constitute a textbook case of “lawfare”, or
      judicial warfare. This is why Lula himself said, “Everything that is happening
      has the hand of the United States on it”. He underscored that “the US created
      the Lava Jato investigation”, in reference to the supposed “anti-corruption” scheme,
      known as Operation Car Wash, that was cynically used as cover to carry out the
      coups. This is also why, in 2025, Lula is pushing back against Donald Trump’s
      heavy-handed meddling in Brazil’s internal affairs. In response to Trump’s tariff
      threats and false accusations that the Brazilian government is carrying out a
      “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro, Lula stated : Brazil is a sovereign nation with
      independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage. The judicial
      proceedings against those responsible for planning the coup d’état fall exclusively
      under the jurisdiction of Brazil´s Judicial Branch and, as such, are not subject
      to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national
      institutions. Lula likewise pledged to hit back against Trump’s unilateral announcement
      of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods with Brazil’s own retaliatory tariffs of 50%
      on US goods. “We’re going to have to look for other partners to buy our products.
      Brazil’s trade with the US represents 1.7% of its GDP”, Lula explained. “ It’s
      not like we can’t survive without the US ”. The Brazilian president noted that
      the successful BRICS summit “likely worried Trump”, according to a report in Bloomberg. Lula
      then doubled down on his calls for dedollarization. “We are interested in creating
      a trade currency among other countries”, the Brazilian leader stressed. “I’m not
      obligated to buy dollars to conduct trade with Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Sweden,
      the European Union, or China. We can trade in our own currencies”. Editor’s Note

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how Western corporate media often belittles
      the BRICS organization, reflecting a deeper fear within the US government, particularly
      from Donald Trump, about BRICS' potential to challenge US dollar dominance, especially
      following a significant summit in Brazil.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the dismissive attitude of Western corporate
      media towards BRICS, a coalition of countries from the Global South, highlighting
      a recent Bloomberg article that trivializes the organization. Despite this criticism,
      the article argues that the U.S. government, particularly Donald Trump, is increasingly
      alarmed by BRICS' growth and its potential to challenge the dominance of the U.S.
      dollar. Following a successful BRICS summit in Brazil, Trump expressed contradictory
      views, labeling BRICS as both a negligible threat and a significant danger to
      U.S. economic supremacy. He threatened tariffs on BRICS nations and emphasized
      the importance of maintaining the dollar's status as the global reserve currency,
      suggesting that losing this status would equate to a major defeat for the United
      States.

      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report Western corporate media coverage of the Global
      South-led organization BRICS is frequently dismissive and condescending. Bloomberg
      published an article claiming that BRICS is “little more than a meaningless acronym”.
      It appears that a lot of this criticism, nevertheless, is actually a coping mechanism,
      because evidence is piling up showing that the US government is very afraid of
      the rapid growth of BRICS . Donald Trump, in particular, is terrified of the possibility
      of BRICS challenging the global dominance of the US dollar. BRICS held a successful
      summit in Brazil in July, featuring for the first time the participation of 10
      members and 10 partner countries. Trump responded with furious denunciation, threatening
      to hit all BRICS countries with 10% tariffs . Trump then delivered an angry rant
      against BRICS at the White House, in a meeting with his cabinet on 8 July. What
      the US president said was deeply contradictory. It was like Schrödinger’s BRICS:
      the organization is not a threat, but also the biggest threat in the world, according
      to Trump. Trump simultaneously claimed that BRICS is “not a serious threat”, but
      also that it is trying to “destroy the dollar”, and that, if the United States
      lost the exorbitant privilege it receives as the issuer of the global reserve
      currency, it “would be like losing a war, a major world war; we would not be the
      same country any longer”. “The dollar is king, and we’re going to keep it that
      way!” Trump declared. These were Trump’s indignant remarks (emphasis added): They
      have to pay 10% if they’re in BRICS . Because BRICS was set up to hurt us. BRICS
      was set up to degenerate our dollar, and take our dollar as the standard, take
      it off as the standard. And that’s okay if they want to play that game, but I
      can play that game, too. So anybody that’s in BRICs is getting a 10% charge. …
      If they’re a member of BRICS, they’re going to have to pay a 10% tariff, just
      for that one thing. And they won’t be a member long. I thought BRICS was — you
      know, I said this about a year ago, and it largely broke up. But, you know, there
      are a couple of them hanging around, but I thought it largely broke up. BRICS
      is not, in my opinion, not a serious threat. But what they’re trying to do is
      destroy the dollar , so that another country can take over and be the standard.
      And we’re not going to lose the standard, at any time. If you have a smart president,
      you will never lose the standard. If you have a stupid president, like the last
      one, you would lose the standard. You wouldn’t have the dollar as [the standard].
      And if we lost the world standard dollar, that would be like losing a war, a major
      world war; we would not be the same country any longer. We’re not going to let
      that happen. The dollar — you never hear the expression “the dollar is king”?
      The dollar is king, and we’re going to keep it that way , ok? Trump is extremely
      “pissed” at BRICS and dedollarization Politico published an article, citing sources
      very close to the US president, that revealed that Trump is enraged about the
      expansion of BRICS and its push for global dedollarization. “You can tell the
      president is pissed every time he looks at the BRICS de-dollarization effort”,
      former top Trump aide Steve Bannon told Politico. The success of the BRICS summit
      in “Rio didn’t help”, Bannon added. Bannon served as CEO of Trump’s presidential
      campaign in 2016, and was the White House chief strategist in 2017. Bannon, who
      previously worked at major Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, is a far-right
      demagogue who proudly stated in 2018, “We’re at war with China” . Similar comments
      were made by a former State Department official, Leland Lazarus, who served as
      a special assistant to the commander of Southern Command, which oversees the US
      military’s operations in Latin America. Lazarus told Politico that Trump is using
      tariffs threats on BRICS countries “to try to peel off new members like Egypt,
      Ethiopia, and Indonesia”. Lazarus emphasized that Brazil’s closer relations with
      China, and their mutual moves to dedollarize and trade in their local currencies,
      “may be triggering alarms within Trump’s circle, especially among advisers who
      view global dollar supremacy as a pillar of U.S. power”. Another Trump ally, Mauricio
      Claver-Carone, who served as the Republican president’s special envoy to Latin
      America during his first term, told Politico that Trump had already been livid
      at Brazil’s left-wing President Lula da Silva, but “BRICS tipped the scale”. Trump
      attacks Brazil, a key player in the new multipolar world order The prominent role
      of Brazil in BRICS, as a major player in the new multipolar global order, has
      made it a target of US aggression. Following the Rio de Janeiro summit in July,
      Trump threatened to impose massive tariffs of 50% on Brazil . The US president
      is trying to make an example out of the Latin American nation, to punish Lula
      for challenging US global hegemony, moving closer to China, challenging the dollar,
      and promoting BRICS as a multipolar vanguard. Lula was one of the co-founders
      of BRICS in 2009 (back when it was BRIC). The Brazilian leftist leader has long
      advocated for the Global South-led organization to play a more important role
      in international affairs. The Brazilian president has strongly supported dedollarization
      , and has repeatedly called for the creation of a new global reserve currency,
      to replace the US dollar. Trump (and Elon Musk) blatantly meddles in Brazil’s
      internal affairs Trump is using tariffs as a weapon of economic warfare to meddle
      in Brazil’s internal political affairs. The US president’s goal is also to help
      Brazil’s far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is a loyal Trump ally.
      Trump hopes his tariffs will hurt the Brazilian economy and damage Lula’s image,
      to tip the scale in support of the Bolsonarista right as the 2026 election approaches.
      To justify this blatant US meddling in Brazil’s internal affairs, Trump absurdly
      claimed that there is a legal “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro. In reality, Bolsonaro
      is facing legal consequences because, after he lost the 2022 election, he tried
      to carry out a military coup in early 2023, to prevent the democratically elected
      Lula from assuming the presidency. Bolsonaro admitted in court that he met with
      Brazilian military leaders and discussed ways to hold on to power, even after
      the majority of the people of his country voted against him. Far-right political
      figures in the West have thrown their weight behind Bolsonaro. Another Bolsonaro
      ally is the world’s richest centibillionaire oligarch, Elon Musk. Musk despises
      Lula, not only because the Brazilian president is left wing and wants to significantly
      increase taxes on the ultra-rich and crack down on tax avoidance, but also because
      Lula has challenged Musk’s business interests in the massive South American nation.
      Musk has used the social media platform Twitter, which is his personal property,
      to promote anti-Lula and pro-Bolsonaro propaganda. Both Trump and Musk falsely
      allege that Lula and the Brazilian government are violating free speech, to justify
      their political meddling in the Latin American country’s internal affairs, and
      to support the far-right failed coup leader. This issue, however, has nothing
      to do with “free speech”. It is about the Brazilian government’s right to defend
      its sovereignty and resist flagrant interventionism by the US empire. US empire
      violates sovereignty of Brazil (and Latin America as a whole) There is a very
      long history of the US government supporting far-right coups d’etat against democratically
      elected left-wing leaders in Latin America — including Guatemala in 1954, Chile
      in 1973, Argentina in 1976, Haiti in 1991 and 2004, Honduras in 2009, Venezuela
      in 2002, 2014, 2017, and 2019, and many, many more. Following a US-backed far-right
      coup against Bolivia’s democratically elected socialist President Evo Morales
      in 2019, Musk declared on Twitter, “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it”.
      The US government has also been involved in numerous putsches in Brazil, going
      back to an infamous military coup in 1964. In 2016 and 2018, the US government
      backed two soft coups , or judicial coups, against Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff
      and Lula, both from the left-wing Workers’ Party. Dilma was impeached on false
      accusations of “corruption” in a 2016 regime-change operation. As Brazil’s leader,
      Dilma had strongly advocated for BRICS, Global South empowerment, good relations
      with China, and multipolarity — which made her the target of Washington’s wrath.
      Today, Dilma is president of the BRICS bank, the New Development Bank, where she
      has likewise advocated for dedollarization. In the lead-up to Brazil’s presidential
      election in 2018, Lula was leading in the polls , but he was imprisoned on fake
      accusations of “corruption”, by US-backed right-wing judges, who essentially installed
      Bolsonaro as president. In 2021, the Brazilian supreme court annulled the fake,
      politically motivated charges of “corruption” against Lula. The United Nations
      Human Rights Committee conducted an investigation into the situation in Brazil,
      led by experts on international law, and concluded in 2022 that the show trial
      against Lula had been illegitimate and violated his civil rights and due process.
      The US government was deeply involved in both of these right-wing political coups
      in Brazil, in 2016 and 2018. They constitute a textbook case of “lawfare”, or
      judicial warfare. This is why Lula himself said, “Everything that is happening
      has the hand of the United States on it”. He underscored that “the US created
      the Lava Jato investigation”, in reference to the supposed “anti-corruption” scheme,
      known as Operation Car Wash, that was cynically used as cover to carry out the
      coups. This is also why, in 2025, Lula is pushing back against Donald Trump’s
      heavy-handed meddling in Brazil’s internal affairs. In response to Trump’s tariff
      threats and false accusations that the Brazilian government is carrying out a
      “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro, Lula stated : Brazil is a sovereign nation with
      independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage. The judicial
      proceedings against those responsible for planning the coup d’état fall exclusively
      under the jurisdiction of Brazil´s Judicial Branch and, as such, are not subject
      to any interference or threats that could compromise the independence of national
      institutions. Lula likewise pledged to hit back against Trump’s unilateral announcement
      of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods with Brazil’s own retaliatory tariffs of 50%
      on US goods. “We’re going to have to look for other partners to buy our products.
      Brazil’s trade with the US represents 1.7% of its GDP”, Lula explained. “ It’s
      not like we can’t survive without the US ”. The Brazilian president noted that
      the successful BRICS summit “likely worried Trump”, according to a report in Bloomberg. Lula
      then doubled down on his calls for dedollarization. “We are interested in creating
      a trade currency among other countries”, the Brazilian leader stressed. “I’m not
      obligated to buy dollars to conduct trade with Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Sweden,
      the European Union, or China. We can trade in our own currencies”. Editor’s Note

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how Western corporate media often belittles
      the BRICS organization, reflecting a deeper fear within the US government, particularly
      from Donald Trump, about BRICS' potential to challenge US dollar dominance, especially
      following a significant summit in Brazil.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the dismissive attitude of Western corporate
      media towards BRICS, a coalition of countries from the Global South, highlighting
      a recent Bloomberg article that trivializes the organization. Despite this criticism,
      the article argues that the U.S. government, particularly Donald Trump, is increasingly
      alarmed by BRICS' growth and its potential to challenge the dominance of the U.S.
      dollar. Following a successful BRICS summit in Brazil, Trump expressed contradictory
      views, labeling BRICS as both a negligible threat and a significant danger to
      U.S. economic supremacy. He threatened tariffs on BRICS nations and emphasized
      the importance of maintaining the dollar's status as the global reserve currency,
      suggesting that losing this status would equate to a major defeat for the United
      States.

      Democratic lawmakers were allowed to tour U.S. President Donald Trump’s sprawling
      Everglades immigrant detention center on Saturday. They said what they witnessed
      was “disturbing” and “disgusting.” After Democrats were previously denied entry
      to the facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” three Democratic congresspeople
      from Florida—Reps. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Jared Moskowitz, and Maxwell Frost—journeyed
      to the remote compound along with another group of Republicans as part of a state-arranged
      tour. “Alligator Alcatraz” was erected within a matter of weeks and now contains
      approximately 900 people who have been rounded up as part of Trump’s “mass deportation”
      crusade, which a court determined was rife with illegal racial profiling. The
      administration said they hope to fill the camp with as many as 5,000 people at
      a time. Detainees have previously described heinous conditions to their attorneys,
      including worm and maggot-infested food, sweltering heat, and the denial of medication
      and showers for days at a time. Though the Democrats who visited the facility
      were not allowed to speak with detainees or see their conditions up close, their
      descriptions of the facilities at a press conference following the visit paint
      an appalling picture. Wasserman-Schultz described it as an “internment camp” where
      detainees are “essentially packed into cages.” “Wall-to-wall humans. 32 detainees
      per cage,” she said. This, she noted, is unusual for immigration facilities, like
      the nearby Krome detention center in Miami-Dade County, where detainees are allowed
      to roam freely between buildings. “The only thing inside those cages are their
      bunk beds,” she said. She later noted that in the unused dorm they toured there
      were already “bugs all over the mattresses that had not yet been used.” “There
      are three tiny toilet units that have a sink attached to it,” she said. “They
      get their drinking water, and they brush their teeth where they poop, in the same
      unit,” she continued. Frost said the lawmakers asked to view the toilets currently
      in use by detainees, but were denied and instead showed ones in a currently unused
      part of the facility. He brought up prior complaints made by prisoners of the
      camp about the sanitation. “Some of the biggest complaints we’ve heard is, yes,
      there’s three toilets, but a lot of the time, only one is working,” he said. “They
      get backed up: Feces being spread everywhere.” Wasserman-Schultz said they also
      viewed a meal-prep area. While employees of the facility were given large, hearty
      portions, she says prisoners were fed a “small…gray turkey and cheese sandwich,
      an apple, and chips” that she said was far too small to sustain a fully-grown
      man. Wasserman-Schultz also said she brought a thermostat to measure the temperature
      within the facility, which the Department of Homeland Security has claimed was
      “air conditioned.” She said that the area just outside the tents that housed the
      detainees was 83°F and said it was likely much hotter inside due to the body heat.
      Moskowitz said there was “evidence of flooding” and “floors that are only about
      eight inches above the ground,” while other lawmakers noted that a hurricane or
      even a lighter tropical storm could prove catastrophic. Last week, videos circulated
      on social media of the facility already beginning to flood due to a minor storm:
      Alligator Alcatraz cost $450M and flooded in a day. It’s been raining nonstop
      in SoFlo this week, now imagine during a hurricane. Don’t call yourself a Christian
      while cheering on a cage built to dehumanize. Jesus fed the hungry; he didn’t
      drown them. pic.twitter.com/sgVwIJNYfm — Natasha ❀ (@ndelriego) July 4, 2025 Moskowitz
      also noted the extraordinary cost to assemble and run the makeshift facility,
      which is estimated to cost $450 million per year according to one U.S. official
      who spoke to The Associated Press. “Why are they spending all this money for this?”
      he asked. “One can’t help but understand and conclude that this is a total cruel
      political stunt meant to have a spectacle of political theater.” The Trump administration
      has described the facility as a holding tank for “the worst of the worst” criminals
      as they await deportation. But according to reporting by the Miami Herald and
      Tampa Bay Times on Sunday, only a third of the people in the facility have criminal
      convictions, which range from crimes like attempted murder to traffic violations.
      More than 250 of the people in the facility have not been convicted of or even
      charged with a crime. No outside journalists have been allowed to tour the facility,
      and there are no photos or videos available publicly beyond what has been released
      by the Trump government. The congresspeople on the tour were told they were not
      allowed to take any photos or videos inside or meet with any of the detainees.
      Instead of being shown the conditions in which detainees were currently being
      housed, they were shown facilities that had not yet been filled. They were still
      denied access to some, including medical facilities. Last week a group of Democrats
      in Florida’s state legislature were turned away when they attempted to tour the
      camp, with Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) saying they could not show up unannounced to
      perform oversight over a federal facility. Frost said that there has been “ambiguity”
      about who has authority over the prison, but it was made abundantly clear during
      the visit that every decision being made was directed by the federal government.
      “What we heard very clear is that ICE is giving them the directions from A to
      Z,” he said. “Which means members of Congress are able to come here unannounced.
      And we will come here unannounced.” “Even with this invitation, so much was kept
      from us,” Frost said. In a video filmed while riding back from the camp, Frost
      spoke even more candidly about what he saw and how much it disturbed him. Rep.
      Maxwell Frost describes the inhumane situation at Alligator Alcatraz following
      his visit: "What I saw made my heart sink. I saw 32 people per cage– about 6 cages
      in one tent. People were yelling ''help me help me''. Someone said I''m a US citizen…
      The drinking water comes… pic.twitter.com/gnnGJCBcka — Ron Smith (@Ronxyz00) July
      12, 2025 Though the congresspeople were not given access to the detainees and
      “pushed back” by security guards, Frost said, “We could see in, and we could hear
      everybody.” “When those doors opened, what I saw made my heart sink,” he said.
      “I saw a lot of people, young men, who looked like me.” “People were yelling,
      ‘Help me, help me!’ I heard in the back someone say, ‘I’m a U.S. citizen,''” he
      continued. “And as we were walking away, they started chanting ‘Libertad! Libertad!
      Libertad!’… ‘Freedom.''” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      viewed a meal-prep area. While employees of the facility were given large, hearty
      portions, she says prisoners were fed a “small…gray turkey and cheese sandwich,
      an apple, and chips” that she said was far too small to sustain a fully-grown
      man. Wasserman-Schultz also said she brought a thermostat to measure the temperature
      within the facility, which the Department of Homeland Security has claimed was
      “air conditioned.” She said that the area just outside the tents that housed the
      detainees was 83°F and said it was likely much hotter inside due to the body heat.
      Moskowitz said there was “evidence of flooding” and “floors that are only about
      eight inches above the ground,” while other lawmakers noted that a hurricane or
      even a lighter tropical storm could prove catastrophic. Last week, videos circulated
      on social media of the facility already beginning to flood due to a minor storm:
      Alligator Alcatraz cost $450M and flooded in a day. It’s been raining nonstop
      in SoFlo this week, now imagine during a hurricane. Don’t call yourself a Christian

      drown them. pic.twitter.com/sgVwIJNYfm — Natasha ❀ (@ndelriego) July 4, 2025 Moskowitz
      also noted the extraordinary cost to assemble and run the makeshift facility,
      which is estimated to cost $450 million per year according to one U.S. official
      who spoke to The Associated Press. “Why are they spending all this money for this?”
      he asked. “One can’t help but understand and conclude that this is a total cruel
      political stunt meant to have a spectacle of political theater.” The Trump administration
      has described the facility as a holding tank for “the worst of the worst” criminals
      as they await deportation. But according to reporting by the Miami Herald and
      Tampa Bay Times on Sunday, only a third of the people in the facility have criminal
      convictions, which range from crimes like attempted murder to traffic violations.
      More than 250 of the people in the facility have not been convicted of or even
      charged with a crime. No outside journalists have been allowed to tour the facility,
      and there are no photos or videos available publicly beyond what has been released
      by the Trump government. The congresspeople on the tour were told they were not
      allowed to take any photos or videos inside or meet with any of the detainees.
      Instead of being shown the conditions in which detainees were currently being
      housed, they were shown facilities that had not yet been filled. They were still
      denied access to some, including medical facilities. Last week a group of Democrats
      in Florida’s state legislature were turned away when they attempted to tour the
      camp, with Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) saying they could not show up unannounced to
      perform oversight over a federal facility. Frost said that there has been “ambiguity”
      about who has authority over the prison, but it was made abundantly clear during
      the visit that every decision being made was directed by the federal government.
      “What we heard very clear is that ICE is giving them the directions from A to
      Z,” he said. “Which means members of Congress are able to come here unannounced.
      And we will come here unannounced.” “Even with this invitation, so much was kept
      from us,” Frost said. In a video filmed while riding back from the camp, Frost
      spoke even more candidly about what he saw and how much it disturbed him. Rep.
      Maxwell Frost describes the inhumane situation at Alligator Alcatraz following
      his visit: "What I saw made my heart sink. I saw 32 people per cage– about 6 cages
      in one tent. People were yelling ''help me help me''. Someone said I''m a US citizen…
      The drinking water comes… pic.twitter.com/gnnGJCBcka — Ron Smith (@Ronxyz00) July
      12, 2025 Though the congresspeople were not given access to the detainees and
      “pushed back” by security guards, Frost said, “We could see in, and we could hear
      everybody.” “When those doors opened, what I saw made my heart sink,” he said.
      “I saw a lot of people, young men, who looked like me.” “People were yelling,
      ‘Help me, help me!’ I heard in the back someone say, ‘I’m a U.S. citizen,''” he
      continued. “And as we were walking away, they started chanting ‘Libertad! Libertad!
      Libertad!’… ‘Freedom.''” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      Trump's Everglades immigrant detention center as "disturbing" and "disgusting,"
      following previous denials of access to the facility.
    paragraph_summary: On July 1, 2025, Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Debbie
      Wasserman-Schultz, Jared Moskowitz, and Maxwell Frost, were finally permitted
      to tour President Donald Trump's controversial immigrant detention center, known
      as "Alligator Alcatraz," located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport
      in Ochopee, Florida. The facility, which was rapidly constructed to accommodate
      up to 5,000 detainees as part of Trump's mass deportation efforts, currently houses
      around 900 individuals. The lawmakers described the conditions as "disturbing"
      and "disgusting," citing reports from detainees of inhumane treatment, including
      infested food, extreme heat, and lack of basic necessities like medication and
      showers. Although the visitors were restricted from directly interacting with
      detainees, their press conference following the tour highlighted the appalling
      realities within the facility.

      donation . By C.J. Polychroniou / Truthout Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful
      Bill,” which was signed into law last week, has been described as a monstrous
      piece of legislation. In this exclusive interview for Truthout , world-renowned
      progressive economist Robert Pollin provides an overview of this “disgraceful”
      federal budget bill. Pollin is distinguished professor of economics and co-director
      of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts
      Amherst. The interview that follows has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
      CJ Polychroniou: Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill” has now become law, achieving
      what ultra-conservatives have been fighting for decades, which are huge tax breaks
      and major cuts to social safety net programs. Of course, there is a lot more reactionary
      stuff included in this megabill, such as hundreds of billions of dollars devoted
      to Trump’s anti-immigration agenda and derailing the green transition by taking
      an axe to clean energy and boosting, in turn, fossil fuel production. In sum,
      I think Ed Kilgore’s claim that this 940-page bill “ is, in fact, the single most
      sweeping piece of legislation in American history ” is quite accurate, although
      some of its effects won’t be felt for some time. Can you discuss specifically
      the economic and social repercussions of Trump’s megabill, especially in light
      of the view that the U.S. is the most unequal high-income country in the world?
      Robert Pollin: Trump’s federal budget bill is disgraceful along multiple dimensions.
      We can start with its egregious distributional impacts. The bill will make the
      rich still richer through tax cuts while attacking the living standards, including
      the health and food security, of working people and the poor. Trump and company
      claim that people at all income levels will benefit from the bill’s tax cuts.
      There is a tiny sliver of truth in this. According to the Institute on Taxation
      and Economic Policy (ITEP), the Trump tax provisions will deliver an average of
      $40 in savings to the lowest 20 percent of income earners in 2026. Meanwhile,
      the richest 1 percent will end up $66,000 richer. This recalls the famous observation
      by Anatole France in 1894 that, “The law, in its majestic equality, forbids rich
      and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their
      bread.” But even these figures do not conclude the story. ITEP also notes that,
      once we also account for the impact of Trump’s tariffs — with these tariffs being
      a tax on imported products — those in the lowest 20 percent income bracket will
      not keep their $40 in benefits, but rather end up worse off by about $300. Meanwhile,
      the richest 1 percent are still better off by about $58,000. Much more punishing
      still for lower-income people are the spending cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance
      program that now covers 85 million low-income and disabled people, along with
      other health funding cuts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that,
      through the Trump measure, at least 17 million people will lose their coverage
      by 2034. In addition, cuts to the federal food security program (SNAP), on which
      42 million people now depend, could eliminate this support for up to 5 million
      people. Moreover, this purposeful Trump project to shower money on the rich while
      depriving lower-income people of health care and food arrives after nearly 50
      years of neoliberal policy dominance had already skewed income and wealth inequality
      to extreme levels. For example, the average wage for non-supervisory workers as
      of 2023 was roughly equal, at about $28 an hour, to where it was in 1972 (controlling
      for inflation), even though average worker productivity had increased two-and-a-half-fold
      over this period. Meanwhile, the average CEO’s pay was 30 times higher than the
      average worker in 1972, but exploded to 290 times higher by 2023. In other words,
      the average worker’s annual income remained roughly constant at around $50,000
      per year over this 50-year span, while the average CEO’s pay skyrocketed from
      $1.5 million to nearly $15 million. Under Joe Biden’s four years in office, some
      modest progress was made toward countering this rising inequality trend, including
      through Biden’s support for union organizing drives and through enforcing existing
      (but long-neglected) anti-monopoly laws. Trump and company are now committed to
      wiping out these small gains. This is while Trump stridently proclaims his commitment
      to working people and while, to date, large segments of the working class have
      been willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Of course, one centerpiece
      of Trump’s appeal to the U.S. working class has been his brutal attacks on immigrants,
      including those with legal status as well as undocumented people. To support this
      program, the bill allocates an average of more than $20 billion per year through
      2029 to build new immigrant detention centers and expand Immigration and Customs
      Enforcement (ICE) operations. This funding more than doubles the current ICE budget.
      Trump and company claim that undocumented immigrants have flooded into the country,
      that most of them are criminals, that they are stealing jobs from U.S.-born workers,
      and that they are draining the public schools, hospitals and other programs of
      resources without paying taxes to support these public programs. None of these
      claims are remotely true. In fact, according to the best available evidence ,
      the population of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has not changed significantly
      since 2005, varying between about 11–12 million people overall. Moreover, all
      immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes
      than the U.S.-born, including both violent and nonviolent crimes. In terms of
      taxes and financing public programs, as of the most recent 2022 data, undocumented
      immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, amounting
      to an average of nearly $9,000 per undocumented immigrant . Furthermore, more
      than one-third of all taxes contributed by undocumented immigrants are funding
      programs that they are unable to access. That is, they are paying into Social
      Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, but are receiving no benefits
      in return. This is also while, in 2023, the official unemployment rate for U.S.-born
      workers was 3.6 percent , the lowest figure on record. What about the environmental
      repercussions? How does Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” impact U.S. climate policy,
      and what does it mean for global climate change? Trump’s bill is one more weapon
      amid his relentless wave of attacks against any and all efforts to avert the mounting
      climate catastrophes. Even prior to the bill’s passage, the Trump administration
      had already introduced, according to Columbia University’s Climate Backtracker,
      more than 200 measures to “scale back or wholly eliminate climate mitigation and
      adaptation measures.” Trump has also fired hundreds of government scientists and
      installed climate change deniers into critical government positions. The Trump
      bill itself repeals or phases out the tax credits for solar and wind energy investments,
      electric vehicle purchases, and making home energy-efficiency improvements that
      were important features of the Biden Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The impact
      of the overall Trump program on the climate will be severe, as intended. U.S.
      carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions — the main cause of global heating — have fallen
      by roughly 20 percent over the past 20 years. Biden’s policies did contribute
      to this downward trend, even while the rate of emissions reductions remained insufficient
      relative to the global climate stabilization goal of net zero emissions by 2050.
      Trump’s policies will stop even these modest gains over the short term. If Trump’s
      program is allowed to remain in place, the likelihood for achieving zero emissions
      by 2050 becomes nil. How can we fight back effectively? For starters, we need
      to proclaim loudly the reality that clean energy investments are delivering money
      and jobs in all regions of the U.S., including in red states. Thus, w ind power
      is thriving in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Moreover, at the end of Biden’s
      presidency, West Virginia had received about $5 billion and Pennsylvania about
      $9 billion in new clean energy investment commitments tied to Biden’s IRA. It
      is hard to believe that working people in these and other states will be okay
      with these projects folding, and the jobs generated by them foregone, all thanks
      to Trump. Still more: Investments in clean renewable energy and high efficiency
      are now, by far, the cheapest ways to deliver energy to consumers. Even Trump’s
      own Energy Department’s most current report on comparative electricity costs confirms
      this. It estimates that electricity generated by onshore wind and solar projects
      that begin operating in 2030 will cost between 3–3.2 cents per kilowatt hour.
      The natural gas price will be more than twice as high, at 6.5 cents. We have opportunities
      right now for major climate policy victories at the state and local levels, even
      in the face of Trump. One important example was the passage of the Climate Change
      Superfund law in New York State last December, right before Trump took office.
      Under this measure, oil and gas companies will pay an average of $3 billion a
      year for the next 25 years for climate adaptation and resilience measures throughout
      the state. This victory in New York followed from the successful campaign to enact
      a similar measure in Vermont earlier in 2024. Comparable bills are now advancing
      in Massachusetts, California, and Maryland. This federal budget bill is projected
      to add trillions of dollars to the nation’s debt load and widen deficits. Is the
      U.S. in the “fast lane” to what Elon Musk calls “ debt slavery ?” Elon Musk and
      his late, unlamented leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency
      (DOGE), demonstrated both unbridled malice and a buffoonish level of ignorance
      regarding the operations of the federal government. Moving on to at least minimally
      serious analysts, the CBO estimates that the tax cuts in Trump’s bill will generate
      an average of $450 billion per year in government revenue loss over the next 10
      years . Increased spending on attacking and deporting immigrants as well as increased
      military spending will cost the government another roughly $30 billion per year.
      This brings the total average costs of Trump’s bill to nearly $500 billion per
      year. Meanwhile, according to the CBO, the spending cuts for health care, food
      security, and clean energy will together amount to an average total of about $170
      billion per year. Overall then, the CBO estimates that Trump’s bill will expand
      the federal deficit by about $330 billion per year over the next decade (i.e.,
      $500 billion in tax cuts and spending increases minus $170 billion in spending
      cuts). This will be on top of the government’s 2024 budget deficit of nearly $1.9
      trillion. The 2024 federal deficit was equal to about 6.3 percent of last year’s
      U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). This 6.3 percent of GDP budget deficit is larger
      than at any other non-recession period since World War II. The government did
      run much larger deficits to counteract the 2008-09 Great Recession and the 2020-2021
      COVID lockdown. But we are not now experiencing any kind of comparable economic
      crisis. As of 2024, the government’s accumulated debt was also at a peacetime
      high of 97 percent of GDP. This is nearly three times higher than the 2007 pre-Great
      Recession figure, which was 35 percent of GDP. The most critical point is that
      the current deficits are not serving to prevent an economic collapse. They are
      rather simply helping rich people get richer, while attacking the living standards
      of working people and the poor, as well as continuing to lavish exorbitant funds
      on the military. Is the government about to go broke as a result? The most important
      indicator here is how much we have to pay to cover these debts — i.e., the interest
      that the government pays on the U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2024, the government paid
      nearly $900 billion in interest to its creditors, equal to 3.8 percent of GDP.
      That is below the 4.9 percent of GDP that the government paid during the Ronald
      Reagan/George H.W. Bush presidential era. We did not hear Reagan, Bush, or any
      other Republican politician of that era scream then that the sky was falling.
      Nor did the sky fall. Still, the government’s $900 billion in 2024 interest payments
      totaled more than it spent on education, scientific research, public infrastructure,
      environmental protection, and global humanitarian aid combined. Moreover, government
      interest payments were at $350 billion as of 2021, 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the
      2024 interest payments were nearly three times larger than only three years prior.
      This huge spike in interest payments was caused both by the ballooning of government
      debt obligations, but even more so, by the sharp rise in interest rates that the
      government now has to pay its creditors. The average interest rate on five-year
      U.S. government bonds rose from 0.9 percent in 2021 to 4.1 percent in 2024. Interest
      rates on government debt are likely to stay high now under Trump, as the budget
      deficit expands and the value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to other major
      currencies ( the dollar’s value has fallen by more than 10 percent relative to
      other major currencies since Trump returned to office ). The government’s creditors
      are mainly rich individuals and foreign governments. The government does have
      the wherewithal to keep forking over these interest payments to its creditors.
      Yet, by running large fiscal deficits now, when we are not fighting a recession
      or a world war, the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money
      rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth
      in taxes. Correspondingly, the government’s interest payments that are now lining
      rich people’s pockets — and will flow into these pockets even more abundantly
      thanks to Trump’s bill — also represent hundreds of billions of dollars that could
      otherwise be devoted to public health, public education, food security, and building
      a green economy. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      by 2034. In addition, cuts to the federal food security program (SNAP), on which
      42 million people now depend, could eliminate this support for up to 5 million
      people. Moreover, this purposeful Trump project to shower money on the rich while
      depriving lower-income people of health care and food arrives after nearly 50
      years of neoliberal policy dominance had already skewed income and wealth inequality
      to extreme levels. For example, the average wage for non-supervisory workers as
      of 2023 was roughly equal, at about $28 an hour, to where it was in 1972 (controlling
      for inflation), even though average worker productivity had increased two-and-a-half-fold
      over this period. Meanwhile, the average CEO’s pay was 30 times higher than the
      average worker in 1972, but exploded to 290 times higher by 2023. In other words,
      the average worker’s annual income remained roughly constant at around $50,000
      per year over this 50-year span, while the average CEO’s pay skyrocketed from
      $1.5 million to nearly $15 million. Under Joe Biden’s four years in office, some
      modest progress was made toward countering this rising inequality trend, including
      through Biden’s support for union organizing drives and through enforcing existing
      (but long-neglected) anti-monopoly laws. Trump and company are now committed to
      wiping out these small gains. This is while Trump stridently proclaims his commitment
      to working people and while, to date, large segments of the working class have
      been willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Of course, one centerpiece
      of Trump’s appeal to the U.S. working class has been his brutal attacks on immigrants,
      including those with legal status as well as undocumented people. To support this
      program, the bill allocates an average of more than $20 billion per year through
      2029 to build new immigrant detention centers and expand Immigration and Customs
      Enforcement (ICE) operations. This funding more than doubles the current ICE budget.
      Trump and company claim that undocumented immigrants have flooded into the country,
      that most of them are criminals, that they are stealing jobs from U.S.-born workers,
      and that they are draining the public schools, hospitals and other programs of
      resources without paying taxes to support these public programs. None of these
      claims are remotely true. In fact, according to the best available evidence ,
      the population of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. has not changed significantly
      since 2005, varying between about 11–12 million people overall. Moreover, all
      immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes
      than the U.S.-born, including both violent and nonviolent crimes. In terms of
      taxes and financing public programs, as of the most recent 2022 data, undocumented
      immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, amounting
      to an average of nearly $9,000 per undocumented immigrant . Furthermore, more
      than one-third of all taxes contributed by undocumented immigrants are funding
      programs that they are unable to access. That is, they are paying into Social
      Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, but are receiving no benefits
      in return. This is also while, in 2023, the official unemployment rate for U.S.-born
      workers was 3.6 percent , the lowest figure on record. What about the environmental
      repercussions? How does Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” impact U.S. climate policy,
      and what does it mean for global climate change? Trump’s bill is one more weapon
      amid his relentless wave of attacks against any and all efforts to avert the mounting
      climate catastrophes. Even prior to the bill’s passage, the Trump administration
      had already introduced, according to Columbia University’s Climate Backtracker,
      more than 200 measures to “scale back or wholly eliminate climate mitigation and
      adaptation measures.” Trump has also fired hundreds of government scientists and
      installed climate change deniers into critical government positions. The Trump
      bill itself repeals or phases out the tax credits for solar and wind energy investments,
      electric vehicle purchases, and making home energy-efficiency improvements that
      were important features of the Biden Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The impact
      of the overall Trump program on the climate will be severe, as intended. U.S.
      carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions — the main cause of global heating — have fallen
      by roughly 20 percent over the past 20 years. Biden’s policies did contribute
      to this downward trend, even while the rate of emissions reductions remained insufficient
      relative to the global climate stabilization goal of net zero emissions by 2050.
      Trump’s policies will stop even these modest gains over the short term. If Trump’s
      program is allowed to remain in place, the likelihood for achieving zero emissions
      by 2050 becomes nil. How can we fight back effectively? For starters, we need
      to proclaim loudly the reality that clean energy investments are delivering money
      and jobs in all regions of the U.S., including in red states. Thus, w ind power
      is thriving in Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Moreover, at the end of Biden’s
      presidency, West Virginia had received about $5 billion and Pennsylvania about
      $9 billion in new clean energy investment commitments tied to Biden’s IRA. It
      is hard to believe that working people in these and other states will be okay
      with these projects folding, and the jobs generated by them foregone, all thanks
      to Trump. Still more: Investments in clean renewable energy and high efficiency
      are now, by far, the cheapest ways to deliver energy to consumers. Even Trump’s
      own Energy Department’s most current report on comparative electricity costs confirms
      this. It estimates that electricity generated by onshore wind and solar projects
      that begin operating in 2030 will cost between 3–3.2 cents per kilowatt hour.
      The natural gas price will be more than twice as high, at 6.5 cents. We have opportunities
      right now for major climate policy victories at the state and local levels, even
      in the face of Trump. One important example was the passage of the Climate Change
      Superfund law in New York State last December, right before Trump took office.
      Under this measure, oil and gas companies will pay an average of $3 billion a
      year for the next 25 years for climate adaptation and resilience measures throughout
      the state. This victory in New York followed from the successful campaign to enact
      a similar measure in Vermont earlier in 2024. Comparable bills are now advancing
      in Massachusetts, California, and Maryland. This federal budget bill is projected
      to add trillions of dollars to the nation’s debt load and widen deficits. Is the
      U.S. in the “fast lane” to what Elon Musk calls “ debt slavery ?” Elon Musk and
      his late, unlamented leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency
      (DOGE), demonstrated both unbridled malice and a buffoonish level of ignorance
      regarding the operations of the federal government. Moving on to at least minimally
      serious analysts, the CBO estimates that the tax cuts in Trump’s bill will generate
      an average of $450 billion per year in government revenue loss over the next 10
      years . Increased spending on attacking and deporting immigrants as well as increased
      military spending will cost the government another roughly $30 billion per year.
      This brings the total average costs of Trump’s bill to nearly $500 billion per
      year. Meanwhile, according to the CBO, the spending cuts for health care, food
      security, and clean energy will together amount to an average total of about $170
      billion per year. Overall then, the CBO estimates that Trump’s bill will expand
      the federal deficit by about $330 billion per year over the next decade (i.e.,
      $500 billion in tax cuts and spending increases minus $170 billion in spending
      cuts). This will be on top of the government’s 2024 budget deficit of nearly $1.9
      trillion. The 2024 federal deficit was equal to about 6.3 percent of last year’s
      U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). This 6.3 percent of GDP budget deficit is larger
      than at any other non-recession period since World War II. The government did
      run much larger deficits to counteract the 2008-09 Great Recession and the 2020-2021
      COVID lockdown. But we are not now experiencing any kind of comparable economic
      crisis. As of 2024, the government’s accumulated debt was also at a peacetime
      high of 97 percent of GDP. This is nearly three times higher than the 2007 pre-Great
      Recession figure, which was 35 percent of GDP. The most critical point is that
      the current deficits are not serving to prevent an economic collapse. They are
      rather simply helping rich people get richer, while attacking the living standards
      of working people and the poor, as well as continuing to lavish exorbitant funds
      on the military. Is the government about to go broke as a result? The most important
      indicator here is how much we have to pay to cover these debts — i.e., the interest
      that the government pays on the U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2024, the government paid
      nearly $900 billion in interest to its creditors, equal to 3.8 percent of GDP.
      That is below the 4.9 percent of GDP that the government paid during the Ronald
      Reagan/George H.W. Bush presidential era. We did not hear Reagan, Bush, or any
      other Republican politician of that era scream then that the sky was falling.
      Nor did the sky fall. Still, the government’s $900 billion in 2024 interest payments
      totaled more than it spent on education, scientific research, public infrastructure,
      environmental protection, and global humanitarian aid combined. Moreover, government
      interest payments were at $350 billion as of 2021, 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the
      2024 interest payments were nearly three times larger than only three years prior.
      This huge spike in interest payments was caused both by the ballooning of government
      debt obligations, but even more so, by the sharp rise in interest rates that the
      government now has to pay its creditors. The average interest rate on five-year
      U.S. government bonds rose from 0.9 percent in 2021 to 4.1 percent in 2024. Interest
      rates on government debt are likely to stay high now under Trump, as the budget
      deficit expands and the value of the U.S. dollar falls relative to other major
      currencies ( the dollar’s value has fallen by more than 10 percent relative to
      other major currencies since Trump returned to office ). The government’s creditors
      are mainly rich individuals and foreign governments. The government does have
      the wherewithal to keep forking over these interest payments to its creditors.
      Yet, by running large fiscal deficits now, when we are not fighting a recession
      or a world war, the government is effectively paying rich people to lend it money
      rather than making them pay minimally decent shares of their income and wealth
      in taxes. Correspondingly, the government’s interest payments that are now lining
      rich people’s pockets — and will flow into these pockets even more abundantly
      thanks to Trump’s bill — also represent hundreds of billions of dollars that could
      otherwise be devoted to public health, public education, food security, and building
      a green economy. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

    paragraph_summary: Donald Trump's recently signed "Big, Beautiful Bill" has been
      criticized as a significant and troubling piece of legislation that primarily
      benefits the wealthy through substantial tax breaks and cuts to social safety
      net programs. In an interview with economist Robert Pollin, he highlights the
      bill's sweeping implications, which include funding for Trump's anti-immigration
      initiatives and detrimental impacts on clean energy efforts, favoring fossil fuel
      production instead. Pollin describes the bill as disgraceful due to its exacerbation
      of economic inequality in the U.S., which is already the most unequal high-income
      country, suggesting that while some effects may take time to manifest, the legislation
      represents a major shift in American policy that aligns with ultra-conservative
      agendas.

    text: 'Royal Courts of Justice in London. (Joe Lauria) In one of the scariest moments
      in modern history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies
      that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider
      a tax-deductible donation . The activist group Palestine Action was designated
      a terrorist organization by the British government last month after it splashed
      red paint on a British war plane in protest of it assisting Israel’s genocide
      in Gaza. The non-violent group is in court challenging its designation by a violent
      government. The author, a former British diplomat, has been in the courthouse
      and filed this report. This is the first installment of his two-part article.
      By Craig Murray / Consortium News I headed to the Royal Courts of Justice in London
      on July 4 for the hearing brought by Huda Ammori, a co-founder of Palestine Action,
      on an application for relief from the government’s proscription order against
      the group as a terrorist organisation. Huda had applied for judicial review of
      the legality of this order. There is to be a hearing on whether a judicial review
      will be granted in the week beginning July 21. What the July 4 hearing was about,
      was whether the proscription should be suspended until that hearing on whether
      permission will be given for judicial review. This is called interim relief. The
      legal precedents on interim relief are that this question should depend on three
      points: — The first is the probability that a full judicial review might ultimately
      succeed, in other words a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case. —
      The second is whether irremediable damage will be done to anyone in the meantime
      if the order is not suspended, should the result of the process eventually be
      a successful judicial review. — If those two hurdles are passed, the third is
      whether on a “balance of convenience” the irremediable harm that might be done
      if the order is not suspended but ultimately is set aside on review, is worse
      than the irremediable harm that the public might suffer from losing the benefit
      the government intends by the order in the interim, should the judicial review
      be denied or eventually confirm the legality of the order. At this stage I presume
      you are deciding whether to bother to read that six times until it makes some
      sort of sense, or whether this is going to be an impenetrably dull article full
      of arcane legal nonsense and you would rather browse something else. I do sympathise.
      I had spent the train journey down from Edinburgh trying to get my head round
      all this; at one stage I had a lovely tourist couple from Hungary, who had the
      bad luck to share the train table with me, each kindly holding sheaves of documents
      and using their thumbs as placeholders. I rose at 6 a.m. on the day of the hearing
      to ensure I would get into the courtroom. I was anticipating that, as with the
      Julian Assange hearings or the International Court of Justice hearings on genocide,
      there may be a long queue waiting to enter. In fact there was nobody at all at
      7 a.m. except a great many policemen and me. I had a coffee opposite the court
      building, and a constant stream of policemen came into the coffee shop to buy
      coffee and doughnuts. By 07.45 there was not a doughnut left within a mile of
      the Strand. Anthropologists should study this. British policemen have no history
      with doughnuts. They never occupied any place in Metropolitan Police culture.
      However a continual barrage of American films and television programmes portray
      policemen as doughnut-eating; so presumably British police think this makes them
      cool. In fact it makes them fat. I shall not be paranoid about the fact the police
      kept photographing me as I hung round waiting for something to happen. They had
      nobody else to photograph. I tried to think of things I might do that look suspicious,
      to make their morning more interesting, but I don’t think my imagination had managed
      enough sleep. I am not going to sugar coat this. I kept going to the cafe loo
      to vomit. In fact I kept having to go and order coffees in various establishments
      to have somewhere to vomit. I had been up most of the night being sick. I hadn’t
      eaten anything suspect, and I assume it was a virus. This continued into the afternoon,
      and once court proceedings started I would race away at less charged moments to
      be sick. Fleet of Police Vans At 8.30 a.m. I went down the Strand to Boots to
      buy some medicine. On my return 10 minutes later, I saw an entire fleet of police
      vans arrive and park up around Arundel Street, about 150 metres from the court
      but out of sight. I counted 16 vans and 11 cars. The vans appeared to have 12-to-15
      policemen in each. That was only around one side of the court. It was a stern
      reminder of the issues at stake, and that proscription as a terrorist group gives
      colossal police-state powers. There are penalties of 14 years in prison should
      you merely “appear to” support a proscribed group, or be “reckless” as to whether
      you say something that may cause someone else to support it. This is the Terrorism
      Act 2000 as originally passed, by the horrible combination of Jack Straw and Tony
      Blair. It has since been amended to be even worse and make plain that no intent
      is required — if you “appear” to support, “recklessly” a proscribed organisation,
      you can be liable for 14 years imprisonment. For some reason the amended version
      is not available on the official government website. At 9 a.m. I entered the the
      Royal Courts of Justice. I have spent many more days here than I would wish, and
      have described the place before : “The architecture of the Royal Courts of Justice
      was the great last gasp of the Gothic revival; having exhausted the exuberance
      that gave us the beauty of St Pancras Station and the Palace of Westminster, the
      movement played out its dreary last efforts at whimsy in shades of grey and brown,
      valuing scale over proportion and mistaking massive for medieval. As intended,
      the buildings are a manifestation of the power of the state; as not intended,
      they are also an indication of the stupidity of large scale power.” Well, here
      I was again. Previously I had only been in the more prestigious courtrooms, off
      the main hall, courts 1 to 15. This case was to be heard in court 73. It was in
      the East Wing. This required an extremely complex feat of navigation through endless
      corridors where your footsteps echoed from the vaulted stone ceilings, through
      uncountable pointed arches, passing open courtyards and cloisters, up stairs and
      then down. With every stage the arches got lower, the architraves shallower, the
      corridors narrower, as you receded from the show of pomp to the mundane exercise
      of power. By the time you were in the cramped L-shaped corridor outside court
      73, you might have mistaken it for a 1950s unemployment benefit office in Solihull.
      I was first there but other people started to arrive for the hearing and the corridor
      became crowded and uncomfortably hot — it was one of the hottest days of the summer.
      At one point I felt about to faint, and Deepa Driver came to my rescue with a
      bottle of water. We were told the court would open at 10.15 am. In the ensuing
      hour I twice lost my place in the queue as I had to leave to go vomit. This did
      enable me to have a quick chat on the stairway with [the attorney] Gareth Peirce
      about the prospects for the case. I managed to get back towards the front of the
      queue each time, either because of immense personal charm or because people got
      out of the way as I smelt faintly of sick, you decide. But in the end it availed
      nothing as only accredited media were allowed into the courtroom. I am famously
      not a journalist in the U.K., as ruled by Lady Dorrian in the High Court of Scotland
      — it’s a long story — so I was not admitted. I was sent instead to an overflow
      room in court 76 on the floor above, where proceedings could be watched on live
      screens. So for this section of proceedings I was not in court. While sound and
      picture quality were excellent, this was not the same as being in the court itself
      in terms of picking up the atmosphere and all the little things which the camera
      does not show. It has never happened to me before in all my reporting. Martin
      Chamberlain The hearing was before Justice Martin Chamberlain. He has a liberal
      reputation. In a case earlier this year, he stated that he had no confidence in
      statements by MI5 [Britain’s domestic intelligence service.] In cases involving
      secret intelligence, British “justice” has an extraordinary procedure whereby
      the defendant is not allowed to know the evidence against him, but can be defended
      on that point in a closed court, without the defendant, by a court-appointed barrister
      known as a “special advocate.” Martin Chamberlain was such an advocate for 10
      years, and it is impossible for anybody with a slightest modicum of honesty to
      view a large quantity of intelligence reports without understanding that a high
      proportion of it is simply inaccurate. I speak as someone who read an average
      of perhaps 12 secret intelligence reports every day over a 22-year career. This
      is hopeful because the secretary of state had indicated that in the substantive
      hearing, there will be intelligence reports on which the government will rely
      in its evidence against Palestine Action. It has been widely leaked to the press
      that this includes intelligence reports that Palestine Action receives funding
      and backing from foreign states – which really is nonsense. Justice Chamberlain
      also ruled against the legality of certain British arms exports to Saudi Arabia
      if they would be used against the civilian population in Yemen. He has argued
      for the strengthening of the freedom of speech provisions of the European Convention
      of Human Rights (ECHR). It was therefore not a shock that he was prepared to annoy
      the legal Establishment by agreeing at least to hear the case as to whether there
      should be a judicial review of the proscription. He might be the only High Court
      judge who would have agreed. Proscribing Palestine Action had been an extremely
      high profile action by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper
      in facing down mounting public anger at the Gaza genocide, and seeking to restore
      the Zionist narrative that Palestinians and supporters of Palestine are terrorist.
      For the court to prevent the proscription from taking effect subject to legal
      proceedings, would be massive news and a further blow to Starmer’s authority.
      So the stakes were very high. Chamberlain gave no indication of this. He appeared
      enthusiastic to engage intellectually with the subject. He was eager and inclined
      to muse aloud in his discussions with the lawyers, interrupting sometimes almost
      out of excitement. He was like a slightly less annoying version of Robert Peston
      . Raza Husain Raza Husain KC opened the case for the claimant, Huda Ammori, in
      the standard form by introducing both teams of bewigged barristers. This took
      some time as the teams were large – six barristers on each side, while Huda had
      in addition two firms of solicitors. It was one of the few immediate indicators
      of the gravity and import of what was happening. But another was the demeanour
      of Raza Husain. Normally the smoothest of operators, he rather stuttered into
      his opening. This struck me throughout the case: Huda’s lawyers sounded slightly
      detached, not because they did not believe what they were saying, but because
      they could not believe that we were in a situation that required them to stand
      there and say it. Husain opened by stating that civil disobedience has a long
      and honourable history in the U.K. Very often people who had broken the law had
      been vindicated by history, such as the suffragettes. This was the first time
      in that long history that a civil disobedience group not advocating violence had
      ever been branded in law as terrorist. Five U.N. special rapporteurs had written
      to oppose the proscription of Palestine Action, including Professor Ben Saul,
      the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human
      rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, who had asked to intervene
      in the case. I am honoured to be appointed by the member countries of the United
      Nations to work with them, civil society, and victims of terrorism and excessive
      counter-terrorism to ensure human rights are fully protected in all counter-terrorism
      efforts https://t.co/WvWEUtJJrF — Prof Ben Saul – UN SR Human Rights & Counterterror
      (@profbensaul) October 13, 2023 The special rapporteurs identified three fundamental
      flaws in the U.K. legislation. There was an overbroad definition of terrorism,
      an overbroad definition of a terrorist organisation and an overbroad definition
      of what constituted support for a terrorist organisation. The overall effect of
      deprivation of liberty was characteristic of an authoritarian state. Husain referred
      to the evidence of Andrew Feinstein. He had experience of the liberation struggle
      in Southern Africa and had become an ANC MP. Feinstein testified that Nelson Mandela
      himself had been designated a terrorist by the British state for decades, and
      that the anti-apartheid movement used all of the direct action methods used by
      Palestine Action. Husain then turned to the evidence of Huda Ammori, who stated
      that in founding Palestine Action she had been directly inspired by the long history
      of civil disobedience movements in Britain and the many instances where courts
      had found such methods, including direct action against the arms industry, to
      be lawful. Palestine Action had never included or targeted any violence or injury
      to persons. Their actions were focused on Elbit, an Israeli state-owned enterprise
      which was fundamental to the Israeli military system. Elbit themselves referred
      to their staff as “civilian soldiers.” Husain continued that the proscription
      of Palestine Action was ill-considered, discriminatory, authoritarian law. It
      was contrary to both the common law and the Human Rights Act. For 20 months the
      Israeli military had been committing acts which most genocide scholars and experts
      consider to be genocide. The population was now being starved, and the very distribution
      of humanitarian aid had been turned into a killing field, according to the U.N.
      Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). To say that Palestine Action were committing
      terrorism was the precise opposite of what they were doing. They were rather seeking
      to prevent terror and genocide. At this stage Judge Chamberlain interposed what
      appeared something of a non sequitur. He asserted that he would have the power
      to create an order suspending the operation of the proscription to a later date,
      and that this was accepted by the secretary of state. Chamberlain continued that
      this could be done one of two ways. He could issue a statutory injunction, or
      the secretary of state could submit a fresh order to Parliament. The proscription
      order also proscribed two other organisations, including the Maniac Murder Cult,
      so the suspension would need to be crafted to benefit only Palestine Action. Judge
      Chamberlain stated that the need was to do justice or to cause the least injustice
      to persons affected in the interim should the case be decided the other way. The
      secretary of state had not evidenced a national security reason for the proscription
      to be introduced immediately. After this apparently heartening judicial intervention,
      Husain continued that the definition of Terrorism in the Act referred to serious
      damage to property. “Serious” in this case must be read, as argued by Professor
      Saul, in relation to international law standards. That was not a measure of financial
      loss, but damage that threatened further consequences such as to nuclear facilities
      or civilian aircraft. The powers of the secretary of state must be exercised proportionately
      within the ECHR rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Therefore
      it could be that even if an organisation fell within the overbroad definitions
      of the act, it still could not be proscribed. Judge Chamberlain countered this
      by citing a Supreme Court ruling in another case (Gould) that overbreadth in legislation
      can be mitigated by prosecutorial discretion. (To translate this into plain English,
      this means that because a law gives the state far too broad a power, it does not
      mean that the state will choose to exercise that power in all cases. Which gives
      of course power to the state selectively to prosecute only its chosen “enemies”
      using overbroad legislation.) Husain countered that when the legislation was passed
      through parliament, the then secretary of state had given a categorical assurance
      that the power of proscription would never be used against domestic direct action
      groups. Yet here we are. Judge Chamberlain responded that to reverse the proscription
      on the grounds Husain proposed, he would have to demonstrate that it led to an
      absurdity, citing another case (Hunt). Husain replied, “It is absurd. It is absurd
      to pronounce a non-violent group terrorist.” Judge Chamberlain said that what
      counted was whether if fitted the statutory definition of terrorism, not “some
      colloquial definition of terrorism”. Husain said the statute specified that terrorism
      was designed to induce a climate of fear, influence the government or intimidate
      the public. None of these applied to Palestine Action. Judge Chamberlain asked
      what was the purpose of the attack on RAF Brize Norton if not to influence the
      government? Palestine Action’s own submissions claim that Brize Norton supplies
      RAF Akrotiri which is supporting the Genocide. Husain said that one isolated or
      sporadic incident did not define the purpose of the organisation, which was to
      disrupt Elbit and the arms industry. Palestine Action has a non-hierarchical nature.
      Ascribing responsibility for individual actions was complex. Judge Chamberlain
      stated that in December 2024 the U.K. government had suspended arms licenses to
      Israel. Could it not be inferred that Palestine Action was attempting to attain
      this end? Hussain replied that was not the design of the organisation. It is designed
      to disrupt the arms supply chain. He then attempted to make further ground with
      his next point: documents showed that the government had engaged both the Israeli
      government and Elbit Systems in the decision making process to proscribe Palestine
      Action. Judge Chamberlain noted that some of these documents were heavily redacted.
      It was not plain what some of them meant. Raza Husain referred to a document which
      involved the phrase “act of vandalism” and reference to “a certain person” intervening.
      It appeared this process had taken place in March. The decision had therefore
      been taken before the Brize Norton incident. Judge Chamberlain asked why it would
      be unlawful to take into account the views of the state of Israel? At this point
      Raza Husain dropped his papers and stared at Judge Chamberlain in incredulity.
      “Israel to interfere? In our criminal law? In our domestic process?” Chamberlain
      responded that the government took a range of views into account. Why should it
      be unlawful to listen to Israel? Husain replied that interference by another state
      in domestic criminal matters was unconstitutional. Chamberlain stated that there
      was nothing in the legislation that precludes taking Israel’s views into account.
      Husain again asked incredulously, “To decide if it is terrorism?” Chamberlain
      responded, “They are the victims. They suffered criminal damage.” Husain said
      that does not go to the definition of terrorism. Chamberlain countered they could
      evidence the seriousness of the damage. Husain said he returned to the international
      definition underlined by Ben Saul. The damage to property had to go to the level
      of endangering nuclear installations or civil aviation. We were not in that territory.
      Husain continued that while both Israel and Elbit were consulted on the decision
      to proscribe, no pro-Palestinian group had been consulted. Judge Chamberlain replied
      that the statutory basis may preclude any common-law right to due process. The
      secretary of state had stated that pro-Palestinian groups could not be consulted,
      because in effect that would give Palestine Action 21 days’ notice of proscription,
      in which period it might take pre-emptive action. Husain responded that may be
      a claimed reason, but how does it apply the law? Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh Chamberlain
      had rather destroyed the flow of Raza Husain’s argument. He now handed over to
      his colleague Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh KC. Readers of my blog last encountered Blinne
      when she held spellbound the International Court of Justice in the Hague, speaking
      for South Africa in the Genocide case against Israel. There the world stopped
      and held its breath, and the dramatic architecture of the great hall of the Palace
      of Justice matched the occasion. Here Blinne stood in the much more modest circumstances
      of court 73. A plain, three-tier dais of utilitarian wood occupied one long side
      for the judge and clerks. It is the kind of unnatural wood finish that you get
      on steel-legged stacking tables, a peculiarly dark reddish brown with unbroken
      black lines of grain running straight across. The bench seats for the lawyers
      were in the well of the court, four rows of those, and then there was a small
      platform at the back for the public gallery, containing fourteen seats — occupied
      by the press, as was the jury box. Everything was the same kind of wood or veneer.
      Fitted bookshelves covered the walls around the court, and a very few contained
      cloth-bound tomes of law, but it appears that someone had forgotten to buy any
      books for most of them. Judge Chamberlain was perched on the top dais of the bench,
      in a rather austere black gown with a neat pressed linen collar known as “court
      bands” around his neck, which featured two long tabs of about six inches hanging
      down in parallel at the front. He rather resembled a Danish Lutheran preacher.
      I was in court 76 watching the large screens, as though in the world’s dullest
      sports bar. The construction was identical to court 73, of the same wood, only
      the entire thing was three times the size. We observers occupied the well of the
      court. There was a public gallery of 48 seats which was almost entirely empty.
      Had the hearing been held in court 76, everybody could have been in the actual
      courtroom itself. Why the large courtroom was the overspill court and the proceedings
      were in the tiny courtroom is an interesting question in itself. The result was
      that no members of the public were in the actual court, despite their right in
      law to attend. I raced out to be sick again before Blinne started, so for her
      first three minutes I am grateful to the whispered advice of my neighbours. Blinne
      was addressing the irreparable harm that would be caused in the next two weeks
      were the proscription not to be set aside pending the next hearing. She said that
      the context of the situation in Gaza was that the Palestinian people there faced
      annihilation and genocide. The U.N. secretary general himself had described what
      was happening as “A stain on our common humanity”. The explosive force that had
      been landed on the tiny area of Gaza was the equivalent of six Hiroshimas. There
      was firm evidence that Israel was now conducting daily massacres of those Palestinians
      attempting to obtain food for their families. Judge Chamberlain interposed that,
      since December 2024, it is not permissible for the U.K. to provide any arms to
      Israel save for F-35 parts. Blinne replied: “That’s a big ‘save’ when people are
      being massacred.” There was much evidence of continuing arms supply and other
      forms of military support. This massacre is what Palestine Action have been attempting
      to disrupt and prevent. If the proscription goes through, how will you differentiate
      between Palestine Action supporters and other people who hold similar views and
      take similar actions? Irreparable harm will be done to protestors. Some will carefully
      follow the law. Some will attempt to walk the invisible tightrope on what expressions
      of support for Palestine are permitted and what expressions are not, and will
      fall off. Some will openly defy the proscription as an act of civil disobedience
      — and some, such as Sally Rooney , [the Irish novelist] live in other jurisdictions.
      This was all the unprecedented impact of the unique proscription of a grassroots
      protest group. Three key offences would be created immediately upon the order
      coming into effect. It would be an offence to belong, or profess to belong, to
      Palestine Action. It would be an offence to invite, or to recklessly encourage,
      support for Palestine Action. It would be an offence to arrange a meeting to support
      Palestine Action or to hear from a member of Palestine Action. All of these carry
      a sentence of up to 14 years in prison. Wearing clothing or a badge associated
      with the organisation were offences of strict liability, bringing a six-month
      prison sentence. Any person convicted would be branded a “terrorist”. A policeman
      could arrest at any time on suspicion of these offences. They could stop and search.
      They could enter and search people’s homes and remove property. All of these without
      a warrant from a court. Any refugee convicted of any of these offences is deemed
      a danger to the community, justifying expulsion from the U.K. All of this will
      chill free speech. Those who have supported Palestine Action in the past will
      fall under suspicion for actions which were perfectly lawful at the time. Judge
      Chamberlain interrupted to say that this would not happen; the general principle
      of non-retrospectivity would apply. Blinne said that Palestine Action was a non-formalised
      body. How did you become a member, and how do you stop being a member? How can
      you prevent being suspected of being a member if you take direct action on behalf
      of Palestine without any connection to Palestine Action? Direct action and civil
      disobedience were not necessarily against U.K. law. A great many of those charged
      for direct action by Palestine Action had in fact been acquitted by the courts,
      and therefore their actions had been perfectly legal. There had been few actual
      convictions. The basic activity was not illegal. Any organisation, for example
      one called “Yvette Cooper”, could be “suspected” by the police of being Palestine
      Action. (A new pro-Palestine direct action group has been announced named ironically
      after the secretary of state.) How would the police decide what symbols showed
      support for Palestine Action? Were red boiler suits now banned? Judge Chamberlain
      attempted to pooh-pooh these questions, and Blinne retorted that people had already
      been arrested for carrying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs. There had
      been an actual trial for carrying a banner showing a palm tree and two coconuts.
      What about republishing? What of those who had Facebook photos wearing a Palestine
      Action T-shirt that might still be seen? How could you argue for de-proscription
      of the organisation if any mention were likely to bring you under “reasonable
      suspicion” of support? Judge Chamberlain replied that in due course he would like
      to hear the government KC, Mr. Ben Watson, address the question of the legality
      of arguing for deproscription. Blinne said that the harm caused during proscription
      would be irreparable. Palestinians will continue to be killed while the efforts
      to disrupt the arms supply to kill them would be banned. The chilling effect on
      free speech would be extreme. There were hundreds of thousands of supporters of
      Palestine Action on Twitter and other platforms. There would be mass mobilisation.
      Over 40 organisations opposed the proscription, including Liberty and Amnesty
      International (both had representatives in court). This was a fundamental attack
      on free speech. Judge Chamberlain responded that they would be able lawfully to
      advocate for deproscription. Blinne replied that they would not, because this
      would give rise to the offence of appearing to give support. Judge Chamberlain
      asked her to specify which offence was that? Blinne replied that under Section
      12, giving intellectual support to the organisation and appearing to support the
      organisation were both covered. Judge Chamberlain persisted, asking how arguing
      for deproscription can be confused with this? Blinne responded that the answer
      is that nobody knows how it will be applied, and therefore it will chill free
      speech. The definition of support for terrorism is really widely drawn. It is
      therefore certainly capable of being interpreted in that way. What would be the
      consequences of simply saying, “I think Palestine Action did the right thing in
      protesting the Genocide?” The consequences of straying the wrong side of the invisible
      line were potentially extreme. Furthermore what would be the position of lawyers
      acting for Palestine Action in future? Would they be permitted to take instruction?
      How could they be paid? In addition to violating Article X of the ECHR on freedom
      of speech, there was a clear violation of Article XIV on non-discrimination due
      to the discrimination in selecting a pro-Palestinian direct action group for proscription,
      when similar direct action groups concerned with other subjects of protest, such
      as climate change, had not been proscribed. According to the Human Rights Act
      it was unlawful in domestic law to violate the c. Articles X, XI and XIV were
      all engaged. (Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Assembly; Non-Discrimination.) There
      was clear Strasbourg case law that neither violence nor financial loss can abnegate
      Article X and XI rights. Judge Chamberlain replied that the secretary of state
      stated that there was “significant damage to key national infrastructure” affecting
      “components that supply U.K. and allied forces” and “damage that amounts to hundreds
      of millions of pounds.” We broke for lunch, and I reacquainted myself with the
      bathroom. The sound of my dry retching reverberated around the vast, unflinching
      stone vaults and halls of the Royal Courts. I trust it was not taken as an expression
      of support for Palestine Action. I emerged into the sunlight, and for the first
      time I saw the large demonstration outside. I did a number of interviews for media
      all around the world. Was at Pal Action protest at the Royal Courts of Justice,
      and surprise surprise who comes out? @craigmurray pic.twitter.com/j4gcAvO8o9 —
      Matt Ó Branáin #PardonAssange (@MattOBranain) July 5, 2025 I had intended to give
      a quick speech to the crowd explaining what was happening inside, but the protest
      was extremely lively and involved bare-chested young men rapping and a great deal
      of dancing, so I figured nobody would want to hear from a fat old man in a suit.
      There was a massive police presence, and I witnessed two instances of young men
      being dragged from the fringes of the crowd by the police and searched – for no
      reason I could discern, other than an attempt by the police to provoke a violent
      reaction that would discredit the protest. This is the first of a two-part article.

    one_sentence_summary: Palestine Action, designated a terrorist organization by the
      British government for its protests against military support for Israel, is challenging
      this designation in court, as reported by former diplomat Craig Murray.
    paragraph_summary: Palestine Action, an activist group recently designated as a
      terrorist organization by the British government for its protests against military
      support for Israel, is challenging this designation in court. The group, co-founded
      by Huda Ammori, is seeking judicial review of the government's proscription order,
      with a hearing scheduled for July 21 to determine if the order should be suspended
      until the review takes place. The initial hearing on July 4 focused on whether
      interim relief should be granted, which hinges on the likelihood of success in
      the judicial review, the potential for irremediable harm if the order is not suspended,
      and the balance of convenience regarding the situation. The author, a former British
      diplomat, reports from the Royal Courts of Justice on this significant legal battle.

      a terrorist organization by the British government last month after it splashed
      red paint on a British war plane in protest of it assisting Israel’s genocide
      in Gaza. The non-violent group is in court challenging its designation by a violent
      government. The author, a former British diplomat, has been in the courthouse
      and filed this report. This is the first installment of his two-part article.
      By Craig Murray / Consortium News I headed to the Royal Courts of Justice in London
      on July 4 for the hearing brought by Huda Ammori, a co-founder of Palestine Action,
      on an application for relief from the government’s proscription order against
      the group as a terrorist organisation. Huda had applied for judicial review of
      the legality of this order. There is to be a hearing on whether a judicial review
      will be granted in the week beginning July 21. What the July 4 hearing was about,
      was whether the proscription should be suspended until that hearing on whether
      permission will be given for judicial review. This is called interim relief. The
      legal precedents on interim relief are that this question should depend on three
      points: — The first is the probability that a full judicial review might ultimately
      succeed, in other words a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case. —
      The second is whether irremediable damage will be done to anyone in the meantime
      if the order is not suspended, should the result of the process eventually be
      a successful judicial review. — If those two hurdles are passed, the third is
      whether on a “balance of convenience” the irremediable harm that might be done
      if the order is not suspended but ultimately is set aside on review, is worse
      than the irremediable harm that the public might suffer from losing the benefit
      the government intends by the order in the interim, should the judicial review
      be denied or eventually confirm the legality of the order. At this stage I presume
      you are deciding whether to bother to read that six times until it makes some
      sort of sense, or whether this is going to be an impenetrably dull article full
      of arcane legal nonsense and you would rather browse something else. I do sympathise.
      I had spent the train journey down from Edinburgh trying to get my head round
      all this; at one stage I had a lovely tourist couple from Hungary, who had the
      bad luck to share the train table with me, each kindly holding sheaves of documents
      and using their thumbs as placeholders. I rose at 6 a.m. on the day of the hearing
      to ensure I would get into the courtroom. I was anticipating that, as with the
      Julian Assange hearings or the International Court of Justice hearings on genocide,
      there may be a long queue waiting to enter. In fact there was nobody at all at
      7 a.m. except a great many policemen and me. I had a coffee opposite the court
      building, and a constant stream of policemen came into the coffee shop to buy
      coffee and doughnuts. By 07.45 there was not a doughnut left within a mile of
      the Strand. Anthropologists should study this. British policemen have no history
      with doughnuts. They never occupied any place in Metropolitan Police culture.
      However a continual barrage of American films and television programmes portray
      policemen as doughnut-eating; so presumably British police think this makes them
      cool. In fact it makes them fat. I shall not be paranoid about the fact the police
      kept photographing me as I hung round waiting for something to happen. They had
      nobody else to photograph. I tried to think of things I might do that look suspicious,
      to make their morning more interesting, but I don’t think my imagination had managed
      enough sleep. I am not going to sugar coat this. I kept going to the cafe loo
      to vomit. In fact I kept having to go and order coffees in various establishments
      to have somewhere to vomit. I had been up most of the night being sick. I hadn’t
      eaten anything suspect, and I assume it was a virus. This continued into the afternoon,
      and once court proceedings started I would race away at less charged moments to
      be sick. Fleet of Police Vans At 8.30 a.m. I went down the Strand to Boots to
      buy some medicine. On my return 10 minutes later, I saw an entire fleet of police
      vans arrive and park up around Arundel Street, about 150 metres from the court
      but out of sight. I counted 16 vans and 11 cars. The vans appeared to have 12-to-15
      policemen in each. That was only around one side of the court. It was a stern
      reminder of the issues at stake, and that proscription as a terrorist group gives
      colossal police-state powers. There are penalties of 14 years in prison should
      you merely “appear to” support a proscribed group, or be “reckless” as to whether
      you say something that may cause someone else to support it. This is the Terrorism
      Act 2000 as originally passed, by the horrible combination of Jack Straw and Tony
      Blair. It has since been amended to be even worse and make plain that no intent
      is required — if you “appear” to support, “recklessly” a proscribed organisation,
      you can be liable for 14 years imprisonment. For some reason the amended version
      is not available on the official government website. At 9 a.m. I entered the the
      Royal Courts of Justice. I have spent many more days here than I would wish, and
      have described the place before : “The architecture of the Royal Courts of Justice
      was the great last gasp of the Gothic revival; having exhausted the exuberance
      that gave us the beauty of St Pancras Station and the Palace of Westminster, the
      movement played out its dreary last efforts at whimsy in shades of grey and brown,
      valuing scale over proportion and mistaking massive for medieval. As intended,
      the buildings are a manifestation of the power of the state; as not intended,
      they are also an indication of the stupidity of large scale power.” Well, here
      I was again. Previously I had only been in the more prestigious courtrooms, off
      the main hall, courts 1 to 15. This case was to be heard in court 73. It was in
      the East Wing. This required an extremely complex feat of navigation through endless
      corridors where your footsteps echoed from the vaulted stone ceilings, through
      uncountable pointed arches, passing open courtyards and cloisters, up stairs and
      then down. With every stage the arches got lower, the architraves shallower, the
      corridors narrower, as you receded from the show of pomp to the mundane exercise
      of power. By the time you were in the cramped L-shaped corridor outside court
      73, you might have mistaken it for a 1950s unemployment benefit office in Solihull.
      I was first there but other people started to arrive for the hearing and the corridor
      became crowded and uncomfortably hot — it was one of the hottest days of the summer.
      At one point I felt about to faint, and Deepa Driver came to my rescue with a
      bottle of water. We were told the court would open at 10.15 am. In the ensuing
      hour I twice lost my place in the queue as I had to leave to go vomit. This did
      enable me to have a quick chat on the stairway with [the attorney] Gareth Peirce
      about the prospects for the case. I managed to get back towards the front of the
      queue each time, either because of immense personal charm or because people got
      out of the way as I smelt faintly of sick, you decide. But in the end it availed
      nothing as only accredited media were allowed into the courtroom. I am famously
      not a journalist in the U.K., as ruled by Lady Dorrian in the High Court of Scotland
      — it’s a long story — so I was not admitted. I was sent instead to an overflow
      room in court 76 on the floor above, where proceedings could be watched on live
      screens. So for this section of proceedings I was not in court. While sound and
      picture quality were excellent, this was not the same as being in the court itself
      in terms of picking up the atmosphere and all the little things which the camera
      does not show. It has never happened to me before in all my reporting. Martin
      Chamberlain The hearing was before Justice Martin Chamberlain. He has a liberal
      reputation. In a case earlier this year, he stated that he had no confidence in
      statements by MI5 [Britain’s domestic intelligence service.] In cases involving
      secret intelligence, British “justice” has an extraordinary procedure whereby
      the defendant is not allowed to know the evidence against him, but can be defended
      on that point in a closed court, without the defendant, by a court-appointed barrister
      known as a “special advocate.” Martin Chamberlain was such an advocate for 10
      years, and it is impossible for anybody with a slightest modicum of honesty to
      view a large quantity of intelligence reports without understanding that a high
      proportion of it is simply inaccurate. I speak as someone who read an average
      of perhaps 12 secret intelligence reports every day over a 22-year career. This
      is hopeful because the secretary of state had indicated that in the substantive
      hearing, there will be intelligence reports on which the government will rely
      in its evidence against Palestine Action. It has been widely leaked to the press
      that this includes intelligence reports that Palestine Action receives funding
      and backing from foreign states – which really is nonsense. Justice Chamberlain
      also ruled against the legality of certain British arms exports to Saudi Arabia
      if they would be used against the civilian population in Yemen. He has argued
      for the strengthening of the freedom of speech provisions of the European Convention
      of Human Rights (ECHR). It was therefore not a shock that he was prepared to annoy
      the legal Establishment by agreeing at least to hear the case as to whether there
      should be a judicial review of the proscription. He might be the only High Court
      judge who would have agreed. Proscribing Palestine Action had been an extremely
      high profile action by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper
      in facing down mounting public anger at the Gaza genocide, and seeking to restore
      the Zionist narrative that Palestinians and supporters of Palestine are terrorist.
      For the court to prevent the proscription from taking effect subject to legal
      proceedings, would be massive news and a further blow to Starmer’s authority.
      So the stakes were very high. Chamberlain gave no indication of this. He appeared
      enthusiastic to engage intellectually with the subject. He was eager and inclined
      to muse aloud in his discussions with the lawyers, interrupting sometimes almost
      out of excitement. He was like a slightly less annoying version of Robert Peston
      . Raza Husain Raza Husain KC opened the case for the claimant, Huda Ammori, in
      the standard form by introducing both teams of bewigged barristers. This took
      some time as the teams were large – six barristers on each side, while Huda had
      in addition two firms of solicitors. It was one of the few immediate indicators
      of the gravity and import of what was happening. But another was the demeanour
      of Raza Husain. Normally the smoothest of operators, he rather stuttered into
      his opening. This struck me throughout the case: Huda’s lawyers sounded slightly
      detached, not because they did not believe what they were saying, but because
      they could not believe that we were in a situation that required them to stand
      there and say it. Husain opened by stating that civil disobedience has a long
      and honourable history in the U.K. Very often people who had broken the law had
      been vindicated by history, such as the suffragettes. This was the first time
      in that long history that a civil disobedience group not advocating violence had
      ever been branded in law as terrorist. Five U.N. special rapporteurs had written
      to oppose the proscription of Palestine Action, including Professor Ben Saul,
      the United Nations special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human
      rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, who had asked to intervene
      in the case. I am honoured to be appointed by the member countries of the United
      Nations to work with them, civil society, and victims of terrorism and excessive
      counter-terrorism to ensure human rights are fully protected in all counter-terrorism
      efforts https://t.co/WvWEUtJJrF — Prof Ben Saul – UN SR Human Rights & Counterterror
      (@profbensaul) October 13, 2023 The special rapporteurs identified three fundamental
      flaws in the U.K. legislation. There was an overbroad definition of terrorism,
      an overbroad definition of a terrorist organisation and an overbroad definition
      of what constituted support for a terrorist organisation. The overall effect of
      deprivation of liberty was characteristic of an authoritarian state. Husain referred
      to the evidence of Andrew Feinstein. He had experience of the liberation struggle
      in Southern Africa and had become an ANC MP. Feinstein testified that Nelson Mandela
      himself had been designated a terrorist by the British state for decades, and
      that the anti-apartheid movement used all of the direct action methods used by
      Palestine Action. Husain then turned to the evidence of Huda Ammori, who stated
      that in founding Palestine Action she had been directly inspired by the long history
      of civil disobedience movements in Britain and the many instances where courts
      had found such methods, including direct action against the arms industry, to
      be lawful. Palestine Action had never included or targeted any violence or injury
      to persons. Their actions were focused on Elbit, an Israeli state-owned enterprise
      which was fundamental to the Israeli military system. Elbit themselves referred
      to their staff as “civilian soldiers.” Husain continued that the proscription
      of Palestine Action was ill-considered, discriminatory, authoritarian law. It
      was contrary to both the common law and the Human Rights Act. For 20 months the
      Israeli military had been committing acts which most genocide scholars and experts
      consider to be genocide. The population was now being starved, and the very distribution
      of humanitarian aid had been turned into a killing field, according to the U.N.
      Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). To say that Palestine Action were committing
      terrorism was the precise opposite of what they were doing. They were rather seeking
      to prevent terror and genocide. At this stage Judge Chamberlain interposed what
      appeared something of a non sequitur. He asserted that he would have the power
      to create an order suspending the operation of the proscription to a later date,
      and that this was accepted by the secretary of state. Chamberlain continued that
      this could be done one of two ways. He could issue a statutory injunction, or
      the secretary of state could submit a fresh order to Parliament. The proscription
      order also proscribed two other organisations, including the Maniac Murder Cult,
      so the suspension would need to be crafted to benefit only Palestine Action. Judge
      Chamberlain stated that the need was to do justice or to cause the least injustice
      to persons affected in the interim should the case be decided the other way. The
      secretary of state had not evidenced a national security reason for the proscription
      to be introduced immediately. After this apparently heartening judicial intervention,
      Husain continued that the definition of Terrorism in the Act referred to serious
      damage to property. “Serious” in this case must be read, as argued by Professor
      Saul, in relation to international law standards. That was not a measure of financial
      loss, but damage that threatened further consequences such as to nuclear facilities
      or civilian aircraft. The powers of the secretary of state must be exercised proportionately
      within the ECHR rights, such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Therefore
      it could be that even if an organisation fell within the overbroad definitions
      of the act, it still could not be proscribed. Judge Chamberlain countered this
      by citing a Supreme Court ruling in another case (Gould) that overbreadth in legislation
      can be mitigated by prosecutorial discretion. (To translate this into plain English,
      this means that because a law gives the state far too broad a power, it does not
      mean that the state will choose to exercise that power in all cases. Which gives
      of course power to the state selectively to prosecute only its chosen “enemies”
      using overbroad legislation.) Husain countered that when the legislation was passed
      through parliament, the then secretary of state had given a categorical assurance
      that the power of proscription would never be used against domestic direct action
      groups. Yet here we are. Judge Chamberlain responded that to reverse the proscription
      on the grounds Husain proposed, he would have to demonstrate that it led to an
      absurdity, citing another case (Hunt). Husain replied, “It is absurd. It is absurd
      to pronounce a non-violent group terrorist.” Judge Chamberlain said that what
      counted was whether if fitted the statutory definition of terrorism, not “some
      colloquial definition of terrorism”. Husain said the statute specified that terrorism
      was designed to induce a climate of fear, influence the government or intimidate
      the public. None of these applied to Palestine Action. Judge Chamberlain asked
      what was the purpose of the attack on RAF Brize Norton if not to influence the
      government? Palestine Action’s own submissions claim that Brize Norton supplies
      RAF Akrotiri which is supporting the Genocide. Husain said that one isolated or
      sporadic incident did not define the purpose of the organisation, which was to
      disrupt Elbit and the arms industry. Palestine Action has a non-hierarchical nature.
      Ascribing responsibility for individual actions was complex. Judge Chamberlain
      stated that in December 2024 the U.K. government had suspended arms licenses to
      Israel. Could it not be inferred that Palestine Action was attempting to attain
      this end? Hussain replied that was not the design of the organisation. It is designed
      to disrupt the arms supply chain. He then attempted to make further ground with
      his next point: documents showed that the government had engaged both the Israeli
      government and Elbit Systems in the decision making process to proscribe Palestine
      Action. Judge Chamberlain noted that some of these documents were heavily redacted.
      It was not plain what some of them meant. Raza Husain referred to a document which
      involved the phrase “act of vandalism” and reference to “a certain person” intervening.
      It appeared this process had taken place in March. The decision had therefore
      been taken before the Brize Norton incident. Judge Chamberlain asked why it would
      be unlawful to take into account the views of the state of Israel? At this point
      Raza Husain dropped his papers and stared at Judge Chamberlain in incredulity.
      “Israel to interfere? In our criminal law? In our domestic process?” Chamberlain
      responded that the government took a range of views into account. Why should it
      be unlawful to listen to Israel? Husain replied that interference by another state
      in domestic criminal matters was unconstitutional. Chamberlain stated that there
      was nothing in the legislation that precludes taking Israel’s views into account.
      Husain again asked incredulously, “To decide if it is terrorism?” Chamberlain
      responded, “They are the victims. They suffered criminal damage.” Husain said
      that does not go to the definition of terrorism. Chamberlain countered they could
      evidence the seriousness of the damage. Husain said he returned to the international
      definition underlined by Ben Saul. The damage to property had to go to the level
      of endangering nuclear installations or civil aviation. We were not in that territory.
      Husain continued that while both Israel and Elbit were consulted on the decision
      to proscribe, no pro-Palestinian group had been consulted. Judge Chamberlain replied
      that the statutory basis may preclude any common-law right to due process. The
      secretary of state had stated that pro-Palestinian groups could not be consulted,
      because in effect that would give Palestine Action 21 days’ notice of proscription,
      in which period it might take pre-emptive action. Husain responded that may be
      a claimed reason, but how does it apply the law? Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh Chamberlain
      had rather destroyed the flow of Raza Husain’s argument. He now handed over to
      his colleague Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh KC. Readers of my blog last encountered Blinne
      when she held spellbound the International Court of Justice in the Hague, speaking
      for South Africa in the Genocide case against Israel. There the world stopped
      and held its breath, and the dramatic architecture of the great hall of the Palace
      of Justice matched the occasion. Here Blinne stood in the much more modest circumstances
      of court 73. A plain, three-tier dais of utilitarian wood occupied one long side
      for the judge and clerks. It is the kind of unnatural wood finish that you get
      on steel-legged stacking tables, a peculiarly dark reddish brown with unbroken
      black lines of grain running straight across. The bench seats for the lawyers
      were in the well of the court, four rows of those, and then there was a small
      platform at the back for the public gallery, containing fourteen seats — occupied
      by the press, as was the jury box. Everything was the same kind of wood or veneer.
      Fitted bookshelves covered the walls around the court, and a very few contained
      cloth-bound tomes of law, but it appears that someone had forgotten to buy any
      books for most of them. Judge Chamberlain was perched on the top dais of the bench,
      in a rather austere black gown with a neat pressed linen collar known as “court
      bands” around his neck, which featured two long tabs of about six inches hanging
      down in parallel at the front. He rather resembled a Danish Lutheran preacher.
      I was in court 76 watching the large screens, as though in the world’s dullest
      sports bar. The construction was identical to court 73, of the same wood, only
      the entire thing was three times the size. We observers occupied the well of the
      court. There was a public gallery of 48 seats which was almost entirely empty.
      Had the hearing been held in court 76, everybody could have been in the actual
      courtroom itself. Why the large courtroom was the overspill court and the proceedings
      were in the tiny courtroom is an interesting question in itself. The result was
      that no members of the public were in the actual court, despite their right in
      law to attend. I raced out to be sick again before Blinne started, so for her
      first three minutes I am grateful to the whispered advice of my neighbours. Blinne
      was addressing the irreparable harm that would be caused in the next two weeks
      were the proscription not to be set aside pending the next hearing. She said that
      the context of the situation in Gaza was that the Palestinian people there faced
      annihilation and genocide. The U.N. secretary general himself had described what
      was happening as “A stain on our common humanity”. The explosive force that had
      been landed on the tiny area of Gaza was the equivalent of six Hiroshimas. There
      was firm evidence that Israel was now conducting daily massacres of those Palestinians
      attempting to obtain food for their families. Judge Chamberlain interposed that,
      since December 2024, it is not permissible for the U.K. to provide any arms to
      Israel save for F-35 parts. Blinne replied: “That’s a big ‘save’ when people are
      being massacred.” There was much evidence of continuing arms supply and other
      forms of military support. This massacre is what Palestine Action have been attempting
      to disrupt and prevent. If the proscription goes through, how will you differentiate
      between Palestine Action supporters and other people who hold similar views and
      take similar actions? Irreparable harm will be done to protestors. Some will carefully
      follow the law. Some will attempt to walk the invisible tightrope on what expressions
      of support for Palestine are permitted and what expressions are not, and will
      fall off. Some will openly defy the proscription as an act of civil disobedience
      — and some, such as Sally Rooney , [the Irish novelist] live in other jurisdictions.
      This was all the unprecedented impact of the unique proscription of a grassroots
      protest group. Three key offences would be created immediately upon the order
      coming into effect. It would be an offence to belong, or profess to belong, to
      Palestine Action. It would be an offence to invite, or to recklessly encourage,
      support for Palestine Action. It would be an offence to arrange a meeting to support
      Palestine Action or to hear from a member of Palestine Action. All of these carry
      a sentence of up to 14 years in prison. Wearing clothing or a badge associated
      with the organisation were offences of strict liability, bringing a six-month
      prison sentence. Any person convicted would be branded a “terrorist”. A policeman
      could arrest at any time on suspicion of these offences. They could stop and search.
      They could enter and search people’s homes and remove property. All of these without
      a warrant from a court. Any refugee convicted of any of these offences is deemed
      a danger to the community, justifying expulsion from the U.K. All of this will
      chill free speech. Those who have supported Palestine Action in the past will
      fall under suspicion for actions which were perfectly lawful at the time. Judge
      Chamberlain interrupted to say that this would not happen; the general principle
      of non-retrospectivity would apply. Blinne said that Palestine Action was a non-formalised
      body. How did you become a member, and how do you stop being a member? How can
      you prevent being suspected of being a member if you take direct action on behalf
      of Palestine without any connection to Palestine Action? Direct action and civil
      disobedience were not necessarily against U.K. law. A great many of those charged
      for direct action by Palestine Action had in fact been acquitted by the courts,
      and therefore their actions had been perfectly legal. There had been few actual
      convictions. The basic activity was not illegal. Any organisation, for example
      one called “Yvette Cooper”, could be “suspected” by the police of being Palestine
      Action. (A new pro-Palestine direct action group has been announced named ironically
      after the secretary of state.) How would the police decide what symbols showed
      support for Palestine Action? Were red boiler suits now banned? Judge Chamberlain
      attempted to pooh-pooh these questions, and Blinne retorted that people had already
      been arrested for carrying Palestinian flags and wearing keffiyehs. There had
      been an actual trial for carrying a banner showing a palm tree and two coconuts.
      What about republishing? What of those who had Facebook photos wearing a Palestine
      Action T-shirt that might still be seen? How could you argue for de-proscription
      of the organisation if any mention were likely to bring you under “reasonable
      suspicion” of support? Judge Chamberlain replied that in due course he would like
      to hear the government KC, Mr. Ben Watson, address the question of the legality
      of arguing for deproscription. Blinne said that the harm caused during proscription
      would be irreparable. Palestinians will continue to be killed while the efforts
      to disrupt the arms supply to kill them would be banned. The chilling effect on
      free speech would be extreme. There were hundreds of thousands of supporters of
      Palestine Action on Twitter and other platforms. There would be mass mobilisation.
      Over 40 organisations opposed the proscription, including Liberty and Amnesty
      International (both had representatives in court). This was a fundamental attack
      on free speech. Judge Chamberlain responded that they would be able lawfully to
      advocate for deproscription. Blinne replied that they would not, because this
      would give rise to the offence of appearing to give support. Judge Chamberlain
      asked her to specify which offence was that? Blinne replied that under Section
      12, giving intellectual support to the organisation and appearing to support the
      organisation were both covered. Judge Chamberlain persisted, asking how arguing
      for deproscription can be confused with this? Blinne responded that the answer
      is that nobody knows how it will be applied, and therefore it will chill free
      speech. The definition of support for terrorism is really widely drawn. It is
      therefore certainly capable of being interpreted in that way. What would be the
      consequences of simply saying, “I think Palestine Action did the right thing in
      protesting the Genocide?” The consequences of straying the wrong side of the invisible
      line were potentially extreme. Furthermore what would be the position of lawyers
      acting for Palestine Action in future? Would they be permitted to take instruction?
      How could they be paid? In addition to violating Article X of the ECHR on freedom
      of speech, there was a clear violation of Article XIV on non-discrimination due
      to the discrimination in selecting a pro-Palestinian direct action group for proscription,
      when similar direct action groups concerned with other subjects of protest, such
      as climate change, had not been proscribed. According to the Human Rights Act
      it was unlawful in domestic law to violate the c. Articles X, XI and XIV were
      all engaged. (Freedom of Speech; Freedom of Assembly; Non-Discrimination.) There
      was clear Strasbourg case law that neither violence nor financial loss can abnegate
      Article X and XI rights. Judge Chamberlain replied that the secretary of state
      stated that there was “significant damage to key national infrastructure” affecting
      “components that supply U.K. and allied forces” and “damage that amounts to hundreds
      of millions of pounds.” We broke for lunch, and I reacquainted myself with the
      bathroom. The sound of my dry retching reverberated around the vast, unflinching
      stone vaults and halls of the Royal Courts. I trust it was not taken as an expression
      of support for Palestine Action. I emerged into the sunlight, and for the first
      time I saw the large demonstration outside. I did a number of interviews for media
      all around the world. Was at Pal Action protest at the Royal Courts of Justice,
      and surprise surprise who comes out? @craigmurray pic.twitter.com/j4gcAvO8o9 —
      Matt Ó Branáin #PardonAssange (@MattOBranain) July 5, 2025 I had intended to give
      a quick speech to the crowd explaining what was happening inside, but the protest
      was extremely lively and involved bare-chested young men rapping and a great deal
      of dancing, so I figured nobody would want to hear from a fat old man in a suit.
      There was a massive police presence, and I witnessed two instances of young men
      being dragged from the fringes of the crowd by the police and searched – for no
      reason I could discern, other than an attempt by the police to provoke a violent
      reaction that would discredit the protest. This is the first of a two-part article.

    one_sentence_summary: Palestine Action, designated a terrorist organization by the
      British government for its protests against military support for Israel, is challenging
      this designation in court, as reported by former diplomat Craig Murray.
    paragraph_summary: Palestine Action, an activist group recently designated as a
      terrorist organization by the British government for its protests against military
      support for Israel, is challenging this designation in court. The group, co-founded
      by Huda Ammori, is seeking judicial review of the government's proscription order,
      with a hearing scheduled for July 21 to determine if the order should be suspended
      until the review takes place. The initial hearing on July 4 focused on whether
      interim relief should be granted, which hinges on the likelihood of success in
      the judicial review, the potential for irremediable harm if the order is not suspended,
      and the balance of convenience regarding the situation. The author, a former British
      diplomat, reports from the Royal Courts of Justice on this significant legal battle.

    text: 'President Of Ukraine, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons In one of the scariest moments
      in modern history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies
      that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider
      a tax-deductible donation . By Kit Klarenberg / Substack On July 5th , Bloomberg
      reported that a BlackRock-administered multibillion-dollar fund for Kiev’s reconstruction,
      due to be unveiled at a dedicated Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome July 10th/11th,
      had been placed on hold at the start of 2025 “due to a lack of interest” among
      institutional, private, and state financiers. The summit is over, lack of investor
      enthusiasm persists, and “the project’s future is now uncertain.” It’s just the
      latest confirmation the West’s long-running mission to carve up Ukraine for profit
      verges on total disintegration. BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund has been
      in the works since May 2023 . It was originally envisaged as one of the most ambitious
      public-private finance collaborations in history, which would rival Washington’s
      Marshall Plan that rebuilt – and heavily indebted – Western Europe in World War
      II’s wake. With vast returns promised, initially investors w ere reportedly “ready
      to plow funds” into the endeavour, due to widespread optimism Kiev’s much-hyped
      “counteroffensive” later that year “might end the war quickly.” In the event,
      the counteroffensive was an unmitigated disaster . Ukraine suffered up to 100,000
      casualties, with much of its arsenal of Western-supplied armour, vehicles and
      weapons obliterated, in return for recapturing just 0.25% of the territory occupied
      by Russia in the proxy war’s initial phases. As BlackRock vice chair Philipp Hildebrand
      explained , the results killed off investor exuberance, as they required “the
      cessation of hostilities, or at the very least a perspective for peace.” Concerns
      about Ukraine’s ever-reducing skilled workforce were also widespread. Fast forward
      to today, and there is no indication of any peace deal on the horizon, Russia
      is rapidly advancing across multiple fronts, and the Ukrainian government estimates
      the country has lost around 40% of its working-age population due to the proxy
      war. No wonder BlackRock’s Development Fund has failed to attract a single dollar.
      Quite what will remain of Ukraine when the conflict is over, and whether any financial
      returns can be gleaned from its ruins, are open, grave questions. The collapse
      of BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund is not only a microcosm of the impending,
      inevitable defeat of Kiev and its overseas puppetmasters in Donbass. It also reflects
      the death of the dream of breaking apart Ukraine’s industries and resources to
      untrammelled rape and pillage, long-held by Western corporations, oligarchs, and
      governments. Planning for this eventuality dates back to the country’s 1991 independence,
      producing concrete results following the 2014 Western-orchestrated Maidan coup,
      and becoming turbocharged once all-out proxy war erupted in February 2022. ‘Investment
      Climate’ From the start of 2013, Western corporations began moving en masse to
      buy up Ukraine wholesale. It was widely expected Kiev would that year enter into
      an “association agreement” with the EU, facilitating privatisation, and tearing
      up of longstanding laws restricting foreign purchase and ownership of the country’s
      untold agricultural riches. The former “breadbasket of the Soviet Union” is home
      to the equivalent of one third of the EU’s total arable land, and projected profits
      were voluminous. That January , Anglo-Dutch MI6-linked energy giant Shell signed
      a 50-year deal with the Ukrainian government to explore and drill for natural
      gas via fracking in areas of Donetsk and Kharkov “believed to hold substantial
      natural gas.” Then, in May, notorious , now-defunct chemical giant Monsanto announced
      plans to invest $140 million in constructing a corn seed plant in the country’s
      agricultural heartlands. The company was a founding member of the US-Ukraine Business
      Council, established in October 1995 to “improve” Kiev’s “investment climate.”
      USUBC’s treasurer was and remains David Kramer , who during Maidan also served
      as president of Freedom House, a National Endowment for Democracy division. NED
      was avowedly founded by the CIA to do publicly what the Agency historically did
      publicly. The Endowment and Freedom House were responsible for Ukraine’s 2004
      “Orange Revolution”, which brought pro-Western puppet Viktor Yushchenko to power.
      He immediately implemented deeply unpopular neoliberal economic reforms, including
      slashing regulations and social spending. Yushchenko was voted out in 2010, securing
      just 5% of the vote. Following Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s rejection
      of the EU association agreement in favour of a more advantageous deal offered
      by Russia in November 2013 , the mass Maidan protests in Kiev were ignited by
      NED-affiliated actors, and fascist agitators . They raged until late February
      2014, when Yanukovych fled the country. In the intervening time, Ukraine was plunged
      into total chaos – yet, firms associated with USUBC weren’t deterred. Many, including
      major companies with representatives on the organisation’s executive committee,
      continued making sizeable investments in Ukraine throughout. Their undimmed enthusiasm
      may be explained by David Kramer being an alumni of Project for the New American
      Century, a neoconservative think tank widely credited with masterminding the Bush
      administration’s “War on Terror”. The organisation’s cofounder Robert Kagan is
      married to Victoria Nuland, at this time the State Department’s point person on
      Ukraine. She visited Kiev repeatedly during the Maidan “revolution”, and hand-picked
      Yanukovych’s replacement interim government. Nuland was thus well-placed to know
      USUBC member investments in Ukraine would be safe long-term. ‘Trade Opportunities’
      Nuland’s fascist interim government was replaced in June 2014 by an administration
      led by far-right Petro Poroshenko, who stood on an explicit platform of privatising
      state industries. The President passed legislation enabling this in March 2016
      . Two years later, his government adopted sweeping laws to further facilitate
      the auctioning off of Kiev’s public assets and industry to foreign actors. However,
      a moratorium on private sale of arable land, imposed in 2001, remained in place.
      No matter – in August 2018 , the European Court of Human Rights ruled this was
      illegal. There was still one problem, though. Opinion polls consistently showed
      Ukrainian citizens overwhelmingly rejected privatisation, and the sale of their
      country’s agricultural land to overseas buyers. As luck would have it, the proxy
      war’s eruption, and imposition of martial law, allowed for industrial scale trampling
      by Volodomyr Zelensky’s government over public opinion, and political opposition.
      Throughout 2022 , a series of controversial laws intended to “make privatization
      as easy as possible for foreign investors” were passed without hindrance. In the
      process, close to 1,000 nationalised enterprises were offered up for overseas
      sale, and auctions for purchase of these entities “under simplified terms” convened.
      The next year, these efforts intensified , with further legislation enacted enabling
      “large-scale privatisation of state assets and state companies.” This was reportedly
      motivated by “the attractiveness” of Ukraine’s “large state assets to institutional
      investors.” They included an Odessa-based ammonia factory, major mining and chemical
      firms, one of the country’s leading power generators, and a producer of high-quality
      titanium products. Encouraged by the West’s reception to these moves, in July
      2024 Kiev announced a dedicated “Large-Scale Privatisation” plan, with yet more
      prize assets under the hammer. Little wonder two months later, a British Foreign
      Office briefing document openly acknowledged it viewed “the invasion not only
      as a crisis, but also as an opportunity.” London’s primary economic aid project
      in Ukraine is explicitly concerned with ensuring the country “adopts and implements
      economic reforms that create a more inclusive economy, enhancing trade opportunities
      with the UK.” The objectives of Britain’s “Good Governance Fund” in Ukraine The
      previous January , the World Economic Forum’s annual congress was convened in
      Davos, Switzerland. The proxy war, and Kiev’s economic future, loomed large on
      the event’s agenda. Its centrepiece was a breakout breakfast attended by political
      leaders and business bigwigs, where Zelensky appeared via videolink. The President
      thanked “giants of the international financial and investment world,” including
      BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan, for buying up his country’s assets during
      wartime. He boldly promised, “everyone can become a big business by working with
      Ukraine.” Subsequently , BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pledged to coordinate billions
      of dollars in reconstruction financing for Kiev, forecasting the country would
      become a “beacon of capitalism” resultantly. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs chief David
      Solomon spoke with intense optimism about Kiev’s post-war future, and the gains
      his firm and other major Western financial institutions would reap. “There is
      no question that as you rebuild, there will be good economic incentives for real
      return and real investment,” he crowed. Zelensky spoke at multiple events held
      in Davos over the five-day-long conference’s course, where pro-Kiev sentiment
      was reportedly “overwhelming”. The President spoke of recapturing Crimea, and
      demanded attendees “give us your weapons.” His audiences were invariably highly
      receptive. On one panel, Boris Johnson, who personally sabotaged fruitful peace
      talks between Kiev and Moscow in April 2022, urged Zelensky be provided “the tools
      he needs to finish the job.” The disgraced former British Prime Minister boomed
      , “Give them the tanks! There’s absolutely nothing to be lost!” In years to come,
      the January 2023 Davos summit may be viewed both as the high point of Ukraine’s
      proxy war effort, and roughly when everything began to spectacularly unravel.
      The desired weapons arrived in huge quantities, to no effect. Kiev’s three biggest
      military efforts since, all British-planned – that year’s counteroffensive , the
      Krynky incursion , and Kursk “counterinvasion” – were deeply costly cataclysms,
      leaving Ukraine undermanned and ill-equipped to fend off Russian advances. Countries
      that supplied munitions borderline disarmed themselves in the process. The Ukraine
      Recovery Conference passed without much media interest , despite a literal red
      carpet being rolled out for Zelensky, and multiple senior EU officials – including
      Ursula von der Leyen – and European state leaders attending. It ended with vague
      commitments to drum up €10 billion in private sector investments for Ukraine.
      Evidently, Western ambitions of making a mint out of Kiev haven’t been fully jettisoned
      – even if the World Bank calculates the total cost of rebuilding the country to
      be $524 billion. In a speech, von der Leyen pledged to support Ukraine “militarily,
      financially, and politically” for “as long as it takes.” Meanwhile, there is little
      indication that Britain has given up on making Kiev safe for neoliberalism and
      its own profit, despite London’s covert commitment to “keeping Ukraine fighting
      at all costs.” Of course, the longer the lost proxy war grinds on, the less Ukraine
      there will be to rebuild, and reap returns from. But apparently, this unambiguous
      reality is lost on the proxy war’s sponsors. God help us all. Editor’s Note :

      a tax-deductible donation . By Kit Klarenberg / Substack On July 5th , Bloomberg
      reported that a BlackRock-administered multibillion-dollar fund for Kiev’s reconstruction,
      due to be unveiled at a dedicated Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome July 10th/11th,
      had been placed on hold at the start of 2025 “due to a lack of interest” among
      institutional, private, and state financiers. The summit is over, lack of investor
      enthusiasm persists, and “the project’s future is now uncertain.” It’s just the
      latest confirmation the West’s long-running mission to carve up Ukraine for profit
      verges on total disintegration. BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund has been
      in the works since May 2023 . It was originally envisaged as one of the most ambitious
      public-private finance collaborations in history, which would rival Washington’s
      Marshall Plan that rebuilt – and heavily indebted – Western Europe in World War
      II’s wake. With vast returns promised, initially investors w ere reportedly “ready
      to plow funds” into the endeavour, due to widespread optimism Kiev’s much-hyped
      “counteroffensive” later that year “might end the war quickly.” In the event,
      the counteroffensive was an unmitigated disaster . Ukraine suffered up to 100,000
      casualties, with much of its arsenal of Western-supplied armour, vehicles and
      weapons obliterated, in return for recapturing just 0.25% of the territory occupied
      by Russia in the proxy war’s initial phases. As BlackRock vice chair Philipp Hildebrand
      explained , the results killed off investor exuberance, as they required “the
      cessation of hostilities, or at the very least a perspective for peace.” Concerns
      about Ukraine’s ever-reducing skilled workforce were also widespread. Fast forward
      to today, and there is no indication of any peace deal on the horizon, Russia
      is rapidly advancing across multiple fronts, and the Ukrainian government estimates
      the country has lost around 40% of its working-age population due to the proxy
      war. No wonder BlackRock’s Development Fund has failed to attract a single dollar.
      Quite what will remain of Ukraine when the conflict is over, and whether any financial
      returns can be gleaned from its ruins, are open, grave questions. The collapse
      of BlackRock’s Ukraine Development Fund is not only a microcosm of the impending,
      inevitable defeat of Kiev and its overseas puppetmasters in Donbass. It also reflects
      the death of the dream of breaking apart Ukraine’s industries and resources to
      untrammelled rape and pillage, long-held by Western corporations, oligarchs, and
      governments. Planning for this eventuality dates back to the country’s 1991 independence,
      producing concrete results following the 2014 Western-orchestrated Maidan coup,
      and becoming turbocharged once all-out proxy war erupted in February 2022. ‘Investment
      Climate’ From the start of 2013, Western corporations began moving en masse to
      buy up Ukraine wholesale. It was widely expected Kiev would that year enter into
      an “association agreement” with the EU, facilitating privatisation, and tearing
      up of longstanding laws restricting foreign purchase and ownership of the country’s
      untold agricultural riches. The former “breadbasket of the Soviet Union” is home
      to the equivalent of one third of the EU’s total arable land, and projected profits
      were voluminous. That January , Anglo-Dutch MI6-linked energy giant Shell signed
      a 50-year deal with the Ukrainian government to explore and drill for natural
      gas via fracking in areas of Donetsk and Kharkov “believed to hold substantial

      donation . By Juan Cole / Informed Comment Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – In an
      interview with Israel’s Channel 14, Minister of Energy Eli Cohen said that “Gaza
      must remain in ruins for decades to come” and that Israel will not help rebuild
      its civilian infrastructure. The Israeli army has damaged or destroyed some 90%
      of the Gaza Strip’s housing stock, as well as destroying most hospitals and all
      schools and universities, as well as water purification plants and other essential
      infrastructure, leaving over 2 million people to try to live in rubble. Note that
      Cohen is a member of the ruling right wing Likud Party headed by Prime Minister
      Benjamin Netanyahu rather than being from the extremist Religious Zionism bloc
      that is in coalition with the Likud. A former accountant and teacher of business
      at Tel Aviv University, Cohen has been listed among the top 100 most influential
      Israelis. Keeping millions of Palestinians in Gaza, half of them children, living
      in ruins for decades is not the sort of goal announced by sane, civilized, ordinary
      European politicians. At least, not since the 1930s. If a Likud Party stalwart
      like Cohen openly speaks like this, imagine what the Religious Zionism and Jewish
      Power cabinet members and members of parliament sound like. Also on Sunday, the
      Associated Press reports from an eyewitness, Ramadan Nassar, that some 14 adults
      brought 20 children to collect water from a distribution point in Nuseirat in
      central Gaza. As though out of nowhere, an Israeli missile struck them, killing
      six children and four adults. AP says that the Israeli military alleged that the
      strike was a technical error. There seem to be a lot of those, since over half
      of the 58,000 Palestinians Israel has killed since October 2023 have been women
      and children, and many of the rest were noncombatant men. Most water in Gaza is
      not potable, since Israel has deliberately destroyed water purification plants,
      and ground water is full of bacteria. Watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration
      and even death, is common in the Palestinian population of Gaza, including among
      vulnerable infants and children. Just as civilized politicians don’t talk about
      making millions of people live in rubble for decades, civilized militaries don’t
      have rules of engagement that allow for 20, or 50, or even 100 civilian deaths
      for every militant targeted. NATO is refusing to do joint military operations
      with Israel because of these unacceptable rules of engagement, which would get
      any NATO officer court-martialed who tried to implement them. In addition, Palestinian
      media sources reported that Israeli airstrikes and attacks left 95 people dead
      on Sunday, 52 of them in Gaza City. On Monday, UNICEF announced that it recorded
      5,800 cases of malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip during the month
      of June, as IMEMC reports : “The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) announced
      Sunday that more than 5,800 children in the Gaza Strip were diagnosed with malnutrition
      during the month of June, amid the ongoing genocide in Gaza and an 18-year blockade.
      UNICEF reported that over 1,000 of these children are suffering from severe acute
      malnutrition, warning that this marks the fourth consecutive month of rising cases.

      donation . By Juan Cole / Informed Comment Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – In an
      interview with Israel’s Channel 14, Minister of Energy Eli Cohen said that “Gaza
      must remain in ruins for decades to come” and that Israel will not help rebuild
      its civilian infrastructure. The Israeli army has damaged or destroyed some 90%
      of the Gaza Strip’s housing stock, as well as destroying most hospitals and all
      schools and universities, as well as water purification plants and other essential
      infrastructure, leaving over 2 million people to try to live in rubble. Note that
      Cohen is a member of the ruling right wing Likud Party headed by Prime Minister
      Benjamin Netanyahu rather than being from the extremist Religious Zionism bloc
      that is in coalition with the Likud. A former accountant and teacher of business
      at Tel Aviv University, Cohen has been listed among the top 100 most influential
      Israelis. Keeping millions of Palestinians in Gaza, half of them children, living
      in ruins for decades is not the sort of goal announced by sane, civilized, ordinary
      European politicians. At least, not since the 1930s. If a Likud Party stalwart
      like Cohen openly speaks like this, imagine what the Religious Zionism and Jewish
      Power cabinet members and members of parliament sound like. Also on Sunday, the
      Associated Press reports from an eyewitness, Ramadan Nassar, that some 14 adults
      brought 20 children to collect water from a distribution point in Nuseirat in
      central Gaza. As though out of nowhere, an Israeli missile struck them, killing
      six children and four adults. AP says that the Israeli military alleged that the
      strike was a technical error. There seem to be a lot of those, since over half
      of the 58,000 Palestinians Israel has killed since October 2023 have been women
      and children, and many of the rest were noncombatant men. Most water in Gaza is
      not potable, since Israel has deliberately destroyed water purification plants,
      and ground water is full of bacteria. Watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration
      and even death, is common in the Palestinian population of Gaza, including among
      vulnerable infants and children. Just as civilized politicians don’t talk about
      making millions of people live in rubble for decades, civilized militaries don’t
      have rules of engagement that allow for 20, or 50, or even 100 civilian deaths
      for every militant targeted. NATO is refusing to do joint military operations
      with Israel because of these unacceptable rules of engagement, which would get
      any NATO officer court-martialed who tried to implement them. In addition, Palestinian
      media sources reported that Israeli airstrikes and attacks left 95 people dead
      on Sunday, 52 of them in Gaza City. On Monday, UNICEF announced that it recorded
      5,800 cases of malnutrition among children in the Gaza Strip during the month
      of June, as IMEMC reports : “The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) announced
      Sunday that more than 5,800 children in the Gaza Strip were diagnosed with malnutrition
      during the month of June, amid the ongoing genocide in Gaza and an 18-year blockade.
      UNICEF reported that over 1,000 of these children are suffering from severe acute
      malnutrition, warning that this marks the fourth consecutive month of rising cases.
      UNICEF stressed that the catastrophic conditions in Gaza demand urgent and large-scale
      humanitarian aid, cautioning that children are facing escalating threats to their
      survival due to a widespread famine that has already claimed numerous lives, particularly
      among children, because of what it described as a campaign of extermination involving

      of parts of southwest Syria. The talks were said to include proposals to give
      Syria substantial parts of northern Lebanon, including the major city of Tripoli,

      with the caveat of it not being about the prisoners. With Syria eagerly cozying

      to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers
      and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Luca Goldmansour / Fairness
      and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) A FAIR study found that CNN ’s primetime coverage
      of the Los Angeles anti-ICE protests in early June rarely included the voices
      of the protesters themselves. Instead, the network’s sources were overwhelmingly
      current and former government and law enforcement officials. The resulting coverage
      rarely took issue with Trump’s desire to silence the people who were defending
      their undocumented neighbors—but mainly debated his decision to deploy the California
      National Guard to do so. FAIR recorded the sources that appeared in the 5–10 pm
      timeslot during two key days, June 9 and 10, of CNN ’s television coverage of
      the Los Angeles protests; the shows included were the Lead with Jake Tapper ,
      Erin Burnett OutFront , Anderson Cooper 360 and the Source With Kaitlan Collins
      . The sources were categorized by current or former occupation, and on whether
      they were a featured guest—who typically field multiple interview-style questions
      from an anchor—or simply a soundbite. Sources that made multiple appearances were
      counted once for each segment they appeared in. ( CNN ’s in-house “analysts” or
      “commentators” were counted as featured guests to reflect their significant impact
      on the perspectives shared on the shows.) Out of 85 total sources across the eight
      broadcasts, only five were protesters, appearing on just three shows. None of
      the 47 featured guests were protesters or community or immigrant advocates. By
      far the most frequent sources were current or former US government officials,
      with 55 appearances—a whopping 65% of total sources. Thirteen additional sources
      were law enforcement, and five were current or former military. Together, these
      official sources accounted for 86% of all appearances. (There were also three
      journalists, two lawyers and two partisan strategists.) Of featured guest and
      analyst interviews, current or former government officials dominated at 49% (23
      out of 47). These sources were given the most time to present their perspectives,
      shaping the narrative around the protests and the government responses. Another
      11 featured guests were law enforcement and two were military, so official sources
      accounted for 77% of all such interviews. The three journalists, two lawyers and
      two partisan strategists made up the remaining featured guests. ‘Verbally at least
      hostile’ CNN ’s made-for-TV, on-the-ground style of protest coverage in the days
      following the Ambiance Apparel and Home Depot ICE raids felt little different
      from when Anderson Cooper stands around in a raincoat during a hurricane. Only
      this time, CNN reporters were braving an uncontrollable storm of Angelenos. Much
      like Cooper’s coat, CNN senior investigative correspondent Kyung Lah ( Erin Burnett
      OutFront , 6/9/25 ) donned protective goggles—useful should she have encountered
      tear gas, but also undoubtedly a dramatic flourish perfect for one of CNN ’s 30-second
      TV spots. That CNN was primarily interested in drama rather than helping viewers
      understand the protests became abundantly clear as—even with her protective goggles—Lah
      made no apparent effort to interview any protesters as she and CNN anchor Erin
      Burnett stood in front of LA’s federal detention center, where federal agents,
      LAPD and the California National Guard were in a standoff with demonstrators.
      Instead, they kept a close eye on every thrown water bottle, expressing concern
      about the crowd’s increasingly “young” demographic as the day went on. “This is
      a much younger crowd, certainly, verbally at least, Erin, hostile,” Lah reported.
      The only protest voices that CNN ’s audience heard from throughout both days of
      primetime coverage came in the form of two brief soundbites captured by correspondent
      Jason Carroll ( Lead , 6/9/25 ) at a protest for the release of arrested SEIU
      leader David Huerta the morning of June 9. Araceli Martinez, the only protester
      identified by name, offered a call to action for all Americans, arguing that the
      Trump administration’s immigration raids are a threat to “the rights of all people,
      not just the immigrants, but all of us.” That soundbite reaired on Erin Burnett
      Outfront and Anderson Cooper 360 , both on June 9. Another protester at the demonstration
      demanding Huerta’s release had this to say, with the soundbite reairing on Anderson
      Cooper 360 , also on June 9: We are part of that immigrant community that has
      made L.A. great, that has made the state of California the fourth largest economy
      in the world today. So, we have a message for President Donald Trump. Get the
      National Guardsmen out of here. Multiple times during the first day studied, Lah
      held up that union-led protest as a standard of message discipline and nonviolent
      tactics that those outside the federal building, later in the day, weren’t measuring
      up to. The folks at the earlier protest were “a very different slice of Los Angeles
      than what I am seeing” at the federal building, Lah said. The key word there is
      “seeing,” as she did not interview a single protester on camera. ‘We do very good
      here with unrest’ Meanwhile, CNN brought on multiple featured guests who framed
      protesters as violent and law enforcement as the ones pushing for accountability—despite
      the fact that reported injuries of civilians by law enforcement far outnumbered
      those of law enforcement by protesters ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ). LA District Attorney
      Nathan Hochman ( OutFront , 6/10/25 ), for example, stated that he would work
      to “punish” all protesters who engage in “illegal conduct.” Similarly, California
      Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis ( Source , 6/10/25 ) warned “anyone who goes out and
      is protesting in a way that is not peaceful…state and local and regional law enforcement
      will hold people accountable.” Rep. Adam Smith told Jake Tapper ( Lead , 6/10/25
      ): “I don’t disagree that you should meet any sort of violent protest with law
      enforcement, but there’s no evidence in this case that the LAPD wasn’t doing that.”
      Once you parse the double negatives, it’s clear that Smith, like the rest of CNN
      ‘s official sources, accepted the characterization of protesters as violent and
      argued that the response of California law enforcement was perfectly appropriate.
      Most of these state and local government sources were responding to questions
      about Trump calling in the National Guard and Marines; they were defending the
      local law enforcement response and challenging Trump’s decision. One of Burnett’s
      featured guests, for instance, was LA County Sheriff Robert Luna ( OutFront ,
      6/9/25)—the leader of a police force that community activists say routinely collaborates
      with federal immigration raids ( Democracy Now! , 6/9/25 ), and had just sparred
      with demonstrators in the Home Depot parking lot in Compton following the failed
      ICE raid there ( New York Times , 6/14/25 ). The primary focus of Burnett’s line
      of questioning was geared at exposing the political nature of Trump’s calling
      in the national guard: Just a very simple question. Do you need the Marines? Do
      you need the National Guard right now? Or if you were looking at this situation
      and assessing it as sheriff of LA County, would you say you do not need them?
      That’s certainly a critical line of questioning to get at the issue of federal
      overreach. But Burnett failed to similarly question (or even acknowledge) the
      violence by local law enforcement—which, by the time of Burnett’s broadcast, included
      24 attacks on journalists with weapons like pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear
      gas canisters, according to Reporters Without Borders ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ).
      Instead, she left unchallenged Luna’s claims that “if they’re peacefully protesting,
      they’ll be allowed to do that,” that his utmost priority was “keeping our community
      safe,” and that his police force does “very good here with unrest.” In doing so,
      Burnett framed the story as a question of whether putting down protests against
      sweeping raids of undocumented workers was the responsibility of federal troops
      or local law enforcement—rather than questioning why such protests were being
      met with force, and why local officials weren’t doing more to protect their immigrant
      communities. Redefining safety Meanwhile, the protesters that received such little
      consideration from Burnett and CNN could have contributed to a very different
      definition of safety for CNN ’s viewers. Ron Gochez, a community organizer and
      social studies teacher, who was one of the protesters at the ICE raid on Ambiance
      Apparel, described on Democracy Now! ( 6/9/25 ) how the protests have managed
      to protect people despite the efforts of local and federal officials: When we
      have these protests, they have been peaceful. But when the repression comes from
      the state, whether it’s the sheriffs, the LAPD or, on Saturday, for example, in
      Paramount, California, it was the Border Patrol, it was brutal violence…. But
      what they didn’t think was going to happen was that the people would resist and
      would fight back. And that’s exactly what happened in Paramount and in Compton,
      California, where for eight-and-a-half hours, the people combatted in the streets
      against the Border Patrol…. They had to retreat because of the fierce resistance
      of the community. And the hundreds of workers that were in the factories around
      them were able to escape. They were able to go to their cars and go home. That
      was only thanks to the resistance that allowed them to go home that night. The
      Trump administration is intent on testing just how far it can go to crush political
      dissent, and it’s clear most Democratic politicians and local law enforcement
      are not going to bat for the most vulnerable communities in its crosshairs. Angelenos
      know they are fighting for the rights of all of us who reside in the US. But CNN
      ’s refusal to have them on air to discuss their struggle and explain their tactics
      makes it all the more difficult to raise public awareness. Pretending to challenge
      the deployment of federal troops, CNN normalizes police violence and silences
      those truly protecting their communities. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

      and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) A FAIR study found that CNN ’s primetime coverage
      of the Los Angeles anti-ICE protests in early June rarely included the voices
      of the protesters themselves. Instead, the network’s sources were overwhelmingly
      current and former government and law enforcement officials. The resulting coverage
      rarely took issue with Trump’s desire to silence the people who were defending
      their undocumented neighbors—but mainly debated his decision to deploy the California
      National Guard to do so. FAIR recorded the sources that appeared in the 5–10 pm
      timeslot during two key days, June 9 and 10, of CNN ’s television coverage of
      the Los Angeles protests; the shows included were the Lead with Jake Tapper ,
      Erin Burnett OutFront , Anderson Cooper 360 and the Source With Kaitlan Collins
      . The sources were categorized by current or former occupation, and on whether
      they were a featured guest—who typically field multiple interview-style questions
      from an anchor—or simply a soundbite. Sources that made multiple appearances were
      counted once for each segment they appeared in. ( CNN ’s in-house “analysts” or
      “commentators” were counted as featured guests to reflect their significant impact
      on the perspectives shared on the shows.) Out of 85 total sources across the eight
      broadcasts, only five were protesters, appearing on just three shows. None of
      the 47 featured guests were protesters or community or immigrant advocates. By
      far the most frequent sources were current or former US government officials,
      with 55 appearances—a whopping 65% of total sources. Thirteen additional sources
      were law enforcement, and five were current or former military. Together, these
      official sources accounted for 86% of all appearances. (There were also three
      journalists, two lawyers and two partisan strategists.) Of featured guest and
      analyst interviews, current or former government officials dominated at 49% (23
      out of 47). These sources were given the most time to present their perspectives,
      shaping the narrative around the protests and the government responses. Another
      11 featured guests were law enforcement and two were military, so official sources
      accounted for 77% of all such interviews. The three journalists, two lawyers and
      two partisan strategists made up the remaining featured guests. ‘Verbally at least
      hostile’ CNN ’s made-for-TV, on-the-ground style of protest coverage in the days
      following the Ambiance Apparel and Home Depot ICE raids felt little different
      from when Anderson Cooper stands around in a raincoat during a hurricane. Only
      this time, CNN reporters were braving an uncontrollable storm of Angelenos. Much
      like Cooper’s coat, CNN senior investigative correspondent Kyung Lah ( Erin Burnett
      OutFront , 6/9/25 ) donned protective goggles—useful should she have encountered
      tear gas, but also undoubtedly a dramatic flourish perfect for one of CNN ’s 30-second
      TV spots. That CNN was primarily interested in drama rather than helping viewers
      understand the protests became abundantly clear as—even with her protective goggles—Lah
      made no apparent effort to interview any protesters as she and CNN anchor Erin
      Burnett stood in front of LA’s federal detention center, where federal agents,
      LAPD and the California National Guard were in a standoff with demonstrators.
      Instead, they kept a close eye on every thrown water bottle, expressing concern
      about the crowd’s increasingly “young” demographic as the day went on. “This is
      a much younger crowd, certainly, verbally at least, Erin, hostile,” Lah reported.
      The only protest voices that CNN ’s audience heard from throughout both days of
      primetime coverage came in the form of two brief soundbites captured by correspondent
      Jason Carroll ( Lead , 6/9/25 ) at a protest for the release of arrested SEIU
      leader David Huerta the morning of June 9. Araceli Martinez, the only protester
      identified by name, offered a call to action for all Americans, arguing that the
      Trump administration’s immigration raids are a threat to “the rights of all people,
      not just the immigrants, but all of us.” That soundbite reaired on Erin Burnett
      Outfront and Anderson Cooper 360 , both on June 9. Another protester at the demonstration
      demanding Huerta’s release had this to say, with the soundbite reairing on Anderson
      Cooper 360 , also on June 9: We are part of that immigrant community that has
      made L.A. great, that has made the state of California the fourth largest economy
      in the world today. So, we have a message for President Donald Trump. Get the
      National Guardsmen out of here. Multiple times during the first day studied, Lah
      held up that union-led protest as a standard of message discipline and nonviolent
      tactics that those outside the federal building, later in the day, weren’t measuring
      up to. The folks at the earlier protest were “a very different slice of Los Angeles
      than what I am seeing” at the federal building, Lah said. The key word there is
      “seeing,” as she did not interview a single protester on camera. ‘We do very good
      here with unrest’ Meanwhile, CNN brought on multiple featured guests who framed
      protesters as violent and law enforcement as the ones pushing for accountability—despite
      the fact that reported injuries of civilians by law enforcement far outnumbered
      those of law enforcement by protesters ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ). LA District Attorney
      Nathan Hochman ( OutFront , 6/10/25 ), for example, stated that he would work
      to “punish” all protesters who engage in “illegal conduct.” Similarly, California
      Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis ( Source , 6/10/25 ) warned “anyone who goes out and
      is protesting in a way that is not peaceful…state and local and regional law enforcement
      will hold people accountable.” Rep. Adam Smith told Jake Tapper ( Lead , 6/10/25
      ): “I don’t disagree that you should meet any sort of violent protest with law
      enforcement, but there’s no evidence in this case that the LAPD wasn’t doing that.”
      Once you parse the double negatives, it’s clear that Smith, like the rest of CNN
      ‘s official sources, accepted the characterization of protesters as violent and
      argued that the response of California law enforcement was perfectly appropriate.
      Most of these state and local government sources were responding to questions
      about Trump calling in the National Guard and Marines; they were defending the
      local law enforcement response and challenging Trump’s decision. One of Burnett’s
      featured guests, for instance, was LA County Sheriff Robert Luna ( OutFront ,
      6/9/25)—the leader of a police force that community activists say routinely collaborates
      with federal immigration raids ( Democracy Now! , 6/9/25 ), and had just sparred
      with demonstrators in the Home Depot parking lot in Compton following the failed
      ICE raid there ( New York Times , 6/14/25 ). The primary focus of Burnett’s line
      of questioning was geared at exposing the political nature of Trump’s calling
      in the national guard: Just a very simple question. Do you need the Marines? Do
      you need the National Guard right now? Or if you were looking at this situation
      and assessing it as sheriff of LA County, would you say you do not need them?
      That’s certainly a critical line of questioning to get at the issue of federal
      overreach. But Burnett failed to similarly question (or even acknowledge) the
      violence by local law enforcement—which, by the time of Burnett’s broadcast, included
      24 attacks on journalists with weapons like pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear
      gas canisters, according to Reporters Without Borders ( FAIR.org , 6/13/25 ).
      Instead, she left unchallenged Luna’s claims that “if they’re peacefully protesting,
      they’ll be allowed to do that,” that his utmost priority was “keeping our community
      safe,” and that his police force does “very good here with unrest.” In doing so,
      Burnett framed the story as a question of whether putting down protests against
      sweeping raids of undocumented workers was the responsibility of federal troops
      or local law enforcement—rather than questioning why such protests were being
      met with force, and why local officials weren’t doing more to protect their immigrant
      communities. Redefining safety Meanwhile, the protesters that received such little

      history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal
      it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost The refusal by the Trump administration
      to release the files and videos amassed during investigations into the activities
      of the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, should put to rest the absurd idea, embraced
      by Trump supporters and gullible liberals, that Trump will dismantle the Deep
      State. Trump is part of , and has long been part of, the repugnant cabal of politicians
      – Democrat and Republican – billionaires and celebrities who look at us, and often
      underage girls and boys, as commodities to exploit for profit or pleasure. The
      list of those who were in Epstein’s orbit is a who’s who of the rich and famous.
      They include not only Trump , but Bill Clinton , who allegedly took a trip to
      Thailand with Epstein, Prince Andrew , Bill Gates , hedge fund billionaire Glenn
      Dubin , former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , former Secretary of the Treasury
      and former president of Harvard University Larry Summers , cognitive psychologist
      and author Stephen Pinker , Alan Dershowitz , billionaire and Victoria’s Secret
      CEO Leslie Wexner , the former Barclays banker Jes Staley , former Israeli prime
      minister Ehud Barak , the magician David Copperfield , actor Kevin Spacey , former
      CIA director Bill Burns , real estate mogul Mort Zuckerman , former Maine senator
      George Mitchell and disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , who reveled
      in Epstein’s perpetual Bacchanalia . They also include law firms and high-priced
      attorneys, federal and state prosecutors, private investigators, personal assistants,
      publicists, servants and drivers. They include the numerous procurers and pimps,
      including Epstein’s girlfriend and daughter of Robert Maxwell , Ghislaine Maxwell.
      They include the media and politicians who ruthlessly discredited and silenced
      the victims, and strong armed anyone, including a handful of intrepid reporters,
      seeking to expose Epstein’s crimes and circle of accomplices. There is a lot that
      remains hidden. But there are some things we know. Epstein installed hidden cameras
      in his opulent residences and on his private Caribbean island, Little St. James,
      to capture his high-powered friends engaging in sexual romps and abuse of teenage
      and underage girls and boys. The recordings were blackmail gold. Were they part
      of an intelligence operation on behalf of the Israeli Mossad ? Or were they used
      to ensure that Epstein had a steady source of investors who funneled him millions
      of dollars to avoid being outed? Or were they used for both? He shuttled underage
      girls between New York and Palm Beach on his private jet the Lolita Express ,
      which was allegedly outfitted with a bed for group sex. His coterie of famous
      friends, including Clinton and Trump , are recorded as traveling on the jet numerous
      times on released flight logs, although many other flight logs have disappeared.
      Epstein’s videos are in the vaults of the FBI, along with detailed evidence that
      would rip back the veil on the sexual proclivities and callousness of the powerful.
      I doubt there is a client list, as Attorney General Pam Bondi claims. There is
      also no single Epstein file. The investigative material amassed on Epstein fills
      many, many boxes, which would bury Bondi’s desk and probably, if collected in
      one room, dominate most of the space in her office. Did Epstein commit suicide,
      as the official autopsy report claims, by hanging himself in his jail cell on
      August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City? Or was
      he murdered? Since the cameras recording activity in his cell the night were not
      functional, we do not know. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein’s
      brother, who served as the chief medical examiner for New York City and who was
      present at the autopsy, said he believes Epstein’s autopsy suggests homicide .
      The Epstein case is important because it implodes the fiction of deep divisions
      between Democrats, who had no more interest in releasing the Epstein files than
      Trump, and the Republicans. They belong to the same club. It exposes how the courts
      and law enforcement agencies collude to shield powerful figures who engage in
      crimes. It lays bare the depravity of our exhibitionist ruling class, accountable
      to no one, free to violate, plunder, loot and prey on the weak and the vulnerable.
      It is the tawdry record of our oligarchic masters, those who lack the capacity
      for shame or guilt, whether dressed up as Donald Trump or Joe Biden. This class
      of ruling parasites was parodied in the first-century satirical novel “ Satyricon
      ” by Gaius Petronius Arbiter , written during the reigns of Caligula, Claudius,
      and Nero. As in Satyricon, Epstein’s circle was dominated by pseudointellectuals,
      pretentious buffoons, grifters, con artists, petty criminals, the insatiable rich
      and the sexually depraved. Epstein and his inner circle routinely engaged in sexual
      perversions of Petronian proportions, as The Miami Herald investigative reporter
      Julie Brown, whose dogged reporting was largely responsible for reopening the
      federal investigation in Epstein and Maxwell, documents in her book “ Perversion
      of Justice: The Jeffrey Epstein Story .” As Brown writes, in 2016 an anonymous
      woman, using the pseudonym “Kate Johnson,” filed a civil complaint in a federal
      court in California alleging she was raped by Trump and Epstein when she was thirteen,
      over a four-month period, from June to September 1994. “I loudly pleaded with
      Trump to stop,” she said in the lawsuit about being raped. “Trump responded to
      my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming
      that he could do whatever he wanted.” Brown continues: Johnson said that Epstein
      invited her to a series of ‘underage sex parties’ at his New York mansion where
      she met Trump. Enticed by promises of money and modeling opportunities, Johnson
      said she was forced to have sex with Trump several times, including once with
      another girl, twelve years old, whom she labeled ‘Marie Doe.’ Trump demanded oral
      sex, the lawsuit said, and afterward he “pushed both minors away while angrily
      berating them for the ‘poor’ quality of the sexual performance,” according to
      the lawsuit, filed April 26 in U.S. District Court in Central California. Afterward,
      when Epstein learned that Trump had taken Johnson’s virginity, Epstein allegedly
      ‘attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists,’ angry he had not
      been the one to take her virginity. Johnson claimed that both men threatened to
      harm her, and her family if she ever revealed what had happened. The lawsuit states
      that Trump did not take part in Epstein’s orgies but liked to watch, often while
      the thirteen-year-old “Kate Johnson” gave him a hand job. It appears Trump was
      able to quash the lawsuit by buying her silence. She has since disappeared. In
      2008, Alex Acosta, who at the time was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
      of Florida, negotiated a plea deal for Epstein. The deal granted immunity from
      all federal criminal charges to Epstein, four named co-conspirators and any unnamed
      “potential co-conspirators.” The agreement shut down the FBI probe into whether
      there were more victims and other powerful figures who took part in Epstein’s
      sex crimes. It halted the investigation and sealed the indictment. Trump, in what
      many consider an act of gratitude, appointed Acosta as Secretary of Labor in his
      first term. Trump contemplated pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell after she was arrested
      in July 2020, fearing she would reveal details of his decades-long friendship
      with Epstein, according to Trump biographer Michael Wolff. In July 2022, Maxwell
      was sentenced to 20 years in prison. “Jeffrey Epstein’s closest relationship in
      life was with Donald Trump…these were two guys joined at the hip for a good 15
      years. They did everything together,” Wolff told host Joanna Coles on The Daily
      Beast Podcast. “And this is from sharing, pursuing women, hunting women, sharing
      at least one girlfriend for at least a year in this kind of rich-guy relationship
      with each other’s planes, to Epstein advising Trump on how to cheat on his taxes.”
      The legal anomalies, including the disappearance of massive amounts of evidence
      incriminating Epstein, saw Epstein avoid federal sex-trafficking charges in 2007,
      when his attorneys negotiated the secret plea deal with Acosta. He was able to
      plead guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. The
      prominent men accused of engaging in Epstein’s carnival of pedophilia, including
      Epstein’s attorney Dershowitz, viciously threaten anyone who seeks to expose them.
      Dershowitz, for example, claims that an investigation which he has refused to
      make public, by the former FBI director Louis Freeh, proves he had never had sex
      with Epstein’s victim Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked at 17 to Prince Andrew.
      Giuffre, one of the few victims to publicly take on her abusers, said she was
      “passed around like a platter of fruit” among Epstein and Maxwell’s friends, until
      at the age of 19 when she escaped. She “ committed suicide ” in April 2025. Dershowitz
      has sent repeated threats to Brown and her editors at The Miami Herald. Brown
      continues: [Dershowitz] kept referring to information that was contained in sealed
      documents. He accused the newspaper of not reporting “facts” that he said were
      in those sealed documents. The truth is, I tried to explain, newspapers just can’t
      write about things because Alan Dershowitz says they exist. We need to see them.
      We need to verify them. Then, because I said “show me the material,” he publicly
      accused me of committing a criminal act by asking him to produce documents that
      were under court seal. This is the way Dershowitz operates. What disturbs me the
      most about Dershowitz is the way that the media, with few exceptions, fails to
      critically challenge him. Journalists fact-checked Donald Trump and others in
      his administration almost every day, yet, for the most part, the media seems to
      give Dershowitz a pass on the Epstein story. In 2015, when Giuffre’s allegations
      first became public, Dershowitz went on every television program imaginable swearing,
      among other things, that Epstein’s plane logs would exonerate him. “How do you
      know that?” he was asked. He replied that he was never on Epstein’s plane during
      the time that Virginia was involved with Epstein. But if the media had checked,
      they could have learned that he was indeed a passenger on the plane during that
      time period, according to the logs. Then he testified, in a sworn deposition,
      that he never went on any plane trips without his wife. But he was listed on those
      passage manifests as traveling multiple times without his wife. During at least
      one trip, he was on the plane with a model named Tatiana. Epstein donated money
      to Harvard and was made a visiting fellow in Harvard’s Department of Psychology,
      although he had no academic qualifications in the field. He was given a key card
      and pass code, as well as an office in the building that housed Harvard’s Program
      for Evolutionary Dynamics. He referred to himself in his press releases as “Science
      Philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Education activist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Evolutionary
      Jeffrey Epstein,” “Science patron Jeffrey Epstein” and “Maverick hedge funder
      Jeffrey Epstein.” Epstein, replicating the pretensions and vacuity of the characters
      who were parodied in the “Dinner with Trimalchio” chapter of Satyricon, organized
      elaborate dinner gatherings for his billionaire friends, including Elon Musk,
      Salar Kamangar and Jeff Bezos. He dreamed up bizarre schemes of social engineering,
      including a plan to seed the human species with his own DNA by creating a baby
      compound at his sprawling ranch in New Mexico. “Epstein was also obsessed with
      cryonics, the transhumanist philosophy whose followers believe that people can
      be replicated or brought back to life after they are frozen,” Brown writes. “Epstein
      apparently told some of the members of his scientific circle that he wanted to
      inseminate women with his sperm for them to give birth to his babies, and that
      he wanted his head and his penis frozen .” The Epstein story is a window into
      the moral bankruptcy, hedonism and greed of the ruling class. This crosses political
      lines. It is the common denominator between Democratic politicians, such as Bill
      Clinton, philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, the billionaire class, and Trump.
      They are one class of predators and grifters. It is not only girls and women they
      exploit, but all of us. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is

    one_sentence_summary: Chris Hedges argues that the Trump administration's refusal
      to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein reveals Trump's complicity in a corrupt
      elite network that exploits vulnerable individuals, challenging the notion that
      he would dismantle the so-called Deep State.
    paragraph_summary: In his article "American Satyricon," Chris Hedges critiques the
      Trump administration's refusal to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein's activities,
      arguing that this refusal undermines the notion that Trump is an adversary of
      the so-called Deep State. Hedges contends that Trump is intertwined with a network
      of powerful figures—including politicians, billionaires, and celebrities—who exploit
      vulnerable individuals, particularly minors, for their own gain. He highlights
      the extensive connections of Epstein, listing numerous prominent individuals from
      various sectors, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and celebrities like Kevin
      Spacey, who have been linked to Epstein's illicit activities. Hedges calls attention
      to the pervasive culture of exploitation and complicity among the elite, suggesting
      that the systemic issues surrounding Epstein's case reflect a broader moral decay
      in society.

    text: 'American Satyricon – by Mr. Fish In one of the scariest moments in modern
      history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal
      it but we need some help to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible
      donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost The refusal by the Trump administration
      to release the files and videos amassed during investigations into the activities
      of the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, should put to rest the absurd idea, embraced
      by Trump supporters and gullible liberals, that Trump will dismantle the Deep
      State. Trump is part of , and has long been part of, the repugnant cabal of politicians
      – Democrat and Republican – billionaires and celebrities who look at us, and often
      underage girls and boys, as commodities to exploit for profit or pleasure. The
      list of those who were in Epstein’s orbit is a who’s who of the rich and famous.
      They include not only Trump , but Bill Clinton , who allegedly took a trip to
      Thailand with Epstein, Prince Andrew , Bill Gates , hedge fund billionaire Glenn
      Dubin , former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , former Secretary of the Treasury
      and former president of Harvard University Larry Summers , cognitive psychologist
      and author Stephen Pinker , Alan Dershowitz , billionaire and Victoria’s Secret
      CEO Leslie Wexner , the former Barclays banker Jes Staley , former Israeli prime
      minister Ehud Barak , the magician David Copperfield , actor Kevin Spacey , former
      CIA director Bill Burns , real estate mogul Mort Zuckerman , former Maine senator
      George Mitchell and disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , who reveled
      in Epstein’s perpetual Bacchanalia . They also include law firms and high-priced
      attorneys, federal and state prosecutors, private investigators, personal assistants,
      publicists, servants and drivers. They include the numerous procurers and pimps,
      including Epstein’s girlfriend and daughter of Robert Maxwell , Ghislaine Maxwell.
      They include the media and politicians who ruthlessly discredited and silenced
      the victims, and strong armed anyone, including a handful of intrepid reporters,
      seeking to expose Epstein’s crimes and circle of accomplices. There is a lot that
      remains hidden. But there are some things we know. Epstein installed hidden cameras
      in his opulent residences and on his private Caribbean island, Little St. James,
      to capture his high-powered friends engaging in sexual romps and abuse of teenage
      and underage girls and boys. The recordings were blackmail gold. Were they part
      of an intelligence operation on behalf of the Israeli Mossad ? Or were they used
      to ensure that Epstein had a steady source of investors who funneled him millions
      of dollars to avoid being outed? Or were they used for both? He shuttled underage
      girls between New York and Palm Beach on his private jet the Lolita Express ,
      which was allegedly outfitted with a bed for group sex. His coterie of famous
      friends, including Clinton and Trump , are recorded as traveling on the jet numerous
      times on released flight logs, although many other flight logs have disappeared.
      Epstein’s videos are in the vaults of the FBI, along with detailed evidence that
      would rip back the veil on the sexual proclivities and callousness of the powerful.
      I doubt there is a client list, as Attorney General Pam Bondi claims. There is
      also no single Epstein file. The investigative material amassed on Epstein fills
      many, many boxes, which would bury Bondi’s desk and probably, if collected in
      one room, dominate most of the space in her office. Did Epstein commit suicide,
      as the official autopsy report claims, by hanging himself in his jail cell on
      August 10, 2019 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City? Or was
      he murdered? Since the cameras recording activity in his cell the night were not
      functional, we do not know. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist hired by Epstein’s
      brother, who served as the chief medical examiner for New York City and who was
      present at the autopsy, said he believes Epstein’s autopsy suggests homicide .
      The Epstein case is important because it implodes the fiction of deep divisions
      between Democrats, who had no more interest in releasing the Epstein files than
      Trump, and the Republicans. They belong to the same club. It exposes how the courts
      and law enforcement agencies collude to shield powerful figures who engage in
      crimes. It lays bare the depravity of our exhibitionist ruling class, accountable
      to no one, free to violate, plunder, loot and prey on the weak and the vulnerable.
      It is the tawdry record of our oligarchic masters, those who lack the capacity
      for shame or guilt, whether dressed up as Donald Trump or Joe Biden. This class
      of ruling parasites was parodied in the first-century satirical novel “ Satyricon
      ” by Gaius Petronius Arbiter , written during the reigns of Caligula, Claudius,
      and Nero. As in Satyricon, Epstein’s circle was dominated by pseudointellectuals,
      pretentious buffoons, grifters, con artists, petty criminals, the insatiable rich
      and the sexually depraved. Epstein and his inner circle routinely engaged in sexual
      perversions of Petronian proportions, as The Miami Herald investigative reporter
      Julie Brown, whose dogged reporting was largely responsible for reopening the
      federal investigation in Epstein and Maxwell, documents in her book “ Perversion
      of Justice: The Jeffrey Epstein Story .” As Brown writes, in 2016 an anonymous
      woman, using the pseudonym “Kate Johnson,” filed a civil complaint in a federal
      court in California alleging she was raped by Trump and Epstein when she was thirteen,
      over a four-month period, from June to September 1994. “I loudly pleaded with
      Trump to stop,” she said in the lawsuit about being raped. “Trump responded to
      my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming
      that he could do whatever he wanted.” Brown continues: Johnson said that Epstein
      invited her to a series of ‘underage sex parties’ at his New York mansion where
      she met Trump. Enticed by promises of money and modeling opportunities, Johnson
      said she was forced to have sex with Trump several times, including once with
      another girl, twelve years old, whom she labeled ‘Marie Doe.’ Trump demanded oral
      sex, the lawsuit said, and afterward he “pushed both minors away while angrily
      berating them for the ‘poor’ quality of the sexual performance,” according to
      the lawsuit, filed April 26 in U.S. District Court in Central California. Afterward,
      when Epstein learned that Trump had taken Johnson’s virginity, Epstein allegedly
      ‘attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists,’ angry he had not
      been the one to take her virginity. Johnson claimed that both men threatened to
      harm her, and her family if she ever revealed what had happened. The lawsuit states
      that Trump did not take part in Epstein’s orgies but liked to watch, often while
      the thirteen-year-old “Kate Johnson” gave him a hand job. It appears Trump was
      able to quash the lawsuit by buying her silence. She has since disappeared. In
      2008, Alex Acosta, who at the time was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
      of Florida, negotiated a plea deal for Epstein. The deal granted immunity from
      all federal criminal charges to Epstein, four named co-conspirators and any unnamed
      “potential co-conspirators.” The agreement shut down the FBI probe into whether
      there were more victims and other powerful figures who took part in Epstein’s
      sex crimes. It halted the investigation and sealed the indictment. Trump, in what
      many consider an act of gratitude, appointed Acosta as Secretary of Labor in his
      first term. Trump contemplated pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell after she was arrested
      in July 2020, fearing she would reveal details of his decades-long friendship
      with Epstein, according to Trump biographer Michael Wolff. In July 2022, Maxwell
      was sentenced to 20 years in prison. “Jeffrey Epstein’s closest relationship in
      life was with Donald Trump…these were two guys joined at the hip for a good 15
      years. They did everything together,” Wolff told host Joanna Coles on The Daily
      Beast Podcast. “And this is from sharing, pursuing women, hunting women, sharing
      at least one girlfriend for at least a year in this kind of rich-guy relationship
      with each other’s planes, to Epstein advising Trump on how to cheat on his taxes.”
      The legal anomalies, including the disappearance of massive amounts of evidence
      incriminating Epstein, saw Epstein avoid federal sex-trafficking charges in 2007,
      when his attorneys negotiated the secret plea deal with Acosta. He was able to
      plead guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. The
      prominent men accused of engaging in Epstein’s carnival of pedophilia, including
      Epstein’s attorney Dershowitz, viciously threaten anyone who seeks to expose them.
      Dershowitz, for example, claims that an investigation which he has refused to
      make public, by the former FBI director Louis Freeh, proves he had never had sex
      with Epstein’s victim Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked at 17 to Prince Andrew.
      Giuffre, one of the few victims to publicly take on her abusers, said she was
      “passed around like a platter of fruit” among Epstein and Maxwell’s friends, until
      at the age of 19 when she escaped. She “ committed suicide ” in April 2025. Dershowitz
      has sent repeated threats to Brown and her editors at The Miami Herald. Brown
      continues: [Dershowitz] kept referring to information that was contained in sealed
      documents. He accused the newspaper of not reporting “facts” that he said were
      in those sealed documents. The truth is, I tried to explain, newspapers just can’t
      write about things because Alan Dershowitz says they exist. We need to see them.
      We need to verify them. Then, because I said “show me the material,” he publicly
      accused me of committing a criminal act by asking him to produce documents that
      were under court seal. This is the way Dershowitz operates. What disturbs me the
      most about Dershowitz is the way that the media, with few exceptions, fails to
      critically challenge him. Journalists fact-checked Donald Trump and others in
      his administration almost every day, yet, for the most part, the media seems to
      give Dershowitz a pass on the Epstein story. In 2015, when Giuffre’s allegations
      first became public, Dershowitz went on every television program imaginable swearing,
      among other things, that Epstein’s plane logs would exonerate him. “How do you
      know that?” he was asked. He replied that he was never on Epstein’s plane during
      the time that Virginia was involved with Epstein. But if the media had checked,
      they could have learned that he was indeed a passenger on the plane during that
      time period, according to the logs. Then he testified, in a sworn deposition,
      that he never went on any plane trips without his wife. But he was listed on those
      passage manifests as traveling multiple times without his wife. During at least
      one trip, he was on the plane with a model named Tatiana. Epstein donated money
      to Harvard and was made a visiting fellow in Harvard’s Department of Psychology,
      although he had no academic qualifications in the field. He was given a key card
      and pass code, as well as an office in the building that housed Harvard’s Program
      for Evolutionary Dynamics. He referred to himself in his press releases as “Science
      Philanthropist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Education activist Jeffrey Epstein,” “Evolutionary
      Jeffrey Epstein,” “Science patron Jeffrey Epstein” and “Maverick hedge funder
      Jeffrey Epstein.” Epstein, replicating the pretensions and vacuity of the characters
      who were parodied in the “Dinner with Trimalchio” chapter of Satyricon, organized
      elaborate dinner gatherings for his billionaire friends, including Elon Musk,
      Salar Kamangar and Jeff Bezos. He dreamed up bizarre schemes of social engineering,
      including a plan to seed the human species with his own DNA by creating a baby

      pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers
      and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Stephen Prager / Common
      Dreams Outrage continues to grow against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi
      Noem over her response to the deadly floods that ravaged Texas last week. According
      to a Friday report from The New York Times , more than two-thirds of phone calls
      to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from flood victims went unanswered
      after Noem allowed hundreds of contractors to be laid off on July 5, just a day
      after the nightmare storm. According to The Times , this dramatically hampered
      the ability of the agency to respond to calls from survivors in the following
      days: On July 5, as floodwaters were starting to recede, FEMA received 3,027 calls
      from disaster survivors and answered 3,018, or roughly 99.7 percent, the documents
      show. Contractors with four call center companies answered the vast majority of
      the calls. That evening, however, Noem did not renew the contracts with the four
      companies, and hundreds of contractors were fired, according to the documents
      and the person briefed on the matter. The next day, July 6, FEMA received 2,363
      calls and answered 846, or roughly 35.8 percent, according to the documents. And
      on Monday, July 7, the agency fielded 16,419 calls and answered 2,613, or around
      15.9 percent, the documents show. Calling is one of the primary ways that flood
      victims apply for aid from the disaster relief agency. But Noem would wait until
      July 10—five days later—to renew the contracts of the people who took those phone
      calls. “Responding to less than half of the inquiries is pretty horrific,” Jeffrey
      Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia
      University, told The Times . “Put yourself in the shoes of a survivor: You’ve
      lost everything, you’re trying to find out what’s insured and what’s not, and
      you’re navigating multiple aid programs,” he added. “One of the most important
      services in disaster recovery is being able to call someone and walk through these
      processes and paperwork.” The lapse is a direct result of a policy introduced
      by Noem last month, which required any payments made by FEMA above $100,000 to
      be directly approved by her before taking effect. Noem, who has said she wants
      to eliminate FEMA entirely, described it as a way of limiting “waste, fraud, and
      abuse.” Under this policy, Noem allowed other critical parts of the flood response
      to wait for days as well. Earlier this week, multiple officials within FEMA told
      CNN that she waited more than 72 hours to authorize the deployment of search and
      rescue teams and aerial imaging. Following The Times’ piece, DHS put out a statement
      claiming that “NO ONE was left without assistance, and every call was responded
      to urgently.” “When a natural disaster strikes, phone calls surge, and wait times
      can subsequently increase,” DHS said. “Despite this expected influx, FEMA’s disaster
      call center responded to every caller swiftly and efficiently, ensuring no one
      was left without assistance. No call center operators were laid off or fired.”
      This is undercut, however, by internal emails also obtained by The Times, which
      showed FEMA officials becoming frustrated and blaming the DHS Secretary for the
      lack of contracts. One official wrote in a July 8 email to colleagues: “We still
      do not have a decision, waiver, or signature from the DHS Secretary.” Democratic
      lawmakers were already calling for investigations into Noem’s response to the
      floods before Friday. They also sought to look into how the Trump administration’s
      mass firings of FEMA employees, as well as employees of the National Weather Service
      (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) may have
      hampered the response. Following The Times’ revelations, outrage has reached a
      greater fever pitch. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called it “unforgivable
      and unforgettable” and an “inexcusable lapse in top leadership.” “Sec. Noem shows

      Kristi Noem following her handling of the aftermath of deadly floods in Texas,
      where a significant number of calls from flood victims to FEMA went unanswered.
      A report from The New York Times revealed that after Noem allowed the layoffs
      of hundreds of contractors on July 5, the agency's ability to respond to disaster
      survivors was severely compromised. While FEMA had answered nearly all calls from
      victims on July 5, the situation deteriorated drastically in the following days,
      with only 35.8% and 15.9% of calls answered on July 6 and July 7, respectively.
      It wasn't until July 10 that Noem renewed the contracts for the call center staff,
      leading to criticism over the delayed response during a critical time for those
      seeking aid.

      Dreams Outrage continues to grow against U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi
      Noem over her response to the deadly floods that ravaged Texas last week. According
      to a Friday report from The New York Times , more than two-thirds of phone calls
      to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from flood victims went unanswered
      after Noem allowed hundreds of contractors to be laid off on July 5, just a day
      after the nightmare storm. According to The Times , this dramatically hampered
      the ability of the agency to respond to calls from survivors in the following
      days: On July 5, as floodwaters were starting to recede, FEMA received 3,027 calls
      from disaster survivors and answered 3,018, or roughly 99.7 percent, the documents
      show. Contractors with four call center companies answered the vast majority of
      the calls. That evening, however, Noem did not renew the contracts with the four
      companies, and hundreds of contractors were fired, according to the documents
      and the person briefed on the matter. The next day, July 6, FEMA received 2,363
      calls and answered 846, or roughly 35.8 percent, according to the documents. And
      on Monday, July 7, the agency fielded 16,419 calls and answered 2,613, or around
      15.9 percent, the documents show. Calling is one of the primary ways that flood
      victims apply for aid from the disaster relief agency. But Noem would wait until
      July 10—five days later—to renew the contracts of the people who took those phone
      calls. “Responding to less than half of the inquiries is pretty horrific,” Jeffrey
      Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia
      University, told The Times . “Put yourself in the shoes of a survivor: You’ve
      lost everything, you’re trying to find out what’s insured and what’s not, and
      you’re navigating multiple aid programs,” he added. “One of the most important
      services in disaster recovery is being able to call someone and walk through these
      processes and paperwork.” The lapse is a direct result of a policy introduced
      by Noem last month, which required any payments made by FEMA above $100,000 to
      be directly approved by her before taking effect. Noem, who has said she wants
      to eliminate FEMA entirely, described it as a way of limiting “waste, fraud, and
      abuse.” Under this policy, Noem allowed other critical parts of the flood response
      to wait for days as well. Earlier this week, multiple officials within FEMA told
      CNN that she waited more than 72 hours to authorize the deployment of search and
      rescue teams and aerial imaging. Following The Times’ piece, DHS put out a statement
      claiming that “NO ONE was left without assistance, and every call was responded
      to urgently.” “When a natural disaster strikes, phone calls surge, and wait times
      can subsequently increase,” DHS said. “Despite this expected influx, FEMA’s disaster
      call center responded to every caller swiftly and efficiently, ensuring no one
      was left without assistance. No call center operators were laid off or fired.”
      This is undercut, however, by internal emails also obtained by The Times, which
      showed FEMA officials becoming frustrated and blaming the DHS Secretary for the
      lack of contracts. One official wrote in a July 8 email to colleagues: “We still
      do not have a decision, waiver, or signature from the DHS Secretary.” Democratic
      lawmakers were already calling for investigations into Noem’s response to the
      floods before Friday. They also sought to look into how the Trump administration’s
      mass firings of FEMA employees, as well as employees of the National Weather Service
      (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) may have
      hampered the response. Following The Times’ revelations, outrage has reached a
      greater fever pitch. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called it “unforgivable
      and unforgettable” and an “inexcusable lapse in top leadership.” “Sec. Noem shows
      that dismantling FEMA impacts real people in real time,” he said. “It hurts countless
      survivors & increases recovery costs.” In response to the news, Sen. Elizabeth
      Warren (D-Mass.) simply wrote that “Kristi Noem must resign now.” Kristi Noem

      By Abdul Rahman / Peoples Dispatch The Donald Trump administration has reportedly
      been pressuring South Korea to join its policy of blocking Chinese growth in the
      international shipbuilding industry by offering South Korea relief from higher
      tariffs under the “reciprocal tariff” regime of the US. South Korea’s trade policy
      director, Chang Sung-gil, said on Friday that “the US feels a sense of crisis
      that China’s market share in the shipbuilding sector is growing and is tapping
      Korea as a strategic partner” against it. Chang also confirmed that cooperation
      against China’s shipbuilding is one of the pre-conditions set by the US for finalizing
      the trade deal with South Korea to avoid high reciprocal tariffs. Earlier this
      week, the Trump administration extended the deadline for the implementation of
      its reciprocal tariff regime. It was to take effect July 9, as per the announcement
      made in April. However, Trump has given countries until August 1 to finalize their
      trade deals to avoid high tariffs. If the talks fail, South Korea will face a
      25% tariff on its exports to the US, according to a Monday letter from Trump to
      the country’s newly elected leadership. South Korea is not the only country that
      the US is coercing to join its China economic containment plan. Various nations,
      both in Asia and elsewhere, have been pressured to cut back their trade ties with
      China. Trump has reportedly demanded, both directly and indirectly, that countries
      should reduce the volume of their trade with China and block certain essential
      exports to it. This is a continuation of the policy adopted by Trump’s predecessor
      Joe Biden, who had asked South Korea to block the supply of high end logic and
      memory chips to China as a way to slow down its progress in high end technology.
      The Trump administration has set similar demands vis-a-vis China for a large number
      of Asian countries as one of the preconditions for getting relief from higher
      tariffs. Violation of international norms China has repeatedly objected to the
      US government’s approach of using its so-called reciprocal tariffs to coerce countries
      to modify their trade policies with a third country. Responding to the news of
      the Trump administration using coercion against South Korea to act against China,
      Mao Ning, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that no
      bilateral trade “agreement or negotiation should come at the expense of third
      parties’ interests”. The Trump administration has also threatened members of the
      BRICS with higher tariffs if they choose to continue aligning with it, calling
      it an anti-American grouping. On Tuesday, Trump reiterated his threat which provoked
      a strong response from Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who just
      hosted the BRICS summit. Trump also announced a 50% tariff on Brazil on Wednesday
      accusing it of “persecuting” former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial
      for spreading misinformation to foreign diplomats about Brazil’s electronic voting
      system and attempting a coup against Lula. Answering a question about Trump’s
      tariff threat against Brazil for its domestic policy decision, Ning called it
      a violation of the basic principles of international politics and an attempt to
      coerce other countries and interfere in their domestic affairs. “Sovereign equality
      and non-interference in internal affairs are important principles of the UN Charter
      and basic norms governing international relations,” Ning said. China is one of
      the founding BRICS members and its push for a multipolar, democratic world order
      is at the heart of its policies. China has rejected Trump’s allegations that BRICS
      is aligned against any particular country. China has also reiterated that there
      are no winners in a tariff or trade war. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the

      By Kit Klarenberg / Substack Leaked files expose how now-defunct intelligence
      cutout USAID secretly employed the services of shady “counter-disinformation”
      firm Valent Projects , to censor and suppress online criticism of an illegitimate
      puppet government Washington installed in Sudan in August 2019. The purpose was
      to shore up its brutal, corrupt rule in the face of widespread public opposition.
      The documents suggest this was not the only country where Valent has been used
      as a cutout to support Western destabilisation and intervention, both covert and
      overt. A since-deleted USAID web entry declared the April 2019 ouster of Sudan’s
      longtime leader Omar al-Bashir represented a “historic” opportunity “to further
      US interests in Sudan and the region.” The Agency’s Office of Transition Services
      (OTI), which provided “fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political
      transition” – in other words, regime change – engaged in “close cooperation” with
      “key ministries” within the interim Sudanese government established four months
      later. This included creating and managing multiple state “media offices” for
      disseminating propaganda, and countering “mis- and disinformation”. The leaks
      show Valent reaped over $1 million from OTI for “counter disinformation and communications
      support” in Sudan. Suspiciously, this staggering sum is not reflected in the company’s
      official accounts . Nonetheless, some detail on its OTI work is provided by a
      June 2021 Meta report on “coordinated inauthentic behavior”. It states a malign
      network of 53 Facebook accounts, 51 pages, three groups, and 18 Instagram users
      in Sudan were removed “after reviewing information about some of its activity
      shared by researchers at Valent Projects.” In October 2021, Valent chief Amil
      Khan told Reuters the “inauthentic” Sudanese “network” his company identified
      was in fact “three times larger” than the nexus removed by Facebook in June that
      year, “attracting more than 6 million followers and continuing to grow.” He accused
      Meta of failing to act appropriately. By contrast, administrators of pages fingered
      by Valent as “inauthentic” emphatically denied the charge, telling Reuters the
      accusations stemmed from their criticism of the interim government’s “oppressive
      policies and poor economic and political management.” Sudan’s deeply unpopular
      OTI-run government collapsed the same month. During its two years of operation,
      it gained a woeful reputation for industrial scale corruption, savage attacks
      on dissidents, banning opposition news outlets, jailing dissidents without charge
      or trial, and other egregious abuses of power. Evidently, Valent was seeking to
      systematically defenestrate any and all online detractors of Washington’s faithful
      client administration on USAID’s dime, in a country where social media is highly
      influential on public perceptions and actions. ‘Measurable Effects’ Publicly,
      Valent Projects presents a friendly, democratic face, its in-house ‘experts’ frequently
      quoted in the mainstream on topics ranging from carbon emission “disinformation”
      to whether popular rapper Kendrick Lamar has been promoted by online bot networks.
      Yet, Khan cut his teeth running propaganda and influence operations for murderous
      CIA and MI6-backed extremist groups during the Syrian dirty war. The USAID leaks
      make abundantly clear he remains up to his old tricks, under Valent’s benign banner.
      Khan’s reprehensible professional background moreover made him an ideal candidate
      for managing “information operations” in support of the Ukraine proxy war, from
      the perspective of Project Alchemy . A British Ministry of Defence-created cell
      of military and intelligence veterans, it is charged with keeping Kiev “fighting
      at all costs”, plotting oft-suicidal missions for Ukrainian forces to carry out.
      Questions thus abound as to whether Khan’s secret plot with celebrity ‘journalist’
      Paul Mason to destroy The Grayzone , exposed in June 2022, arose from his clandestine
      mission for Alchemy. Dubbing him a “ninja” in the field of psychological warfare,
      Alchemy chiefs approached Khan in April 2022, inviting him to lead their “information”
      effort in the proxy war. He responded that Valent was already collaborating with
      Chemonics International, which manages the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine.
      Set up by Western governments to funnel support of all kinds to Kiev, PFRU is
      now run by the British Foreign Office, in direct “collaboration” with Volodymyr
      Zelensky’s administration. Khan explained this project was concerned with “tracking
      pro-Russian disinfo targeting key audiences in key countries…with the aim of influencing
      policy in a pro-Russian direction,” and countering attempts “to turn key audiences
      against the idea of support for Ukraine.” He bragged how Valent had “past performance
      in identifying, monitoring and closing such activity.” Khan enquired of Alchemy,
      “would something like that be of interest?” Not long after this email exchange,
      Valent submitted a pitch to PFRU. The firm proposed to “map audiences critical
      to the Kremlin’s efforts, and identify opportunities to impact their narratives,”
      thus supporting Kiev’s “strategic communications efforts.” If successful, Ukrainian
      officials would be provided with “a stream of ‘narrative opportunities’” to “influence”
      and “engage” audiences not only in Russia, but “other key states” including India
      and Turkey, via news outlets, social media, and other information sources. “One
      strand” of the project would “focus on mapping Russian internal audiences critical
      to the Kremlin’s plans with the aim of identifying opportunities to influence.”
      This would, it was projected, increase Kiev’s ability “to affect measurable attitudinal
      and behavioural change amongst key Russian audiences.” Meanwhile, “Russia’s ability
      to politically absorb negative conflict-related impacts,” such as “manpower losses”
      and “economic damage”, would be “degraded.” Valent’s pitch to PFRU The operation’s
      “second strand” would identify and monitor “social media networks delivering Russian
      information operations” overseas. Analysing the “content” and “engagement patterns”
      of these purported “networks” would “produce streams of highly specific, time
      sensitive information designed to present [Ukrainian] stakeholders opportunities
      to achieve influence.” The document bragged that “the approach and specific methodologies
      outlined” therein were “based on work [Valent Projects] has already conducted
      for multiple donors with measurable effects.” While no examples are cited in the
      leaked file, an obvious candidate would be Project Aurelius. This was an information
      warfare effort waged while Khan was based in Amman, Jordan, secret headquarters
      of a variety of British intelligence cutouts , with which he was employed during
      the Syrian dirty war. It sought to undermine Russia’s military support of Damascus,
      and Vladimir Putin’s rule, by “exposing Russians to the complicated reality their
      government” faced in the country. The Project’s leaked outline claimed “Russia’s
      position in Syria is more costly and less successful than the Kremlin is admitting,”
      and Putin’s position domestically and internationally was “fragile”. The objective
      therefore was to present Russia’s Syria intervention “as depicted” in British
      intelligence-created and run Syrian opposition media outlets “to key Russian audiences,
      including mainstream news consumers.” This “mechanism” could easily be constructed
      by “[tasking] Syrian opposition media activists” – in other words, British assets
      – “to capture raw material that undermines Russian claims.” Project_Aurelius Download
      The Project reportedly already had “potential points of entry into Russian mainstream
      media,” a team of “Russian activists based in Ukraine with access to foreign journalists
      and opinion influencers with media profiles,” and “activists able to establish
      and run Russian social media pages,” including “Russian opposition social media
      networks.” Funding would appear to come from a “Syrian-run media activist group”,
      ostensibly financed by “donations from wealthy Syrians”, which would send funds
      to a “a Russian-run similar entity…registered in Ukraine.” ‘Particularly Problematic’
      Another leaked Valent file shows the firm was employed by Thomson Reuters Foundation,
      the world-famous news agency’s “charitable” wing, “to gauge audience trust levels
      towards independent media in Ukraine.” The firm conducted extensive analysis of
      188 separate news outlets in Kiev, operating “across a variety of platforms, from
      websites to Facebook pages and Telegram channels.” It identified four separate
      audiences; “nationalist grannies”; “tech-savvy professionals”; “Russia First fans”;
      and “Ukrainian ‘Proud Boys’”, referencing the far-right US militia. The findings
      were delivered in March 2021. Excerpt from leaked Valent file Valent found “the
      most trusted information sources” in Ukraine “tend to be individuals who could
      best be described as ‘celebrity bloggers’,” as “larger media outlets…are assumed
      to be promoting an oligarch’s interests.” Those “celebrity bloggers” who could
      “communicate a certain comfort level with Russian culture and language while maintaining
      a dispassionate but critical tone on Kremlin policy” were concluded to be “the
      most likely actors in the Ukrainian information space to attract the widest cross
      section of audiences.” Such was the depth of Valent’s research, the firm was “confident”
      in making a number of “recommendations to news outlets operating in the Ukrainian
      information environment.” This included developing outlets “around real-world
      personalities,” avoiding “the appearance of narrow tribalism,” and “[showing]
      respect to Russian culture and history” when “criticising Russian policy.” Meanwhile,
      “long-form content” should focus on “newsworthy interviews”, with outlets posting
      “appropriate content” across platforms “in an integrated manner around a central
      narrative…[tailored] to audience profiles.” It is uncertain why Thomson Reuters
      Foundation commissioned Valent to identify the most popular independent media
      outlets and personalities, and effective propaganda strategies, in Ukraine. Nonetheless,
      The Grayzone has previously revealed the Foundation groomed a secret army of pro-Western
      Russian journalists under a covert Foreign Office operation, to “weaken the Russian
      state’s influence”. More gravely, this journalist has also exposed how Reuters
      and TRF created a British intelligence-funded astroturf opposition media outlet
      in Egypt, Aswat Masriya , which was central to Cairo’s brutal 2013 military coup.
      Thomson Reuters Foundation proposes secretly creating ‘independent’ media outlet
      for Ukraine’s 2019 elections Strikingly, leaked TRF files related to Aswat Masriya
      proposed repeating the exercise in Kiev, “timed for the run up to the 2019 elections.”
      That vote saw Zelensky elected by landslide, on a peace platform. This project
      was ostensibly inspired by “a lack of in-depth, independent news coverage” in
      Ukraine, which the Foundation considered “particularly problematic at key political
      junctures such as elections, especially when vested interests seek to influence
      particular outcomes.” In this context, the timing of Valent’s research effort
      for TRF is rendered rather suspect. In March 2021, Zelensky issued a decree ,
      outlining a “strategy for the de-occupation and reintegration” of “temporarily
      occupied territory” in Crimea and Donbass. It sketched a blueprint for the military
      to recapture both territories. Immediately, Kiev’s forces began massing in the
      south and east of Ukraine, a key precursor to the proxy conflict that erupted
      in February 2022. Perhaps Zelensky’s British intelligence backers wished to ensure
      in advance local “independent” media figures and outlets were supportive of the
      President’s “strategy” to ignite war with Russia? Editor’s Note : A t a moment

      By Kit Klarenberg / Substack Leaked files expose how now-defunct intelligence
      cutout USAID secretly employed the services of shady “counter-disinformation”
      firm Valent Projects , to censor and suppress online criticism of an illegitimate
      puppet government Washington installed in Sudan in August 2019. The purpose was
      to shore up its brutal, corrupt rule in the face of widespread public opposition.
      The documents suggest this was not the only country where Valent has been used
      as a cutout to support Western destabilisation and intervention, both covert and
      overt. A since-deleted USAID web entry declared the April 2019 ouster of Sudan’s
      longtime leader Omar al-Bashir represented a “historic” opportunity “to further
      US interests in Sudan and the region.” The Agency’s Office of Transition Services
      (OTI), which provided “fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political
      transition” – in other words, regime change – engaged in “close cooperation” with
      “key ministries” within the interim Sudanese government established four months
      later. This included creating and managing multiple state “media offices” for
      disseminating propaganda, and countering “mis- and disinformation”. The leaks
      show Valent reaped over $1 million from OTI for “counter disinformation and communications
      support” in Sudan. Suspiciously, this staggering sum is not reflected in the company’s
      official accounts . Nonetheless, some detail on its OTI work is provided by a
      June 2021 Meta report on “coordinated inauthentic behavior”. It states a malign
      network of 53 Facebook accounts, 51 pages, three groups, and 18 Instagram users
      in Sudan were removed “after reviewing information about some of its activity
      shared by researchers at Valent Projects.” In October 2021, Valent chief Amil
      Khan told Reuters the “inauthentic” Sudanese “network” his company identified
      was in fact “three times larger” than the nexus removed by Facebook in June that
      year, “attracting more than 6 million followers and continuing to grow.” He accused
      Meta of failing to act appropriately. By contrast, administrators of pages fingered
      by Valent as “inauthentic” emphatically denied the charge, telling Reuters the
      accusations stemmed from their criticism of the interim government’s “oppressive
      policies and poor economic and political management.” Sudan’s deeply unpopular
      OTI-run government collapsed the same month. During its two years of operation,
      it gained a woeful reputation for industrial scale corruption, savage attacks
      on dissidents, banning opposition news outlets, jailing dissidents without charge
      or trial, and other egregious abuses of power. Evidently, Valent was seeking to
      systematically defenestrate any and all online detractors of Washington’s faithful
      client administration on USAID’s dime, in a country where social media is highly
      influential on public perceptions and actions. ‘Measurable Effects’ Publicly,
      Valent Projects presents a friendly, democratic face, its in-house ‘experts’ frequently
      quoted in the mainstream on topics ranging from carbon emission “disinformation”
      to whether popular rapper Kendrick Lamar has been promoted by online bot networks.
      Yet, Khan cut his teeth running propaganda and influence operations for murderous
      CIA and MI6-backed extremist groups during the Syrian dirty war. The USAID leaks
      make abundantly clear he remains up to his old tricks, under Valent’s benign banner.
      Khan’s reprehensible professional background moreover made him an ideal candidate
      for managing “information operations” in support of the Ukraine proxy war, from
      the perspective of Project Alchemy . A British Ministry of Defence-created cell
      of military and intelligence veterans, it is charged with keeping Kiev “fighting

      By Vijay Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research In 1957, Mao
      Zedong oversaw the publication of Socialist Upsurge in China’s Countryside , a
      three-volume collection of articles compiled by the Communist Party of China for
      the political education of the peasantry. The following year, selections from
      these volumes were republished in abridged and regional editions. One such edition
      included a report from the Anyang Regional Communist Party Committee’s Office
      for the Co-operative Movement with an introduction by Mao. The text, called ‘Who
      Says a Chicken Feather Can’t Fly up to Heaven?’, provides the title for this newsletter.
      The chicken feather’s task is the task of socialism: to do what is considered
      by many to be impossible. The peasants of Anyang, Mao wrote, faced a choice between
      capitalism and socialism – although any socialist construction would inevitably
      bear traces of the capitalist system, as it must emerge out of existing forms
      of social production. ‘The poor want to remake their lives’, Mao wrote. ‘The old
      system is dying. A new system is being born. Chicken feathers really are flying
      up to heaven’. But Mao remained cautious. In the preface to another article, ‘They
      Insist on Taking the Road to Co-Operation’ (20 September 1955), he wrote: Socialism
      is something new. A severe struggle must be waged against the old ways before
      socialism can be brought about. At a given time, a section of society is very
      stubborn and refuses to abandon its old ways. At another time, these same people
      may change their attitude and approve the new. Ever since socialist forces have
      endeavoured to build a society free from the wretched outcomes of capitalism,
      they have had to contend with the challenge of transcending pre-existing social
      relations. The mechanisms to allocate resources under the capitalist system –
      such as the ‘profit incentive’ – create the conditions for private control over
      social processes, which in turn generate enormous waste and inequality. When socialists
      have tried to imagine a society without the commodification of labour – one of
      the defining features of capitalism – they have found themselves replicating the
      wage system through experiments such as labour vouchers based on time worked.
      The transition away from commodified labour was not going to be abrupt or simple,
      but rather a protracted process of struggle to de-commodify key areas of social
      life (such as healthcare, education, and transportation) and to create mechanisms
      for people to acquire goods for personal use through non-wage means. When socialist
      forces took state power – as in the USSR after 1917 and China after 1949 – they
      struggled to construct elementary forms of socialism while navigating the following
      conundrums: Limited systems for managing information. Socialisteconomies were
      vast and complex yet lacked adequate mechanisms to gather and process all the
      data required for the effective planning of a dynamic economy – a challenge that
      persists even today, despite powerful computing technologies. Fundamental uncertainty
      in decision-making. Planning authorities had to make budgetary and investment
      decisions under conditions of uncertainty, particularly as rapid advances in science
      and technology risked rendering major investments obsolete. Tension between long-term
      planning and short-term demand. Central plans often clashed with shifting consumer
      tastes, making it difficult to align long-term planned investment with the short-term
      tastes and whims of consumers. Conflicting political objectives. Economic goals
      were not always politically unified, and competing visions embedded in various
      plans often led to acute forms of bureaucratisation. There is no formula for overcoming
      these and other problems faced by socialist projects once in state power. They
      must be solved experimentally – or, as the Chinese saying goes, by ‘crossing the
      river by feeling the stones’ (摸着石头过河). It is fitting, then, that the June 2025
      edition of Wenhua Zongheng , published by Tricontinental: Institute for Social
      Research and focused on ‘ Chinese Experiments in Socialist Modernisation ’, opens
      with an essay by the Chinese writer Li Tuo titled ‘On the Experimental Nature
      of Socialism and the Complexity of China’s Reform and Opening Up’. One of the
      key insights of Li Tuo’s fascinating essay – which journeys from the Paris Commune
      to China’s reform and opening up – is that socialist revolutions, particularly
      in formerly colonised or economically underdeveloped countries, cannot transition
      directly to ‘complete socialism’ but must go through – quoting Lenin – ‘a series
      of varied, imperfect, and concrete attempts to create this or that socialist state’.
      I like the emphasis on ‘this or that socialist state’. There is no blueprint,
      but there are examples that need to be studied and histories that need to be properly
      digested. This is precisely what Li Tuo does in his essay, which he ends by marvelling
      at the creation of the high-speed rail system in China. The next essay, written
      by Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin and titled ‘Industrial Policy with Chinese Characteristics:
      The Political Economy of China’s Intermediary Institutions’, examines China’s
      socialist modernisation with the diligence it demands – not just with awe but
      through close study. Every time I hear Meng Jie lecture or read his work on China’s
      market economy, I am deeply impressed by his insistence on building theory from
      active research in the very factories that produce the goods for modern China.
      Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin’s essay is no different, drawing on field research conducted
      in various factories along the high-speed rail supply chain. What the authors
      find is that China’s high-speed rail production system was built within the state-owned
      sector but conceptualised within a ‘constructive market’ framework where ‘intra-governmental
      competition’ served as the engine of innovation. In other words, the Chinese state
      constructed a market that involved not just a profit-seeking private sector but
      also a product-oriented public sector with institutions competing to achieve national
      development goals. Finance for this entire system came from state-owned financial
      institutions that steered capital accumulation towards social use rather than
      merely a high rate of return. As Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin write, ‘The primary
      goal of state-owned capital is to implement the objectives of socialist production
      and fulfil the tasks set by the national development plans and strategies’. This
      essay is part of a broader effort by Meng Jie and his collaborators to try to
      understand the system of production relations and innovation that China has developed
      – a crucial area of enquiry as the country enters the era of ‘new quality productive
      forces’, a key concept in contemporary Chinese development policy. One of the
      key elements of this latest issue of Wenhua Zongheng is to show that class struggle
      continues during the period of socialist construction. What this means is that
      various experiments are needed along the way to see what works and what doesn’t
      – both to develop the productive forces and to put in place more equitable social
      relations. In this process there has been a continued ideological struggle inside
      China as the capitalists seek ways to reproduce themselves. However, under China’s
      socialist system, capitalists are not permitted to organise themselves into a
      class with political power through ownership of media, financial systems, political
      parties, or other institutions. They cannot freely take their profits overseas
      or invest them wherever they like. There are several strategic dams in place –
      including capital controls – that regulate the flow of capital and prevent the
      Chinese capitalists from becoming oligarchic and refusing to invest in their country
      (a problem faced by so many governments in both the Global North and South, where
      oligarchs can take their capital wherever they want and even go on ‘strike’ by
      refusing to invest in infrastructure or industry). China’s capital remains within
      the country and in reach of a state-owned banking system that puts that capital
      to work within the parameters of the national development plan. Capitalists can
      operate in the country, but they cannot dominate the system and allow their profit-seeking
      behaviour to become paramount. In this way, the class struggle is tilted in favour
      of the people. This is what separates the socialist system in China from the capitalist
      systems in other countries. In The German Ideology (1846), Marx and Engels wrote
      of the ‘muck of ages’ that needed to be set aside for a new world to be born.
      This act of setting aside is going to take a very long time. The chicken feather
      certainly has not yet reached heaven, but it is not in hell either. Editor’s Note

      By Vijay Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research In 1957, Mao
      Zedong oversaw the publication of Socialist Upsurge in China’s Countryside , a
      three-volume collection of articles compiled by the Communist Party of China for
      the political education of the peasantry. The following year, selections from
      these volumes were republished in abridged and regional editions. One such edition
      included a report from the Anyang Regional Communist Party Committee’s Office
      for the Co-operative Movement with an introduction by Mao. The text, called ‘Who
      Says a Chicken Feather Can’t Fly up to Heaven?’, provides the title for this newsletter.
      The chicken feather’s task is the task of socialism: to do what is considered
      by many to be impossible. The peasants of Anyang, Mao wrote, faced a choice between
      capitalism and socialism – although any socialist construction would inevitably
      bear traces of the capitalist system, as it must emerge out of existing forms
      of social production. ‘The poor want to remake their lives’, Mao wrote. ‘The old
      system is dying. A new system is being born. Chicken feathers really are flying
      up to heaven’. But Mao remained cautious. In the preface to another article, ‘They
      Insist on Taking the Road to Co-Operation’ (20 September 1955), he wrote: Socialism
      is something new. A severe struggle must be waged against the old ways before
      socialism can be brought about. At a given time, a section of society is very
      stubborn and refuses to abandon its old ways. At another time, these same people
      may change their attitude and approve the new. Ever since socialist forces have
      endeavoured to build a society free from the wretched outcomes of capitalism,
      they have had to contend with the challenge of transcending pre-existing social
      relations. The mechanisms to allocate resources under the capitalist system –
      such as the ‘profit incentive’ – create the conditions for private control over
      social processes, which in turn generate enormous waste and inequality. When socialists
      have tried to imagine a society without the commodification of labour – one of
      the defining features of capitalism – they have found themselves replicating the
      wage system through experiments such as labour vouchers based on time worked.
      The transition away from commodified labour was not going to be abrupt or simple,
      but rather a protracted process of struggle to de-commodify key areas of social
      life (such as healthcare, education, and transportation) and to create mechanisms
      for people to acquire goods for personal use through non-wage means. When socialist
      forces took state power – as in the USSR after 1917 and China after 1949 – they
      struggled to construct elementary forms of socialism while navigating the following
      conundrums: Limited systems for managing information. Socialisteconomies were
      vast and complex yet lacked adequate mechanisms to gather and process all the
      data required for the effective planning of a dynamic economy – a challenge that
      persists even today, despite powerful computing technologies. Fundamental uncertainty
      in decision-making. Planning authorities had to make budgetary and investment
      decisions under conditions of uncertainty, particularly as rapid advances in science
      and technology risked rendering major investments obsolete. Tension between long-term
      planning and short-term demand. Central plans often clashed with shifting consumer
      tastes, making it difficult to align long-term planned investment with the short-term
      tastes and whims of consumers. Conflicting political objectives. Economic goals
      were not always politically unified, and competing visions embedded in various
      plans often led to acute forms of bureaucratisation. There is no formula for overcoming

      Dreams Federal immigration agents were met with a strong show of resistance Thursday
      when they raided two farms in Southern California—with hundreds of community members
      protesting the arrests of migrants at the facilities growing cannabis and vegetables.
      Los Angeles-based independent journalist Mel Buer reported that hundreds of community
      members gathered to protest the raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
      at Glass House Farms’ facility in Camarillo, Ventura County, and supporters dropped
      “hundreds of pounds of water, food, and masks.” Local news outlet KTLA reported
      that “dozens of farmworkers were detained” in the raids at Glass House Farms’
      properties in Camarillo and Carpinteria. Federal law enforcement first arrived
      in Camarillo at about 11:00 am, and the situation escalated as a crowd of community
      members gathered. The federal agents first deployed tear gas into the crowd early
      Thursday afternoon. Ventura County District 5 Supervisor Vianey Lopez told KTLA
      that as the federal agents used force on the protesters, she saw two government
      vans, each carrying about 15 people, leaving the farm. “It is an ongoing situation
      that is very concerning for the safety of those showing up with anger and disappointment
      at what is happening to hardworking people in our community,” Lopez said. The
      immigration enforcement agents were joined by National Guard troops in military
      vehicles later that afternoon in Camarillo, according to The Guardian , as other
      federal agents carried out a simultaneous raid in Carpinteria, about 50 miles
      northwest in Santa Barbara County. Carpinteria City Council members Julia Mayer
      and Mónica Solórzano were among a large crowd of community members who gathered
      to protest the raid, and they told the Santa Barbara Independent that federal
      officers “pushed us as a group into the ground” and threw at least one smoke grenade,
      causing Solórzano to injure her arm. View this post on Instagram A post shared
      by Santa Barbara Independent (@sbindependent) U.S. Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.),
      who represents Santa Barbara County and part of Ventura County, released a statement
      condemning the ICE raid and saying he had been “denied entry and not allowed to
      pass” when he attempted to “conduct oversight” over the raid targeting his constituents
      in Carpinteria. “ICE was conducting a raid using disproportionate displays of
      force against local farmworkers and our agricultural community,” said Carbajal.
      “There’s been a troubling lack of transparency from ICE since the Trump administration
      started, and I won’t stop asking questions on behalf of my constituents.” Carbajal
      is now one of several Democratic elected officials who have been denied the ability
      to oversee ICE operations. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) pleaded not guilty last
      month to forcibly interfering with federal officers—charges that stemmed from
      her attempt to conduct congressional oversight at an ICE detention center in Newark,
      New Jersey. “These militarized ICE raids are not how you keep our communities
      safe. This kind of chaos only traumatizes families and tears communities apart.
      They are also a gross misuse of limited resources and a betrayal of the values
      that define us as Americans,” said Carbajal, who noted that the identities of
      those detained in the raids had not been made clear. In Camarillo, a resident
      named Judith Ramos told The Guardian that she had learned from her father, who
      worked in Glass House Farms’ tomato fields, that “immigration was outside his
      job” on Thursday morning. Ramos, a 22-year-old certified nurse assistant with
      two younger siblings, said her father told her “to take care of everything” if
      he was detained by ICE. She was sprayed with a chemical substance when she arrived
      at the farm and joined the crowd of protesters, and told The Guardian that she
      did not know where her father was. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has clashed
      with President Donald Trump and filed a lawsuit against the administration last
      month over its federalization of the California National Guard to respond to protests
      against immigration raids in Los Angeles, posted a video showing children running
      from the federal agents. Kids running from tear gas, crying on the phone because
      their mother was just taken from the fields. Trump calls me “Newscum” — but he’s

      against ICE raids on two farms, voicing their opposition to the arrests of migrants
      working in the cannabis and vegetable industries.
    paragraph_summary: On June 12, 2025, a significant protest erupted in Southern California
      in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at two farms, Glass
      House Farms in Camarillo and Carpinteria, where dozens of farmworkers were detained.
      Hundreds of community members rallied against the arrests, providing food, water,
      and masks to those affected. The situation intensified when federal agents deployed
      tear gas to disperse the crowd, leading to concerns about the safety of the protesters.
      Local officials, including Ventura County District Supervisor Vianey Lopez, expressed
      alarm over the aggressive tactics used by federal agents, who were supported by
      National Guard troops in military vehicles. The events highlighted the community's
      strong resistance to immigration enforcement actions targeting hardworking individuals
      in the agricultural sector.

      that as the federal agents used force on the protesters, she saw two government
      vans, each carrying about 15 people, leaving the farm. “It is an ongoing situation
      that is very concerning for the safety of those showing up with anger and disappointment
      at what is happening to hardworking people in our community,” Lopez said. The
      immigration enforcement agents were joined by National Guard troops in military
      vehicles later that afternoon in Camarillo, according to The Guardian , as other
      federal agents carried out a simultaneous raid in Carpinteria, about 50 miles
      northwest in Santa Barbara County. Carpinteria City Council members Julia Mayer
      and Mónica Solórzano were among a large crowd of community members who gathered
      to protest the raid, and they told the Santa Barbara Independent that federal
      officers “pushed us as a group into the ground” and threw at least one smoke grenade,
      causing Solórzano to injure her arm. View this post on Instagram A post shared
      by Santa Barbara Independent (@sbindependent) U.S. Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.),
      who represents Santa Barbara County and part of Ventura County, released a statement
      condemning the ICE raid and saying he had been “denied entry and not allowed to
      pass” when he attempted to “conduct oversight” over the raid targeting his constituents
      in Carpinteria. “ICE was conducting a raid using disproportionate displays of
      force against local farmworkers and our agricultural community,” said Carbajal.
      “There’s been a troubling lack of transparency from ICE since the Trump administration
      started, and I won’t stop asking questions on behalf of my constituents.” Carbajal
      is now one of several Democratic elected officials who have been denied the ability
      to oversee ICE operations. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) pleaded not guilty last
      month to forcibly interfering with federal officers—charges that stemmed from
      her attempt to conduct congressional oversight at an ICE detention center in Newark,
      New Jersey. “These militarized ICE raids are not how you keep our communities
      safe. This kind of chaos only traumatizes families and tears communities apart.
      They are also a gross misuse of limited resources and a betrayal of the values
      that define us as Americans,” said Carbajal, who noted that the identities of
      those detained in the raids had not been made clear. In Camarillo, a resident
      named Judith Ramos told The Guardian that she had learned from her father, who
      worked in Glass House Farms’ tomato fields, that “immigration was outside his
      job” on Thursday morning. Ramos, a 22-year-old certified nurse assistant with
      two younger siblings, said her father told her “to take care of everything” if
      he was detained by ICE. She was sprayed with a chemical substance when she arrived
      at the farm and joined the crowd of protesters, and told The Guardian that she
      did not know where her father was. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has clashed
      with President Donald Trump and filed a lawsuit against the administration last
      month over its federalization of the California National Guard to respond to protests
      against immigration raids in Los Angeles, posted a video showing children running
      from the federal agents. Kids running from tear gas, crying on the phone because

    one_sentence_summary: Community members in Southern California strongly protested
      against ICE raids on two farms, voicing their opposition to the arrests of migrants
      working in the cannabis and vegetable industries.
    paragraph_summary: On June 12, 2025, a significant protest erupted in Southern California
      in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at two farms, Glass
      House Farms in Camarillo and Carpinteria, where dozens of farmworkers were detained.
      Hundreds of community members rallied against the arrests, providing food, water,
      and masks to those affected. The situation intensified when federal agents deployed
      tear gas to disperse the crowd, leading to concerns about the safety of the protesters.
      Local officials, including Ventura County District Supervisor Vianey Lopez, expressed
      alarm over the aggressive tactics used by federal agents, who were supported by
      National Guard troops in military vehicles. The events highlighted the community's
      strong resistance to immigration enforcement actions targeting hardworking individuals
      in the agricultural sector.

      on 10 July that Beijing and Moscow should strengthen strategic coordination to
      promote peace in West Asia. According to a statement by China’s Foreign Ministry,
      Yi said the two countries should push for a diplomatic solution to the Iran nuclear
      issue during a meeting with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Kuala Lumpur.
      “Peace cannot be achieved through force, and applying pressure won’t solve problems.”
      Dialogue and negotiations were the solution to the conflict, Yi added. The two
      foreign ministers also discussed China–Russia coordination with the countries
      comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “Russia and China
      stand united in opposing actions and plans to militarize the region, including
      attempts to deploy NATO-standard military infrastructure,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry
      stated after the meeting. During the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro on 7 July,
      Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Moscow was ready to aid in
      mediating negotiations between the US and Iran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear
      program. Lavrov offered Russia’s technical assistance to help Iran replenish its
      depleted uranium stocks by removing uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels
      and replacing it with uranium suitable for power generation. “We have technological
      capacities and we are ready to offer them, taking the excess of overly enriched
      uranium and returning the power-generation-grade uranium to the Islamic Republic
      and its nuclear facilities.” The US and Israel have insisted that Iran end all
      uranium enrichment on its own soil. Tehran insists that enriching uranium within
      its borders is its right under international law and according to the Nuclear
      Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Iran is seeking relief from US sanctions in exchange
      for limitations on its nuclear program, which it insists is for producing energy,
      not a nuclear weapon. On 8 July, Iran denied US President Donald Trump’s claim
      that it had requested to resume talks with the US over its nuclear program. “No
      request for a meeting has been made on our side to the American side,” Iranian
      Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Tuesday. The US and Iran were
      engaged in nuclear talks in June when Israel launched a surprise war on Tehran
      on 13 June. During the 12-day war, Israeli bombing killed 1,060 people, while
      Iran’s retaliatory drone and missile attacks on Israel resulted in at least 28
      deaths. The US joined the attack on 22 June by bombing three of Iran’s major nuclear
      sites, Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump reportedly used the nuclear negotiations
      to deceive Iranian leaders into thinking that no Israeli attack was imminent.
      “Israel and the US carried out a multi-faceted misinformation campaign in recent
      days to convince Iran that a strike on its nuclear facilities was not imminent,”

      donation . By Mike Ludwig / Truthout Alocal sanitation workers strike that began
      on July 1 in Boston, Massachusetts, and left trash unpicked across the city is
      now spreading nationwide in a series of labor actions coordinated by the Teamsters
      union as frustrated workers demand better pay and benefits from Republic Services,
      a major waste disposal company. The Teamsters said on July 9 that 2,000 sanitation
      workers were on strike in multiple cities while others refused to cross picket
      lines in solidarity with striking workers at local Republic Services sites in
      Massachusetts, Illinois , Washington State , and California . For example, workers
      in the Bay Area launched a temporary trash pickup stoppage this week in solidarity
      with fellow workers striking over negotiations with Republic Services for better
      pay at a regional landfill near Stockton. “Republic Services has been threatening
      a war with American workers for years — and now, they’ve got one,” said Teamsters
      General President Sean M. O’Brien in a statement on Wednesday. While trash collection
      has resumed in some Boston residential neighborhoods, trash bags continued to
      pile up this week outside businesses and in dumpsters as sanitation workers demand
      higher wages, better benefits, and paid time off, according to local reports.
      The Boston City Council voted unanimously on July 9 to support the workers in
      their strike, which council members said was both a labor issue and a public health
      issue. In a statement to local media this week, Teamsters Local 25 in Boston told
      Republic Services on July 3 that it was prepared to extend the picket line to
      other cities if the company failed to begin contract negotiations with the union
      by July 7, but the company did not meet the deadline. Republic Services is a private
      contractor in charge of waste pickup and disposal in cities across the country,
      and work stoppages spread coast to coast this week after Local 25 extended the
      picket line to job sites beyond Boston. Republic Services did not respond to a
      request for comment from Truthout by the time this story was published. In a statement
      to local media in Boston, the company said it stands ready to meet with the Teamsters
      Local 25 “when they are ready to re-engage.” “We will continue to focus on providing
      service and doing right by our employees,” Republic Services said. “We call on
      Teamsters’ leadership to immediately stop the instigation, intimidation, and criminal
      acts, and resolve this situation.” The right to join a union and go on strike
      is protected by federal labor law, so it’s unclear what “criminal acts” Republic
      Services could be referring to in its response to Local 25 in Boston. Raising
      the specter of criminal prosecution may itself be an intimidation tactic. O’Brien
      said the Teamsters are not backing down because Republic Services “abuses and
      underpays” sanitation workers serving communities across the country. “They burn
      massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives,” O’Brien
      said. “The Teamsters have had it with Republic. We will flood the streets and
      shut down garbage collection in state after state. Workers are uniting nationwide,
      and we will get the wages and benefits we’ve earned, come hell or high water.”
      In a statement, the Teamsters union says Republic Services has refused to bargain
      in good faith and settle fair labor contracts with sanitation workers despite
      months of negotiations in cities around the country. Instead, the company has
      resorted to “union-busting tactics” and “illegal threats” in order to provoke
      a nationwide strike. Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said
      Republic Services is one of the most “depraved employers we’ve ever come across.”
      “Republic has lied, stalled, and broken the law to try to squeeze every last dime
      out of workers. But these corporate thieves have underestimated our members,”
      Zuckerman said in a statement on July 9. The war of words comes as work stoppages
      spread, potentially delaying trash pickup for millions of people. However, Zuckerman
      said the Teamsters will not give up until they receive a fair contract from Republic
      Services. “To the millions of Americans seeing their trash pile up because of
      Republic’s strike, remember one thing: this corporation has hauled in $77 billion,”
      said Victor Mineros, director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division,
      in a statement. “Republic can easily afford a fair and competitive contract that
      meets the needs of everyday hardworking Americans.” While Truthout was unable
      to verify that Republic Services has brought in $77 billion in revenue, an earnings
      statement released to investors shows the company had a net income of $2 billion
      in 2024. Republic Services reported revenue growth at 5.6 percent over the three
      months ending in December 2024, and the company returned nearly $1.2 billion to
      shareholders last year. Adan Alvarez, a waste management worker in southern California,
      said his local Teamsters union is not technically on strike against Republic Services.
      Instead, their union contract allows workers to refuse crossing a picket line,
      and workers in southern California announced a work stoppage after Local 25 in
      Boston extended its picket line this week. Alvarez and fellow workers are responsible
      for safely transporting hazardous materials, and their contract with Republic
      Services expires next year. “The reason we support one another is there is strength
      in numbers,” Alvarez told Truthout in an interview. Mineros said sanitation and
      waste management workers perform “dangerous, high-stakes jobs” that protect local
      communities and the environment from pollution and hazardous waste. “They deserve
      a contract that respects their contributions — not lowball proposals and corporate
      stonewalling. The company must bargain in good faith,” Mineros said. Meanwhile,
      after more than a week of work stoppage, an unrelated trash pickup and city services
      strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to an end after eight days in the early
      hours of Wednesday morning after members of the local American Federation of State,
      Council and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union reached a tentative finalized a
      contract with city officials. However, rank- and- file workers still need to approve
      the contract, and some union leaders left the final negotiations in frustration.
      The deal includes a one-time $1,500 bonus and a 3 percent annual wage increase
      for three years, for a total of 9 percent by 2028, according to reports . Union
      leaders pushed for a 5 percent annual wage increase after originally proposing
      an 8 percent annual increase. The average salary for a sanitation worker is $46,000
      a year in Philadelphia, which the union argues is not a living wage. Greg Boulware,
      president of the AFSCME local representing public workers in Philadelphia, told
      the Philadelphia Inquirer that the strike is over and “nobody’s happy” as he left
      negotiations with the city on Wednesday. If the rank and file reject the deal,
      Boulware said the strike could potentially resume . “We felt our clock was running
      out,” Boulware said. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

      expanding nationwide, driven by the Teamsters union as workers demand improved
      pay and benefits from Republic Services, a major waste disposal company. As of
      July 9, around 2,000 workers are on strike in various cities, with others showing
      solidarity by refusing to cross picket lines. In the Bay Area, workers temporarily
      halted trash pickup in support of their striking colleagues. While some trash
      collection has resumed in Boston, significant amounts of waste remain uncollected,
      prompting the Boston City Council to unanimously support the workers, framing
      the strike as both a labor and public health issue. Teamsters General President
      Sean M. O’Brien emphasized that Republic Services has been antagonistic towards
      American workers, leading to the current labor unrest.

      has resumed in some Boston residential neighborhoods, trash bags continued to
      pile up this week outside businesses and in dumpsters as sanitation workers demand
      higher wages, better benefits, and paid time off, according to local reports.
      The Boston City Council voted unanimously on July 9 to support the workers in
      their strike, which council members said was both a labor issue and a public health
      issue. In a statement to local media this week, Teamsters Local 25 in Boston told
      Republic Services on July 3 that it was prepared to extend the picket line to
      other cities if the company failed to begin contract negotiations with the union
      by July 7, but the company did not meet the deadline. Republic Services is a private
      contractor in charge of waste pickup and disposal in cities across the country,
      and work stoppages spread coast to coast this week after Local 25 extended the
      picket line to job sites beyond Boston. Republic Services did not respond to a
      request for comment from Truthout by the time this story was published. In a statement
      to local media in Boston, the company said it stands ready to meet with the Teamsters
      Local 25 “when they are ready to re-engage.” “We will continue to focus on providing
      service and doing right by our employees,” Republic Services said. “We call on
      Teamsters’ leadership to immediately stop the instigation, intimidation, and criminal
      acts, and resolve this situation.” The right to join a union and go on strike
      is protected by federal labor law, so it’s unclear what “criminal acts” Republic
      Services could be referring to in its response to Local 25 in Boston. Raising
      the specter of criminal prosecution may itself be an intimidation tactic. O’Brien
      said the Teamsters are not backing down because Republic Services “abuses and
      underpays” sanitation workers serving communities across the country. “They burn
      massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives,” O’Brien
      said. “The Teamsters have had it with Republic. We will flood the streets and
      shut down garbage collection in state after state. Workers are uniting nationwide,
      and we will get the wages and benefits we’ve earned, come hell or high water.”
      In a statement, the Teamsters union says Republic Services has refused to bargain
      in good faith and settle fair labor contracts with sanitation workers despite
      months of negotiations in cities around the country. Instead, the company has
      resorted to “union-busting tactics” and “illegal threats” in order to provoke
      a nationwide strike. Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman said
      Republic Services is one of the most “depraved employers we’ve ever come across.”
      “Republic has lied, stalled, and broken the law to try to squeeze every last dime
      out of workers. But these corporate thieves have underestimated our members,”
      Zuckerman said in a statement on July 9. The war of words comes as work stoppages
      spread, potentially delaying trash pickup for millions of people. However, Zuckerman
      said the Teamsters will not give up until they receive a fair contract from Republic
      Services. “To the millions of Americans seeing their trash pile up because of
      Republic’s strike, remember one thing: this corporation has hauled in $77 billion,”
      said Victor Mineros, director of the Teamsters Solid Waste and Recycling Division,
      in a statement. “Republic can easily afford a fair and competitive contract that
      meets the needs of everyday hardworking Americans.” While Truthout was unable
      to verify that Republic Services has brought in $77 billion in revenue, an earnings
      statement released to investors shows the company had a net income of $2 billion
      in 2024. Republic Services reported revenue growth at 5.6 percent over the three
      months ending in December 2024, and the company returned nearly $1.2 billion to
      shareholders last year. Adan Alvarez, a waste management worker in southern California,
      said his local Teamsters union is not technically on strike against Republic Services.
      Instead, their union contract allows workers to refuse crossing a picket line,
      and workers in southern California announced a work stoppage after Local 25 in
      Boston extended its picket line this week. Alvarez and fellow workers are responsible
      for safely transporting hazardous materials, and their contract with Republic
      Services expires next year. “The reason we support one another is there is strength
      in numbers,” Alvarez told Truthout in an interview. Mineros said sanitation and
      waste management workers perform “dangerous, high-stakes jobs” that protect local
      communities and the environment from pollution and hazardous waste. “They deserve
      a contract that respects their contributions — not lowball proposals and corporate
      stonewalling. The company must bargain in good faith,” Mineros said. Meanwhile,
      after more than a week of work stoppage, an unrelated trash pickup and city services
      strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, came to an end after eight days in the early
      hours of Wednesday morning after members of the local American Federation of State,
      Council and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union reached a tentative finalized a
      contract with city officials. However, rank- and- file workers still need to approve
      the contract, and some union leaders left the final negotiations in frustration.
      The deal includes a one-time $1,500 bonus and a 3 percent annual wage increase
      for three years, for a total of 9 percent by 2028, according to reports . Union
      leaders pushed for a 5 percent annual wage increase after originally proposing
      an 8 percent annual increase. The average salary for a sanitation worker is $46,000
      a year in Philadelphia, which the union argues is not a living wage. Greg Boulware,
      president of the AFSCME local representing public workers in Philadelphia, told
      the Philadelphia Inquirer that the strike is over and “nobody’s happy” as he left
      negotiations with the city on Wednesday. If the rank and file reject the deal,
      Boulware said the strike could potentially resume . “We felt our clock was running
      out,” Boulware said. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

    paragraph_summary: A sanitation workers strike that began on July 1 in Boston is
      expanding nationwide, driven by the Teamsters union as workers demand improved
      pay and benefits from Republic Services, a major waste disposal company. As of
      July 9, around 2,000 workers are on strike in various cities, with others showing
      solidarity by refusing to cross picket lines. In the Bay Area, workers temporarily
      halted trash pickup in support of their striking colleagues. While some trash
      collection has resumed in Boston, significant amounts of waste remain uncollected,
      prompting the Boston City Council to unanimously support the workers, framing
      the strike as both a labor and public health issue. Teamsters General President
      Sean M. O’Brien emphasized that Republic Services has been antagonistic towards
      American workers, leading to the current labor unrest.

      donation . By Elham Azad / Truthout In early June 2025, The Guardian revealed
      that the University of Michigan paid over $800,000 to Amerishield, parent company
      to a private security company called City Shield. It was part of a broader $3
      million public‑security budget, which included surveillance of pro‑Palestinian
      student activists. The university hired plainclothes agents who trailed students
      into cafés, harassed them, and even staged confrontations, including faking a
      disability to falsely accuse them of theft. City Shield , a private security agency
      based out of Detroit, used the supposed evidence collected by their agents against
      these students to prosecute them and send them to jail. Massive Blue, a company
      based in New York, has created a surveillance tool called Overwatch that uses
      AI to monitor online spaces. Although this tool is sold and marketed as a public
      safety tool, the technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate
      online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence, particularly
      targeting college protesters and activists labeled as “radicalized.” These bots
      are created to imitate human behavior, making them very hard to detect. The tech
      stack these agencies deploy is formidable: geofencing tools, license plate readers,
      real-time social media surveillance, predictive analytics. Even Radian6, a Salesforce
      product, has been linked to student protest monitoring . These tools don’t just
      observe behavior, they anticipate it, allowing administrators and police to intervene
      before a rally even begins. This surveillance is not merely bureaucratic overreach.
      It is an act of intimidation, one that reflects an ideological alignment with
      systems of repression abroad. In Gaza, for example, humanitarian aid is increasingly
      distributed only through biometric registration , leaving starving Palestinians
      with no choice but to submit to facial and fingerprint scans to access food. Although
      aid agencies and occupying forces justify this as a form of “efficiency,” it can
      only be seen as coercive surveillance, stripping Palestinians of dignity and autonomy
      under the guise of relief. Within the United States, university officials have
      increasingly turned to firms like ShadowDragon, Skydio, and Stellar Technologies,
      whose tools are capable of profiling, analyzing, and geolocating social media
      posts , drone-mapping encampments , and even identifying masked protestors through
      AI-enhanced facial recognition . These companies aren’t developing tools for student
      safety. They’re developing battlefield tech and students are the new targets.
      In April 2024, when students at Columbia University set up a peaceful encampment
      to protest the genocide in Gaza, few expected the administration to respond with
      mass arrests. Fewer still understood the extent to which military-grade surveillance
      technologies were already in place to track them. In the same month, Jewish Currents
      reported on Yale University’s use of drones, surveillance cameras, and plainclothes
      officers to monitor pro-Palestine student activists. Surveillance footage was
      used to identify students who had not violated any laws but had simply been present.
      Meanwhile, in May 2025, it was revealed that LAPD used Dataminr to track the social
      media activity of students organizing pro-Palestine events . Surveillance reports
      included screenshots of Instagram stories, private group chats, and Twitter threads.
      Some of this data was sourced using tools built by Dataminr and Social Sentinel,
      both of which specialize in identifying “emerging threats” by combing through
      vast amounts of social media data tools originally developed for use by law enforcement
      and intelligence agencies. In addition, in March 2024, it was revealed that Elon
      Musk’s X was also selling user data to Dataminr . The logic is chillingly consistent:
      Dissent is pathologized, monitored, and neutralized while capitalists keep making
      money. And universities have become willing partners in this process. In my Ph.D.
      research, I studied surveillance infrastructures, particularly in contexts where
      settler colonial regimes seek to erase dissent. What we’re seeing on U.S. campuses
      today mirrors repression models from places like East Turkestan (Xinjiang), where
      everyday resistance is quelled through predictive monitoring and data extraction
      . What this tells us is that surveillance isn’t about protection, it’s about power.
      And American universities are rapidly becoming test beds for the kind of repressive
      technology we associate with authoritarian states abroad. The money behind these
      technologies flows through a familiar nexus of venture capital firms , defense
      contractors, and government agencies. ShadowDragon, for example, has been celebrated
      by the World Economic Forum and boasts contracts with U.S. law enforcement and
      military branches. Cobwebs Technologies, Xtend, and Oosto are Israeli surveillance
      companies whose products are now being deployed against student activists in the
      U.S . These firms have marketed their tools based on effectiveness in tracking
      Palestinians and other “high-risk” populations. Now, they are used on American
      campuses to monitor solidarity. There is a historical precedent to this kind of
      repression. During the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s and 70s,
      FBI programs like COINTELPRO targeted student activist groups like the Student
      Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society
      (SDS), and organizations like the Black Panther Party, with infiltration, wiretaps,
      and blackmail. The FBI’s targeting of student and civil rights activists through
      COINTELPRO is well-documented, as explored in this Yale News interview with historian
      Beverly Gage, who says J. Edgar Hoover’s tactics were both coercive and widely
      normalized. Hoover was the first director of the FBI, serving from 1924 until
      his death in 1972. However, the difference today is scale and automation. Rather
      than needing a human informant in every room, university administrators can now
      rely on machine learning algorithms to scan student emails, monitor group chats,
      and alert authorities to so-called “escalation indicators.” Recently, billionaire
      investor Kevin O’Leary called for permanently destroying the digital lives of
      student protesters using AI-based doxxing campaigns . While O’Leary was widely
      condemned, his dystopian vision isn’t far from the reality already taking root.
      Companies like Babel Street and Stellar Technologies offer tools with the explicit
      promise of identifying individuals based on minimal data inputs like a partial
      image or a Twitter handle. Tools like NesherAI claim to identify masked individuals
      in a crowd using behavioral and gait analysis. Corsight AI advertises facial recognition
      that works through masks, hoods, and sunglasses. These are not theoretical tools.
      They’re being piloted now, often in secret, and often in tandem with increasing
      police presence on campuses. These developments must be viewed in the broader
      context of the militarization of civilian life. The pipeline between Gaza and
      Georgia Tech is not rhetorical. Technologies field-tested in war zones are refined
      and normalized on American campuses, where students are reduced to data points
      in behavioral prediction models. Israeli firms developed surveillance for use
      in Gaza and the West Bank are now contracted domestically. Surveillance technologies
      once reserved for military and foreign operations are now being deployed on U.S.
      university campuses, targeting student protestors, particularly those demonstrating
      for Palestine. These tools are not isolated innovations. Many were tested on Palestinians
      and Uyghurs before being repurposed for U.S. settings. This is not a breakdown
      of democratic norms but their systematic redirection using universities as testbeds
      for next-generation policing. University administrators often claim that surveillance
      is about safety. But whose safety? Lately, surveillance tools have mostly targeted
      the most vulnerable in our communities: Muslims, Indigenous people, undocumented
      immigrants, Black people, and anyone who supports Palestinian liberation and an
      end to the U.S.-sponsored genocide in Gaza. They claim that these tools are here
      to protect us, but in truth, they only serve to erase us, discipline us, and punish
      us. It doesn’t have to be this way. Campuses have historically been sites of inquiry,
      dissent, and transformation, not laboratories for digital repression, and we must
      fight to keep them that way. We must reject the narrative that surveillance is
      inevitable. It is not. It is a political choice, made behind closed doors, mostly
      without consent or oversight of those who are affected the most. Surveillance
      Watch is one intervention in this landscape, an attempt to shift the power back
      to those being watched. It is a community‑driven project that deploys interactive
      maps and databases to reveal the web of surveillance companies, their funders,
      subsidiaries, affiliations, and global operations in an effort to make opaque
      surveillance networks transparent. However, we need more. We need more public
      and legal accountability, more student organizing, more media scrutiny, and way
      more institutional courage. We need to say, unequivocally, that resistance is

    one_sentence_summary: The University of Michigan reportedly spent over $800,000
      on a private security firm to surveil and harass pro-Palestinian student activists,
      including employing undercover agents to stage confrontations and falsely accuse
      them of theft.
    paragraph_summary: In June 2025, The Guardian reported that the University of Michigan
      allocated over $800,000 to Amerishield, the parent company of City Shield, for
      a public security budget exceeding $3 million, which included the surveillance
      of pro-Palestinian student activists. The university employed plainclothes agents
      to follow and harass students, staging confrontations and using fabricated evidence
      to prosecute them. Additionally, Massive Blue's AI surveillance tool, Overwatch,
      infiltrates online activist groups with virtual characters to collect intelligence
      on those labeled as "radicalized." This extensive surveillance infrastructure,
      which includes geofencing, license plate readers, and predictive analytics, enables
      authorities to monitor and anticipate student protests, raising significant concerns
      about civil liberties and the targeting of dissent.

      donation . By Elham Azad / Truthout In early June 2025, The Guardian revealed
      that the University of Michigan paid over $800,000 to Amerishield, parent company
      to a private security company called City Shield. It was part of a broader $3
      million public‑security budget, which included surveillance of pro‑Palestinian
      student activists. The university hired plainclothes agents who trailed students
      into cafés, harassed them, and even staged confrontations, including faking a
      disability to falsely accuse them of theft. City Shield , a private security agency
      based out of Detroit, used the supposed evidence collected by their agents against
      these students to prosecute them and send them to jail. Massive Blue, a company
      based in New York, has created a surveillance tool called Overwatch that uses
      AI to monitor online spaces. Although this tool is sold and marketed as a public
      safety tool, the technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate
      online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence, particularly
      targeting college protesters and activists labeled as “radicalized.” These bots
      are created to imitate human behavior, making them very hard to detect. The tech
      stack these agencies deploy is formidable: geofencing tools, license plate readers,
      real-time social media surveillance, predictive analytics. Even Radian6, a Salesforce
      product, has been linked to student protest monitoring . These tools don’t just
      observe behavior, they anticipate it, allowing administrators and police to intervene
      before a rally even begins. This surveillance is not merely bureaucratic overreach.
      It is an act of intimidation, one that reflects an ideological alignment with
      systems of repression abroad. In Gaza, for example, humanitarian aid is increasingly
      distributed only through biometric registration , leaving starving Palestinians
      with no choice but to submit to facial and fingerprint scans to access food. Although
      aid agencies and occupying forces justify this as a form of “efficiency,” it can
      only be seen as coercive surveillance, stripping Palestinians of dignity and autonomy
      under the guise of relief. Within the United States, university officials have
      increasingly turned to firms like ShadowDragon, Skydio, and Stellar Technologies,
      whose tools are capable of profiling, analyzing, and geolocating social media
      posts , drone-mapping encampments , and even identifying masked protestors through
      AI-enhanced facial recognition . These companies aren’t developing tools for student
      safety. They’re developing battlefield tech and students are the new targets.
      In April 2024, when students at Columbia University set up a peaceful encampment
      to protest the genocide in Gaza, few expected the administration to respond with
      mass arrests. Fewer still understood the extent to which military-grade surveillance
      technologies were already in place to track them. In the same month, Jewish Currents
      reported on Yale University’s use of drones, surveillance cameras, and plainclothes
      officers to monitor pro-Palestine student activists. Surveillance footage was
      used to identify students who had not violated any laws but had simply been present.
      Meanwhile, in May 2025, it was revealed that LAPD used Dataminr to track the social
      media activity of students organizing pro-Palestine events . Surveillance reports
      included screenshots of Instagram stories, private group chats, and Twitter threads.
      Some of this data was sourced using tools built by Dataminr and Social Sentinel,
      both of which specialize in identifying “emerging threats” by combing through
      vast amounts of social media data tools originally developed for use by law enforcement
      and intelligence agencies. In addition, in March 2024, it was revealed that Elon
      Musk’s X was also selling user data to Dataminr . The logic is chillingly consistent:
      Dissent is pathologized, monitored, and neutralized while capitalists keep making
      money. And universities have become willing partners in this process. In my Ph.D.
      research, I studied surveillance infrastructures, particularly in contexts where
      settler colonial regimes seek to erase dissent. What we’re seeing on U.S. campuses
      today mirrors repression models from places like East Turkestan (Xinjiang), where
      everyday resistance is quelled through predictive monitoring and data extraction
      . What this tells us is that surveillance isn’t about protection, it’s about power.
      And American universities are rapidly becoming test beds for the kind of repressive
      technology we associate with authoritarian states abroad. The money behind these
      technologies flows through a familiar nexus of venture capital firms , defense
      contractors, and government agencies. ShadowDragon, for example, has been celebrated
      by the World Economic Forum and boasts contracts with U.S. law enforcement and
      military branches. Cobwebs Technologies, Xtend, and Oosto are Israeli surveillance
      companies whose products are now being deployed against student activists in the
      U.S . These firms have marketed their tools based on effectiveness in tracking
      Palestinians and other “high-risk” populations. Now, they are used on American
      campuses to monitor solidarity. There is a historical precedent to this kind of
      repression. During the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s and 70s,
      FBI programs like COINTELPRO targeted student activist groups like the Student
      Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society
      (SDS), and organizations like the Black Panther Party, with infiltration, wiretaps,
      and blackmail. The FBI’s targeting of student and civil rights activists through
      COINTELPRO is well-documented, as explored in this Yale News interview with historian
      Beverly Gage, who says J. Edgar Hoover’s tactics were both coercive and widely
      normalized. Hoover was the first director of the FBI, serving from 1924 until
      his death in 1972. However, the difference today is scale and automation. Rather
      than needing a human informant in every room, university administrators can now
      rely on machine learning algorithms to scan student emails, monitor group chats,
      and alert authorities to so-called “escalation indicators.” Recently, billionaire
      investor Kevin O’Leary called for permanently destroying the digital lives of
      student protesters using AI-based doxxing campaigns . While O’Leary was widely
      condemned, his dystopian vision isn’t far from the reality already taking root.
      Companies like Babel Street and Stellar Technologies offer tools with the explicit
      promise of identifying individuals based on minimal data inputs like a partial
      image or a Twitter handle. Tools like NesherAI claim to identify masked individuals
      in a crowd using behavioral and gait analysis. Corsight AI advertises facial recognition
      that works through masks, hoods, and sunglasses. These are not theoretical tools.
      They’re being piloted now, often in secret, and often in tandem with increasing
      police presence on campuses. These developments must be viewed in the broader
      context of the militarization of civilian life. The pipeline between Gaza and
      Georgia Tech is not rhetorical. Technologies field-tested in war zones are refined
      and normalized on American campuses, where students are reduced to data points
      in behavioral prediction models. Israeli firms developed surveillance for use
      in Gaza and the West Bank are now contracted domestically. Surveillance technologies
      once reserved for military and foreign operations are now being deployed on U.S.
      university campuses, targeting student protestors, particularly those demonstrating
      for Palestine. These tools are not isolated innovations. Many were tested on Palestinians
      and Uyghurs before being repurposed for U.S. settings. This is not a breakdown
      of democratic norms but their systematic redirection using universities as testbeds
      for next-generation policing. University administrators often claim that surveillance
      is about safety. But whose safety? Lately, surveillance tools have mostly targeted
      the most vulnerable in our communities: Muslims, Indigenous people, undocumented
      immigrants, Black people, and anyone who supports Palestinian liberation and an
      end to the U.S.-sponsored genocide in Gaza. They claim that these tools are here
      to protect us, but in truth, they only serve to erase us, discipline us, and punish
      us. It doesn’t have to be this way. Campuses have historically been sites of inquiry,
      dissent, and transformation, not laboratories for digital repression, and we must
      fight to keep them that way. We must reject the narrative that surveillance is
      inevitable. It is not. It is a political choice, made behind closed doors, mostly
      without consent or oversight of those who are affected the most. Surveillance
      Watch is one intervention in this landscape, an attempt to shift the power back
      to those being watched. It is a community‑driven project that deploys interactive
      maps and databases to reveal the web of surveillance companies, their funders,
      subsidiaries, affiliations, and global operations in an effort to make opaque
      surveillance networks transparent. However, we need more. We need more public
      and legal accountability, more student organizing, more media scrutiny, and way
      more institutional courage. We need to say, unequivocally, that resistance is
      not a threat. It is a right. We are not subjects. We are watching back. Editor’s

      Corps of Engineers is constructing new military infrastructure for Israel across
      several bases, including airfields, hangars, and ammunition depots, according
      to public records reported by Haaretz on 8 July. The current projects total more
      than $250 million, with future ones expected to exceed $1 billion, based on a
      call for interested contractors originally scheduled for June but postponed due
      to Israel’s war against Iran. The Israeli news site Haaretz reported on the public
      documents on Monday. The US Army Corps of Engineers is using contractors to build
      ammunition depots, refuelling stations, and concrete structures for Israeli military
      bases. The documents also show that the US is seeking contractors for building
      maintenance and repairs, including work on airfields. One project for hangars,
      maintenance rooms, and storage facilities for new Boeing KC-46 tankers that Israel
      is expected to receive in the coming years is projected to cost over $100 million.
      Another facility to house CH-53K helicopters is expected to cost up to $250 million.
      The US is also soliciting bids for ammunition storage buildings, estimated at
      up to $100 million. A separate seven-year tender, capped at $900 million, covers
      maintenance, repairs, construction, demolition, and infrastructure upgrades at
      unspecified sites for the Israeli Ministry of Defence. These projects are funded
      through foreign military financing. Israel receives $3.8 billion annually in military
      aid, under a system that allows the US and Israel to determine how to spend the
      funds, which are routed to US defense contractors. Since the Hamas-led 7 October
      2023 Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, Washington has also provided supplemental military
      aid totalling around $18 billion. The US has previously used military aid for
      Israeli infrastructure. In 2012, public tender documents showed large-scale US-funded
      works at Nevatim air base. At the time, the Washington Post reported that the
      US had constructed a secret facility there, known as site “911.” The construction
      projects detailed on Monday were planned before the June 2025 Israeli attack on
      Iran. On 2 July, Reuters cited an Israeli official confirming that Iranian ballistic
      missiles struck several Israeli military sites during the 12-day exchange. Earlier
      in June, Washington approved a $510 million arms deal for Israel, adding over
      7,000 JDAM kits and support services to the growing list of weapons transfers
      in 2025. That package formed part of a broader escalation in US military support,
      which by mid-year had surpassed $9 billion. Tel Aviv reported receiving more than
      90,000 tons of US weapons in 600 days – deliveries Netanyahu credited to Trump
      as “the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House.” Around the
      same time, the Pentagon halted multiple arms shipments to Ukraine, despite internal
      reviews showing no critical shortage. The decision followed concerns over stockpile
      depletion after the US assisted Israel in intercepting Iranian missiles. Senior
      officials have since pushed for a shift in US military focus toward the Pacific.

      leader Mahmoud Khalil on Thursday began the process of suing U.S. President Donald
      Trump’s administration for $20 million in damages for the harm he suffered as
      a result of the government’s “politically motivated plan to unlawfully arrest,
      detain, and deport” him. “This is the first step towards accountability,” Khalil
      said in a statement. “Nothing can restore the 104 days stolen from me. The trauma,
      the separation from my wife, the birth of my first child that I was forced to
      miss . But let’s be clear, the same government that targeted me for speaking out
      is using taxpayer dollars to fund Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza .” “There
      must be accountability for political retaliation and abuse of power,” he asserted.
      “And I won’t stop here. I will continue to pursue justice against everyone who
      contributed to my unlawful detention or spread lies in an attempt to destroy my
      reputation, including those affiliated with Columbia University. I’m holding the
      U.S. government accountable not just for myself, but for everyone they try to
      silence through fear, exile, or detention.” In March, federal agents who were
      in plain clothes and lacked a warrant accosted Khalil, a lawful permanent resident
      who recently finished a graduate program at Columbia, and his wife—Noor Abdalla,
      a U.S. citizen who was then pregnant with their son—outside their New York City
      home. Following Khalil’s arrest , several other student activists critical of
      the U.S.-backed Israeli assault on Gaza were also targeted for deportation. The
      claim that 30-year-old Khalil filed Thursday against the U.S. Homeland Security
      and State departments, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is
      a precursor to a lawsuit that will cite the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, according
      to the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), part of his legal team. The filing
      accuses the Trump administration of carrying out a plan to deport Khalil “in a
      manner calculated to terrorize him and his family,” and says the mistreatment
      caused “severe emotional distress, economic hardship, damage to his reputation,
      and significant impairment of his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.”
      Mahmoud Khalil has filed a claim against the Trump administration, seeking either
      $20 million or an official apology and change in the administration’s policy after
      he was held in detention for over 100 days. NBC News’ Maya Eaglin spoke to Khalil

      from an ICE facility in Louisiana last month, is seeking $20 million to help others
      similarly targeted by the government and Columbia, but “he would accept, in lieu
      of payment, an official apology and abandonment of the administration’s unconstitutional
      policy,” CCR explained. The Associated Press reported that “a White House spokesperson
      deferred comment to the State Department, which said its actions were fully supported
      by the law. In an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the
      Department of Homeland Security, called Khalil’s claim ‘absurd,’ accusing him
      of ‘hateful behavior and rhetoric’ that threatened Jewish students.” While the
      departments’ comments signal that the Trump administration won’t be making any
      apologies, Khalil’s team is determined to move forward with his case. “The Trump
      administration’s unconstitutional targeting of Mr. Khalil led to severe harms
      that he continues to navigate, including financial loss, reputational damage,
      and emotional distress,” said Samah Sisay, staff attorney at CCR. “Mr. Khalil
      will never get back the three months stolen from him while in immigration detention,
      including his child’s birth and first months of life. The government must take
      accountability for their unlawful actions and compensate Mr. Khalil for his suffering.”
      Khalil’s claim was filed a day after an ICE official testified under oath that
      a task force formed in March used lists from Canary Mission, an operation linked
      to Israeli intelligence agencies, and the pro-Israel group Betar Worldwide to
      compile reports on international students targeted for their protest activities.

      leader Mahmoud Khalil on Thursday began the process of suing U.S. President Donald
      Trump’s administration for $20 million in damages for the harm he suffered as
      a result of the government’s “politically motivated plan to unlawfully arrest,
      detain, and deport” him. “This is the first step towards accountability,” Khalil
      said in a statement. “Nothing can restore the 104 days stolen from me. The trauma,
      the separation from my wife, the birth of my first child that I was forced to
      miss . But let’s be clear, the same government that targeted me for speaking out
      is using taxpayer dollars to fund Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza .” “There
      must be accountability for political retaliation and abuse of power,” he asserted.
      “And I won’t stop here. I will continue to pursue justice against everyone who
      contributed to my unlawful detention or spread lies in an attempt to destroy my
      reputation, including those affiliated with Columbia University. I’m holding the
      U.S. government accountable not just for myself, but for everyone they try to
      silence through fear, exile, or detention.” In March, federal agents who were
      in plain clothes and lacked a warrant accosted Khalil, a lawful permanent resident
      who recently finished a graduate program at Columbia, and his wife—Noor Abdalla,
      a U.S. citizen who was then pregnant with their son—outside their New York City
      home. Following Khalil’s arrest , several other student activists critical of
      the U.S.-backed Israeli assault on Gaza were also targeted for deportation. The
      claim that 30-year-old Khalil filed Thursday against the U.S. Homeland Security
      and State departments, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is
      a precursor to a lawsuit that will cite the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, according
      to the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), part of his legal team. The filing
      accuses the Trump administration of carrying out a plan to deport Khalil “in a
      manner calculated to terrorize him and his family,” and says the mistreatment
      caused “severe emotional distress, economic hardship, damage to his reputation,
      and significant impairment of his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.”
      Mahmoud Khalil has filed a claim against the Trump administration, seeking either
      $20 million or an official apology and change in the administration’s policy after
      he was held in detention for over 100 days. NBC News’ Maya Eaglin spoke to Khalil

      donation . By Tareq S. Hajjaj / Mondoweiss The Israel-backed and U.S.-run Gaza
      Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has been weathering one public relations disaster
      after another as new information continues to expose the organization’s complicity
      in Israel’s plans to “ concentrate ” Gaza’s population in camps ahead of their
      forcible displacement — in keeping with Israel’s stated military goals of conquering
      the Strip and expelling its people. In service of these goals, the GHF has replaced
      the UN’s aid distribution system with what Gazans describe as “ death traps ,”
      leading Palestinians to accuse the organization of fulfilling Israeli military
      objectives under the guise of humanitarianism. In order to bolster this facade,
      the GHF has been actively attempting to pressure international humanitarian organizations
      into cooperating with the GHF and participating in its operations. The GHF has
      also actively attempted to form a local network of distributors run by companies
      known to have collaborated with the Israeli army in the past. Speaking with several
      individuals and organizations approached by the GHF, Mondoweiss investigations
      reveal that Israel and the GHF are attempting to coerce local and international
      actors into cooperating with the U.S.-Israeli aid scheme. In some cases, the GHF
      has tasked local companies to engage in outreach to the population to advertise
      its centers and handle distribution and logistics. According to sources inside
      Gaza, the Israeli army is also pursuing a broader strategy of pressuring humanitarian
      organizations to either operate under the GHF framework or cease their activities
      altogether. The Israeli military has reportedly forced several international organizations
      to distribute their aid through GHF centers, overriding previous agreements that
      allowed them to operate independently. In many cases, aid shipments that entered
      through Israeli-controlled crossings were redirected — without the knowledge or
      consent of the aid organizations — to the U.S. company’s centers. An official
      security source in the Gaza civil government told Mondoweiss in mid-June that
      Hamas possesses “reliable intelligence” confirming that the GHF has been pressuring
      local institutions to participate in its operations. These attempts were meant
      to force organizations to cooperate in a strategy of “engineering starvation and
      managing chaos,” the official said, which he said was part of “a politically motivated
      and security-driven project disguised in humanitarian garb.” “However, these institutions,
      guided by their national consciousness and ethical commitment, refused to become
      tools for a party responsible for our people’s suffering,” he added. But there
      are some organizations that have cooperated. The GHF and the Israeli army have
      essentially pursued two paths in dominating the humanitarian landscape in Gaza:
      forcing international organizations to either work with the GHF or to halt operations,
      and using local gangs and businesses as part of its “native” network, giving a
      Palestinian face to an Israeli-U.S. operation with military and political objectives.
      Here is how it has attempted to achieve the objective of building this network
      of “aid collaborators.” The case of the al-Khozandar Company On the night of June
      11, 12 employees working for a local trading company were killed after being publicly
      detained by groups affiliated with Hamas’s security forces. Locals said they were
      from the Arrow Force , the Hamas unit tasked with hunting down looters and Israeli-backed
      gangs in Gaza. After being reportedly beaten and shot in the foot, the security
      members publicly accused the individuals of working for a company allegedly collaborating
      with the Israeli military. Eyewitnesses told Mondoweiss that the employees were
      then lynched by a crowd of people who were allegedly incited by the security members,
      who reportedly told the crowds that the employees were responsible for the deaths
      of their loved ones at GHF sites. It later became clear that the individuals were
      employees of the al-Khozandar Company, a commercial firm owned by a Palestinian
      residing in Cairo. The killing of the employees sparked controversy and outrage,
      with the victims’ families issuing a statement on June 17 demanding accountability.
      The statement also denied allegations that their sons were working with the Israeli-backed
      gang led by Yasser Abu Shabab that loots aid across Gaza, calling the accusations
      “false and baseless.” The events surrounding the incident, however, reveal a more
      complex picture. Before the families had issued their statement, the GHF condemned
      the “murder of 12 of our aid workers.” In contrast, the families stated that their
      sons were on their first day of work for al-Khozandar, suggesting that the company
      was working closely with the GHF. The security source in the Gaza government who
      spoke to Mondoweiss in June identified the Mohsen al-Khozandar Trading and Transport
      corporation, headed by a man named Muhammad al-Khozandar, as a “morally and nationally
      compromised” company that “coordinates directly with suspicious foreign actors
      at the expense of our people’s interests.” This company, the source added, “contributes,
      whether knowingly or not, to the systematic killing and starvation of Palestinians.”
      He asserted that “certain measures” have already been taken against the company,
      and that “more will follow,” including classifying the company as a “complicit
      entity.” The Khozandar company has been operating in Gaza for years. Also known
      as “Three Brothers,” the company specialized in bringing goods into Gaza in coordination
      with Israel before the war, which led Hamas to classify the company as “collaborating
      with the occupation,” according to the security source. The source added that,
      during the war, the company’s activities expanded noticeably beyond trade, raising
      suspicions of collaboration with the Israeli army’s military plans. According
      to the Geneva Council for Rights and Liberties , Palestinian workers employed
      by Three Brothers have been “forced to work under conditions resembling modern
      slavery,” and have been forced to sort and load aid boxes under direct Israeli
      supervision and to “serve American mercenaries.” The workers were subject to degrading
      searches by Israeli soldiers, and were not paid any wages, only receiving a few
      cigarettes and a single daily meal as compensation, according to the Geneva Council,
      based on testimony it says it has verified. Al-Khozandar began implementing the
      U.S.-Israeli aid distribution scheme in Rafah after it contracted with Safe Reach
      Solution (SRS), a military contractor that is also the parent company of the GHF
      and has reportedly conducted military-intelligence operations in Gaza using Israeli
      data. According to a Financial Times investigation, the arrangement was for SRS
      to provide security at the GHF centers, while the Khozandar company would run
      distribution, specifically at the Tal Sultan center in Rafah. According to local
      reports, al-Khozandar’s role in the aid scheme is to engage local individuals
      and civil society organizations to cooperate with the GHF, while the FT investigation
      quoted a source that said Three Brothers would be “the first interface with the
      population” at the distribution sites, and that the Khozandar team “was well known
      to the Israeli security establishment and had a long history of working with them.”
      The FT reported that SRS had approached several other prominent businessmen in
      Gaza to staff the centers, but that they refused to participate in the U.S.-Israeli
      scheme, “arguing it amounted to forced displacement of people in the enclave.”
      Meanwhile, the al-Khozandar family in Gaza issued a statement in May disavowing
      the Mohsen Khozandar Company and condemning any activities carried out by Muhammad
      al-Khozandar and his brothers, who manage the firm. The statement was supported
      by the Contractors Union and business owners in Gaza, who described any cooperation
      with this scheme as a “betrayal of national unity” and demanded strict accountability
      for all those involved. Local testimonies also indicate that the company’s managers
      from the al-Khozandar family phoned several prominent influencers and content
      creators in Gaza, urging them to promote the company’s aid centers and claiming
      they were safe and free from inspections or any violations of people’s dignity.
      Yahya Hilles, a digital creator , told Mondoweiss that a person going by the name
      of Noor al-Khozandar contacted him and spoke with him for over an hour, trying
      to convince him to encourage people to go to the GHF centers. Hilles explained
      that he consulted his family elders, who firmly opposed any involvement in promoting
      this project. “Noor al-Khozandar kept insisting, urging me to go, film, and promote
      the centers, but I repeatedly asked him why he came to me specifically,” Hilles
      said. “He gave no clear answer. He knew that people trust me and believe what
      I share on social media, so he wants to drag me into this. He told me there would
      be no soldiers or Americans, and that I would just carry aid and return home.”
      “I knew that, even if things might go smoothly the first or second time, it might
      later turn into a disaster,” Hilles added. “In that case, I would be responsible
      before my people, so I categorically refused. I told him clearly: this issue is
      bigger than one person, with serious security and political implications. It cannot
      be handled through a simple call from one person to another.” Israeli army attempts
      to strong-arm international organizations Rahma Worldwide is among the most active
      humanitarian organizations in Gaza since the war began, although it has been operating
      in the territory since 2017. During the war, it became notably involved in facilitating
      the entry of medical delegations and volunteers to Gaza hospitals, where they
      provided services for a limited time before leaving the territory. The organization
      has an extensive history in humanitarian relief. Recently, however, the Israeli
      military attempted to coerce Rahma Worldwide into operating under the umbrella
      of the GHF. In late May, the organization’s director, Dr. Shadi Zaza, told Mondoweiss
      that Rahma Worldwide rejected the collaboration. Zaza stated that the organization
      operates in Gaza as part of a group that includes several humanitarian institutions,
      including some affiliated with the UN. He said that the Israeli army had informed
      them of the addition of a new institution — the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation —
      to this group, and later announced changes to the aid distribution plan, including
      designating new distribution points where each organization would be required
      to send its staff. “We are always on standby,” Zaza said. “We’re ready anytime
      we’re permitted to bring in aid. Our goods are prepared and waiting at the crossings.”
      He noted that Rahma Worldwide had received permission the previous month to deliver
      four trucks carrying 4,000 food parcels, only to be surprised by an Israeli army
      order to transfer the aid to distribution points managed by the GHF, along with
      a demand that Rahma staff help with distribution there. “We categorically refused
      this request,” Zaza stated. “Our agreement with the army was clear — we would
      distribute our parcels at locations designated for our organization, not those
      belonging to any other.” Despite Rahma Worldwide’s request that the parcels be
      redirected to their own sites, the army insisted on sending them to the GHF-run
      facilities. The army also declared that GHF was now the sole authority responsible
      for aid distribution in Gaza. Accordingly, the 4,000 parcels were transferred
      to Rafah, and the army contacted Rahma’s team, urging them to assist with distribution.
      But the team reached out to the organization’s U.S. headquarters, which unequivocally
      rejected involvement with Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. “We will not be part of
      this mechanism. We reject it entirely,” said Al-Zaza, highlighting that the army
      continues to pressure aid groups, especially those importing goods from Egypt,
      Jordan, or even the West Bank, insisting that all items be sourced from within
      Israel. As a final request, Rahma Worldwide asked for its logos to be removed
      from the food boxes that were to be distributed at the GHF’s sites to avoid appearing
      as a participant or collaborator in the distribution scheme. This reflects the
      organization’s firm opposition to the scheme, Zaza said. According to the organization,
      some of the logos were removed, but boxes bearing the Rahma logo were nonetheless
      distributed at locations affiliated with the GHF at least on one occasion, which
      the organization said was beyond its control. Rahma identified these Israeli efforts
      early on as attempts to forcibly integrate it into the GHF’s network. Upon the
      organization’s refusal, the army imposed even more stringent conditions for aid
      entry. “We have over 20,000 food parcels ready in our warehouses,” Zaza added.
      “But we refuse to deliver them through the American organization’s mechanism.
      That organization was originally just one of many working here—we had no issue
      with that. But now that it’s trying to monopolize aid and impose its control,
      that is completely unacceptable.” This stance of refusal reflects a broader trend
      among humanitarian organizations in Gaza, many of which oppose the GHF for its
      role in facilitating Israeli military objectives. Continued pressure for these
      organizations to work with the GHF or leave, some warn, could lead to the withdrawal
      of many aid organizations from Gaza entirely, creating a severe gap in humanitarian
      assistance. “If Israel continues imposing this style of control and management,
      we simply won’t bring in aid,” Zaza said. “Other organizations may follow our
      lead. This policy — though unofficial — may well be Israel’s way of clearing the
      field of independent organizations and turning humanitarian work into a fully
      controlled instrument.” Some international humanitarian organizations have begun
      cutting ties with the Boston Consulting Group, the company that helped conceive
      and launch the GHF and had even modelled the costs of “relocating” Palestinians
      outside of Gaza. Save the Children recently ended a two-decade partnership with
      the BCG over its role in the GHF, calling the aid organization’s plan to forcibly
      displace Gaza’s population “utterly unacceptable.” BCG’s chief executive admitted
      that its involvement in the GHF was “reputationally damaging” and the result of
      “deliberate individual misconduct” and “missed warning signs.” The GHF has continued
      to push organizations to work with it as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues
      to worsen. On July 6, the GHF announced that it had met with the Country Director
      of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) to propose a plan to help it “feed the
      north of Gaza.” “Right now, nearly all their trucks are being looted,” the GHF
      said. “We hope they will put politics aside and accept our proposal soon so we
      can achieve our shared mission: getting more aid to the people of Gaza.” The GHF
      was responding to a WFP statement that the need for food in Gaza was desperate.
      “WFP stand ready to assist the entire population,” the WFP said. “We have the
      food, the capacity and the systems.” The WFP could not be reached for comment.
      In an abrupt development on Monday, July 7, the GHF announced the closure of its
      center in central Gaza near the Netzarim Corridor until further notice. This was
      followed by another announcement Wednesday, July 9, declaring the closure of its
      distribution point in Khan Younis. At present, only the GHF’s distribution center
      in Rafah remains operational. These announcements come amid ongoing ceasefire
      negotiations between Israel and Hamas. One of Hamas’s conditions for the prospective
      60-day ceasefire period is that aid distributions be handled exclusively by the
      United Nations and its agencies operating in Gaza, completely excluding the GHF.
      This condition was reportedly accepted in the ceasefire talks. This has led local
      reporters to speculate that the closure of the GHF’s distribution centers indicates
      that agreement regarding the ceasefire’s terms are near, with the GHF complying
      with Hamas’s demand by halting its operations in the Strip. Local sources say
      it is expected that the Rafah distribution center may also be closed in the coming
      days, signaling that the ceasefire might soon go into effect. Muhammad Eslayeh

      donation . By Tareq S. Hajjaj / Mondoweiss The Israel-backed and U.S.-run Gaza
      Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has been weathering one public relations disaster
      after another as new information continues to expose the organization’s complicity
      in Israel’s plans to “ concentrate ” Gaza’s population in camps ahead of their
      forcible displacement — in keeping with Israel’s stated military goals of conquering
      the Strip and expelling its people. In service of these goals, the GHF has replaced
      the UN’s aid distribution system with what Gazans describe as “ death traps ,”
      leading Palestinians to accuse the organization of fulfilling Israeli military
      objectives under the guise of humanitarianism. In order to bolster this facade,
      the GHF has been actively attempting to pressure international humanitarian organizations
      into cooperating with the GHF and participating in its operations. The GHF has
      also actively attempted to form a local network of distributors run by companies
      known to have collaborated with the Israeli army in the past. Speaking with several
      individuals and organizations approached by the GHF, Mondoweiss investigations
      reveal that Israel and the GHF are attempting to coerce local and international
      actors into cooperating with the U.S.-Israeli aid scheme. In some cases, the GHF
      has tasked local companies to engage in outreach to the population to advertise
      its centers and handle distribution and logistics. According to sources inside
      Gaza, the Israeli army is also pursuing a broader strategy of pressuring humanitarian
      organizations to either operate under the GHF framework or cease their activities
      altogether. The Israeli military has reportedly forced several international organizations
      to distribute their aid through GHF centers, overriding previous agreements that
      allowed them to operate independently. In many cases, aid shipments that entered
      through Israeli-controlled crossings were redirected — without the knowledge or
      consent of the aid organizations — to the U.S. company’s centers. An official
      security source in the Gaza civil government told Mondoweiss in mid-June that
      Hamas possesses “reliable intelligence” confirming that the GHF has been pressuring
      local institutions to participate in its operations. These attempts were meant
      to force organizations to cooperate in a strategy of “engineering starvation and
      managing chaos,” the official said, which he said was part of “a politically motivated
      and security-driven project disguised in humanitarian garb.” “However, these institutions,
      guided by their national consciousness and ethical commitment, refused to become
      tools for a party responsible for our people’s suffering,” he added. But there
      are some organizations that have cooperated. The GHF and the Israeli army have
      essentially pursued two paths in dominating the humanitarian landscape in Gaza:
      forcing international organizations to either work with the GHF or to halt operations,
      and using local gangs and businesses as part of its “native” network, giving a
      Palestinian face to an Israeli-U.S. operation with military and political objectives.
      Here is how it has attempted to achieve the objective of building this network
      of “aid collaborators.” The case of the al-Khozandar Company On the night of June
      11, 12 employees working for a local trading company were killed after being publicly
      detained by groups affiliated with Hamas’s security forces. Locals said they were
      from the Arrow Force , the Hamas unit tasked with hunting down looters and Israeli-backed
      gangs in Gaza. After being reportedly beaten and shot in the foot, the security
      members publicly accused the individuals of working for a company allegedly collaborating
      with the Israeli military. Eyewitnesses told Mondoweiss that the employees were
      then lynched by a crowd of people who were allegedly incited by the security members,
      who reportedly told the crowds that the employees were responsible for the deaths
      of their loved ones at GHF sites. It later became clear that the individuals were
      employees of the al-Khozandar Company, a commercial firm owned by a Palestinian
      residing in Cairo. The killing of the employees sparked controversy and outrage,
      with the victims’ families issuing a statement on June 17 demanding accountability.
      The statement also denied allegations that their sons were working with the Israeli-backed
      gang led by Yasser Abu Shabab that loots aid across Gaza, calling the accusations
      “false and baseless.” The events surrounding the incident, however, reveal a more
      complex picture. Before the families had issued their statement, the GHF condemned
      the “murder of 12 of our aid workers.” In contrast, the families stated that their
      sons were on their first day of work for al-Khozandar, suggesting that the company
      was working closely with the GHF. The security source in the Gaza government who
      spoke to Mondoweiss in June identified the Mohsen al-Khozandar Trading and Transport
      corporation, headed by a man named Muhammad al-Khozandar, as a “morally and nationally
      compromised” company that “coordinates directly with suspicious foreign actors
      at the expense of our people’s interests.” This company, the source added, “contributes,
      whether knowingly or not, to the systematic killing and starvation of Palestinians.”
      He asserted that “certain measures” have already been taken against the company,
      and that “more will follow,” including classifying the company as a “complicit
      entity.” The Khozandar company has been operating in Gaza for years. Also known
      as “Three Brothers,” the company specialized in bringing goods into Gaza in coordination
      with Israel before the war, which led Hamas to classify the company as “collaborating
      with the occupation,” according to the security source. The source added that,
      during the war, the company’s activities expanded noticeably beyond trade, raising
      suspicions of collaboration with the Israeli army’s military plans. According
      to the Geneva Council for Rights and Liberties , Palestinian workers employed
      by Three Brothers have been “forced to work under conditions resembling modern
      slavery,” and have been forced to sort and load aid boxes under direct Israeli
      supervision and to “serve American mercenaries.” The workers were subject to degrading
      searches by Israeli soldiers, and were not paid any wages, only receiving a few
      cigarettes and a single daily meal as compensation, according to the Geneva Council,
      based on testimony it says it has verified. Al-Khozandar began implementing the
      U.S.-Israeli aid distribution scheme in Rafah after it contracted with Safe Reach
      Solution (SRS), a military contractor that is also the parent company of the GHF
      and has reportedly conducted military-intelligence operations in Gaza using Israeli
      data. According to a Financial Times investigation, the arrangement was for SRS
      to provide security at the GHF centers, while the Khozandar company would run
      distribution, specifically at the Tal Sultan center in Rafah. According to local
      reports, al-Khozandar’s role in the aid scheme is to engage local individuals
      and civil society organizations to cooperate with the GHF, while the FT investigation
      quoted a source that said Three Brothers would be “the first interface with the
      population” at the distribution sites, and that the Khozandar team “was well known
      to the Israeli security establishment and had a long history of working with them.”
      The FT reported that SRS had approached several other prominent businessmen in
      Gaza to staff the centers, but that they refused to participate in the U.S.-Israeli
      scheme, “arguing it amounted to forced displacement of people in the enclave.”
      Meanwhile, the al-Khozandar family in Gaza issued a statement in May disavowing
      the Mohsen Khozandar Company and condemning any activities carried out by Muhammad
      al-Khozandar and his brothers, who manage the firm. The statement was supported
      by the Contractors Union and business owners in Gaza, who described any cooperation
      with this scheme as a “betrayal of national unity” and demanded strict accountability
      for all those involved. Local testimonies also indicate that the company’s managers
      from the al-Khozandar family phoned several prominent influencers and content
      creators in Gaza, urging them to promote the company’s aid centers and claiming
      they were safe and free from inspections or any violations of people’s dignity.
      Yahya Hilles, a digital creator , told Mondoweiss that a person going by the name
      of Noor al-Khozandar contacted him and spoke with him for over an hour, trying
      to convince him to encourage people to go to the GHF centers. Hilles explained
      that he consulted his family elders, who firmly opposed any involvement in promoting
      this project. “Noor al-Khozandar kept insisting, urging me to go, film, and promote
      the centers, but I repeatedly asked him why he came to me specifically,” Hilles
      said. “He gave no clear answer. He knew that people trust me and believe what
      I share on social media, so he wants to drag me into this. He told me there would
      be no soldiers or Americans, and that I would just carry aid and return home.”
      “I knew that, even if things might go smoothly the first or second time, it might
      later turn into a disaster,” Hilles added. “In that case, I would be responsible
      before my people, so I categorically refused. I told him clearly: this issue is
      bigger than one person, with serious security and political implications. It cannot
      be handled through a simple call from one person to another.” Israeli army attempts
      to strong-arm international organizations Rahma Worldwide is among the most active
      humanitarian organizations in Gaza since the war began, although it has been operating
      in the territory since 2017. During the war, it became notably involved in facilitating
      the entry of medical delegations and volunteers to Gaza hospitals, where they
      provided services for a limited time before leaving the territory. The organization
      has an extensive history in humanitarian relief. Recently, however, the Israeli
      military attempted to coerce Rahma Worldwide into operating under the umbrella
      of the GHF. In late May, the organization’s director, Dr. Shadi Zaza, told Mondoweiss
      that Rahma Worldwide rejected the collaboration. Zaza stated that the organization
      operates in Gaza as part of a group that includes several humanitarian institutions,
      including some affiliated with the UN. He said that the Israeli army had informed
      them of the addition of a new institution — the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation —
      to this group, and later announced changes to the aid distribution plan, including
      designating new distribution points where each organization would be required
      to send its staff. “We are always on standby,” Zaza said. “We’re ready anytime
      we’re permitted to bring in aid. Our goods are prepared and waiting at the crossings.”
      He noted that Rahma Worldwide had received permission the previous month to deliver
      four trucks carrying 4,000 food parcels, only to be surprised by an Israeli army
      order to transfer the aid to distribution points managed by the GHF, along with
      a demand that Rahma staff help with distribution there. “We categorically refused
      this request,” Zaza stated. “Our agreement with the army was clear — we would
      distribute our parcels at locations designated for our organization, not those
      belonging to any other.” Despite Rahma Worldwide’s request that the parcels be
      redirected to their own sites, the army insisted on sending them to the GHF-run
      facilities. The army also declared that GHF was now the sole authority responsible
      for aid distribution in Gaza. Accordingly, the 4,000 parcels were transferred
      to Rafah, and the army contacted Rahma’s team, urging them to assist with distribution.
      But the team reached out to the organization’s U.S. headquarters, which unequivocally
      rejected involvement with Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. “We will not be part of
      this mechanism. We reject it entirely,” said Al-Zaza, highlighting that the army
      continues to pressure aid groups, especially those importing goods from Egypt,
      Jordan, or even the West Bank, insisting that all items be sourced from within
      Israel. As a final request, Rahma Worldwide asked for its logos to be removed
      from the food boxes that were to be distributed at the GHF’s sites to avoid appearing
      as a participant or collaborator in the distribution scheme. This reflects the
      organization’s firm opposition to the scheme, Zaza said. According to the organization,
      some of the logos were removed, but boxes bearing the Rahma logo were nonetheless
      distributed at locations affiliated with the GHF at least on one occasion, which
      the organization said was beyond its control. Rahma identified these Israeli efforts
      early on as attempts to forcibly integrate it into the GHF’s network. Upon the
      organization’s refusal, the army imposed even more stringent conditions for aid
      entry. “We have over 20,000 food parcels ready in our warehouses,” Zaza added.
      “But we refuse to deliver them through the American organization’s mechanism.
      That organization was originally just one of many working here—we had no issue
      with that. But now that it’s trying to monopolize aid and impose its control,
      that is completely unacceptable.” This stance of refusal reflects a broader trend
      among humanitarian organizations in Gaza, many of which oppose the GHF for its
      role in facilitating Israeli military objectives. Continued pressure for these
      organizations to work with the GHF or leave, some warn, could lead to the withdrawal
      of many aid organizations from Gaza entirely, creating a severe gap in humanitarian
      assistance. “If Israel continues imposing this style of control and management,
      we simply won’t bring in aid,” Zaza said. “Other organizations may follow our
      lead. This policy — though unofficial — may well be Israel’s way of clearing the
      field of independent organizations and turning humanitarian work into a fully
      controlled instrument.” Some international humanitarian organizations have begun
      cutting ties with the Boston Consulting Group, the company that helped conceive
      and launch the GHF and had even modelled the costs of “relocating” Palestinians
      outside of Gaza. Save the Children recently ended a two-decade partnership with
      the BCG over its role in the GHF, calling the aid organization’s plan to forcibly
      displace Gaza’s population “utterly unacceptable.” BCG’s chief executive admitted
      that its involvement in the GHF was “reputationally damaging” and the result of
      “deliberate individual misconduct” and “missed warning signs.” The GHF has continued
      to push organizations to work with it as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues
      to worsen. On July 6, the GHF announced that it had met with the Country Director
      of the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) to propose a plan to help it “feed the
      north of Gaza.” “Right now, nearly all their trucks are being looted,” the GHF
      said. “We hope they will put politics aside and accept our proposal soon so we
      can achieve our shared mission: getting more aid to the people of Gaza.” The GHF
      was responding to a WFP statement that the need for food in Gaza was desperate.
      “WFP stand ready to assist the entire population,” the WFP said. “We have the
      food, the capacity and the systems.” The WFP could not be reached for comment.
      In an abrupt development on Monday, July 7, the GHF announced the closure of its
      center in central Gaza near the Netzarim Corridor until further notice. This was
      followed by another announcement Wednesday, July 9, declaring the closure of its
      distribution point in Khan Younis. At present, only the GHF’s distribution center
      in Rafah remains operational. These announcements come amid ongoing ceasefire
      negotiations between Israel and Hamas. One of Hamas’s conditions for the prospective
      60-day ceasefire period is that aid distributions be handled exclusively by the
      United Nations and its agencies operating in Gaza, completely excluding the GHF.
      This condition was reportedly accepted in the ceasefire talks. This has led local
      reporters to speculate that the closure of the GHF’s distribution centers indicates
      that agreement regarding the ceasefire’s terms are near, with the GHF complying
      with Hamas’s demand by halting its operations in the Strip. Local sources say
      it is expected that the Rafah distribution center may also be closed in the coming
      days, signaling that the ceasefire might soon go into effect. Muhammad Eslayeh

      Imperialism

      ScheerPost to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to
      pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Ben
      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report The Global South-led organization BRICS has
      been growing in size and influence, and this has frightened some Western politicians.
      Donald Trump is particularly rattled. After he returned to the White House for
      his second term as US president, Trump threatened very high tariffs on BRICS,
      and falsely said he had destroyed the organization. “BRICS is dead”, Trump claimed
      in a press conference on 13 February. The US president stated: BRICS was put there
      for a bad purpose, and most of those people don’t want — they don’t even want
      to talk about it now; they’re afraid to talk about it. Because I told them, if
      they want to play games with the dollar, then they’re going to be hit with a 100%
      tariff, the day they mention that they want to do it. And they will come back
      and say, “We beg you, we beg you not to do this”. BRICS is dead, since I mentioned
      that. BRICS died the minute I mentioned that. And I know, I remember when Obama
      and Biden in particular, I guess he said that, “Oh, they have us over a barrel”.
      They don’t have us over a barrel; we have them over a barrel. If BRICS wants to
      play games, those countries won’t trade with us; we won’t trade with them. And
      if any trading gets through, it’ll be a 100% tariff, at least. Trump’s claim that
      “BRICS is dead” could not be further from the truth. The exact opposite is happening:
      BRICS is continuously expanding. 2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro, Brazil In
      July, representatives of BRICS countries gathered in Brazil for an annual summit.
      This was the first meeting that featured the 10 partner countries that were added
      to BRICS in 2025, in addition to the new members that were admitted in 2024. BRICS
      now consists of 20 countries. The 10 BRICS members are the founding five — Brazil,
      Russia, India, China, and South Africa — plus Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran,
      and the United Arab Emirates. The 10 BRICS partners are Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba,
      Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The
      2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro was historic, because it included for the
      first time the participation of Vietnam , which had been admitted to the group
      in June. Geopolitical Economy Report previously detailed how the US government
      has tried to divide China and Vietnam , in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit
      Hanoi for Washington’s Cold War Two against Beijing. Vietnam’s decision to join
      BRICS was a clear sign that its foreign policy remains independent and non-aligned.
      Moreover, on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil, Reuters reported that
      Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China’s Premier Li Qiang held a friendly
      meeting, and “ agreed to boost trade and investment ties”. The 2025 BRICS summit
      also featured the participation of Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel. This was
      symbolic, given that Cuba has suffered under illegal US sanctions and a devastating
      blockade for more than 60 years, despite the fact that, every year the United
      Nations General Assembly, nearly every country on Earth votes to demand an end
      to the criminal US embargo. The vision that BRICS has for a more multipolar world,
      where the Global South is equal and the colonialist nations of the Global North
      no longer have an unfair “exorbitant privilege”, is very attractive to most countries
      on Earth. Even the United States’ top trading partner and southern neighbor, Mexico,
      participated in the BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro. Mexico’s progressive President
      Claudia Sheinbaum sent Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente to Brazil to
      participate, even though Mexico is not officially a member or partner of BRICS.
      The Mexican government announced that it had been invited to serve as an “observer”
      by Brazil, which holds the annual rotating BRICS presidency for 2025. Trump threatens
      more tariffs on BRICS countries The US president clearly was unsettled by the
      BRICS summit held in Brazil on 6 July, because on that day he took to his website
      Truth Social to threaten the organization. “Any Country aligning themselves with
      the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff”,
      Trump wrote. “There will be no exceptions to this policy”, he added. This 10%
      tariff threat was a significant reduction of the 100% duty that Trump had originally
      vowed to impose on BRICS countries. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva shot back
      at Trump’s threats, implying that the US president was trying to become a global
      “emperor”. “The world has changed. We don’t want an emperor”, Lula said . “This
      is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from
      the economic perspective”, Lula added. “I think that’s why the BRICS are making
      people uncomfortable”. Trump falsely claimed that Spain is part of BRICS Nevertheless,
      it should be underscored that Trump doesn’t really understand what BRICS is. In
      a White House press conference in January, Trump again threatened BRICS, and he
      falsely claimed that Spain is part of the Global South-led organization. The European
      nation is not involved, and never has been. Trump said: They’re a BRICS nation,
      Spain. You know what a BRICS nation is? You’ll figure it out. But — and if the
      BRICS nations want to do that, that’s okay, but we’re going to put at least a
      100% tariff on the business they do with the United States. You know what the
      BRICS is, right? You guys know, you know what I’m saying, you know what I’m saying.
      BRICS: 44% of global GDP (PPP), 56% of world population The US government’s fear
      of BRICS is rooted in the Global South-led organization’s increasing power. The
      20 BRICS members and partners already represent more than two-fifths of the global
      economy: 43.93% of world GDP , when measured at purchasing power parity (PPP).
      The BRICS 20 also have a combined population of 4.45 billion, meaning they represent
      55.61% of the global population — the majority of the world. BRICS discusses dedollarization
      One of the key issues discussed at the 2025 BRICS summit was dedollarization —
      the attempt to create alternatives to the US dollar as the global reserve currency.
      Brazil’s left-wing President Lula da Silva has long been an advocate of dedollarization
      . “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don’t have to pass through
      the dollar”, Lula said at the BRICS summit . “Obviously, we have to be responsible
      about doing that carefully. Our central banks have to discuss it with central
      banks from other countries”, the Brazilian leader explained, according to Reuters.
      He added, “That’s something that happens gradually until it’s consolidated”. Lula
      qualified that dedollarization is “complicated” and will be a slow, gradual process,
      but he maintained that it is necessary. At the 2025 BRICS summit, the Brazilian
      president even reiterated his call for the creation of a new global currency to
      challenge the US dollar. “That’s why your debate about the need for a new trade
      currency is so important . Is it complicated? I know. There are political challenges.
      But if we don’t find a new formula, we’ll end the 21st century the same way we
      started the 20th. And that won’t benefit humanity”, Lula said. BRICS initiatives
      to advance dedollarization At the summit on 6 July, 2025, the 20 BRICS members
      and partners signed a lengthy joint statement. The Rio de Janeiro Declaration
      was 31 pages long, and consisted of 126 points, encompassing a wide variety of
      subjects. The joint declaration made many references to BRICS initiatives to encourage
      dedollarization. It called to strengthen the BRICS bank, the New Development Bank
      (NDB), to “support its growing role as a robust and strategic agent of development
      and modernization in the Global South”. In particular, the document emphasized
      the need for the NDB to “expand local currency financing”. The BRICS declaration
      similarly urged further development of the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA),
      which could serve as an alternative to the US-dominated International Monetary
      Fund (IMF), by providing short-term liquidity to countries facing balance-of-payments
      crises. Another initiative discussed in the document was the New Investment Platform
      (NIP), which seeks to facilitate investments in local currencies, instead of US
      dollars, British pounds, or euro. The declaration addressed the BRICS Interbank
      Cooperation Mechanism (ICM), which is working on “finding acceptable mechanisms
      of financing in local currencies”. The joint statement also highlighted the work
      of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative and BRICS Payment Task Force (BPTF),
      which it noted are identifying “the potential for greater interoperability of
      BRICS payment systems”, as part of “efforts to facilitate fast, low-cost, more
      accessible, efficient, transparent, and safe cross-border payments among BRICS
      countries and other nations and which can support greater trade and investment
      flows”. BRICS New Development Bank expands The current chief of the BRICS bank
      is Dilma Rousseff, the former president of Brazil, from Lula’s left-wing Workers’
      Party. She announced that two more countries had joined the New Development Bank:
      Colombia and Uzbekistan. Colombia’s accession was especially symbolic, given that
      the South American nation has historically been one of the closest allies of the
      United States. Under its first ever left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, Colombia
      has adopted a more non-aligned foreign policy, and has expressed support for BRICS.
      Just a few days before the BRICS summit, leaked audio recordings exposed the US
      government’s links to a coup attempt against Colombia’s democratically elected
      left-wing leader. With the addition of Colombia and Uzbekistan, the New Development
      Bank now has 11 members, including the founding five of Brazil, Russia, India,
      China, and South Africa, plus the United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh, Egypt, and
      Algeria. BRICS promotes trade, investment, and lending in local currencies In
      her remarks at the BRICS summit, Dilma emphasized that the New Development Bank
      is promoting financing in local currencies. “Any business or government that borrows
      in foreign currency becomes subject to decisions made by the Federal Reserve or
      other central banks in developed nations”, she said, warning of exchange-rate
      risk and currency volatility. As a positive example of an alternative, the BRICS
      website noted that Dilma “pointed to a project in Brasil funded directly in renminbi,
      without the need for dollar conversion”. The official BRICS readout of Dilma’s
      speech emphasized that “local-currency operations will remain an absolute priority
      as a means of building a more diverse, balanced international financial system”.
      Dedollarization will be slow and steady, the NDB president stressed. The role
      of the US dollar as the global reserve currency will not end overnight, “But the
      rise of initiatives to expand trade in local currencies is undeniable, and I see
      that as a positive development”, Dilma explained. BRICS follows in footsteps of
      Non-Aligned Movement and Bandung Conference In speeches they delivered at the
      2025 summit, several Global South leaders emphasized that they see BRICS as following
      in the footsteps of the Non-Aligned Movement and the anti-colonial Bandung Conference
      of 1955. Brazil’s President Lula declared that “BRICS is an indispensable actor
      in the struggle for a multipolar, less asymmetrical, and more peaceful world”.
      He lamented that the US-dominated international financial system benefits the
      rich colonial countries at the expense of the poor, formerly colonized ones. Lula
      stated (emphasis added): The frameworks of the World Bank and the IMF currently
      support a “ reverse Marshall Plan ,” where emerging and developing economies essentially
      finance the more developed world. International aid flows have decreased, and
      debt costs for the poorest countries have soared. The neoliberal model only deepens
      inequalities. For instance, 3000 billionaires have collectively earned USD 6.5
      trillion since 2015. Tax justice and the fight against tax evasion are essential
      to truly consolidate inclusive and sustainable growth strategies fit for the 21st
      century. In another speech at the BRICS summit, the Brazilian president said the
      following (emphasis added): The United Nations recently marked its 80 th anniversary
      on June 26 of this year, and we are witnessing an unprecedented collapse of multilateralism.
      The advent of the UN marked the defeat of Nazi-Fascism and the birth of a sense
      of collective hope. The vast majority of countries that currently comprise the
      BRICS were among its founders. Ten years later, the Bandung Conference refuted
      the division of the world into zones of influence and advanced the fight for a
      multipolar international order. BRICS is an heir of the Non-Aligned Movement.
      With multilateralism under attack, our autonomy is once again in check. … International
      law has become a dead letter , as has the pacific resolution of controversies.
      We are before an unprecedented number of conflicts since World War II. NATO’s
      recent decision feeds the arms race. It is easier to designate 5% of the GDP to
      military spending than to allocate the 0.7% that has been promised for Official
      Development Assistance. Lula condemned the “genocidal practices by Israel in Gaza,
      the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians, and the use of starvation as
      a weapon of war”. The Brazilian government demanded an “end of the Israeli occupation
      and the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State”. Lula also “denounced
      the violations of Iran’s territorial integrity” by the United States and Israel.
      Lamenting the “loss of credibility and paralysis” in the UN Security Council,
      due to Washington’s abuse of its veto power, Brazil reiterated its call for “deep
      transformations in the Security Council”, with the inclusion of “new permanent
      members from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean”. Malaysia’s Prime
      Minister Anwar Ibrahim also delivered a powerful speech likening BRICS to the
      Non-Aligned Movement and Bandung Conference. Anwar stated (emphasis added): It
      is a historic moment for those of you who have been following the antecedents
      of history, who realize the attempt to save the voice of newly emerging economies
      and countries post colonialism was by Sukarno of Indonesia, Zhou Enlai of China,
      Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Kwame Nkrumah of Africa. It was a bold attempt to ensure
      that the voice of conscience, those struggling for freedom and justice is heard.
      Not much success. It was a bold attempt. Then we have a Non-aligned Movement ,
      proceeding that. Then we have G77 , still not achieving the desired results. Now,
      I salute you, President Lula, for having the courage to proceed with a clear vision,
      a clear commitment to voice the concerns, aspirations of the people, particularly
      of the Global South. … We have enormous potential to increase because only with
      that strength can we safely, fairly, justly negotiate with all other partners
      multilaterally. We must demand a change. Democratic, just international and multilateral
      organization from the United Nations to WTO to IMF in the World Bank … We have
      attempted in ASEAN other than enhancing international trade is even using financial
      settlement systems. We use our local currency. Of course, we’re not talking about
      de-dollarization because there’s a long way to go, but at least we try, Malaysia
      with Indonesia, Malaysia with Thailand, and together with China, trying to use
      our own local currency, even beginning with 10 or 20%, it makes a difference,
      because we cannot continue complaining but not executing our own plan among in
      our countries and our friendly neighbors. … But I come back to the major and central
      issue: BRICS today of 2025 is not the first attempt. The Bandung Conference of
      1955 — at that time we were struggling, No industry, no new technology, no competence
      except for a united nation, the country, and political leadership. Now we have
      political leadership with that vision and we have strong business community. Editor’s

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the growing influence of the BRICS organization,
      which has alarmed some Western politicians, particularly Donald Trump. After returning
      to the White House, Trump claimed that BRICS was "dead" and threatened high tariffs
      on its members if they engaged in trade that undermined the US dollar. Despite
      his assertions, the article argues that BRICS is actually expanding, with a recent
      summit in Brazil marking the inclusion of ten new partner countries, bringing
      its total membership to 20. The piece emphasizes the contrast between Trump's
      rhetoric and the reality of BRICS's increasing prominence on the global stage.

      Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report The Global South-led organization BRICS has
      been growing in size and influence, and this has frightened some Western politicians.
      Donald Trump is particularly rattled. After he returned to the White House for
      his second term as US president, Trump threatened very high tariffs on BRICS,
      and falsely said he had destroyed the organization. “BRICS is dead”, Trump claimed
      in a press conference on 13 February. The US president stated: BRICS was put there
      for a bad purpose, and most of those people don’t want — they don’t even want
      to talk about it now; they’re afraid to talk about it. Because I told them, if
      they want to play games with the dollar, then they’re going to be hit with a 100%
      tariff, the day they mention that they want to do it. And they will come back
      and say, “We beg you, we beg you not to do this”. BRICS is dead, since I mentioned
      that. BRICS died the minute I mentioned that. And I know, I remember when Obama
      and Biden in particular, I guess he said that, “Oh, they have us over a barrel”.
      They don’t have us over a barrel; we have them over a barrel. If BRICS wants to
      play games, those countries won’t trade with us; we won’t trade with them. And
      if any trading gets through, it’ll be a 100% tariff, at least. Trump’s claim that
      “BRICS is dead” could not be further from the truth. The exact opposite is happening:
      BRICS is continuously expanding. 2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro, Brazil In
      July, representatives of BRICS countries gathered in Brazil for an annual summit.
      This was the first meeting that featured the 10 partner countries that were added
      to BRICS in 2025, in addition to the new members that were admitted in 2024. BRICS
      now consists of 20 countries. The 10 BRICS members are the founding five — Brazil,
      Russia, India, China, and South Africa — plus Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran,
      and the United Arab Emirates. The 10 BRICS partners are Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba,
      Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The
      2025 BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro was historic, because it included for the
      first time the participation of Vietnam , which had been admitted to the group
      in June. Geopolitical Economy Report previously detailed how the US government
      has tried to divide China and Vietnam , in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit
      Hanoi for Washington’s Cold War Two against Beijing. Vietnam’s decision to join
      BRICS was a clear sign that its foreign policy remains independent and non-aligned.
      Moreover, on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Brazil, Reuters reported that
      Vietnam’s Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and China’s Premier Li Qiang held a friendly
      meeting, and “ agreed to boost trade and investment ties”. The 2025 BRICS summit
      also featured the participation of Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel. This was
      symbolic, given that Cuba has suffered under illegal US sanctions and a devastating
      blockade for more than 60 years, despite the fact that, every year the United
      Nations General Assembly, nearly every country on Earth votes to demand an end
      to the criminal US embargo. The vision that BRICS has for a more multipolar world,
      where the Global South is equal and the colonialist nations of the Global North
      no longer have an unfair “exorbitant privilege”, is very attractive to most countries
      on Earth. Even the United States’ top trading partner and southern neighbor, Mexico,
      participated in the BRICS summit in Río de Janeiro. Mexico’s progressive President
      Claudia Sheinbaum sent Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente to Brazil to
      participate, even though Mexico is not officially a member or partner of BRICS.
      The Mexican government announced that it had been invited to serve as an “observer”
      by Brazil, which holds the annual rotating BRICS presidency for 2025. Trump threatens
      more tariffs on BRICS countries The US president clearly was unsettled by the
      BRICS summit held in Brazil on 6 July, because on that day he took to his website
      Truth Social to threaten the organization. “Any Country aligning themselves with
      the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff”,
      Trump wrote. “There will be no exceptions to this policy”, he added. This 10%
      tariff threat was a significant reduction of the 100% duty that Trump had originally
      vowed to impose on BRICS countries. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva shot back
      at Trump’s threats, implying that the US president was trying to become a global
      “emperor”. “The world has changed. We don’t want an emperor”, Lula said . “This
      is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from
      the economic perspective”, Lula added. “I think that’s why the BRICS are making
      people uncomfortable”. Trump falsely claimed that Spain is part of BRICS Nevertheless,
      it should be underscored that Trump doesn’t really understand what BRICS is. In
      a White House press conference in January, Trump again threatened BRICS, and he
      falsely claimed that Spain is part of the Global South-led organization. The European
      nation is not involved, and never has been. Trump said: They’re a BRICS nation,
      Spain. You know what a BRICS nation is? You’ll figure it out. But — and if the
      BRICS nations want to do that, that’s okay, but we’re going to put at least a
      100% tariff on the business they do with the United States. You know what the
      BRICS is, right? You guys know, you know what I’m saying, you know what I’m saying.
      BRICS: 44% of global GDP (PPP), 56% of world population The US government’s fear
      of BRICS is rooted in the Global South-led organization’s increasing power. The
      20 BRICS members and partners already represent more than two-fifths of the global
      economy: 43.93% of world GDP , when measured at purchasing power parity (PPP).
      The BRICS 20 also have a combined population of 4.45 billion, meaning they represent
      55.61% of the global population — the majority of the world. BRICS discusses dedollarization
      One of the key issues discussed at the 2025 BRICS summit was dedollarization —
      the attempt to create alternatives to the US dollar as the global reserve currency.
      Brazil’s left-wing President Lula da Silva has long been an advocate of dedollarization
      . “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don’t have to pass through
      the dollar”, Lula said at the BRICS summit . “Obviously, we have to be responsible
      about doing that carefully. Our central banks have to discuss it with central
      banks from other countries”, the Brazilian leader explained, according to Reuters.
      He added, “That’s something that happens gradually until it’s consolidated”. Lula
      qualified that dedollarization is “complicated” and will be a slow, gradual process,
      but he maintained that it is necessary. At the 2025 BRICS summit, the Brazilian
      president even reiterated his call for the creation of a new global currency to
      challenge the US dollar. “That’s why your debate about the need for a new trade
      currency is so important . Is it complicated? I know. There are political challenges.
      But if we don’t find a new formula, we’ll end the 21st century the same way we
      started the 20th. And that won’t benefit humanity”, Lula said. BRICS initiatives
      to advance dedollarization At the summit on 6 July, 2025, the 20 BRICS members
      and partners signed a lengthy joint statement. The Rio de Janeiro Declaration
      was 31 pages long, and consisted of 126 points, encompassing a wide variety of

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the growing influence of the BRICS organization,
      which has alarmed some Western politicians, particularly Donald Trump. After returning
      to the White House, Trump claimed that BRICS was "dead" and threatened high tariffs
      on its members if they engaged in trade that undermined the US dollar. Despite
      his assertions, the article argues that BRICS is actually expanding, with a recent
      summit in Brazil marking the inclusion of ten new partner countries, bringing
      its total membership to 20. The piece emphasizes the contrast between Trump's
      rhetoric and the reality of BRICS's increasing prominence on the global stage.

    text: 'By Chris Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report This interview is also available
      on podcast platforms and Rumble . Following attacks on Iran by Israel and the
      United States, the world held its breath as the prospect of World War III loomed
      on the horizon. After 12 days of conflict, a ceasefire has brought about new uncertainty
      for the future. Former British diplomat Alastair Crooke joins host Chris Hedges
      on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to make sense of the current situation
      in the Middle East and what can be expected in the coming weeks or months. Crooke
      details the lead up to the Israeli attacks, including the use of technology and
      neighbouring countries that allowed for the element of surprise. Cyber attacks,
      drones flown in from Azerbaijan and American military software served as crucial
      elements for the Israeli attacks on Iran. As for the American strikes weeks later,
      Crooke explains Donald Trump’s alleged anxiety in not engaging in a prolonged
      conflict and theorizes about what the damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities actually
      looks like and what it could mean going forward. Hedges and Crooke lay out what
      could come next, indicating that this conflict is far from over and the future
      of the Middle East, along with the rest of the world’s economy, hinges on what
      comes next from Israel, Iran or the United States. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS

      with the elites, including the Democratic Party elites, clamoring for more and
      more censorship. Bob Scheer, who runs ScheerPost on a shoestring budget, and I
      will not waver in our commitment to independent and honest journalism, and we
      will never put ScheerPost behind a paywall, charge a subscription for it, sell

      my weekly television show, The Chris Hedges Report. Host Chris Hedges Producer:
      Max Jones Intro: Diego Ramos Crew: Diego Ramos, Sofia Menemenlis and Thomas Hedges
      Transcript: Diego Ramos Transcript Chris Hedges The 12-day conflict between Israel,
      the United States and Iran is not over. It is the first phase of what could become
      an endless war, much like Israel’s decades-long sporadic war against Lebanon.
      The attacks on Iran, as with the invasion and occupation of Iraq, was based on
      a lie. Neither U.S. intelligence nor the U.N. concurred with Netanyahu and Trump’s
      claim that Iran was weaponizing its enriched uranium. Israel was able to inflict
      significant damage on Iran, including what it says were the targeted assassinations
      of 30 senior security officials and 11 senior nuclear scientists. But Israel and
      the United States do not appear to have, as Donald Trump insisted, obliterated
      Iran’s nuclear weapons program. At best, it probably set back any enrichment program
      by only a few weeks or months should Iran decide to build a bomb. Iran’s surface-to-surface
      missiles probably caused more damage and casualties than Israel expected, but
      because the Israeli Air Force had virtual control over the skies of Iran it was
      able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficacy. By shredding the
      nuclear agreement with Iran in Trump’s first administration, which the Iranians
      were abiding by, and then allowing Israel to carry out an attack while negotiations
      were ongoing with Iran, the United States and Israel have effectively shut the
      door on any diplomatic resolution to the conflict. The failure of European governments
      to condemn the bombing, a flagrant violation of Iran’s sovereignty, has only widened
      the divide between Iran and the West. Rather than weaken the Iranian regime, these
      attacks have enraged Iranians, especially young Iranians, who poured into the
      streets in the millions for the funerals of the victims of Israel’s attacks. It
      has hardened the resolve of the Iranians rulers who have suspended cooperation
      with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and rejected calls by the Trump
      administration to resume negotiations. Joining me to discuss the fallout from
      this 12-day war and what comes next is Alastair Crooke, a former British diplomat
      who served for many years in the Middle East working as a security advisor to
      the EU special envoy to the Middle East, as well as helping lead efforts to set
      up negotiations and truces between Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian
      resistant groups with Israel. He is also the author of Resistance: The Essence
      of the Islamist Revolution , which analyzes the ascendancy of Islamic movements
      in the Middle East. You can find his work at ConflictsForum.Substack.com . Let’s
      begin with a question that has puzzled me since these attacks began, and that
      is why it was so easy for Israel to take out Iran’s air defenses, which were a
      mixture of Iranian-produced air defenses, of course, but also Russian air defenses.
      Alastair Crooke Well, there’s a certain deception about what happened there. I
      know that it is advertised by Israel and by many in the United States that there
      was open skies and that Israel could actually come across and destroy the air
      defenses. That actually is not true. In fact, if you look, you’ll find there is
      not a single video. Many people were taking shots from their smartphones and things,
      not a single video of an Israeli aircraft over Tehran or Iran as a whole. What
      happened? It’s really very interesting because it has a very important impact.
      What happened was that well before the 13th of June surprise attack that Israel
      mounted on Iran, Israel Mossad and its special forces were pre-positioning anti-tank
      weapons from Kurdistan area, from Erbil and the Kurdistan area of Iraq across
      the border into Iran. Quite close, as close as they could get to the air defense
      systems that were present. And then special forces, Israelis have admitted they
      had special forces in Iran at that time, and the special forces then were coming
      and using ballistic missiles guided by American software, the Battlescape software
      system onto the targets that they wanted. Now, there were no aircraft crossing
      into Iranian airspace except that some aircraft from Israel flew right along the
      north of Iran, which is very mountainous and really deserted, into Azerbaijan,
      the airspace. And from Azerbaijan, Israel launched drones, attack drones. They
      didn’t have such a big warhead. But they also then flew down the Caspian till
      they were opposite Tehran. And from there, the Israeli planes fired these latest
      ballistic cruise missiles. Those are the ones that hit Tehran and made a big impact
      on it. So it was a very complicated setup that had taken months, if not years
      for Mossad to put all of those into position to infiltrate people, pre-position
      them. What took out the Iranian air defences in the first day was actually a cyber
      attack, a really major cyber attack on their air defences, and they managed to
      undo that and to correct it with eight hours after which their air defences were
      working again and you can see there’s evidence, we can see quite clear evidence
      of that happening. Why was Iran in such a vulnerable position? Well, that’s quite
      interesting too, because actually on that day, the 13th of June, scheduled, long
      scheduled, and with the Iranians expecting to go to talks on the Sunday with [United
      States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve] Witkoff in Oman and the Americans
      to talk about the nuclear program, the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]
      had a big program, a big exercise prepared with naval and other forces engaged
      with us and some of the missile launches were actually exposed and put out because
      of this big exercise. I think it involved the Chinese too as well. So they were
      all in this headquarters in a single room in the headquarters when Israel decapitated
      the line commanders of the IRGC and the military staff who were all preparing
      for this big exercise. They were taken by surprise and the decapitation happened.
      What happened with the civilian scientists, they were killed by spike missiles
      fired directly and small ballistic missiles fired by probably the special forces,
      I’m not quite sure, into their homes. Precise strikes into the homes killing them
      and their families too. I think it’s 10 or 11 scientists were killed. So that
      was really what happened. Now, the most important, there are two important things
      that flow from this. The first is this setup is not repeatable. You can’t, I mean,
      it was a very sophisticated, long-prepared positioning people in the site, both
      from the north, from Azerbaijan, and across the border from Kurdistan, the MEK
      [People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran] coming across Kurdistan, setting all
      these up. The cyber attack was set up and prepared and everything was ready for
      this. But now it’s exposed. You can’t go back to it. And also that now, I mean,
      the Iranian air defenses are fully operational. They’re getting more air defenses
      from the Chinese. So it won’t be the same. You can’t just repeat that operation.
      And the talk about open skies was very deceptive. It was really a lie. It wasn’t
      open skies. It was actually something rather different that happened. So that’s
      very important that it’s not something that can be repeated. Israel can’t do this
      next week or the week after. It would take months if possible. But in the meantime,
      Iran is, of course, operating around Erbil and Kurdistan. You’ve probably seen
      there have been many explosions and attacks there. In the north, removing Baluchis
      and refugees from across the border from that area. And there is a tough conversation
      taking place between Russia and [Ilham] Aliyev, the head of the Azeri state and
      also from Iran. So there is a great deal of tension there from Azerbaijan and
      Russia about different things. But it used to have good relations, but now it’s
      very tense indeed there. The Russians suspect that not only those tactics of infiltration,
      of saboteurs were done, if you like, during that attack on Russia’s strategic
      bomber force out of Kazakhstan, but they think that some of them were done by
      part of the illegal and criminal gangs who are Azeris as well as Russian citizens.
      And behind this, Russia sees the hand of Turkey and NATO for both the attack in
      Iran and also the attack that took place, I think it was called the Spider’s Web
      attack [Operation Spiderweb] on those strategic bombers that were out in the open
      on, again, the day before peace talks were taking place. Chris Hedges Let’s talk
      about the American strike. Correct me if I’m wrong, it was my understanding that
      the Israelis did take out air defenses to open a corridor for American bombers,
      but maybe that’s incorrect. And secondly, let’s talk about the, what is it, 408
      kilograms of enriched uranium. I think they’re supposedly at 60%. But let’s talk
      about the American strike. Alastair Crooke Well, the Americans warned these Iranians
      beforehand, either I think probably through the Swiss embassy in Tehran or through,
      perhaps equally likely through Oman, warned them in advance and also told them
      it was once and done, i.e. would be one strike, finish, end of the process. So
      they passed that information to the Iranians and I believe, I can’t budge for
      it perfectly, but my understanding is that the Russians said to them, look, just
      let it happen. It’s much better, just let it happen. You probably won’t, it won’t
      be as damaging as it may be advertised, just let it happen. And it’s true because
      in that time it’s fairly clear. There was no evidence you can see of any great,
      if you like, air defences being used or mounted or explosions. Iranians tell me,
      I was in Iran just before this happened, the Iranians tell me it was very quiet
      that night, there was nothing happening. So they just came in, they did what they
      wanted to do and then they left. What success they had, well, nobody can really
      say. At this stage, anyone who tells you or says they know, I don’t think is telling
      the truth because the only way you know… there are about five entrances to Fordow,
      five different entrances. Two of them were blocked up with soil by the Iranians
      before the strike, two days before. And the whole basis of this depends on a very
      controversial piece of, if you like, mechanics. Most of those entrances to the
      Fordow base have got blast bends in them. In other words, if there’s an explosion,
      it can’t go any further. It can’t reach the centrifuge hole. Centrifuge hole,
      don’t forget, is at 800 meters depth in this mountain. And then there is a vent.
      And this is a source of controversy in America as anywhere else is according to
      the Americans and who brief Trump, the vent had no, if you like, bend in it. It
      was vertical, straight from the surface down to the centrifuge hole. And many
      experts, professors from MIT and others, are very adamant and saying it’s unbelievable
      that the Iranians would have put blast vents in all of the entrances but have
      forget to do it in the vent. Well, I don’t know the answer to that. You’ll have
      to go and ask the professor about that. But, yes, four days beforehand there were
      trucks at Fordow and the Iranians and I think there’s some reasonably reliable
      reporting that the highly enriched uranium was removed and probably deposited
      in this other site called the Pickaxe Mountain, which is also quite close to Qom
      and I would think it’s probably hidden there somewhere. It’s even deeper than
      Fordow by the way, but it’s never mentioned because it seems to be off the radar.
      Anyway, I think that is probably where it is, but until the Iranians clear one
      of these entrances, which they deliberately blocked up to stop pressure rising
      and go into the hall, we won’t know how much damage is done. But I think the Isfahan
      one also is very deep and it’s quite likely that centrifuges were not destroyed
      at Isfahan. Natanz is different. Natanz is very old. It’s there from the Shah’s
      time. It’s mostly on the surface. I remember passing it and you could, you know,
      it’s there and you see it. But they put the centrifuges down I think between 60
      and 80 meters. So I mean, maybe they’re badly damaged, who knows. But they don’t
      need many centrifuges. One of the things that this professor from MIT, Postol,
      Ted Postol says that, you know, once you get to a certain point in the enrichment
      process, then it becomes exponential. You just have to do a tiny bit more and
      that you’re up at 90%. So I mean, you know, they don’t need many centrifuges to
      have survived. Chris Hedges The pilots talked about seeing explosions, but what
      I heard, that was in fact not a good sign. Alastair Crooke Yes, that’s right.
      That is a sign that there was a blast bend on the vent. And so the blast was coming
      up. And that’s why it had a spectacular view of explosion, because it hadn’t gone
      down to the centrifuge floor. It had come up and was at the surface. So it isn’t
      necessarily a good indicator of that. So that was really the gist of it, that
      I think it was clear that Trump wanted it. And we know quite a lot about that
      day because someone, and I wrote about it, it extends to you and I’m sure you
      probably know Michael Wolff, who’s written four books on Trump, and he was talking
      and calling. He works by calling interlocutors that the Trump has just spoken
      to on the phone. And he says it’s a really reliable way of finding out what Trump
      is thinking because he says the same question to each interlocutor. And it’s not
      really a question. So on the 12th, it seemed that… on the 22nd rather, the day
      of the American strike, Trump was quite anxious, according to Michael Wolff. And
      he kept asking people, I mean, is it going to work? Is it going to be a win? Is
      it going to be, I mean, a game changer? I’m hoping for a game change, we want
      something that is perfect and this will be a big headline and a big win and I
      want the headline, “We won.” So he says there was an element of sort of lack of
      confidence, almost, in Trump, I mean he went on saying the same thing you know,
      “this is what it’s got to be: in, boom, out. In, boom out, ceasefire.” And so
      that’s how it was presented. And actually, you know, this suits the Iranians quite
      well, because he says and insists, obliterated. Everything has been obliterated.
      There’s nothing left. It’s all over. No nuclear program. Well, this is fine from
      the Iranian point of view because they say, well then, to sort of [French President
      Emmanuel] Macron and others who saying, well, well, the IAEA have to go back and
      sort of inspect and find out what’s going on. And they say, but it’s you who say
      it’s all over. There isn’t a program. So why do we need the IAEA in there at all?
      In fact, the IAEA are already out and their return, I mean, I’m not exaggerating
      this, they need huge bodyguards if they ever went back to Iran. They are hated
      with a huge intensity by the ordinary population because they believe that particularly
      the assassination of the scientists and the identification of them came from the
      IAEA artificial intelligence program MOSAIC, which is one of the, if you like,
      Palantir stable of targeting systems, which relies on imputing motives to people,
      not on evidence. This is where you get the great disparity with Tulsi Gabbard,
      for example, because what the IAEA were using was this data gathering process
      examining 400 million pieces of data, social, what you read on your social platforms,
      where you move, who your children play with, all of this thing, just like Palantir
      uses the same system in Israel and in Gaza to impute to Israel, to Iran the idea
      that they are not being honest in moving the enriched uranium, that they’re not
      declaring things. And so that’s what happened on the 12th. The day before the
      Israeli attack on Iran, the board of the IAEA on the basis of this evidence said,
      Iran is accelerating towards enrichment and therefore to a bomb. And this is in
      breach of the protocols of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]. This
      is really the pretext for the attack on Iran that took place on Friday the 13th
      of June. That resolution that was prepared and stage managed effectively by the
      IAEA to give, if you like, a peg for the Israeli tact to take place, which is
      why the Iranians and the Russians too are so distrustful of the IAEA and I don’t
      think it’s going back into Iran. Chris Hedges Well, the UN inspection teams in
      Iraq were riddled with foreign intelligence operatives, including Israeli. One
      has to assume that’s also true with the IAEA. Alastair Crooke It’s completely,
      I mean it’s verified. I mean, we know that they were providing intelligence to
      the Mossad and to Israel about, and of course IAEA insisted on meeting the scientists
      involved in the nuclear program and therefore being able to identify them. Whether
      this was directly passed on, I can’t say. But the Iranians have intelligence which
      suggests that it was passed on. I haven’t seen the intelligence. Chris Hedges
      Let’s talk about the strikes on Israel. Of course, because of military censorship
      in Israel, we don’t know the full picture. We know that refineries were hit in
      Haifa. We know the Weizmann Institute was hit. Reading it from a distance, it
      does appear that Israel was probably a little surprised at the extent of the damage
      that the Iranians were able to inflict. Alastair Crooke I think they were very
      shocked by it. They were attacked as they’d never been attacked before. I mean,
      they might have been used to a few Katyusha rockets from Gaza, but this was a
      completely different order. As you say, there’s been a complete news blackout,
      but subsequently, from satellite images, it’s clear that at least five military
      sites were destroyed by the Iranians apart from, if you like, the main ones, which
      was the HaKirya, which was the equivalent of the Pentagon, the Mossad headquarters
      in Herzliya, and various other sites as well, as well as other damages. And those
      other ones are very important because this is key in their economic sense, that
      first of all, there was the attack on Haifa and the destruction of the refinery
      at Haifa. And the Israelis say it will not be able to operate for at least a month.
      And then there was the attack on the Ashdod Port which destroyed the electric
      power system. There’s a generator, the power generator there which led to the
      blackout in about a third of the country. It’s been restored. Israel has three
      ports, Eilat, which has been closed for months, Haifa and Ashdod. Both of those
      were heavily attacked and the economy was really at a halt and this is why Israel
      called to the Omanis and said we need a ceasefire and said the same to America,
      we need it. And the other reason was because they were running out of missiles,
      of intercept missiles. The Israelis themselves say 93 THAAD [Terminal High Altitude
      Area Defense] missiles were fired by the Americans and the Israelis in that period
      of the 12 days. 93, which is equivalent to $1.2 billion worth of missiles, which
      is about two to three years total production capacity of THAAD missile interceptors
      during that period. So again, not only can that operation that they did on the
      13th not be easily resurrected, but at the moment, Israel is going to have to
      wait to re-equip itself with air defenses in a major way before they could think
      of attacking. Iran is also doing the same. The Iranians believe and think that
      there will be a further attack from Israel because it’s not, they believe, in
      Israel’s interest to accept the Trump assertion that the program is over, that
      Israel wants to say that the program is there because that provides them with
      the cue to say, yes, within the ceasefire we have the right to attack when and
      as we want onto Iran, if we suspect that they’re enriching or moving uranium,
      we can attack at our initiative. This is what the basis of the ceasefire in Lebanon
      is, that there is to be a ceasefire, but Israel has the right to attack anywhere
      in Lebanon as it chooses and when it chooses. So they’ve been trying to impose
      the same terms, if you like, on Iran. And I think that is ultimately intended
      to try and pull in America to another round of attacks because the Israeli position
      is still, and this is very important really, that the Israeli position is that
      simply the enrichment program cannot be defeated by military systems alone. The
      only way ultimately to defeat it is by a regime change and the imposition of a
      Western style puppet government into Tehran because they believe that they cannot
      kill the technical knowledge or the will to move ahead with enrichment. I think
      there are two triggers that we should watch. If the West really pushes the Iranians
      to allow some sort of oversight or monitoring of the program with a reformed perhaps
      IAEA or whatever, by the way, Russia won’t push them very hard on that because
      the IAEA, Russia has its own quarrels with the IAEA. But if the West pushes, Trump
      pushes very hard on that, then I think, and it is required under the NPT, the
      Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, monitoring and accountability is part of the treaty.
      If that is pushed, then I think there will be an answer, which is we’re leaving
      the NPT. And if then, which is also likely, the Euro 3 and the JCPOA push for
      a snapback of sanctions on Iran. And they’ve already said publicly that they intend
      to push for snapback sanctions. Part of the whole process of putting more pressure
      on Iran and then the hope that Trump keeps saying that they will then come and
      offer an unconditional surrender, which will never happen. But that’s the plan
      anyway. But those two things were likely to push Iran off the NPT. What happens
      then? We have to wait and see. But there is a very strong patriotic mood, as you
      referred to in the introduction. And what is so striking is it’s the young, the
      people that people thought were not necessarily, you know, supporters of it. And
      they are totally, totally supporting the Supreme Leader. He’s like a sort of celebrity
      figure now for everyone, for the young and for all. So I don’t know whether they
      will decide to move towards a weapon or leave it in sort of strategic ambiguity.
      That’s a possibility too. Chris Hedges Well, these kinds of attacks always generate
      that kind of blowback. I was in Buenos Aires right before the British attacked
      the Falklands and the regime was about to fall, the junta. And then as soon as
      the attack began, these people became national galtiere and all these criminals
      became national heroes. I want to talk about that process because the Supreme
      Leader has, I think it was 2003, had written that it was against Sharia Islamic
      law to build a nuclear weapon. Alastair Crooke That’s perfectly true, but there
      is some important element. Under Sharia jurisprudence there’s a thing called Ijtihad,
      which is that you can change law through reasoning, through a process of reasoning.
      And that reasoning can be changed on the basis of time and circumstances. So that
      if it’s no longer appropriate because the world has moved on and life is different
      or because of a changed circumstances then a jurist, it has to be a jurist, it’s
      not a political decision but a qualified jurist, Hujjat al-Islam or [inaudible]
      can actually change the law and a new fatwa can be issued very easily. It doesn’t
      need parliamentary or a pew but there is a majority in Iran now of people who
      argued that it was a mistake never to go down this route and that this is going
      to be something that is going to be really much more, and this is something the
      Russians have alluded to, which I think is quite significant. They’re saying actually
      this whole proliferation process that the West had is actually back to front because
      actually it’s pushing people ultimately towards a weapon, not preventing them
      because this process of going around and just threatening states we’re going to
      bomb you to the stone age if you don’t do what we tell you actually has ended
      and that’s what happened of course with North Korea. I mean they’d agreed a process
      of giving it up but then more requirements and more requirements were imposed.
      I mean it was all agreed and there was going to be money put in and a new process
      and then the extra demands that Washington imposed on top of the original agreement
      prompted the North Koreans to say, hang it, it’s not worth it, I mean it’s much
      better that we should go for a bomb. So I mean the Russians and others are saying
      well this whole nonproliferation, actually the real proliferators at this moment
      is the West because they keep pushing people towards thinking the only thing that
      they need. And look what’s happened. They bombed Iran and now Saudi Arabia is
      talking about a weapon. Now India is expressing concerns about it and what the
      consequence will be. Other states will be pursuing it. So actually rather than
      stopping proliferation, acting to stop proliferation as the West says it’s doing,
      it is actually encouraging proliferation. That’s the Russian view. [Dmitry] Medvedev
      said that, the Vice President said that quite recently. Chris Hedges We also have
      the example of [Muammar] Gaddafi, who gave up his program. Alastair Crooke Exactly,
      It wasn’t too difficult to take away, I remember, because it was still in its
      packing cases. He hadn’t even unpacked it and it was removed. Anyway, that was,
      yes, there isn’t a good history [inaudible]. Chris Hedges Let’s talk about the
      increased drone activity that apparently is occurring over Iran and what that
      means. Alastair Crooke The Israeli drone activity over Iran at the moment is not
      attack drones. It is mostly surveillance drones. They’re sort of trying to scope
      out radar and the sort of the time it takes for radar to lock onto them and where
      the radar is. And that is being fed into the American, only the Americans have
      this sort of satellite-based battlescape map that sort of tracks all radar and
      air defenses so that you can, if you like, construct your missiles to sort of
      do a slalom between all the impediments to reach your target. So that’s what’s
      happening at the moment. Plus, and I heard this from Tehran just yesterday, they’re
      under huge cyber attack from all NATO, they say. I mean, there’s a big cyber attack
      going. So I think, you know, both parties expect there will be another round and
      Iran’s certainly and Israel is preparing for the next stage. So I think, you know,
      although Trump, and I don’t think he wanted this, I mean, from everything that
      Michael Wolff said about those calls which were, you know, I just want this to
      be perfect. I want this, you know, I want this to be in boom, out, finished, ceasefire,
      done, let’s close it, finish this talk. I think that what Trump is trying to do
      there is he does not, and Michael Wolff says, and I think this is absolutely right,
      he doesn’t think he has the attention span to do a long, drawn-out slugfest fight
      with Iran. What he’s trying to do is shut it down to give him enough space to
      get back to what he really wants, which is, if you like, this new Middle East
      business world, this new structure whereby Lebanon and Syria and others will be
      brought into some form. We will have the Abraham Accords 2.0. And this will open
      a universe of business and trading possibilities through and you know that he
      hopes that Iran can just sort of stand on the sidelines and not do anything about
      it till he can find some other agreement with Iran. The main thing is the headline.
      Let’s have a big headline. We’ve done it. There’s a new Middle East. Everyone’s
      in this new sort of matrix of money, investments, resources, and of course the
      resources of Iran, which are so vital to China. And also the fact that the Gulf
      states and that if he can take that whole, if you like, corridor of the Middle
      East, he can take it into southern Central Asia and disrupt the BRICS and their
      connectivity plans in those stung areas — Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, all those areas.
      He can disrupt it and start moving the economic sphere into this. At the same
      time, that he’s doing, if you like, an attempt to cage China literally by tariffs
      structures. And also weakening Russia by reigniting the tensions in the Caucasus
      again. And so Russia and Putin are taking this very seriously. And so is China.
      And they are very angry about this. They’re angry about the deceit because Putin
      thinks he was deceived by those attacks on the strategic bombers just the day
      before the Istanbul talks just as Iran is. And China believes also that Xi was
      cheated by Trump in the discussions that they had. So there’s a real sort of sense
      of preparing for a new and wider Cold War that is being pushed. I mean, Kazakhstan
      in the north that is, I was in Russia around about the time of the Crocus Hall,
      the concert hall that was burnt down. And they were Tajiks that had come down
      who were found to be responsible. And there was a big structure in Kazakhstan
      for recruiting people, Afghans and Tajiks and others and for infiltrating them
      into Russia or to Iran or whatever. And now we see that Azerbaijan is engaged
      in the same idea. Now the reports, I can’t verify them, but recently Russia arrested
      a number of Azeris-Russian citizens and that produced a dramatic response from
      Aliyev who arrested all the Sputnik journalists and many others in Azerbaijan
      and they roughed them up and they’ve charged them with espionage and other charges.
      Now there’s always been sort of criminal groups in Russia from Azerbaijan. They’re
      known as sort of a mafia there. But this is more serious, I believe, because it’s
      thinking the Russians may be suspected that these groups were also facilitating
      the infiltration of some of those pre-positioned units that were ready for the
      attack on the strategic bomber system in Russia, the Spider’s Web. And that also
      Azerbaijan was facilitating the attack on Iran. So Azerbaijan and Armenia too
      and the question of Turkey’s role. The United States is trying to woo [Recep Tayyip]
      Erdoğan with promises of F-35s, if only he’ll mothball the S-400s that he has
      and I think that the aim is, the Israeli aim is the key to their, if you like,
      their new corridor, the new, if you like, Abraham Accord 2.0, a business plan
      right through to Asia, is that Turkey should persuade both Syria and Lebanon that
      they have no choice and incentivize them both to join into this new sort of greater
      Israel project. So this is why there’s a lot of tensions that all these proposals
      that are coming out of America at the moment, the intent to sort of cut off China
      from trade by putting differential tariffs on China if they trans ship goods through
      Vietnam or another country. The prospect of new sanctions on Russia. The attack
      on Iran is a pivot, a key pivot for Russia and China of the whole BRICS structure.
      All of these things are producing a really strong response from Russia. I mean,
      it’s given very tough response to Trump and this and says, we know exactly what
      you’re doing in the Caucasus. We know what you are doing in Azerbaijan and we
      won’t put up with it. And so Russia responded to this by destroying the two refineries
      in Ukraine that were fueled from Baku, from Azerbaijan. There was Azerbaijan input
      that was fueling these two refineries. This was a warning to Azerbaijan, you know,
      stop playing around with this. So Iran will be saying something rather similar,
      I suspect, to the Azeris. Now, I think some people in the United States think,
      even dream, of the idea that Azerbaijan could invade at the right moment in coordination
      with Israel into Iran as the Baluch perhaps come from another side or the Kurds
      from the other. But I think that is very far-fetched because 85% of the areas
      are Shiʿi. There is, if you like, the leadership is Turkic more than Iranian Shiʿi
      but they’re Turkic, either Sunni or Shiʿi converted. Anyway, it’s very secular.
      And the Iranians, all the Azeris in Iran are very, very loyal to Iran. And people
      talk about, well, the Azeri’s glass ceiling. And I slightly laugh at that. And
      I say, well, there’s one person you probably have heard of who’s really well-known
      poet and he writes in the Azeri language and he’s fluent in the Azeri language
      and he is Azeri and that’s the Supreme Leader. So it’s not that the Azeris are
      completely sort of outliers in Iran. Chris Hedges Didn’t Israel launch drones
      from there? Isn’t that a launch point for… Alastair Crooke Yeah, exactly. They
      launched drones and also, as I say, the airspace of Azerbaijan was used for standoff
      firing of drones that had these new cruise missiles, multiple cruise missiles.
      They could launch them once they were in Iranian territory. Chris Hedges I have
      two last questions, but just on Gaza, because in the meeting in the White House,
      when reporters were allowed in, Trump and Netanyahu were talking about depopulating
      Gaza. Netanyahu very cynically said it’s not a prison. People who want to leave,
      of course, there’s enforced starvation since March 2nd, should have the right
      to leave. Just your thoughts on what’s happening in Gaza. Alastair Crooke What’s
      happening in Gaza is that Netanyahu and the right are intent on first of all pushing
      all the Palestinians into what amounts to a concentration camp in one small part.
      They will be put in but they will not be allowed out of it. And it is a stage
      towards, it’s politely called voluntary expatriation but it is of course mandatory,
      if you like, removal of the population from Gaza. And the same is going on in
      the West Bank. Huge process. [Bezalel] Smotrich is in charge of this aspect. And
      there is a real effort being made because they think they believe they can persuade
      Trump to annex most of the West Bank. But settlers have moved into large areas.
      New settlements are announced all the time. The annexation is afoot in the West
      Bank as in Gaza. I think I remember Smotrich was always very, very clear about
      this. I remember listening to him about six years ago or so and he said, listen,
      this is our plan, to remove all the Palestinians from the area. And he said, but
      you know, as it is with the legal system, it’s difficult. What we need is a big
      crisis or a big war. And when that happens, we will complete the project. That’s
      what we’re looking for. And that’s why they’re always sort of playing around with
      the Temple Mount, Al-Aqsa. Looking to use that perhaps as the pretext to sort
      of trigger a commotion in the whole Muslim world. Al-Aqsa is a neuralgic point
      in the Muslim world, that they could use this as the ability to sort of create
      the crisis that they could then, under the pretext of an emergency, really move,
      finish off the depopulation of Gaza and also much of the West Bank, drive the
      West Bank to Jordan. Chris Hedges Does that mean they would drive the Palestinians
      and try to drive them into Jordan and they would drive the Palestinians in Gaza
      into Egypt? The Egyptians and the Jordanians have been adamant that’s not going
      to happen. Alastair Crooke Yes, but I mean they are pushing them closer and closer
      to the Rafah Gate. And, you know, what’s going to happen if they open those gates
      and just push them out, tou know, a million or so Palestinians? It’s very, very
      sensitive in Egypt. The Egyptians are really, ordinary Egyptians, the Egyptian
      army is very angry with [Abdel Fattah El-]Sisi about his ineffectual response
      to what’s happening in Gaza. It could explode. The whole Egyptian element could
      explode in this process. Of course there will be some sort of public relations
      exercise of sending a few Palestinians to, I don’t know where, but somewhere to
      say, no they went voluntarily. But of course that’s not what’s planned. What’s
      planned is another Nakba from Gaza. And it’s unfolding, sadly, unfortunately.
      You know, Hamas demands are not met by this proposal. This is why I don’t, I think
      what we will get is probably some sort of ceasefire. But it’s a ceasefire designed
      to allow the Israelis to resume the attrition of Gaza either because they’ll claim
      it will break down or because they’ll claim the 60 days are over. And the Hamas
      position remains unchanged — we want an end to the war. We want the removal of
      all of the Israeli troops from Gaza and a reconstruction of the strip. And of
      course, the Witkoff proposal does none of those things. It doesn’t provide for
      an end of the war. There will still be Israeli forces inside Gaza during the ceasefire
      and after. And the proposals for reconstructing it is quite different to be done
      by pliant Arab states. Chris Hedges And we should just draw that parallel between
      decapitating Hamas. I knew Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, one of the co-founders of Hamas,
      assassinated with his son in 2004, a long litany of Hamas leaders who were killed.
      And of course, it disrupts the organization without question. But just because
      Israel has decapitated Iranian leadership, ultimately, I mean I’ll get your feed
      on this, it ultimately doesn’t disrupt the system. Alastair Crooke I think that’s
      exactly what we saw in Iran. I mean, that actually, as so often has happened,
      Israel decapitates the moderates and the younger generation that come in are much
      more hardline than, you know, their other elderly. I mean, some of the IRGC are
      veterans from the Iran-Iraq War and, you know, the younger are much more vigorous
      and much more determined than the older ones and that’s what’s happened. And I
      think what we’ve seen is the other part of this great equation that was supposed
      to come out of Washington. Hezbollah have said categorically they will not accept
      any process that leads to their disarmament. Now this may end up in civil war
      in Lebanon, it could do what the Americans are pushing very, very hard in every
      way to disenfranchise, depoliticize, demilitarize the Shia who are the majority
      in Lebanon and it won’t happen. I mean they’ve been down that route in the past
      as you know and it’s not likely to happen. Chris Hedges Let’s just close with
      the next Israeli strike, which you talked about how Israel views ceasefires. This
      is writ large in Gaza, where Israel violates every single ceasefire they make
      to “mow the lawn.” That same kind of mentality will most likely be used to again
      make strikes against Iran if in Israeli eyes they feel they are reconstituting
      military defenses or a nuclear program. What do you, how do you picture that strike
      and the consequences? The next one. Alastair Crooke I think the first thing which
      is really important to say is that, and we follow the Israeli press very very
      closely, the Hebrew press, I mean not just the English language press. It’s very
      clear that they know now after what has happened, I mean they sustained much more
      damage than they had expected, that they cannot attack Iran without full unstinting
      American support. Now the question is, is that going to be forthcoming? And I
      think one of the things that I feel might stop it is the question of the MAGA.
      I think the MAGA are really quite unhappy. You know, there were two issues in
      the American election, immigration and forever wars. And MAGA came and also there
      is a quite a number of Democrats, young Democratic voters who supported Trump
      mainly because he promised peace and no more war. Not necessarily for the other
      part, but certainly for that. They are starting to filter away. And it’s also
      in the MAGA. You’ve seen, I mean, Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and everyone
      who, there’s a big pushback against it. They have, Trump has a majority, I think
      you can correct me if I’m wrong, about three in both houses, in the Senate and
      the House. It’s small. And midterms are just over a year away. So I think he is
      going to be worried about the internal position, the MAGA position and that. And
      that was obvious almost when Hexeth came in, spoke, and he said, he went on, you
      may remember it, he made a statement, I think, on Fox News saying, look, we’re
      not attacking Iran per se or the Iranian people, we’re just attacking the nuclear
      program. I think, you know, we’re not wanting to have a war with Iran, we’re just
      trying to, you know, sort this part out. So I think he will because, you know,
      with only three, it would be quite feasible if he gets stuck and locked into a
      long… bloody conflict in Iran and it would be because Iran’s got surprises for
      the United States and for Israel if it moves to another phase everyone is preparing
      for another phase. If it does that you know he may find that you know at the end
      of it I mean it would be a very different world. I mean one can’t even rule out
      if there is a change at the midterm elections you know impeachment and things
      might come back. on to the agenda. You know more about that than I, but it’s a
      generous moment and I think he’s right to be concerned about it because it’s from
      both ends of his, it’s the young and it is the MAGA who are both, you know, don’t
      want a war, a big war in the Middle East particularly. Chris Hedges Great, thanks.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, host Chris Hedges
      interviews former British diplomat Alastair Crooke about the escalating tensions
      in the Middle East following Israeli and American attacks on Iran, which raised
      fears of a potential World War III. After a 12-day conflict, a ceasefire has introduced
      new uncertainties regarding the future of the region. Crooke discusses the factors
      leading to the Israeli strikes, including advanced technology and support from
      neighboring countries, as well as the implications of American military involvement
      under Donald Trump's administration. Both Hedges and Crooke emphasize that the
      conflict is ongoing and that the future stability of the Middle East and the global
      economy is contingent on the actions of Israel, Iran, and the United States in
      the coming weeks and months. Hedges also appeals for support to sustain independent
      journalism amidst increasing censorship pressures.

    text: 'By Chris Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report This interview is also available
      on podcast platforms and Rumble . Following attacks on Iran by Israel and the
      United States, the world held its breath as the prospect of World War III loomed
      on the horizon. After 12 days of conflict, a ceasefire has brought about new uncertainty
      for the future. Former British diplomat Alastair Crooke joins host Chris Hedges
      on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to make sense of the current situation
      in the Middle East and what can be expected in the coming weeks or months. Crooke
      details the lead up to the Israeli attacks, including the use of technology and
      neighbouring countries that allowed for the element of surprise. Cyber attacks,
      drones flown in from Azerbaijan and American military software served as crucial
      elements for the Israeli attacks on Iran. As for the American strikes weeks later,
      Crooke explains Donald Trump’s alleged anxiety in not engaging in a prolonged
      conflict and theorizes about what the damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities actually
      looks like and what it could mean going forward. Hedges and Crooke lay out what
      could come next, indicating that this conflict is far from over and the future
      of the Middle East, along with the rest of the world’s economy, hinges on what
      comes next from Israel, Iran or the United States. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS
      FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is now no way left for me to continue to write a weekly
      column for ScheerPost and produce my weekly television show without your help.
      The walls are closing in, with startling rapidity, on independent journalism ,
      with the elites, including the Democratic Party elites, clamoring for more and
      more censorship. Bob Scheer, who runs ScheerPost on a shoestring budget, and I
      will not waver in our commitment to independent and honest journalism, and we
      will never put ScheerPost behind a paywall, charge a subscription for it, sell
      your data or accept advertising. Please, if you can, sign up at chrishedges.substack.com
      so I can continue to post my now weekly Monday column on ScheerPost and produce
      my weekly television show, The Chris Hedges Report. Host Chris Hedges Producer:
      Max Jones Intro: Diego Ramos Crew: Diego Ramos, Sofia Menemenlis and Thomas Hedges
      Transcript: Diego Ramos Transcript Chris Hedges The 12-day conflict between Israel,
      the United States and Iran is not over. It is the first phase of what could become
      an endless war, much like Israel’s decades-long sporadic war against Lebanon.
      The attacks on Iran, as with the invasion and occupation of Iraq, was based on
      a lie. Neither U.S. intelligence nor the U.N. concurred with Netanyahu and Trump’s
      claim that Iran was weaponizing its enriched uranium. Israel was able to inflict
      significant damage on Iran, including what it says were the targeted assassinations
      of 30 senior security officials and 11 senior nuclear scientists. But Israel and
      the United States do not appear to have, as Donald Trump insisted, obliterated
      Iran’s nuclear weapons program. At best, it probably set back any enrichment program
      by only a few weeks or months should Iran decide to build a bomb. Iran’s surface-to-surface
      missiles probably caused more damage and casualties than Israel expected, but
      because the Israeli Air Force had virtual control over the skies of Iran it was
      able to find and hit those launchers with increasing efficacy. By shredding the
      nuclear agreement with Iran in Trump’s first administration, which the Iranians
      were abiding by, and then allowing Israel to carry out an attack while negotiations
      were ongoing with Iran, the United States and Israel have effectively shut the
      door on any diplomatic resolution to the conflict. The failure of European governments
      to condemn the bombing, a flagrant violation of Iran’s sovereignty, has only widened
      the divide between Iran and the West. Rather than weaken the Iranian regime, these
      attacks have enraged Iranians, especially young Iranians, who poured into the
      streets in the millions for the funerals of the victims of Israel’s attacks. It
      has hardened the resolve of the Iranians rulers who have suspended cooperation
      with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and rejected calls by the Trump
      administration to resume negotiations. Joining me to discuss the fallout from
      this 12-day war and what comes next is Alastair Crooke, a former British diplomat
      who served for many years in the Middle East working as a security advisor to
      the EU special envoy to the Middle East, as well as helping lead efforts to set
      up negotiations and truces between Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Palestinian
      resistant groups with Israel. He is also the author of Resistance: The Essence
      of the Islamist Revolution , which analyzes the ascendancy of Islamic movements
      in the Middle East. You can find his work at ConflictsForum.Substack.com . Let’s
      begin with a question that has puzzled me since these attacks began, and that
      is why it was so easy for Israel to take out Iran’s air defenses, which were a
      mixture of Iranian-produced air defenses, of course, but also Russian air defenses.
      Alastair Crooke Well, there’s a certain deception about what happened there. I
      know that it is advertised by Israel and by many in the United States that there
      was open skies and that Israel could actually come across and destroy the air
      defenses. That actually is not true. In fact, if you look, you’ll find there is
      not a single video. Many people were taking shots from their smartphones and things,
      not a single video of an Israeli aircraft over Tehran or Iran as a whole. What
      happened? It’s really very interesting because it has a very important impact.
      What happened was that well before the 13th of June surprise attack that Israel
      mounted on Iran, Israel Mossad and its special forces were pre-positioning anti-tank
      weapons from Kurdistan area, from Erbil and the Kurdistan area of Iraq across
      the border into Iran. Quite close, as close as they could get to the air defense
      systems that were present. And then special forces, Israelis have admitted they
      had special forces in Iran at that time, and the special forces then were coming
      and using ballistic missiles guided by American software, the Battlescape software
      system onto the targets that they wanted. Now, there were no aircraft crossing
      into Iranian airspace except that some aircraft from Israel flew right along the
      north of Iran, which is very mountainous and really deserted, into Azerbaijan,
      the airspace. And from Azerbaijan, Israel launched drones, attack drones. They
      didn’t have such a big warhead. But they also then flew down the Caspian till
      they were opposite Tehran. And from there, the Israeli planes fired these latest
      ballistic cruise missiles. Those are the ones that hit Tehran and made a big impact
      on it. So it was a very complicated setup that had taken months, if not years
      for Mossad to put all of those into position to infiltrate people, pre-position
      them. What took out the Iranian air defences in the first day was actually a cyber
      attack, a really major cyber attack on their air defences, and they managed to
      undo that and to correct it with eight hours after which their air defences were
      working again and you can see there’s evidence, we can see quite clear evidence
      of that happening. Why was Iran in such a vulnerable position? Well, that’s quite
      interesting too, because actually on that day, the 13th of June, scheduled, long
      scheduled, and with the Iranians expecting to go to talks on the Sunday with [United
      States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve] Witkoff in Oman and the Americans
      to talk about the nuclear program, the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]
      had a big program, a big exercise prepared with naval and other forces engaged
      with us and some of the missile launches were actually exposed and put out because
      of this big exercise. I think it involved the Chinese too as well. So they were
      all in this headquarters in a single room in the headquarters when Israel decapitated
      the line commanders of the IRGC and the military staff who were all preparing
      for this big exercise. They were taken by surprise and the decapitation happened.
      What happened with the civilian scientists, they were killed by spike missiles
      fired directly and small ballistic missiles fired by probably the special forces,
      I’m not quite sure, into their homes. Precise strikes into the homes killing them
      and their families too. I think it’s 10 or 11 scientists were killed. So that
      was really what happened. Now, the most important, there are two important things
      that flow from this. The first is this setup is not repeatable. You can’t, I mean,
      it was a very sophisticated, long-prepared positioning people in the site, both
      from the north, from Azerbaijan, and across the border from Kurdistan, the MEK
      [People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran] coming across Kurdistan, setting all
      these up. The cyber attack was set up and prepared and everything was ready for
      this. But now it’s exposed. You can’t go back to it. And also that now, I mean,
      the Iranian air defenses are fully operational. They’re getting more air defenses
      from the Chinese. So it won’t be the same. You can’t just repeat that operation.
      And the talk about open skies was very deceptive. It was really a lie. It wasn’t
      open skies. It was actually something rather different that happened. So that’s
      very important that it’s not something that can be repeated. Israel can’t do this
      next week or the week after. It would take months if possible. But in the meantime,
      Iran is, of course, operating around Erbil and Kurdistan. You’ve probably seen
      there have been many explosions and attacks there. In the north, removing Baluchis
      and refugees from across the border from that area. And there is a tough conversation
      taking place between Russia and [Ilham] Aliyev, the head of the Azeri state and
      also from Iran. So there is a great deal of tension there from Azerbaijan and
      Russia about different things. But it used to have good relations, but now it’s
      very tense indeed there. The Russians suspect that not only those tactics of infiltration,
      of saboteurs were done, if you like, during that attack on Russia’s strategic
      bomber force out of Kazakhstan, but they think that some of them were done by
      part of the illegal and criminal gangs who are Azeris as well as Russian citizens.
      And behind this, Russia sees the hand of Turkey and NATO for both the attack in
      Iran and also the attack that took place, I think it was called the Spider’s Web
      attack [Operation Spiderweb] on those strategic bombers that were out in the open
      on, again, the day before peace talks were taking place. Chris Hedges Let’s talk
      about the American strike. Correct me if I’m wrong, it was my understanding that
      the Israelis did take out air defenses to open a corridor for American bombers,
      but maybe that’s incorrect. And secondly, let’s talk about the, what is it, 408
      kilograms of enriched uranium. I think they’re supposedly at 60%. But let’s talk
      about the American strike. Alastair Crooke Well, the Americans warned these Iranians
      beforehand, either I think probably through the Swiss embassy in Tehran or through,
      perhaps equally likely through Oman, warned them in advance and also told them
      it was once and done, i.e. would be one strike, finish, end of the process. So
      they passed that information to the Iranians and I believe, I can’t budge for
      it perfectly, but my understanding is that the Russians said to them, look, just
      let it happen. It’s much better, just let it happen. You probably won’t, it won’t
      be as damaging as it may be advertised, just let it happen. And it’s true because
      in that time it’s fairly clear. There was no evidence you can see of any great,
      if you like, air defences being used or mounted or explosions. Iranians tell me,
      I was in Iran just before this happened, the Iranians tell me it was very quiet
      that night, there was nothing happening. So they just came in, they did what they
      wanted to do and then they left. What success they had, well, nobody can really
      say. At this stage, anyone who tells you or says they know, I don’t think is telling
      the truth because the only way you know… there are about five entrances to Fordow,
      five different entrances. Two of them were blocked up with soil by the Iranians
      before the strike, two days before. And the whole basis of this depends on a very
      controversial piece of, if you like, mechanics. Most of those entrances to the
      Fordow base have got blast bends in them. In other words, if there’s an explosion,
      it can’t go any further. It can’t reach the centrifuge hole. Centrifuge hole,
      don’t forget, is at 800 meters depth in this mountain. And then there is a vent.
      And this is a source of controversy in America as anywhere else is according to
      the Americans and who brief Trump, the vent had no, if you like, bend in it. It
      was vertical, straight from the surface down to the centrifuge hole. And many
      experts, professors from MIT and others, are very adamant and saying it’s unbelievable
      that the Iranians would have put blast vents in all of the entrances but have
      forget to do it in the vent. Well, I don’t know the answer to that. You’ll have
      to go and ask the professor about that. But, yes, four days beforehand there were
      trucks at Fordow and the Iranians and I think there’s some reasonably reliable
      reporting that the highly enriched uranium was removed and probably deposited
      in this other site called the Pickaxe Mountain, which is also quite close to Qom
      and I would think it’s probably hidden there somewhere. It’s even deeper than
      Fordow by the way, but it’s never mentioned because it seems to be off the radar.
      Anyway, I think that is probably where it is, but until the Iranians clear one
      of these entrances, which they deliberately blocked up to stop pressure rising
      and go into the hall, we won’t know how much damage is done. But I think the Isfahan
      one also is very deep and it’s quite likely that centrifuges were not destroyed
      at Isfahan. Natanz is different. Natanz is very old. It’s there from the Shah’s
      time. It’s mostly on the surface. I remember passing it and you could, you know,
      it’s there and you see it. But they put the centrifuges down I think between 60
      and 80 meters. So I mean, maybe they’re badly damaged, who knows. But they don’t
      need many centrifuges. One of the things that this professor from MIT, Postol,
      Ted Postol says that, you know, once you get to a certain point in the enrichment
      process, then it becomes exponential. You just have to do a tiny bit more and
      that you’re up at 90%. So I mean, you know, they don’t need many centrifuges to
      have survived. Chris Hedges The pilots talked about seeing explosions, but what
      I heard, that was in fact not a good sign. Alastair Crooke Yes, that’s right.
      That is a sign that there was a blast bend on the vent. And so the blast was coming
      up. And that’s why it had a spectacular view of explosion, because it hadn’t gone
      down to the centrifuge floor. It had come up and was at the surface. So it isn’t
      necessarily a good indicator of that. So that was really the gist of it, that
      I think it was clear that Trump wanted it. And we know quite a lot about that
      day because someone, and I wrote about it, it extends to you and I’m sure you
      probably know Michael Wolff, who’s written four books on Trump, and he was talking
      and calling. He works by calling interlocutors that the Trump has just spoken
      to on the phone. And he says it’s a really reliable way of finding out what Trump
      is thinking because he says the same question to each interlocutor. And it’s not
      really a question. So on the 12th, it seemed that… on the 22nd rather, the day
      of the American strike, Trump was quite anxious, according to Michael Wolff. And
      he kept asking people, I mean, is it going to work? Is it going to be a win? Is
      it going to be, I mean, a game changer? I’m hoping for a game change, we want
      something that is perfect and this will be a big headline and a big win and I
      want the headline, “We won.” So he says there was an element of sort of lack of
      confidence, almost, in Trump, I mean he went on saying the same thing you know,
      “this is what it’s got to be: in, boom, out. In, boom out, ceasefire.” And so
      that’s how it was presented. And actually, you know, this suits the Iranians quite
      well, because he says and insists, obliterated. Everything has been obliterated.
      There’s nothing left. It’s all over. No nuclear program. Well, this is fine from
      the Iranian point of view because they say, well then, to sort of [French President
      Emmanuel] Macron and others who saying, well, well, the IAEA have to go back and
      sort of inspect and find out what’s going on. And they say, but it’s you who say
      it’s all over. There isn’t a program. So why do we need the IAEA in there at all?
      In fact, the IAEA are already out and their return, I mean, I’m not exaggerating
      this, they need huge bodyguards if they ever went back to Iran. They are hated
      with a huge intensity by the ordinary population because they believe that particularly
      the assassination of the scientists and the identification of them came from the
      IAEA artificial intelligence program MOSAIC, which is one of the, if you like,
      Palantir stable of targeting systems, which relies on imputing motives to people,
      not on evidence. This is where you get the great disparity with Tulsi Gabbard,
      for example, because what the IAEA were using was this data gathering process
      examining 400 million pieces of data, social, what you read on your social platforms,
      where you move, who your children play with, all of this thing, just like Palantir
      uses the same system in Israel and in Gaza to impute to Israel, to Iran the idea
      that they are not being honest in moving the enriched uranium, that they’re not
      declaring things. And so that’s what happened on the 12th. The day before the
      Israeli attack on Iran, the board of the IAEA on the basis of this evidence said,
      Iran is accelerating towards enrichment and therefore to a bomb. And this is in
      breach of the protocols of the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]. This
      is really the pretext for the attack on Iran that took place on Friday the 13th
      of June. That resolution that was prepared and stage managed effectively by the
      IAEA to give, if you like, a peg for the Israeli tact to take place, which is
      why the Iranians and the Russians too are so distrustful of the IAEA and I don’t
      think it’s going back into Iran. Chris Hedges Well, the UN inspection teams in
      Iraq were riddled with foreign intelligence operatives, including Israeli. One
      has to assume that’s also true with the IAEA. Alastair Crooke It’s completely,
      I mean it’s verified. I mean, we know that they were providing intelligence to
      the Mossad and to Israel about, and of course IAEA insisted on meeting the scientists
      involved in the nuclear program and therefore being able to identify them. Whether
      this was directly passed on, I can’t say. But the Iranians have intelligence which
      suggests that it was passed on. I haven’t seen the intelligence. Chris Hedges
      Let’s talk about the strikes on Israel. Of course, because of military censorship
      in Israel, we don’t know the full picture. We know that refineries were hit in
      Haifa. We know the Weizmann Institute was hit. Reading it from a distance, it
      does appear that Israel was probably a little surprised at the extent of the damage
      that the Iranians were able to inflict. Alastair Crooke I think they were very
      shocked by it. They were attacked as they’d never been attacked before. I mean,
      they might have been used to a few Katyusha rockets from Gaza, but this was a
      completely different order. As you say, there’s been a complete news blackout,
      but subsequently, from satellite images, it’s clear that at least five military
      sites were destroyed by the Iranians apart from, if you like, the main ones, which
      was the HaKirya, which was the equivalent of the Pentagon, the Mossad headquarters
      in Herzliya, and various other sites as well, as well as other damages. And those
      other ones are very important because this is key in their economic sense, that
      first of all, there was the attack on Haifa and the destruction of the refinery
      at Haifa. And the Israelis say it will not be able to operate for at least a month.
      And then there was the attack on the Ashdod Port which destroyed the electric
      power system. There’s a generator, the power generator there which led to the
      blackout in about a third of the country. It’s been restored. Israel has three
      ports, Eilat, which has been closed for months, Haifa and Ashdod. Both of those
      were heavily attacked and the economy was really at a halt and this is why Israel
      called to the Omanis and said we need a ceasefire and said the same to America,
      we need it. And the other reason was because they were running out of missiles,
      of intercept missiles. The Israelis themselves say 93 THAAD [Terminal High Altitude
      Area Defense] missiles were fired by the Americans and the Israelis in that period
      of the 12 days. 93, which is equivalent to $1.2 billion worth of missiles, which
      is about two to three years total production capacity of THAAD missile interceptors
      during that period. So again, not only can that operation that they did on the
      13th not be easily resurrected, but at the moment, Israel is going to have to
      wait to re-equip itself with air defenses in a major way before they could think
      of attacking. Iran is also doing the same. The Iranians believe and think that
      there will be a further attack from Israel because it’s not, they believe, in
      Israel’s interest to accept the Trump assertion that the program is over, that
      Israel wants to say that the program is there because that provides them with
      the cue to say, yes, within the ceasefire we have the right to attack when and
      as we want onto Iran, if we suspect that they’re enriching or moving uranium,
      we can attack at our initiative. This is what the basis of the ceasefire in Lebanon
      is, that there is to be a ceasefire, but Israel has the right to attack anywhere
      in Lebanon as it chooses and when it chooses. So they’ve been trying to impose
      the same terms, if you like, on Iran. And I think that is ultimately intended
      to try and pull in America to another round of attacks because the Israeli position
      is still, and this is very important really, that the Israeli position is that
      simply the enrichment program cannot be defeated by military systems alone. The
      only way ultimately to defeat it is by a regime change and the imposition of a
      Western style puppet government into Tehran because they believe that they cannot
      kill the technical knowledge or the will to move ahead with enrichment. I think
      there are two triggers that we should watch. If the West really pushes the Iranians
      to allow some sort of oversight or monitoring of the program with a reformed perhaps
      IAEA or whatever, by the way, Russia won’t push them very hard on that because
      the IAEA, Russia has its own quarrels with the IAEA. But if the West pushes, Trump
      pushes very hard on that, then I think, and it is required under the NPT, the
      Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, monitoring and accountability is part of the treaty.
      If that is pushed, then I think there will be an answer, which is we’re leaving
      the NPT. And if then, which is also likely, the Euro 3 and the JCPOA push for
      a snapback of sanctions on Iran. And they’ve already said publicly that they intend
      to push for snapback sanctions. Part of the whole process of putting more pressure
      on Iran and then the hope that Trump keeps saying that they will then come and
      offer an unconditional surrender, which will never happen. But that’s the plan
      anyway. But those two things were likely to push Iran off the NPT. What happens
      then? We have to wait and see. But there is a very strong patriotic mood, as you
      referred to in the introduction. And what is so striking is it’s the young, the
      people that people thought were not necessarily, you know, supporters of it. And
      they are totally, totally supporting the Supreme Leader. He’s like a sort of celebrity
      figure now for everyone, for the young and for all. So I don’t know whether they
      will decide to move towards a weapon or leave it in sort of strategic ambiguity.
      That’s a possibility too. Chris Hedges Well, these kinds of attacks always generate
      that kind of blowback. I was in Buenos Aires right before the British attacked
      the Falklands and the regime was about to fall, the junta. And then as soon as
      the attack began, these people became national galtiere and all these criminals
      became national heroes. I want to talk about that process because the Supreme
      Leader has, I think it was 2003, had written that it was against Sharia Islamic
      law to build a nuclear weapon. Alastair Crooke That’s perfectly true, but there
      is some important element. Under Sharia jurisprudence there’s a thing called Ijtihad,
      which is that you can change law through reasoning, through a process of reasoning.
      And that reasoning can be changed on the basis of time and circumstances. So that
      if it’s no longer appropriate because the world has moved on and life is different
      or because of a changed circumstances then a jurist, it has to be a jurist, it’s
      not a political decision but a qualified jurist, Hujjat al-Islam or [inaudible]
      can actually change the law and a new fatwa can be issued very easily. It doesn’t
      need parliamentary or a pew but there is a majority in Iran now of people who
      argued that it was a mistake never to go down this route and that this is going
      to be something that is going to be really much more, and this is something the
      Russians have alluded to, which I think is quite significant. They’re saying actually
      this whole proliferation process that the West had is actually back to front because
      actually it’s pushing people ultimately towards a weapon, not preventing them
      because this process of going around and just threatening states we’re going to
      bomb you to the stone age if you don’t do what we tell you actually has ended
      and that’s what happened of course with North Korea. I mean they’d agreed a process
      of giving it up but then more requirements and more requirements were imposed.
      I mean it was all agreed and there was going to be money put in and a new process
      and then the extra demands that Washington imposed on top of the original agreement
      prompted the North Koreans to say, hang it, it’s not worth it, I mean it’s much
      better that we should go for a bomb. So I mean the Russians and others are saying
      well this whole nonproliferation, actually the real proliferators at this moment
      is the West because they keep pushing people towards thinking the only thing that
      they need. And look what’s happened. They bombed Iran and now Saudi Arabia is
      talking about a weapon. Now India is expressing concerns about it and what the
      consequence will be. Other states will be pursuing it. So actually rather than
      stopping proliferation, acting to stop proliferation as the West says it’s doing,
      it is actually encouraging proliferation. That’s the Russian view. [Dmitry] Medvedev
      said that, the Vice President said that quite recently. Chris Hedges We also have
      the example of [Muammar] Gaddafi, who gave up his program. Alastair Crooke Exactly,
      It wasn’t too difficult to take away, I remember, because it was still in its
      packing cases. He hadn’t even unpacked it and it was removed. Anyway, that was,
      yes, there isn’t a good history [inaudible]. Chris Hedges Let’s talk about the
      increased drone activity that apparently is occurring over Iran and what that
      means. Alastair Crooke The Israeli drone activity over Iran at the moment is not
      attack drones. It is mostly surveillance drones. They’re sort of trying to scope
      out radar and the sort of the time it takes for radar to lock onto them and where
      the radar is. And that is being fed into the American, only the Americans have
      this sort of satellite-based battlescape map that sort of tracks all radar and
      air defenses so that you can, if you like, construct your missiles to sort of
      do a slalom between all the impediments to reach your target. So that’s what’s
      happening at the moment. Plus, and I heard this from Tehran just yesterday, they’re
      under huge cyber attack from all NATO, they say. I mean, there’s a big cyber attack
      going. So I think, you know, both parties expect there will be another round and
      Iran’s certainly and Israel is preparing for the next stage. So I think, you know,
      although Trump, and I don’t think he wanted this, I mean, from everything that
      Michael Wolff said about those calls which were, you know, I just want this to
      be perfect. I want this, you know, I want this to be in boom, out, finished, ceasefire,
      done, let’s close it, finish this talk. I think that what Trump is trying to do
      there is he does not, and Michael Wolff says, and I think this is absolutely right,
      he doesn’t think he has the attention span to do a long, drawn-out slugfest fight
      with Iran. What he’s trying to do is shut it down to give him enough space to
      get back to what he really wants, which is, if you like, this new Middle East
      business world, this new structure whereby Lebanon and Syria and others will be
      brought into some form. We will have the Abraham Accords 2.0. And this will open
      a universe of business and trading possibilities through and you know that he
      hopes that Iran can just sort of stand on the sidelines and not do anything about
      it till he can find some other agreement with Iran. The main thing is the headline.
      Let’s have a big headline. We’ve done it. There’s a new Middle East. Everyone’s
      in this new sort of matrix of money, investments, resources, and of course the
      resources of Iran, which are so vital to China. And also the fact that the Gulf
      states and that if he can take that whole, if you like, corridor of the Middle
      East, he can take it into southern Central Asia and disrupt the BRICS and their
      connectivity plans in those stung areas — Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, all those areas.
      He can disrupt it and start moving the economic sphere into this. At the same
      time, that he’s doing, if you like, an attempt to cage China literally by tariffs
      structures. And also weakening Russia by reigniting the tensions in the Caucasus
      again. And so Russia and Putin are taking this very seriously. And so is China.
      And they are very angry about this. They’re angry about the deceit because Putin
      thinks he was deceived by those attacks on the strategic bombers just the day
      before the Istanbul talks just as Iran is. And China believes also that Xi was
      cheated by Trump in the discussions that they had. So there’s a real sort of sense
      of preparing for a new and wider Cold War that is being pushed. I mean, Kazakhstan
      in the north that is, I was in Russia around about the time of the Crocus Hall,
      the concert hall that was burnt down. And they were Tajiks that had come down
      who were found to be responsible. And there was a big structure in Kazakhstan
      for recruiting people, Afghans and Tajiks and others and for infiltrating them
      into Russia or to Iran or whatever. And now we see that Azerbaijan is engaged
      in the same idea. Now the reports, I can’t verify them, but recently Russia arrested
      a number of Azeris-Russian citizens and that produced a dramatic response from
      Aliyev who arrested all the Sputnik journalists and many others in Azerbaijan
      and they roughed them up and they’ve charged them with espionage and other charges.
      Now there’s always been sort of criminal groups in Russia from Azerbaijan. They’re
      known as sort of a mafia there. But this is more serious, I believe, because it’s
      thinking the Russians may be suspected that these groups were also facilitating
      the infiltration of some of those pre-positioned units that were ready for the
      attack on the strategic bomber system in Russia, the Spider’s Web. And that also
      Azerbaijan was facilitating the attack on Iran. So Azerbaijan and Armenia too
      and the question of Turkey’s role. The United States is trying to woo [Recep Tayyip]
      Erdoğan with promises of F-35s, if only he’ll mothball the S-400s that he has
      and I think that the aim is, the Israeli aim is the key to their, if you like,
      their new corridor, the new, if you like, Abraham Accord 2.0, a business plan
      right through to Asia, is that Turkey should persuade both Syria and Lebanon that
      they have no choice and incentivize them both to join into this new sort of greater
      Israel project. So this is why there’s a lot of tensions that all these proposals
      that are coming out of America at the moment, the intent to sort of cut off China
      from trade by putting differential tariffs on China if they trans ship goods through
      Vietnam or another country. The prospect of new sanctions on Russia. The attack
      on Iran is a pivot, a key pivot for Russia and China of the whole BRICS structure.
      All of these things are producing a really strong response from Russia. I mean,
      it’s given very tough response to Trump and this and says, we know exactly what
      you’re doing in the Caucasus. We know what you are doing in Azerbaijan and we
      won’t put up with it. And so Russia responded to this by destroying the two refineries
      in Ukraine that were fueled from Baku, from Azerbaijan. There was Azerbaijan input
      that was fueling these two refineries. This was a warning to Azerbaijan, you know,
      stop playing around with this. So Iran will be saying something rather similar,
      I suspect, to the Azeris. Now, I think some people in the United States think,
      even dream, of the idea that Azerbaijan could invade at the right moment in coordination
      with Israel into Iran as the Baluch perhaps come from another side or the Kurds
      from the other. But I think that is very far-fetched because 85% of the areas
      are Shiʿi. There is, if you like, the leadership is Turkic more than Iranian Shiʿi
      but they’re Turkic, either Sunni or Shiʿi converted. Anyway, it’s very secular.
      And the Iranians, all the Azeris in Iran are very, very loyal to Iran. And people
      talk about, well, the Azeri’s glass ceiling. And I slightly laugh at that. And
      I say, well, there’s one person you probably have heard of who’s really well-known
      poet and he writes in the Azeri language and he’s fluent in the Azeri language
      and he is Azeri and that’s the Supreme Leader. So it’s not that the Azeris are
      completely sort of outliers in Iran. Chris Hedges Didn’t Israel launch drones
      from there? Isn’t that a launch point for… Alastair Crooke Yeah, exactly. They
      launched drones and also, as I say, the airspace of Azerbaijan was used for standoff
      firing of drones that had these new cruise missiles, multiple cruise missiles.
      They could launch them once they were in Iranian territory. Chris Hedges I have
      two last questions, but just on Gaza, because in the meeting in the White House,
      when reporters were allowed in, Trump and Netanyahu were talking about depopulating
      Gaza. Netanyahu very cynically said it’s not a prison. People who want to leave,
      of course, there’s enforced starvation since March 2nd, should have the right
      to leave. Just your thoughts on what’s happening in Gaza. Alastair Crooke What’s
      happening in Gaza is that Netanyahu and the right are intent on first of all pushing
      all the Palestinians into what amounts to a concentration camp in one small part.
      They will be put in but they will not be allowed out of it. And it is a stage
      towards, it’s politely called voluntary expatriation but it is of course mandatory,
      if you like, removal of the population from Gaza. And the same is going on in
      the West Bank. Huge process. [Bezalel] Smotrich is in charge of this aspect. And
      there is a real effort being made because they think they believe they can persuade
      Trump to annex most of the West Bank. But settlers have moved into large areas.
      New settlements are announced all the time. The annexation is afoot in the West
      Bank as in Gaza. I think I remember Smotrich was always very, very clear about
      this. I remember listening to him about six years ago or so and he said, listen,
      this is our plan, to remove all the Palestinians from the area. And he said, but
      you know, as it is with the legal system, it’s difficult. What we need is a big
      crisis or a big war. And when that happens, we will complete the project. That’s
      what we’re looking for. And that’s why they’re always sort of playing around with
      the Temple Mount, Al-Aqsa. Looking to use that perhaps as the pretext to sort
      of trigger a commotion in the whole Muslim world. Al-Aqsa is a neuralgic point
      in the Muslim world, that they could use this as the ability to sort of create
      the crisis that they could then, under the pretext of an emergency, really move,
      finish off the depopulation of Gaza and also much of the West Bank, drive the
      West Bank to Jordan. Chris Hedges Does that mean they would drive the Palestinians
      and try to drive them into Jordan and they would drive the Palestinians in Gaza
      into Egypt? The Egyptians and the Jordanians have been adamant that’s not going
      to happen. Alastair Crooke Yes, but I mean they are pushing them closer and closer
      to the Rafah Gate. And, you know, what’s going to happen if they open those gates
      and just push them out, tou know, a million or so Palestinians? It’s very, very
      sensitive in Egypt. The Egyptians are really, ordinary Egyptians, the Egyptian
      army is very angry with [Abdel Fattah El-]Sisi about his ineffectual response
      to what’s happening in Gaza. It could explode. The whole Egyptian element could
      explode in this process. Of course there will be some sort of public relations
      exercise of sending a few Palestinians to, I don’t know where, but somewhere to
      say, no they went voluntarily. But of course that’s not what’s planned. What’s
      planned is another Nakba from Gaza. And it’s unfolding, sadly, unfortunately.
      You know, Hamas demands are not met by this proposal. This is why I don’t, I think
      what we will get is probably some sort of ceasefire. But it’s a ceasefire designed
      to allow the Israelis to resume the attrition of Gaza either because they’ll claim
      it will break down or because they’ll claim the 60 days are over. And the Hamas
      position remains unchanged — we want an end to the war. We want the removal of
      all of the Israeli troops from Gaza and a reconstruction of the strip. And of
      course, the Witkoff proposal does none of those things. It doesn’t provide for
      an end of the war. There will still be Israeli forces inside Gaza during the ceasefire
      and after. And the proposals for reconstructing it is quite different to be done
      by pliant Arab states. Chris Hedges And we should just draw that parallel between
      decapitating Hamas. I knew Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, one of the co-founders of Hamas,
      assassinated with his son in 2004, a long litany of Hamas leaders who were killed.
      And of course, it disrupts the organization without question. But just because
      Israel has decapitated Iranian leadership, ultimately, I mean I’ll get your feed
      on this, it ultimately doesn’t disrupt the system. Alastair Crooke I think that’s
      exactly what we saw in Iran. I mean, that actually, as so often has happened,
      Israel decapitates the moderates and the younger generation that come in are much
      more hardline than, you know, their other elderly. I mean, some of the IRGC are
      veterans from the Iran-Iraq War and, you know, the younger are much more vigorous
      and much more determined than the older ones and that’s what’s happened. And I
      think what we’ve seen is the other part of this great equation that was supposed
      to come out of Washington. Hezbollah have said categorically they will not accept
      any process that leads to their disarmament. Now this may end up in civil war
      in Lebanon, it could do what the Americans are pushing very, very hard in every
      way to disenfranchise, depoliticize, demilitarize the Shia who are the majority
      in Lebanon and it won’t happen. I mean they’ve been down that route in the past
      as you know and it’s not likely to happen. Chris Hedges Let’s just close with
      the next Israeli strike, which you talked about how Israel views ceasefires. This
      is writ large in Gaza, where Israel violates every single ceasefire they make
      to “mow the lawn.” That same kind of mentality will most likely be used to again
      make strikes against Iran if in Israeli eyes they feel they are reconstituting
      military defenses or a nuclear program. What do you, how do you picture that strike
      and the consequences? The next one. Alastair Crooke I think the first thing which
      is really important to say is that, and we follow the Israeli press very very
      closely, the Hebrew press, I mean not just the English language press. It’s very
      clear that they know now after what has happened, I mean they sustained much more
      damage than they had expected, that they cannot attack Iran without full unstinting
      American support. Now the question is, is that going to be forthcoming? And I
      think one of the things that I feel might stop it is the question of the MAGA.
      I think the MAGA are really quite unhappy. You know, there were two issues in
      the American election, immigration and forever wars. And MAGA came and also there
      is a quite a number of Democrats, young Democratic voters who supported Trump
      mainly because he promised peace and no more war. Not necessarily for the other
      part, but certainly for that. They are starting to filter away. And it’s also
      in the MAGA. You’ve seen, I mean, Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson and everyone
      who, there’s a big pushback against it. They have, Trump has a majority, I think
      you can correct me if I’m wrong, about three in both houses, in the Senate and
      the House. It’s small. And midterms are just over a year away. So I think he is
      going to be worried about the internal position, the MAGA position and that. And
      that was obvious almost when Hexeth came in, spoke, and he said, he went on, you
      may remember it, he made a statement, I think, on Fox News saying, look, we’re
      not attacking Iran per se or the Iranian people, we’re just attacking the nuclear
      program. I think, you know, we’re not wanting to have a war with Iran, we’re just
      trying to, you know, sort this part out. So I think he will because, you know,
      with only three, it would be quite feasible if he gets stuck and locked into a
      long… bloody conflict in Iran and it would be because Iran’s got surprises for
      the United States and for Israel if it moves to another phase everyone is preparing
      for another phase. If it does that you know he may find that you know at the end
      of it I mean it would be a very different world. I mean one can’t even rule out
      if there is a change at the midterm elections you know impeachment and things
      might come back. on to the agenda. You know more about that than I, but it’s a
      generous moment and I think he’s right to be concerned about it because it’s from
      both ends of his, it’s the young and it is the MAGA who are both, you know, don’t
      want a war, a big war in the Middle East particularly. Chris Hedges Great, thanks.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent episode of The Chris Hedges Report, host Chris Hedges
      interviews former British diplomat Alastair Crooke about the escalating tensions
      in the Middle East following Israeli and American attacks on Iran, which raised
      fears of a potential World War III. After a 12-day conflict, a ceasefire has introduced
      new uncertainties regarding the future of the region. Crooke discusses the factors
      leading to the Israeli strikes, including advanced technology and support from
      neighboring countries, as well as the implications of American military involvement
      under Donald Trump's administration. Both Hedges and Crooke emphasize that the
      conflict is ongoing and that the future stability of the Middle East and the global
      economy is contingent on the actions of Israel, Iran, and the United States in
      the coming weeks and months. Hedges also appeals for support to sustain independent
      journalism amidst increasing censorship pressures.

      Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for a second day on Tuesday , holding a
      90-minute meeting in the Oval Office. The two leaders were also joined by Vice
      President JD Vance. According to media reports, the purpose of the meeting was
      to discuss the potential for a Gaza ceasefire deal. Haaretz reported that following
      the Trump-Netanyahu meeting, US envoy Steve Witkoff will now travel to Qatar for
      ceasefire negotiations, but his office said the trip hasn’t been finalized. The
      negotiations in Doha are focusing on the potential of a 60-day ceasefire, during
      which the two sides are supposed to negotiate a long-term deal. Hamas is looking
      for a stronger guarantee from the US that it is committed to turning the temporary
      truce into a permanent one. There are conflicting reports on the progress in the
      ceasefire negotiations. Some have said the issues over aid deliveries have been
      resolved and that the main impasse is now over Israel’s demand to maintain control
      of the “Morag Corridor,” a strip of land between the southern Gaza cities of Rafah
      and Khan Younis, while other reports say there has been no progress at all. A
      Palestinian official told the Saudi Asharq News outlet that negotiations are “at
      a standstill” because the Israeli negotiating team is “limiting itself to listening
      rather than negotiating” and consulting on “every issue” with officials back in
      Israel. The official charged that the lack of authority for the negotiating team
      was “a continuation of the stalling policy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      to obstruct any potential agreement.” Drop Site News reporter Jeremy Scahill said
      in a post on X that a Hamas official told him that claims from US officials that
      there was progress are part of a “deception game,” likely so the US and Israel
      can blame Hamas for the lack of a deal. The official also mentioned Israel’s demands
      about the Morag Corridor and its plans to build a camp to concentrate Gaza’s civilian
      population on the ruins of Rafah, which Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced
      on Monday. “This is a fluid situation and developments can happen at any moment
      as the talks continue and with Netanyahu in DC,” Scahill said. “The bottom line
      will be what Trump wants and all parties know this.” While Trump says he wants
      a deal, it remains unclear if he’s willing to put enough pressure on Netanyahu
      to reach one. US military aid is required for Israel to sustain its military operations
      and continue its genocidal war on the Palestinians of Gaza, meaning Trump has
      significant leverage. Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court
      (ICC) for war crimes in Gaza, met with other US officials on Tuesday, including
      House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA). Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

      to pay our writers and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By C.J.
      Polychroniou / Truthout Arecent study published by Ecological Economics reveals
      that the petrochemical industry, well known for creating pollution and health
      risks to predominantly poor and Black communities near its plants, also perpetuates
      stark racial disparities across its workforce, reflecting what can only be described
      as institutional racism. In the exclusive interview for Truthout , one of the
      co-authors of the study, University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Michael
      Ash talks about what goes on in the employment practices of the petrochemical
      industry. The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
      C.J. Polychroniou : The petrochemical industry creates huge amounts of pollution
      and is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Many petrochemical plants
      are also located on former slave plantation lands, such as those along the Mississippi
      River. These petrochemical plants affect predominantly Black, Brown, Indigenous,
      and poor communities as they are exposed to high risks of cancer and respiratory
      ailments from the pollutants emitted by these facilities. However, a growing body
      of literature also reveals sharp racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce.
      A recent study you co-authored supports such findings. Can you talk about these
      racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce? How pervasive are they, and
      are they confined to certain geographical locations, or is it a widespread phenomenon
      across the United States? Michael Ash : First, I really can’t discuss this study
      without reference to the struggle for academic freedom that our study has engendered
      for the lead author, Kimberly Terrell. Until June 11, Terrell was a research scientist
      and director of community engagement at the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at
      Tulane University. Our study discusses disparities in employment and access to
      high-quality jobs in the petrochemical industry in Louisiana and elsewhere; and
      the governor of Louisiana made it clear to the administration of Tulane University
      that this type of research, no matter how objective and scientific, would not
      be tolerated. The Tulane administration, to its grave discredit, bent to this
      pressure and attempted to gag Terrell’s communication with the public and with
      the media and to impede her scientific research on economic and environmental
      disparities. With the survival of the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at stake,
      Terrell chose to resign and will carry on her research under other auspices. The
      makeup of the petrochemical workforce is tightly bound with the political influence
      and pollution effluents of the petrochemical industry. Petrochemical employment
      is concentrated in the U.S., a product of both geographic and technological imperatives
      and industrial planning. Petrochemical jobs have historically been good jobs in
      the sense of offering a pay premium above similar work in other industries — made
      possible by capital-intensive production, monopoly profits, and an organized workforce.
      The employment disparities in petrochemical employment are widespread in the U.S.,
      but they are especially notable in Louisiana because the African American share
      of the workforce is so high; the environmental risks and harms disproportionately
      imposed on African Americans are so great; and the representation of African Americans
      in jobs in the petrochemical industry, especially in good jobs, is so poor. An
      account from my friend and colleague Jim Boyce illustrates the disconnect between
      who suffers environmental harms and who benefits from employment. When visiting
      African American frontline communities in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” along the
      Mississippi River, Jim asked, “Well, the chemical plants and refineries and paper
      mills obviously bring pollution, but don’t they also bring at least some good
      jobs? The reply came: ‘No, none of us work there. It’s all white guys who come
      in their pickup trucks from Baton Rouge.’” I should state explicitly that even
      access to good jobs cannot objectively make up for exposure to environmental harm.
      Environmental harm and risks and access to decent employment are non-commensurate
      costs and benefits. Indeed, everyone should and can have the right to both a clean,
      healthy, and safe environment and to a decent livelihood. But if there are no
      jobs — environment tradeoffs, even on their own impoverished and dehumanizing
      terms — then the environmental and economic injustice is especially stark. That’s
      what my work with Boyce showed on a national basis in our 2018 paper , and what
      Terrell, Gianna St. Julien, and I find in more detail in our 2025 study on Louisiana.
      What draws petrochemical industries to Louisiana and its so-called “Cancer Alley?”
      “Cancer Alley,” the stretch of the Mississippi River beginning near Baton Rouge,
      Louisiana, and running to the Gulf, is home to a planned and cultivated petrochemical
      industry. Some petrochemical hubs emerge because of proximity to mines or wells,
      and of course, Louisiana and offshore activity in the Gulf are sources. But the
      petrochemical industry along that stretch of the Mississippi began with planning
      — Standard Oil Company (ancestor of today’s ExxonMobil) initiated its Baton Rouge
      refining plans around 1910 — and flourished with state initiatives. The location
      fit into both John D. Rockefeller’s aim for mid-country, river-accessible petroleum
      processing and the new oil and gas discoveries along the Gulf Coast. Over the
      course of the 20th century, and especially in the decades after World War II,
      the petrochemical industry cemented its relationships with public leadership in
      Louisiana, garnering large public subsidies and tax exemptions. Many of the area’s
      petrochemical facilities are literally built on the sites of former plantations.
      So the coalescence of newer petroleum interests with the existing racist governance
      system enabled the development of new structures for the profitable exploitation
      of communities of color. In addition to exploring the employment gaps, we also
      document the very large subsidies and tax exemptions for petrochemicals and how
      these industries contribute little to total employment, and essentially nothing
      to fair employment in Louisiana. Some have suggested that the racial disparities
      encountered in the petrochemical industry can be at least partly attributed to
      the racial education gap. Is there any validity behind this claim? There’s an
      overwhelming urge, encouraged by the media and employers, to make gross inequities
      seem fair or deserved. Under this logic, racial gaps in employment or in access
      to good jobs are attributed to racial gaps in education. The truth about racial
      disparities in employment in the petrochemical industry (and in many other industries)
      is part of several longstanding employers’ strategies: (1) divide-and-conquer
      with segmented and segregated work; and (2) blame workers for the bad deal that
      workers get. These petrochemical jobs are skilled jobs, and while formal education
      provides some of the needed skills, skills learned in training programs or on
      the job are very important. That’s what makes equitable access to the jobs central.
      Without that, there’s simply a vicious cycle of no skills, no job; and no job,
      no skills. As a formal matter, we used statistical methods to control for educational
      differences in the available workforce, and we still find large disparities in
      employment, especially in the better jobs in the industry. So even on the terms
      of the industry’s apologists, education does not explain the racial employment
      gap. Petrochemical job disparities are outsized compared to the racial education
      gap. But the bigger point is that these exclusions are structural and self-sustaining
      unless there is a concerted public intervention. Education is wonderful; it makes
      workers more productive and opens the way to innovation. But if the institutions
      for sharing the gains from education aren’t set up correctly, then employers,
      instead of workers, can pocket the lion’s share of the benefits. So I want to
      dispel the notion that the racial disparity in employment and access to good jobs
      is zero-sum (what’s lost by Black workers is gained by white workers). White workers,
      too, get a worse deal than they would in a racially fair system because the racially
      unfair system stacks the deck against all workers, white and Black. If the racial
      disparities already discussed reflect institutional racism, how does the law address
      this problem? The petrochemical industry in Louisiana is regularly given a host
      of advantages by the public in Louisiana, including outright subsidies and exemptions
      from taxation, especially the local property tax. These are outright giveaways,
      with minimal payback in terms of employment and especially little benefit in terms
      of opportunities for excluded communities. The job numbers and new plant announcements
      are from companies’ reports of how they have used the public subsidies. But it’s
      easy to announce job numbers in the media, and the companies now receive their
      tax exemptions essentially without any actual demonstration of job creation or
      retention. The petrochemical industry is increasingly automated; so even these
      not-very-impressive announced job numbers may not reflect real or long-term opportunities.
      At a minimum, Louisiana could strike a better deal for itself in terms of requiring
      demonstrable benefits in terms of training and access in exchange for this large
      annual outlay. What role do the trade unions themselves play in people of color
      being underrepresented in high-paying jobs in the petrochemical industry? I mean,
      they must be aware of these racial disparities, so are they also not responsible
      for allowing this unfair state of affairs to continue? Trade unions are painfully
      aware of the divide-and-conquer tactics that employers use. The former Oil, Chemical,
      and Atomic Workers (OCAW) union, which eventually merged into the paper workers
      union and subsequently into the United Steel Workers, had a decent foothold in
      the Baton Rouge petrochemical industry. OCAW was the first union to put worker
      and community health, safety, and protection from pollution at the forefront of
      labor campaigns. OCAW, especially under the leadership of Tony Mazzocchi, always
      pushed hard for racial equity because they recognized that the working class was
      ultimately in it together. Indeed, the term “Cancer Alley” itself originated from
      a billboard that OCAW put up when cooperating with environmental groups in the
      1980s. Employers, on the other hand, are effective practitioners of divide-and-conquer
      and also operate with the knowledge that African Americans are, on average, more
      favorably disposed toward unions. What are the remedies for institutional racism
      in the petrochemical industry? A much closer and more detailed look is possible
      for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC. We used the best publicly
      available EEOC data for our study. The EEOC can take a deeper dive and examine
      exactly which companies are hiring into which occupations. With mandated environmental
      reporting, such as the Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory,
      the public has the right to know what chemicals companies are releasing into the
      environment. With additional modeling, we can learn, for example, that around
      80 percent of the potential chronic human health risk from the ExxonMobil facilities
      in Baton Rouge fall on people of color and nearly 30 percent on poor households
      — both of these are far out of line with the national and Louisiana shares of
      the population. But we do not know what ExxonMobil’s allocation of jobs, and especially
      of good jobs, is from the facilities. When I say, “we do not know,” I mean the
      general public; the EEOC collects this data from the ExxonMobil facilities. In
      the short run, there is nothing stopping companies from releasing their own EEOC
      reporting on how many and which jobs are represented, and which workers, in terms
      of sex and race or ethnicity, hold these jobs. In the longer run, we should have
      employment and job-quality transparency so that we can assess employment justice
      for industries as effectively as we can assess environmental justice. The tools
      for environmental justice assessment were the product of a long, determined campaign

      Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for a second day on Tuesday , holding a
      90-minute meeting in the Oval Office. The two leaders were also joined by Vice
      President JD Vance. According to media reports, the purpose of the meeting was
      to discuss the potential for a Gaza ceasefire deal. Haaretz reported that following
      the Trump-Netanyahu meeting, US envoy Steve Witkoff will now travel to Qatar for
      ceasefire negotiations, but his office said the trip hasn’t been finalized. The
      negotiations in Doha are focusing on the potential of a 60-day ceasefire, during
      which the two sides are supposed to negotiate a long-term deal. Hamas is looking
      for a stronger guarantee from the US that it is committed to turning the temporary
      truce into a permanent one. There are conflicting reports on the progress in the
      ceasefire negotiations. Some have said the issues over aid deliveries have been
      resolved and that the main impasse is now over Israel’s demand to maintain control
      of the “Morag Corridor,” a strip of land between the southern Gaza cities of Rafah
      and Khan Younis, while other reports say there has been no progress at all. A
      Palestinian official told the Saudi Asharq News outlet that negotiations are “at
      a standstill” because the Israeli negotiating team is “limiting itself to listening
      rather than negotiating” and consulting on “every issue” with officials back in
      Israel. The official charged that the lack of authority for the negotiating team
      was “a continuation of the stalling policy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      to obstruct any potential agreement.” Drop Site News reporter Jeremy Scahill said
      in a post on X that a Hamas official told him that claims from US officials that
      there was progress are part of a “deception game,” likely so the US and Israel
      can blame Hamas for the lack of a deal. The official also mentioned Israel’s demands
      about the Morag Corridor and its plans to build a camp to concentrate Gaza’s civilian
      population on the ruins of Rafah, which Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced
      on Monday. “This is a fluid situation and developments can happen at any moment
      as the talks continue and with Netanyahu in DC,” Scahill said. “The bottom line
      will be what Trump wants and all parties know this.” While Trump says he wants
      a deal, it remains unclear if he’s willing to put enough pressure on Netanyahu
      to reach one. US military aid is required for Israel to sustain its military operations
      and continue its genocidal war on the Palestinians of Gaza, meaning Trump has
      significant leverage. Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court
      (ICC) for war crimes in Gaza, met with other US officials on Tuesday, including
      House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA). Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

      Polychroniou / Truthout Arecent study published by Ecological Economics reveals
      that the petrochemical industry, well known for creating pollution and health
      risks to predominantly poor and Black communities near its plants, also perpetuates
      stark racial disparities across its workforce, reflecting what can only be described
      as institutional racism. In the exclusive interview for Truthout , one of the
      co-authors of the study, University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Michael
      Ash talks about what goes on in the employment practices of the petrochemical
      industry. The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
      C.J. Polychroniou : The petrochemical industry creates huge amounts of pollution
      and is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Many petrochemical plants
      are also located on former slave plantation lands, such as those along the Mississippi
      River. These petrochemical plants affect predominantly Black, Brown, Indigenous,
      and poor communities as they are exposed to high risks of cancer and respiratory
      ailments from the pollutants emitted by these facilities. However, a growing body
      of literature also reveals sharp racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce.
      A recent study you co-authored supports such findings. Can you talk about these
      racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce? How pervasive are they, and
      are they confined to certain geographical locations, or is it a widespread phenomenon
      across the United States? Michael Ash : First, I really can’t discuss this study
      without reference to the struggle for academic freedom that our study has engendered
      for the lead author, Kimberly Terrell. Until June 11, Terrell was a research scientist
      and director of community engagement at the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at
      Tulane University. Our study discusses disparities in employment and access to
      high-quality jobs in the petrochemical industry in Louisiana and elsewhere; and
      the governor of Louisiana made it clear to the administration of Tulane University
      that this type of research, no matter how objective and scientific, would not
      be tolerated. The Tulane administration, to its grave discredit, bent to this
      pressure and attempted to gag Terrell’s communication with the public and with
      the media and to impede her scientific research on economic and environmental
      disparities. With the survival of the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic at stake,
      Terrell chose to resign and will carry on her research under other auspices. The
      makeup of the petrochemical workforce is tightly bound with the political influence
      and pollution effluents of the petrochemical industry. Petrochemical employment
      is concentrated in the U.S., a product of both geographic and technological imperatives
      and industrial planning. Petrochemical jobs have historically been good jobs in
      the sense of offering a pay premium above similar work in other industries — made
      possible by capital-intensive production, monopoly profits, and an organized workforce.
      The employment disparities in petrochemical employment are widespread in the U.S.,
      but they are especially notable in Louisiana because the African American share
      of the workforce is so high; the environmental risks and harms disproportionately
      imposed on African Americans are so great; and the representation of African Americans
      in jobs in the petrochemical industry, especially in good jobs, is so poor. An
      account from my friend and colleague Jim Boyce illustrates the disconnect between
      who suffers environmental harms and who benefits from employment. When visiting
      African American frontline communities in Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley” along the
      Mississippi River, Jim asked, “Well, the chemical plants and refineries and paper
      mills obviously bring pollution, but don’t they also bring at least some good
      jobs? The reply came: ‘No, none of us work there. It’s all white guys who come
      in their pickup trucks from Baton Rouge.’” I should state explicitly that even
      access to good jobs cannot objectively make up for exposure to environmental harm.
      Environmental harm and risks and access to decent employment are non-commensurate
      costs and benefits. Indeed, everyone should and can have the right to both a clean,
      healthy, and safe environment and to a decent livelihood. But if there are no
      jobs — environment tradeoffs, even on their own impoverished and dehumanizing
      terms — then the environmental and economic injustice is especially stark. That’s
      what my work with Boyce showed on a national basis in our 2018 paper , and what
      Terrell, Gianna St. Julien, and I find in more detail in our 2025 study on Louisiana.
      What draws petrochemical industries to Louisiana and its so-called “Cancer Alley?”
      “Cancer Alley,” the stretch of the Mississippi River beginning near Baton Rouge,
      Louisiana, and running to the Gulf, is home to a planned and cultivated petrochemical
      industry. Some petrochemical hubs emerge because of proximity to mines or wells,
      and of course, Louisiana and offshore activity in the Gulf are sources. But the
      petrochemical industry along that stretch of the Mississippi began with planning
      — Standard Oil Company (ancestor of today’s ExxonMobil) initiated its Baton Rouge
      refining plans around 1910 — and flourished with state initiatives. The location
      fit into both John D. Rockefeller’s aim for mid-country, river-accessible petroleum
      processing and the new oil and gas discoveries along the Gulf Coast. Over the
      course of the 20th century, and especially in the decades after World War II,
      the petrochemical industry cemented its relationships with public leadership in
      Louisiana, garnering large public subsidies and tax exemptions. Many of the area’s
      petrochemical facilities are literally built on the sites of former plantations.
      So the coalescence of newer petroleum interests with the existing racist governance
      system enabled the development of new structures for the profitable exploitation
      of communities of color. In addition to exploring the employment gaps, we also
      document the very large subsidies and tax exemptions for petrochemicals and how
      these industries contribute little to total employment, and essentially nothing
      to fair employment in Louisiana. Some have suggested that the racial disparities
      encountered in the petrochemical industry can be at least partly attributed to
      the racial education gap. Is there any validity behind this claim? There’s an
      overwhelming urge, encouraged by the media and employers, to make gross inequities
      seem fair or deserved. Under this logic, racial gaps in employment or in access
      to good jobs are attributed to racial gaps in education. The truth about racial
      disparities in employment in the petrochemical industry (and in many other industries)
      is part of several longstanding employers’ strategies: (1) divide-and-conquer
      with segmented and segregated work; and (2) blame workers for the bad deal that

      gap. Petrochemical job disparities are outsized compared to the racial education

      donation . By Abrahm Lustgarten / ProPublica On July 4, the broken remnants of
      a powerful tropical storm spun off the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico so heavy
      with moisture that it seemed to stagger under its load. Then, colliding with another
      soggy system sliding north off the Pacific, the storm wobbled and its clouds tipped,
      waterboarding south central Texas with an extraordinary 20 inches of rain. In
      the predawn blackness, the Guadalupe River, which drains from the Hill Country,
      rose by more than 26 vertical feet in just 45 minutes, jumping its banks and hurtling
      downstream, killing 109 people, including at least 27 children at a summer camp
      located inside a federally designated floodway. Over the days and weeks to come
      there will be tireless — and warranted — analysis of who is to blame for this
      heart-wrenching loss. Should Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have
      installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children
      allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding? Why were urgent
      updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with
      limited connectivity? Did the National Weather Service, enduring steep budget
      cuts under the current administration, adequately forecast this storm? Those questions
      are critical. But so is a far larger concern: The rapid onset of disruptive climate
      change — driven by the burning of oil, gasoline and coal — is making disasters
      like this one more common, more deadly and far more costly to Americans, even
      as the federal government is running away from the policies and research that
      might begin to address it. President Lyndon B. Johnson was briefed in 1965 that
      a climate crisis was being caused by burning fossil fuels and was warned that
      it would create the conditions for intensifying storms and extreme events, and
      this country — including 10 more presidents — has debated how to respond to that
      warning ever since. Still, it took decades for the slow-motion change to grow
      large enough to affect people’s everyday lives and safety and for the world to
      reach the stage it is in now: an age of climate-driven chaos, where the past is
      no longer prologue and the specific challenges of the future might be foreseeable
      but are less predictable. Climate change doesn’t chart a linear path where each
      day is warmer than the last. Rather, science suggests that we’re now in an age
      of discontinuity, with heat one day and hail the next and with more dramatic extremes.
      Across the planet, dry places are getting drier while wet places are getting wetter.
      The jet stream — the band of air that circulates through the Northern Hemisphere
      — is slowing to a near stall at times, weaving off its tracks, causing unprecedented
      events like polar vortexes drawing arctic air far south. Meanwhile the heat is
      sucking moisture from the drought-plagued plains of Kansas only to dump it over
      Spain, contributing to last year’s cataclysmic floods. We saw something similar
      when Hurricane Harvey dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on parts of Texas in
      2017 and when Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina last year — and countless
      times in between. We witnessed it again in Texas this past weekend. Warmer oceans
      evaporate faster, and warmer air holds more water, transporting it in the form
      of humidity across the atmosphere, until it can’t hold it any longer and it falls.
      Meteorologists estimate that the atmosphere had reached its capacity for moisture
      before the storm struck. The disaster comes during a week in which extreme heat
      and extreme weather have battered the planet. Parts of northern Spain and southern
      France are burning out of control, as are parts of California. In the past 72
      hours, storms have torn the roofs off of five-story apartment buildings in Slovakia,
      while intense rainfall has turned streets into rivers in southern Italy. Same
      story in Lombok, Indonesia, where cars floated like buoys, and in eastern China,
      where an inland typhoon-like storm sent furniture blowing down the streets like
      so many sheafs of paper. Léon, Mexico, was battered by hail so thick on Monday
      it covered the city in white. And North Carolina is, again, enduring 10 inches
      of rainfall. There is no longer much debate that climate change is making many
      of these events demonstrably worse. Scientists conducting a rapid analysis of
      last week’s extreme heat wave that spread across Europe have concluded that human-caused
      warming killed roughly 1,500 more people than might have otherwise perished. Early
      reports suggest that the flooding in Texas, too, was substantially influenced
      by climate change. According to a preliminary analysis by ClimaMeter, a joint
      project of the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research,
      the weather in Texas was 7% wetter on July 4 than it was before climate change
      warmed that part of the state, and natural variability alone cannot explain “this
      very exceptional meteorological condition.” That the United States once again
      is reeling from familiar but alarming headlines and body counts should not be
      a surprise by now. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the number
      of extreme weather disasters has jumped fivefold worldwide over the past 50 years,
      and the number of deaths has nearly tripled. In the United States, which prefers
      to measure its losses in dollars, the damage from major storms was more than $180
      billion last year, nearly 10 times the average annual toll during the 1980s, after
      accounting for inflation. These storms have now cost Americans nearly $3 trillion.
      Meanwhile, the number of annual major disasters has grown sevenfold. Fatalities
      in billion-dollar storms last year alone were nearly equal to the number of such
      deaths counted by the federal government in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000.
      The most worrisome fact, though, may be that the warming of the planet has scarcely
      begun. Just as each step up on the Richter scale represents a massive increase
      in the force of an earthquake, the damage caused by the next 1 or 2 degrees Celsius
      of warming stands to be far greater than that caused by the 1.5 degrees we have
      so far endured. The world’s leading scientists, the United Nations panel on climate
      change and even many global energy experts warn that we face something akin to
      our last chance before it is too late to curtail a runaway crisis. It’s one reason
      our predictions and modeling capabilities are becoming an essential, lifesaving
      mechanism of national defense. What is extraordinary is that at such a volatile
      moment, President Donald Trump’s administration would choose not just to minimize
      the climate danger — and thus the suffering of the people affected by it — but
      to revoke funding for the very data collection and research that would help the
      country better understand and prepare for this moment. Over the past couple of
      months, the administration has defunded much of the operations of the National
      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the nation’s chief climate and scientific
      agency responsible for weather forecasting, as well as the cutting-edge earth
      systems research at places like Princeton University, which is essential to modeling
      an aberrant future. It has canceled the nation’s seminal scientific assessment
      of climate change and risk. The administration has defunded the Federal Emergency
      Management Agency’s core program paying for infrastructure projects meant to prevent
      major disasters from causing harm, and it has threatened to eliminate FEMA itself,
      the main federal agency charged with helping Americans after a climate emergency
      like the Texas floods. It has — as of last week — signed legislation that unravels
      the federal programs meant to slow warming by helping the country’s industries
      transition to cleaner energy. And it has even stopped the reporting of the cost
      of disasters, stating that doing so is “in alignment with evolving priorities”
      of the administration. It is as if the administration hopes that making the price
      tag for the Kerr County flooding invisible would make the events unfolding there
      seem less devastating. Given the abandonment of policy that might forestall more
      severe events like the Texas floods by reducing the emissions that cause them,
      Americans are left to the daunting task of adapting. In Texas, it is critical
      to ask whether the protocols in place at the time of the storm were good enough.
      This week is not the first time that children have died in a flash flood along
      the Guadalupe River, and reports suggest county officials struggled to raise money
      and then declined to install a warning system in 2018 in order to save approximately
      $1 million. But the country faces a larger and more daunting challenge, because
      this disaster — like the firestorms in Los Angeles and the hurricanes repeatedly
      pummeling Florida and the southeast — once again raises the question of where
      people can continue to safely live. It might be that in an era of what researchers
      are calling “mega rain” events, a flood plain should now be off-limits. Editor’s

    paragraph_summary: On July 4, a powerful tropical storm unleashed an unprecedented
      20 inches of rain on south central Texas, leading to catastrophic flooding that
      resulted in the deaths of 109 people, including 27 children at a summer camp situated

      its banks within 45 minutes. As communities grapple with the aftermath, critical
      questions arise regarding local preparedness, such as the lack of warning sirens
      and the decision to allow children to camp in a flood-prone area. Additionally,
      concerns are mounting over the National Weather Service's ability to forecast
      such events amid budget cuts. The article emphasizes that this tragedy is part
      of a broader trend linked to climate change, exacerbated by fossil fuel consumption,
      which is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters while the
      federal government retreats from necessary climate policies and research.

      War kills in so many ways. These days, Americans are bombarded with images from
      Gaza and elsewhere of people or broken bodies being ferried on stretchers from
      the rubble of homes and hospitals, by rescue workers whose thin bodies and stricken
      faces suggest they are barely better off than those they’re helping. Social media
      and journalists make us eyewitnesses to emaciated children too weak to cry. And
      yet, compared with air raids that crush and bloody instantaneously, a slower disaster,
      more difficult to capture (especially given our made-for-TikTok attention spans),
      consists of the hours that many people in war zones spend wasting away from infectious
      diseases of one sort or another. Let me count a few of the ways. In Iraq in 2004,
      three-month-old Ali tries to cry but he’s too weak to make a sound, since his
      body has been ravaged by diarrhea. Between 2003 and 2007 , half of Iraq’s 18,000
      doctors left the country due to the deteriorating security situation (with few
      intending to return). Health facilities had also been bombed out and destroyed.
      By then, about two-thirds of the deaths of children under the age of five, like
      Ali, were due to respiratory infections and diarrhea compounded by malnutrition.
      In Pakistan in 2017, one of a handful of countries that has yet to eliminate the
      polio virus, the father of a five-year-old boy is inconsolable when he learns
      that his son will never walk on his own again. Among displaced people in the Afghan-Pakistani
      border region where they lived, concerns about counterinsurgency air raids from
      U.S. and later Pakistani government and opposition forces, security threats toward
      vaccination teams in conflict-torn parts of that country, and suspicions among
      parents like that boy’s father that health workers had been sent by the U.S. government
      to sterilize Pakistani children, all prevented kids from getting the immunizations
      that they needed. In Burkina Faso in 2019, three-year-old Abdoulaye dies after
      contracting malaria while in a shelter for people internally displaced by violence
      between government forces and Islamic militias. Malnourished and anemic, without
      direct access to a health clinic, he succumbs to a treatable illness. In Fayetteville,
      North Carolina, in 2020, as in other military towns across the U.S., rates of
      sexually transmitted infections like syphilis, herpes simplex, and HIV are among
      the highest in the country. Bases tend to drive up poverty among civilians by
      making the surrounding populations dependent on low-wage service work. And stressed-out,
      war-traumatized American soldiers are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior
      that spreads disease among the broader population. In Ukraine in 2023, a soldier
      treated for severe burns dies of sepsis, despite being given multiple antibiotics.
      Doctors found klebsiella, a multi-drug-resistant pathogen, in his body. Despite
      successful efforts by the Ukrainian government to curb antimicrobial resistance
      in its population prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion, mounting casualties, along
      with shortages of supplies and personnel, mean that Ukrainian health workers now
      try to do whatever they can to keep soldiers alive. In the long term, antibiotic-resistant
      infections traceable to Ukrainian patients are already beginning to appear in
      places as distant as Japan . In May 2025 in the Gaza strip, four-month-old Jenan
      dies from chronic diarrhea after losing half her bodyweight. She needed hypoallergenic
      milk formula, but aerial bombardments and blockades of basic food and medical
      supplies have made that once common product scarce. As anthropologist Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins
      points out, prior to the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October
      2023, cases of diarrhea in young children there averaged about 2,000 per month.
      In April of the following year, however, such cases already numbered more than
      100,000. Likewise, in the decade before the war, there were no large-scale epidemics
      in Gaza. In just the first seven months of that conflict, however, overcrowding
      in makeshift shelters, nutritional deficits, shortages of hygiene products — only
      one in every three Gazans has soap! — and contaminated water have led to new outbreaks
      of infectious diseases like measles, cholera, typhoid, and polio, exacerbated
      by widespread starvation. At some level, it couldn’t be simpler. War destroys
      all too many of the modern amenities that make life possible. Preventable illness
      and death occur even in industrialized settings that are marked by inequality,
      lack of information, psychological trauma, or just the chaos of combat that hinders
      long-term thinking. In poor- and middle-income countries like Yemen, Syria, and
      Nigeria, infectious diseases were already among the top causes of death, even
      before the outbreak of significant conflicts. Their incidence, however, grew so
      much worse in wartime, especially among civilians who didn’t have the same access
      to doctors and medical hospitals as armed groups. The body of a single child,
      wasting away from the lack of the basic fluid that runs in my sink or yours, best
      captures the way war casualties ripple across time and populations. For every
      soldier who dies in battle, exponentially more people suffer deaths from malnutrition,
      disease, or trauma-related violence even after battles end. Preventable infections
      play a large role in this story. The War on Children Children are particularly
      vulnerable to sickness and death in armed conflicts because of their immature
      immune systems, greater nutritional needs, tendency to succumb more easily to
      dehydration, and reliance on families who may not even be around to care for them.
      A study of more than 15,000 armed-conflict events in 35 African countries found
      that children aged 10 or younger were far more likely to die if they lived within
      100 kilometers of a battle zone than they would have in earlier periods of peacetime.
      Increases in mortality ranged from 3% to about 27%, varying with how many people
      also died in nearby battles. Strikingly, many more babies under the age of one
      died annually in the eight years following a conflict’s end than while the battles
      were going on — infectious disease being a primary killer. Take Yemen as an example
      of how war may affect young children and their families over time. Since the start
      of that country’s civil war in 2015, cholera, a waterborne illness doctors have
      known how to prevent since 1954, has ravaged the most vulnerable members of that
      country’s population, particularly children, due to a lack of appropriate sanitation
      or reasonable access to healthcare. As of December 2017, more than a million people
      had contracted the disease, nearly half of them children, and more than 2,000
      had died of the illness. Compare that to the more than 10,000 Yemenis estimated
      to have died in direct combat by that time, and you get an idea of how significantly
      death by illness counts among the casualties of war. Nearly a decade later, in
      fact, there are hundreds of thousands of new cases of that illness in Yemen each
      year and hundreds of annual deaths, making up more than a third of all cases globally.
      When Rami discovered that his daughters, aged 10 and 7, had cholera, he managed
      to scrape together the equivalent of about $15 to travel to a clinic so that the
      family could get lifesaving fluids and information to prevent further cases. Many
      families like his, however, can’t afford such treatment, forcing all too many
      of them to delay care or even experience the unthinkable: losing a child. Consider
      what it would do if someone you loved perished because they were born in the wrong
      place at the wrong time in the storm of war that destroys infrastructure so central
      to our lives that normally we barely even notice its presence. I hope it’s an
      experience that neither you nor I ever have. War and Displacement Still, I think
      about such things every day, as I bet do many of my colleagues connected to the
      Costs of War Project . When we first launched that project in 2011, Professors
      Catherine Lutz, Neta Crawford, and I met with experts in armed conflict to discuss
      how we would cover the issue of war’s health impacts. Repeatedly, they reminded
      us of how hard it is to talk about war and health without understanding what it’s
      like for families to be forced to leave their homes in search of safety. Unsurprisingly,
      refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) are uniquely vulnerable to disease
      and illness. Anyone who has gotten sick while traveling knows that the challenges
      of getting care are compounded by a lack of knowledge of the community you find
      yourself in. In the case of today’s more than 122 million war refugees or displaced
      people, stigma and harassment are frequent travel companions. According to one
      meta-analysis, more than one-fifth of refugee and IDP women have experienced some
      form of sexual violence while living in displacement settings. A study of more
      than 500 immigrants and refugees in Italy found that nearly half experienced physical
      violence, sexual abuse, harassment, or workplace discrimination. The stories that
      extremist politicians tell about migrants — think of Donald Trump’s tall tale
      of supposedly dog- and cat-eating Haitians in Springfield, Ohio — distract us
      from the social problems such politicians seem unwilling to deal with like loneliness
      and poverty. Displaced persons lack political clout and voting power in places
      that host them and, in actual war zones, fighters rarely respect shelters and
      camps designated for their survival. For people who flee their homes, the basic
      boring stuff is lacking, too. Only 35% of refugees have clean drinking water where
      they live, while less than a fifth of them have access to toilets . Imagine how
      that would affect all of the higher-order things you value in your life, including
      gatherings with people you care about, if you couldn’t even find a decent place
      to wash your hands or brush your teeth! Most of all, what stands out to me as
      both a social worker and a scholar of war is how people forced to leave their
      communities end up losing connections to health providers they trust. I can’t
      tell you how many individuals I’ve met in clinical and humanitarian settings who
      had declined to seek care for Covid-19, pneumonia, severe flu symptoms, and other
      illnesses because they lacked confidence that professionals in their host communities
      had their best interests at heart. My Government’s Assault on Public Health As
      Republicans in Congress struggle to pass a bill that would deprive millions of
      Americans of health insurance in the near term, as high-level officials spread
      disinformation about vaccines for once-eradicated illnesses like measles, and
      as public health workers and officials face threats of violence, all too many
      poor Americans are starting to experience the sorts of obstacles to healthcare
      common in war zones. Meanwhile, with the Trump administration’s decisions earlier
      this year to fire at least 2,000 U.S. Agency for International Development workers
      and freeze foreign aid dollars used (in part) to treat and monitor infectious
      diseases elsewhere on this planet, the threat that a foreign pandemic might make
      it to this country has grown considerably. To quote Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa)
      at a recent town hall with constituents worried about losing healthcare, “we are
      all going to die.” While that is indeed so, it also matters how. A long life with
      access to basic services like immunizations and clean water is one of the differences
      between dying like a human being and dying like one of the wild animals I find
      in my rural area, infected by bacteria in the water or exhausted from heat exposure.
      How, I wonder, did we Americans reach a place where many of us are silent or supportive
      of a strongman’s $45 million birthday military parade that closed roads to residents
      and commuters for days? How did we get to a time when our leaders seem loath to
      invest in healthcare and don’t even hide their disdain for poor people, a significant
      number of whom are military personnel and veterans? I’m not sure I know what this
      country stands for anymore. I don’t know about you, but these days America sometimes
      feels to me like a treacherous foreign land. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when

      War kills in so many ways. These days, Americans are bombarded with images from
      Gaza and elsewhere of people or broken bodies being ferried on stretchers from
      the rubble of homes and hospitals, by rescue workers whose thin bodies and stricken
      faces suggest they are barely better off than those they’re helping. Social media
      and journalists make us eyewitnesses to emaciated children too weak to cry. And
      yet, compared with air raids that crush and bloody instantaneously, a slower disaster,
      more difficult to capture (especially given our made-for-TikTok attention spans),
      consists of the hours that many people in war zones spend wasting away from infectious
      diseases of one sort or another. Let me count a few of the ways. In Iraq in 2004,
      three-month-old Ali tries to cry but he’s too weak to make a sound, since his
      body has been ravaged by diarrhea. Between 2003 and 2007 , half of Iraq’s 18,000
      doctors left the country due to the deteriorating security situation (with few
      intending to return). Health facilities had also been bombed out and destroyed.
      By then, about two-thirds of the deaths of children under the age of five, like
      Ali, were due to respiratory infections and diarrhea compounded by malnutrition.
      In Pakistan in 2017, one of a handful of countries that has yet to eliminate the
      polio virus, the father of a five-year-old boy is inconsolable when he learns
      that his son will never walk on his own again. Among displaced people in the Afghan-Pakistani
      border region where they lived, concerns about counterinsurgency air raids from
      U.S. and later Pakistani government and opposition forces, security threats toward
      vaccination teams in conflict-torn parts of that country, and suspicions among
      parents like that boy’s father that health workers had been sent by the U.S. government
      to sterilize Pakistani children, all prevented kids from getting the immunizations
      that they needed. In Burkina Faso in 2019, three-year-old Abdoulaye dies after
      contracting malaria while in a shelter for people internally displaced by violence
      between government forces and Islamic militias. Malnourished and anemic, without
      direct access to a health clinic, he succumbs to a treatable illness. In Fayetteville,
      North Carolina, in 2020, as in other military towns across the U.S., rates of
      sexually transmitted infections like syphilis, herpes simplex, and HIV are among
      the highest in the country. Bases tend to drive up poverty among civilians by
      making the surrounding populations dependent on low-wage service work. And stressed-out,
      war-traumatized American soldiers are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior
      that spreads disease among the broader population. In Ukraine in 2023, a soldier
      treated for severe burns dies of sepsis, despite being given multiple antibiotics.
      Doctors found klebsiella, a multi-drug-resistant pathogen, in his body. Despite
      successful efforts by the Ukrainian government to curb antimicrobial resistance
      in its population prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion, mounting casualties, along
      with shortages of supplies and personnel, mean that Ukrainian health workers now
      try to do whatever they can to keep soldiers alive. In the long term, antibiotic-resistant
      infections traceable to Ukrainian patients are already beginning to appear in
      places as distant as Japan . In May 2025 in the Gaza strip, four-month-old Jenan
      dies from chronic diarrhea after losing half her bodyweight. She needed hypoallergenic
      milk formula, but aerial bombardments and blockades of basic food and medical
      supplies have made that once common product scarce. As anthropologist Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins
      points out, prior to the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October
      2023, cases of diarrhea in young children there averaged about 2,000 per month.
      In April of the following year, however, such cases already numbered more than
      100,000. Likewise, in the decade before the war, there were no large-scale epidemics
      in Gaza. In just the first seven months of that conflict, however, overcrowding
      in makeshift shelters, nutritional deficits, shortages of hygiene products — only
      one in every three Gazans has soap! — and contaminated water have led to new outbreaks
      of infectious diseases like measles, cholera, typhoid, and polio, exacerbated
      by widespread starvation. At some level, it couldn’t be simpler. War destroys
      all too many of the modern amenities that make life possible. Preventable illness
      and death occur even in industrialized settings that are marked by inequality,
      lack of information, psychological trauma, or just the chaos of combat that hinders
      long-term thinking. In poor- and middle-income countries like Yemen, Syria, and
      Nigeria, infectious diseases were already among the top causes of death, even
      before the outbreak of significant conflicts. Their incidence, however, grew so
      much worse in wartime, especially among civilians who didn’t have the same access
      to doctors and medical hospitals as armed groups. The body of a single child,

      donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost When the history of the genocide
      in Gaza is written, one of the most courageous and outspoken champions for justice
      and the adherence to international law will be Francesca Albanese, the United
      Nations Special Rapporteur, who today the Trump administration is sanctioning.
      Her office is tasked with monitoring and reporting on human rights violations
      that Israel commits against Palestinians. Albanese, who regularly receives death
      threats and endures well-orchestrated smear campaigns directed by Israel and its
      allies, valiantly seeks to hold those who support and sustain the genocide accountable.
      She lambasts what she calls “the moral and political corruption of the world”
      that allows the genocide to continue. Her office has issued detailed reports documenting
      war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, one of which, called “ Genocide as colonial
      erasure ,” I have reprinted as an appendix in my latest book, “ A Genocide Foretold
      .” She has informed private organizations that they are “criminally liable” for
      assisting Israel in carrying out the genocide in Gaza. She announced that if true,
      as has been reported, that the former British prime minister David Cameron threatened
      to defund and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued
      arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense
      minister Yoav Gallant, which Cameron and the other former British prime minister
      Rishi Sunak could be charged with a criminal offense for, under the Rome Statue.
      The Rome Statue criminalizes those who seek to prevent war crimes from being prosecuted.
      She has called on top European Union (EU) officials to face charges of complicity
      of war crimes over their support for the genocide, saying that their actions cannot
      be met with impunity. She was a champion of the Madleen flotilla that sought to
      break the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, writing that the boat
      which was intercepted by Israel, was carrying not only supplies, but a message
      of humanity. You can see the interview I did with Albanese here . Her latest report
      lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc.,

      real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law, are
      making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. You can
      read my article on Albanese’s most recent report here . Secretary of State Marco
      Rubio condemned her support for the ICC, four of whose judges have been sanctioned
      by the U.S. for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last year. He
      criticized Albanese for her efforts to prosecute American or Israeli nationals
      who sustain the genocide, saying she is unfit for service as a special rapporteur.
      Rubio also accused Albanese of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed
      support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the
      West.” The sanctions will most likely prevent Albanese from travelling to the
      U.S. and will freeze any assets she may have in the country. The attack against
      Albanese presages a world without rules, one where rogue states, such as the U.S.
      and Israel, are permitted to carry out war crimes and genocide without any accountability
      or restraint. It exposes the subterfuges we use to fool ourselves and attempt
      to fool others. It reveals our hypocrisy, cruelty and racism. No one, from now
      on, will take seriously our stated commitments to democracy, freedom of expression,
      the rule of law or human rights. And who can blame them? We speak exclusively
      in the language of force, the language of brutes, the language of mass slaughter,
      the language of genocide. “The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction
      of psychological and physical torture, the devastation, the creation of conditions
      of life that would not allow the people in Gaza to live, from the destruction
      of hospitals, the mass forced displacement and the mass homelessness, while people
      were being bombed daily, and the starvation — how can we read these acts in isolation?”
      Albanese asked in an interview I did with her when we discussed her report, “Genocide
      as colonial erasure.” The militarized drones, helicopter gunships, walls and barriers,
      checkpoints, coils of concertina wire, watchtowers, detention centers, deportations,
      brutality and torture, denial of entry visas, apartheidesque existence that comes
      with being undocumented, loss of individual rights and electronic surveillance,
      are as familiar to desperate migrants along the Mexican border, or attempting
      to enter Europe, as they are to Palestinians. This is what awaits those who Frantz
      Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth.” Those that defend the oppressed, such
      as Albanese, will be treated like the oppressed. NOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM

    paragraph_summary: Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, is
      highlighted as a courageous advocate for justice in the face of the ongoing genocide
      in Gaza, particularly as she faces sanctions from the Trump administration and
      threats to her safety. Albanese's office is dedicated to monitoring human rights
      violations by Israel against Palestinians, and she has produced detailed reports
      documenting these war crimes, including one titled "Genocide as Colonial Erasure."
      She criticizes the global complicity that allows such atrocities to persist and
      has warned organizations of their potential criminal liability for supporting
      Israel's actions. Additionally, she has raised concerns about former British Prime
      Minister David Cameron's alleged threats to undermine the International Criminal
      Court in response to its actions against Israeli leaders, suggesting that such
      interference could constitute a criminal offense under international law.

      donation . By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost When the history of the genocide
      in Gaza is written, one of the most courageous and outspoken champions for justice
      and the adherence to international law will be Francesca Albanese, the United
      Nations Special Rapporteur, who today the Trump administration is sanctioning.
      Her office is tasked with monitoring and reporting on human rights violations
      that Israel commits against Palestinians. Albanese, who regularly receives death
      threats and endures well-orchestrated smear campaigns directed by Israel and its
      allies, valiantly seeks to hold those who support and sustain the genocide accountable.
      She lambasts what she calls “the moral and political corruption of the world”
      that allows the genocide to continue. Her office has issued detailed reports documenting
      war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, one of which, called “ Genocide as colonial
      erasure ,” I have reprinted as an appendix in my latest book, “ A Genocide Foretold
      .” She has informed private organizations that they are “criminally liable” for
      assisting Israel in carrying out the genocide in Gaza. She announced that if true,
      as has been reported, that the former British prime minister David Cameron threatened
      to defund and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued
      arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense
      minister Yoav Gallant, which Cameron and the other former British prime minister
      Rishi Sunak could be charged with a criminal offense for, under the Rome Statue.
      The Rome Statue criminalizes those who seek to prevent war crimes from being prosecuted.
      She has called on top European Union (EU) officials to face charges of complicity
      of war crimes over their support for the genocide, saying that their actions cannot
      be met with impunity. She was a champion of the Madleen flotilla that sought to
      break the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, writing that the boat
      which was intercepted by Israel, was carrying not only supplies, but a message
      of humanity. You can see the interview I did with Albanese here . Her latest report
      lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc.,
      Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon, International Business Machine
      Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institute
      of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as BlackRock, insurers,

      and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) And so it has come to pass: US President Donald
      Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” has set the stage for tax cuts for the rich, slashed
      services for the poor, and a host of other things that qualify as “beautiful”
      in the present dystopia. Some cuts, like those to Medicaid, have been heavily
      covered by the corporate media. But one key piece of the bill has gotten much
      less media scrutiny: The preposterous sum of $175 billion has been allocated to
      fund Trump’s signature mass deportation campaign, which, as a Salon article (
      7/3/25 ) points out, exceeds the military budget for every single country in the
      world aside from the US and China. Approximately $30 billion of that is destined
      directly for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the goons who have
      recently made a name for themselves by going around in masks and kidnapping people.
      This constitutes a threefold increase over ICE’s previous budget, and propels
      the outfit to the position of the largest US federal law enforcement agency in
      history. $45 billion will go toward building new ICE detention centers, including
      family detention centers. Prior to the signing into law of the sweeping bill on
      July 4, US Vice President JD Vance took to X to highlight what really mattered
      in the legislation: Everything else—the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] score,
      the proper baseline, the minutiae of the Medicaid policy—is immaterial compared
      to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions. Scant attention to ICE
      expansion And yet many US corporate media outlets have paid scant attention to
      this aspect of the bill and refrained from delving too deeply into the matter
      of what exactly this massive ramping up of ICE portends for American society.
      According to a search of the Nexis news database, while half (50%) of newspaper
      articles and news transcripts mentioning the reconciliation bill from its first
      passage in the House (May 20) to its signing into law (July 4) also mentioned
      Medicaid, less than 6% named Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE. Even
      many of those that did mention ICE barely gave it any attention. On July 3, for
      example, the New York Times presented readers with “ Nine Questions About the
      Republican Megabill, Answered ,” which in response to the first question—“Why
      is it being called a megabill?”—did manage to mention “a 150% boost to the Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement budget over the next five years.” However, there was no
      further discussion in the article’s remaining 1,500-plus words of potential ramifications
      of this boost—although there was a section devoted to the “tax break for Native
      Alaskan subsistence whaling captains.” That was more than CNN ’s intervention
      managed, also published on July 3, and headlined “Here’s Who Stands to Gain From
      the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill.’ And Who May Struggle.” The article aced a couple of
      no-brainers, including that “corporate America” would be “better off” thanks to
      the bill, while “low-income Americans” would be “worse off.” But there was not
      a single reference to the ICE budget—or who might “struggle” because of it. ‘Detention
      blitz’ This is not to imply, of course, that there are no articles detailing what
      ICE has been up to in terms of persecuting refuge seekers , visa holders, legal
      US residents and even US citizens —who supposedly have greater protections under
      the law—and how all of this stands to get worse, in accordance with the impending
      deluge of anti-immigration funds. In its report on ICE’s looming “detention blitz,”
      the Washington Post ( 7/4/25 ) noted that “at least 10 immigrants died while in
      ICE’s custody during the first half of this year,” and cited the finding that
      ICE is “now arresting people with no criminal charges at a higher rate than people
      charged with crimes.” The Post article also contained sufficiently thought-provoking
      details to enable the conscientious reader to draw their own conclusions regarding
      the ultimate purpose of manic detention schemes. (Hint: it’s not to keep America
      “safe.”) For instance, we learn that the share prices of GEO Group and CoreCivic—the
      two largest detention companies contracted by ICE, which have notorious reputations
      for detainee mistreatment—“each rose about 3%… as investors cheered the passage
      of congressional funding likely to result in a flurry of new contracts.” Lest
      there remain any doubt as to the centrality of profit flows to the immigration
      crackdown, the article specifies that GEO Group and CoreCivic “each gave $500,000
      to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, according to Federal Election Commission
      data.” This article, however, came after the legislation was passed. A Post opinion
      piece ( 6/30/25 ), meanwhile, put a human face on some of ICE’s victims, such
      as Jermaine Thomas, born to a US soldier on a military base in Germany. Following
      an incident of “suspected trespassing” in Texas, Thomas was deported by ICE to
      Jamaica, a country he had never set foot in. Other victims spotlighted by the
      Post include 64-year-old Iranian immigrant Madonna Kashanian, nabbed while gardening
      at her house in New Orleans, and a six-year-old Honduran boy with leukemia who
      was arrested at an immigration court in California while pursuing his asylum case
      with his family. It was also possible, if one sought it out, to find reporting
      on what the cash infusion entails from a logistical perspective: more agents ,
      more arrests, more racial profiling , increased detention capacity , and a deportation
      system that runs “like Amazon , trying to get your product delivered in 24 hours,”
      as ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons charmingly put it . ‘Police state first’ Gutting
      Medicaid is certainly an angle on the reconciliation bill that deserved the media
      attention it got, and will devastate millions in this country. But the massive
      infusion of money and power to ICE will likewise devastate millions with a ballooning
      police state that unleashes terror, rips apart families and creates a network
      of concentration camps across the country. Given ICE’s contemporary track record
      and de facto exemption from the constraints of due process , the public desperately
      needs a media that will connect the dots in order to convey a bigger-picture look
      of what America is up against. In an interview with Jacobin magazine ( 7/3/25
      ) on how “ICE Is About to Get More Money Than It Can Spend,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick
      —a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council—made the crucial observation:
      “You don’t build the mass deportation machine without building the police state
      first.” This is precisely the analysis that is missing from corporate media coverage
      of the bill. Beyond making life hell for the undocumented workers on whose very
      labor the US economy depends, ICE has become a tool for political repression as
      well—as evidenced by a slew of recent episodes involving the abduction and disappearance
      of international scholars whose political opinions did not coincide with those
      of the commander in chief of our, um, democracy. Take the case of 30-year-old
      Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student and Fulbright scholar studying childhood
      development at Tufts University in Massachusetts. While walking to an iftar dinner
      in March, Öztürk was accosted by six plainclothes officers, some of them masked,
      and forced into an unmarked van, after which she was flown halfway across the
      country to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Her crime, apparently, was to
      have co-written an opinion piece last year for the Tufts Daily ( 3/26/24 ), in
      which she and her co-authors encouraged the university to accede to demands by
      the Tufts Community Union Senate by recognizing the Israeli genocide in the Gaza
      Strip and divesting from companies with ties to Israel. Öztürk’s case is hardly
      an isolated one. There’s Badar Khan Suri , a postdoctoral researcher at Georgetown
      University who was seized by masked agents outside his Virginia home and swept
      off to an ICE facility in Texas. There’s Momodou Taal , a British-Gambian former
      PhD student at Cornell who sued the Trump administration over the crackdown on
      Palestine solidarity and then self-deported, explaining that he had “lost faith
      [he] could walk the streets without being abducted.” And the list goes on ( Al
      Jazeera , 5/15/25 ). ‘Homegrowns are next’ In the twisted view of the US government,
      of course, opposing the US-backed genocide of Palestinians equals support for
      “terrorism”—and in Trump’s view , basically anything that goes against his own
      thinking and policies potentially constitutes a criminal offense. It follows that
      Öztürk-style politically motivated kidnappings by the state are presumably merely
      the top of a very slippery slope that US citizens, too, will soon find themselves
      careening down—especially as Trump has already exhibited enthusiasm at the prospect
      of outsourcing the incarceration of US citizens to El Salvador: “The homegrowns
      are next,” he told Salvadoran autocrat Nayib Bukele. The line between citizens
      and residents has been intentionally blurred, with the Trump Justice Department
      announcing it was “Prioritizing Denaturalization”—that is, stripping citizenship
      from foreign-born citizens. This draconian punishment has been proposed for Trump’s
      political enemies, from New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to former BFF
      Elon Musk . Trump has also taken aim at the constitutional right of birthright
      citizenship , potentially turning millions of other Americans into ICE targets.
      Somehow, the elite media have not deemed it necessary to dwell even superficially
      on the implications of super-funding a rogue agency that has essentially been
      given carte blanche to indiscriminately round people up—be they undocumented workers,
      political dissidents, or just somebody who “looks like somebody we are looking
      for.” As for CNN ’s write-up on “who stands to gain from the ‘big, beautiful bill,’”
      it’s definitely not all the folks currently living in a permanent state of fear,
      deprived of basic freedoms like movement, speech and thought. Editor’s Note :

      bill signed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which allocates a staggering $175
      billion for mass deportation efforts, overshadowing other budgetary concerns such
      as Medicaid cuts. This funding includes approximately $30 billion for U.S. Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement (ICE), marking a threefold increase in their budget and
      making ICE the largest federal law enforcement agency in U.S. history. Additionally,
      $45 billion is designated for the construction of new ICE detention centers, including
      those for families. The article emphasizes that while corporate media has focused
      on certain cuts, the massive financial commitment to immigration enforcement has
      received less scrutiny, with Vice President JD Vance highlighting its significance
      over other legislative details.

      one of the scariest moments in modern history, we''re doing our best at ScheerPost
      to pierce the fog of lies that conceal it but we need some help to pay our writers
      and staff. Please consider a tax-deductible donation . By Belén Fernández / Fairness
      and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) And so it has come to pass: US President Donald
      Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” has set the stage for tax cuts for the rich, slashed
      services for the poor, and a host of other things that qualify as “beautiful”
      in the present dystopia. Some cuts, like those to Medicaid, have been heavily
      covered by the corporate media. But one key piece of the bill has gotten much
      less media scrutiny: The preposterous sum of $175 billion has been allocated to
      fund Trump’s signature mass deportation campaign, which, as a Salon article (
      7/3/25 ) points out, exceeds the military budget for every single country in the
      world aside from the US and China. Approximately $30 billion of that is destined
      directly for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the goons who have
      recently made a name for themselves by going around in masks and kidnapping people.
      This constitutes a threefold increase over ICE’s previous budget, and propels
      the outfit to the position of the largest US federal law enforcement agency in
      history. $45 billion will go toward building new ICE detention centers, including
      family detention centers. Prior to the signing into law of the sweeping bill on
      July 4, US Vice President JD Vance took to X to highlight what really mattered
      in the legislation: Everything else—the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] score,
      the proper baseline, the minutiae of the Medicaid policy—is immaterial compared
      to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions. Scant attention to ICE
      expansion And yet many US corporate media outlets have paid scant attention to
      this aspect of the bill and refrained from delving too deeply into the matter
      of what exactly this massive ramping up of ICE portends for American society.
      According to a search of the Nexis news database, while half (50%) of newspaper
      articles and news transcripts mentioning the reconciliation bill from its first
      passage in the House (May 20) to its signing into law (July 4) also mentioned
      Medicaid, less than 6% named Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE. Even
      many of those that did mention ICE barely gave it any attention. On July 3, for
      example, the New York Times presented readers with “ Nine Questions About the
      Republican Megabill, Answered ,” which in response to the first question—“Why
      is it being called a megabill?”—did manage to mention “a 150% boost to the Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement budget over the next five years.” However, there was no
      further discussion in the article’s remaining 1,500-plus words of potential ramifications
      of this boost—although there was a section devoted to the “tax break for Native
      Alaskan subsistence whaling captains.” That was more than CNN ’s intervention
      managed, also published on July 3, and headlined “Here’s Who Stands to Gain From
      the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill.’ And Who May Struggle.” The article aced a couple of
      no-brainers, including that “corporate America” would be “better off” thanks to
      the bill, while “low-income Americans” would be “worse off.” But there was not
      a single reference to the ICE budget—or who might “struggle” because of it. ‘Detention
      blitz’ This is not to imply, of course, that there are no articles detailing what
      ICE has been up to in terms of persecuting refuge seekers , visa holders, legal
      US residents and even US citizens —who supposedly have greater protections under
      the law—and how all of this stands to get worse, in accordance with the impending
      deluge of anti-immigration funds. In its report on ICE’s looming “detention blitz,”
      the Washington Post ( 7/4/25 ) noted that “at least 10 immigrants died while in
      ICE’s custody during the first half of this year,” and cited the finding that
      ICE is “now arresting people with no criminal charges at a higher rate than people
      charged with crimes.” The Post article also contained sufficiently thought-provoking
      details to enable the conscientious reader to draw their own conclusions regarding
      the ultimate purpose of manic detention schemes. (Hint: it’s not to keep America
      “safe.”) For instance, we learn that the share prices of GEO Group and CoreCivic—the
      two largest detention companies contracted by ICE, which have notorious reputations
      for detainee mistreatment—“each rose about 3%… as investors cheered the passage
      of congressional funding likely to result in a flurry of new contracts.” Lest
      there remain any doubt as to the centrality of profit flows to the immigration
      crackdown, the article specifies that GEO Group and CoreCivic “each gave $500,000
      to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, according to Federal Election Commission
      data.” This article, however, came after the legislation was passed. A Post opinion
      piece ( 6/30/25 ), meanwhile, put a human face on some of ICE’s victims, such
      as Jermaine Thomas, born to a US soldier on a military base in Germany. Following
      an incident of “suspected trespassing” in Texas, Thomas was deported by ICE to
      Jamaica, a country he had never set foot in. Other victims spotlighted by the
      Post include 64-year-old Iranian immigrant Madonna Kashanian, nabbed while gardening
      at her house in New Orleans, and a six-year-old Honduran boy with leukemia who
      was arrested at an immigration court in California while pursuing his asylum case
      with his family. It was also possible, if one sought it out, to find reporting
      on what the cash infusion entails from a logistical perspective: more agents ,
      more arrests, more racial profiling , increased detention capacity , and a deportation
      system that runs “like Amazon , trying to get your product delivered in 24 hours,”
      as ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons charmingly put it . ‘Police state first’ Gutting
      Medicaid is certainly an angle on the reconciliation bill that deserved the media
      attention it got, and will devastate millions in this country. But the massive
      infusion of money and power to ICE will likewise devastate millions with a ballooning
      police state that unleashes terror, rips apart families and creates a network
      of concentration camps across the country. Given ICE’s contemporary track record
      and de facto exemption from the constraints of due process , the public desperately
      needs a media that will connect the dots in order to convey a bigger-picture look
      of what America is up against. In an interview with Jacobin magazine ( 7/3/25
      ) on how “ICE Is About to Get More Money Than It Can Spend,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick
      —a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council—made the crucial observation:
      “You don’t build the mass deportation machine without building the police state
      first.” This is precisely the analysis that is missing from corporate media coverage
      of the bill. Beyond making life hell for the undocumented workers on whose very
      labor the US economy depends, ICE has become a tool for political repression as
      well—as evidenced by a slew of recent episodes involving the abduction and disappearance
      of international scholars whose political opinions did not coincide with those
      of the commander in chief of our, um, democracy. Take the case of 30-year-old
      Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student and Fulbright scholar studying childhood
      development at Tufts University in Massachusetts. While walking to an iftar dinner
      in March, Öztürk was accosted by six plainclothes officers, some of them masked,
      and forced into an unmarked van, after which she was flown halfway across the
      country to an ICE detention center in Louisiana. Her crime, apparently, was to
      have co-written an opinion piece last year for the Tufts Daily ( 3/26/24 ), in
      which she and her co-authors encouraged the university to accede to demands by
      the Tufts Community Union Senate by recognizing the Israeli genocide in the Gaza
      Strip and divesting from companies with ties to Israel. Öztürk’s case is hardly
      an isolated one. There’s Badar Khan Suri , a postdoctoral researcher at Georgetown
      University who was seized by masked agents outside his Virginia home and swept
      off to an ICE facility in Texas. There’s Momodou Taal , a British-Gambian former
      PhD student at Cornell who sued the Trump administration over the crackdown on
      Palestine solidarity and then self-deported, explaining that he had “lost faith
      [he] could walk the streets without being abducted.” And the list goes on ( Al
      Jazeera , 5/15/25 ). ‘Homegrowns are next’ In the twisted view of the US government,
      of course, opposing the US-backed genocide of Palestinians equals support for
      “terrorism”—and in Trump’s view , basically anything that goes against his own
      thinking and policies potentially constitutes a criminal offense. It follows that
      Öztürk-style politically motivated kidnappings by the state are presumably merely
      the top of a very slippery slope that US citizens, too, will soon find themselves
      careening down—especially as Trump has already exhibited enthusiasm at the prospect
      of outsourcing the incarceration of US citizens to El Salvador: “The homegrowns
      are next,” he told Salvadoran autocrat Nayib Bukele. The line between citizens
      and residents has been intentionally blurred, with the Trump Justice Department
      announcing it was “Prioritizing Denaturalization”—that is, stripping citizenship
      from foreign-born citizens. This draconian punishment has been proposed for Trump’s
      political enemies, from New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to former BFF
      Elon Musk . Trump has also taken aim at the constitutional right of birthright
      citizenship , potentially turning millions of other Americans into ICE targets.
      Somehow, the elite media have not deemed it necessary to dwell even superficially
      on the implications of super-funding a rogue agency that has essentially been
      given carte blanche to indiscriminately round people up—be they undocumented workers,
      political dissidents, or just somebody who “looks like somebody we are looking
      for.” As for CNN ’s write-up on “who stands to gain from the ‘big, beautiful bill,’”
      it’s definitely not all the folks currently living in a permanent state of fear,
      deprived of basic freedoms like movement, speech and thought. Editor’s Note :

      / OtherWords The GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which narrowly passed Congress
      and was recently signed by President Trump, represents the largest transfer of
      wealth from the poor to the rich since chattel slavery. Here are just 10 of the
      worst things about it. 1. It’s going to kill people. Cuts to Medicaid and the
      Affordable Care Act, combined with new administrative hurdles, could result in
      an estimated 51,000 preventable deaths per year. The new law and other actions
      by the Trump administration will strip health insurance from 17 million people
      . 2. It will be an apocalypse for rural hospitals. The budget restricts the provider
      taxes that many states use to fund Medicaid. The threat is particularly severe
      for rural hospitals , which rely heavily on Medicaid revenue. More than 700 rural
      hospitals are already at risk of closure — and at least 338 are at increased risk
      due to changes in this budget. 3. It takes food from the mouths of hungry people.
      New work requirements for SNAP benefits will take food assistance from millions
      , including children and veterans. As with Medicaid, new work requirements for
      SNAP will have little effect on employment, but will cause more children to go
      hungry. 4. It squeezes states on SNAP. For the first time, states will have to
      take on a significant share of funding SNAP. This unprecedented shift will likely
      lead many states to cut enrollees or even terminate food aid altogether. 5. It
      bars lawfully present immigrants from aid. Hundreds of thousands of lawfully present
      immigrants , including children, will lose access to Medicaid, the Children’ s
      Health Insurance Program, Medicare, ACA tax credits, and SNAP benefits. And 2.6
      million U.S. citizen children who live with only an undocumented adult are expected
      to lose their Child Tax Credit. 6. It terrorizes immigrant families. The GOP budget
      provides $170 billion to arrest, detain, deport, and wall off migrants. That includes
      $45 billion for new immigration detention centers, including family detention
      facilities —  a vast increase that will primarily benefit private companies contracted
      to build and run them. 7. It takes from the poor to give to the rich. The bill’s
      tax policies will overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest households . A Yale analysis
      of the bill’s combined tax and spending policies finds that the poorest 20 percent
      of households will suffer a net income loss of $700 per year on average, while
      the top 1 percent will get a $30,000 increase. 8. Corporations will take the spoils
      for themselves. The budget keeps the corporate tax rate at 21 percent, a drastic
      reduction from the 35 percent rate from before the first Trump tax cuts in 2018
      — despite the fact that ordinary workers have not benefited from this rate reduction.
      9. It rewards polluters while raising energy costs. The budget also includes more
      than $1 billion in new tax breaks and subsidies for the fossil fuel industry,
      accelerating climate change while costing taxpayers. It also allows oil and gas
      companies to avoid paying fees for polluting methane leaks, a major cause of climate
      change. Meanwhile, cuts to clean energy subsidies could raise household energy
      bills by $415 a year over the next decade. 10. It funds war and enriches war profiteers.
      The bill gives the Pentagon a $150 billion boost, bringing overall Pentagon spending
      to over $1 trillion — a record high. That includes $25 billion for the “Golden
      Dome,” a missile defense system that’s economically and physically impossible
      but would enrich wealthy Pentagon contractors like Elon Musk . Instead, Congress
      should harness America’s abundant wealth to create a moral economy that works
      for all of us. By fairly taxing the wealthy and big corporations, reducing our
      bloated military budget, and de-militarizing immigration policy, we could free
      up more than enough public funds to ensure we can all survive and thrive. We have
      no excuse for not investing our national resources in ways that reflect our Constitutional
      values: to establish justice, domestic tranquility, real security, and the general
      welfare for all. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      confrontation between Iran and Israel marked a decisive shift in regional power
      equations, particularly in the Persian Gulf. Iran’s direct and calibrated military
      response – executed through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – exposed
      the strategic vulnerabilities of Tel Aviv and forced Gulf capitals, chiefly Riyadh,
      to reassess long-standing assumptions about regional security. The Saudi-led recalibration
      did not emerge in isolation. Years of cumulative political, military, and diplomatic
      failures under the umbrella of US-Israeli tutelage have pushed Persian Gulf states
      to seek more viable, non-confrontational security arrangements. What we are witnessing
      is the slow dismantling of obsolete alliances and the opening of pragmatic, interest-driven
      channels with Tehran. Iran’s war strategy resets Gulf expectations Tehran’s handling
      of the latest military clash – with its reliance on precision strikes, regional
      alliances, and calibrated escalation – demonstrated a new level of deterrence.
      Using its regional networks, missile bases, and sophisticated drones, Tehran managed
      the confrontation very carefully, avoiding being drawn into all-out war, but at
      the same time sending clear messages to the enemy about its ability to deter and
      expand engagement if necessary. The message to the Gulf was clear: Iran is neither
      isolated nor vulnerable. It is capable of shaping outcomes across multiple fronts
      without falling into full-scale war. Speaking to The Cradle , a well-informed
      Arab diplomat says: “This war was a turning point in the Saudi thinking. Riyadh
      now understands Iran is a mature military power, immune to coercion. Traditional
      pressure no longer works. Saudi security now depends on direct engagement with
      Iran – not on Israel, and certainly not under the receding American security umbrella.”
      At the heart of Saudi discontent lies Tel Aviv’s escalating aggression against
      the Palestinians and its outright dismissal of Arab peace initiatives , including
      the Riyadh-led 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
      intransigence – particularly the aggressive expansion of settlements in Jerusalem
      and the occupied West Bank – has alarmed the Saudis. These provocations not only
      sabotage diplomatic efforts but strike at the kingdom’s pan-Islamic legitimacy,
      forcing a reassessment of Israel’s utility as a strategic partner. As the diplomatic
      source notes: “This Israeli political stalemate pushes Saudi Arabia to reconsider
      its regional bets and view Iran as a regional power factor that cannot be ignored.”
      Riyadh turns to Tehran: containment over confrontation Behind closed doors, Saudi
      Arabia is advancing a strategy of “positive containment” with Iran. This marks
      a clear departure from the era of proxy wars and ideological hostility. Riyadh
      is no longer seeking confrontation – it is seeking coordination, particularly
      on issues of regional security and energy. Diplomatic sources inform The Cradle
      that the reopening of embassies and stepped-up security coordination are not mere
      side effects of Chinese mediation . They reflect a deeper Saudi conviction: that
      normalization with Israel yields no meaningful security dividends, especially
      after Tel Aviv’s exposed vulnerabilities in the last war. Riyadh’s new path also
      signals its growing appetite for regional solutions away from Washington – a position
      increasingly shared by other Persian Gulf states. For its part, the Islamic Republic
      is moving swiftly to convert military leverage into political capital. Beyond
      showcasing its missile and drone capabilities , Iran is now actively courting
      Arab states of the Persian Gulf with proposals for economic cooperation, regional
      integration, and the construction of an indigenous security architecture. Informed
      sources reveal to The Cradle that Iran is pursuing comprehensive engagement with
      Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Oman. This includes economic partnerships and
      alignment on key regional files, from Yemen to Syria and Iraq. Tehran’s position
      is consistent with its long-stated view: The Persian Gulf’s security must be decided
      by its littoral states and peoples – not by foreign agendas. A new Gulf alliance
      is taking shape This is no longer a Saudi story alone. The UAE is expanding economic
      cooperation with Tehran, while maintaining open security channels. Qatar sustains
      a solid diplomatic line with Iran, using its credibility to broker key regional
      talks. Oman remains the region’s trusted bridge and discreet mediator. An Arab
      diplomat briefed on recent developments tells The Cradle : “Upcoming Gulf–Iran
      meetings will address navigation in the Strait of Hormuz, energy coordination,
      and broader regional files. There is consensus building that understanding with
      Iran open the door to a more stable phase in the Gulf.” Amid these realignments,
      Israel finds itself regionally sidelined – its project to forge an anti-Iran axis
      has crumbled. The US-brokered Abraham Accords – once trumpeted as a strategic
      triumph – now elicit little more than polite disinterest across the Gulf, with
      even existing Arab signatories walking back their engagement. Riyadh’s political
      elite now openly question the utility of normalization. As Tel Aviv continues
      its war on Gaza, Gulf populations grow more vocal and Saudi leaders more cautious.
      The Saudi position is unspoken but unmistakable: Tel Aviv can no longer guarantee
      security, nor can it be viewed as the gatekeeper to regional stability any longer.
      Pragmatism trumps ideology This Saudi–Iranian thaw is not ideological – it is
      hard-nosed realpolitik. As another senior Arab diplomat tells The Cradle: “Riyadh
      is discarding illusions. Dialogue with neighbors – not alliance with Washington
      and Tel Aviv – is now the route to safeguarding Saudi interests. This is now about
      facts, not old loyalties. Iran is now a fixed component of the Gulf’s security
      equation.” The binary of “Gulf versus Iran” is fading. The last war accelerated
      a trend long in motion: the collapse of Pax Americana and the emergence of multipolar
      regionalism . The Gulf is charting a new course – one less beholden to US-Israeli
      diktats. Today, Saudi Arabia sees Tehran not as a threat to be neutralized, but
      as a power to be engaged . Regional security frameworks are being built from within.
      Israel, meanwhile, despite its many pontifications about a Tel Aviv-led, Arab-aligned
      “Middle East,” is struggling to stay relevant. If these dynamics hold, we are
      on the cusp of a historic transition – one that may finally allow the Persian
      Gulf to define its own security and sovereignty, on its own terms. This is not
      an ideal future. But it is a strategic upgrade from decades of subservience. Saudi
      Arabia is turning toward Iran – not out of love, but out of logic. Editor’s Note

      ordered the IDF to prepare a plan to establish a camp to concentrate the entire
      civilian population of Gaza on the ruins of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. According
      to Haaretz , Katz said that once Palestinian civilians are pushed into what he
      is calling a “humanitarian city,” they will not be allowed to leave. The idea
      is to first transfer 600,000 civilians from the al-Mawasi tent camp on the coast
      in southern Gaza, followed by the rest of the civilian population. Katz said that
      if conditions permit, the “city” could be built during a potential 60-day ceasefire,
      comments that will make Hamas less likely to agree to a temporary truce. The Israeli
      defense minister also said that during the ceasefire, Israel will maintain control
      of the “Morag Corridor,” a strip of land between Rafah and Khan Younis. Katz also
      suggested the camp can facilitate the government’s ultimate goal of ethnic cleansing,
      which it refers to as “voluntary migration,” telling reporters that Israel will
      implement “the emigration plan, which will happen.” Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel
      Smotrich has previously said that the goal of Israel’s current military operation,
      dubbed Gideon’s Chariots, is to create a concentration camp south of the Morag
      Corridor and pressure the civilians forced into it to leave. “The Gazan citizens
      will be concentrated in the south. They will be totally despairing, understanding
      that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for
      relocation to begin a new life in other places,” Smotrich said in May. Katz’s
      comments come after Reuters reported that the controversial US-backed Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF) had proposed to the US government the idea of creating camps
      it called “Humanitarian Transit Areas” inside Gaza or possibly outside Gaza. The
      GHF plan describes the camps as “large-scale” and “voluntary” places where the
      Palestinian population could “temporarily reside, deradicalize, re-integrate and
      prepare to relocate if they wish to do so.” Katz said Israel is seeking “international
      partners” to manage the zone and that four aid distribution sites would be set
      up inside the camp, suggesting the GHF will be involved in the plan. GHF aid sites
      are secured by American security contractors, who have been credibly accused of
      using live ammunition and stun grenades to disperse crowds of hungry Palestinian
      civilians. Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model of responsible

      Press host Kristen Welker ( 6/29/25 ) showed courage by interviewing Zohran Mamdani,
      the winner of the Democratic mayoral primary for New York, after he’d been widely
      attacked by corporate media. But unfortunately, she fell into a trap that has
      been set repeatedly in recent months to smear Mamdani. She asked him to condemn
      the phrase “globalize the intifada,” claiming—without offering evidence—that the
      term “intifada” refers to “violence against Jews.” I doubt Welker is an Arabic
      linguist. But as a Palestinian journalist who covered the Intifada and helped
      introduce the term to Western media, I am appalled by this misrepresentation.
      Not only is the translation wrong, it’s an insult to the thousands of New York
      Jews who voted for Mamdani. For the record, intifada translates to “shake off.”
      Palestinians used the term to describe their popular resistance against an Israeli
      occupation of their land that had no end in sight. It emerged amid a steady expansion
      of illegal settlements, which were systematically turning the occupied territories
      into a Swiss cheese–like landscape, precisely designed to prevent the establishment
      of a Palestinian state. As someone who reported on the Intifada and explained
      its meaning to international audiences, I can say unequivocally: Intifada was
      used by Palestinian activists to describe a civil resistance movement rooted in
      dignity and national self-determination. Metaphor for liberation Let’s begin with
      the word’s literal meaning. As noted, in Arabic, intifada simply means “shaking
      off.” Since many—including Jewish leaders, Christian Zionists and GOP officials—have
      distorted the peaceful intentions behind the word, I turned to a source that might
      resonate more clearly with people of faith: the Bible. In the Arabic version of
      the Old Testament, the word intifada appears three times, both as a noun and a
      verb. Looking at its English equivalents in the New International Version (though
      other translations are similar) offers enlightening context: Judges 16:20 : “Samson
      awoke from his sleep and thought, ‘I’ll go out as before and shake myself free
      .’” Isaiah 52:2 : “ Shake off your dust; rise up, sit enthroned, Jerusalem. Free
      yourself from the chains on your neck, Daughter Zion, now a captive.” Psalm 109:23
      : “I fade away like an evening shadow; I am shaken off like a locust.” Each of
      these examples uses the term intifada —shaking off oppression, captivity or anguish—as
      a metaphor for liberation, not violence. While Google Translate and other modern
      tools often render intifada as “popular uprising,” its literal meaning—“to shake
      off”—captures the spirit with which Palestinians adopted the term. When they launched
      the first Intifada in 1987—after 20 years under a foreign military occupation—it
      was an expression of a desire to wake up, rise and throw off the chains of subjugation.
      It is not inherently antisemitic, nor does it refer by default to terrorism or
      violence. While accompanying international journalists covering the protests,
      I often discussed this with them. In Jerusalem, I explained to LA Times bureau
      chief Dan Fisher, the Washington Post ’s Glenn Frankel and the New York Times
      ’ John Kifner what Palestinians meant by the word. I told them that throughout
      Palestinian patriotic literature and slogans, two distinctions were always made:
      The Intifada was a protest against the Israeli occupation, not against Jews or
      the existence of Israel, and that the ultimate goal was to achieve an independent
      Palestinian state alongside Israel. Fisher , Frankel and Kifner included these
      clarifications in their reports, helping the Arabic term intifada enter the global
      lexicon with its intended meaning. ‘Bringing terror to the streets of America’
      But today, as protests against Israel’s devastating war on Gaza mount, the word
      is being twisted. When Rep. Elise Stefanik grilled the presidents of UPenn, Harvard,
      and MIT in December 2023 about pro-Palestinian chants invoking “intifada,” she
      equated the term with “genocide of Jews.” The university presidents faltered.
      They should have said clearly: Genocide against Jews—or any people—is abhorrent.
      But intifada is not synonymous with genocide. To equate a call to end the Israeli
      military occupation with a call for genocide or violence against Jews is a gross
      distortion—a bizarre reversal that paints the victims as aggressors. And yet this
      distortion persists. [Gillibrand] Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled
      Mamdani antisemitic. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt—who likely
      doesn’t speak Arabic— claimed on X that intifada is “explicit incitement to violence.”
      Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) added that the word is “well understood to refer to
      the violent terror attacks.” Sen. Kristen Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) told WNYC public
      radio ( 6/26/25 ), “The global intifada is a statement that means destroy Israel
      and kill all the Jews.” Media echoed the politicians’ misrepresentations of intifada
      . “Many Jews see it as a call to violence against Israeli civilians,” ABC ( 6/29/25
      ) reported. “Many Jews consider it a call to violence, a nod to deadly attacks
      on civilians in Israel by Palestinians in uprisings in the 1980s and 2000s,” wrote
      the New York Times ( 6/25/25 ). Of course, “many Jews” do not hear the word that
      way—but the more important question is, what is the accurate understanding of
      the word as used by Palestinians? Fox News ( 5/23/25 ) didn’t mince words: “‘Intifada’
      Means Bringing Terror to the Streets of America,” it said in a headline, citing
      notorious Islamophobe Douglas Murray. To the New York Times ‘ Bret Stephens (
      7/1/25 ), “What Intifada Really Means” is “giving moral comfort to people who
      deliberately murder innocent Jews.” Even liberal podcast host Donny Deutsch repeated
      the same claim while speaking on MSNBC ( Morning Joe , 6/30/25 ): I’m outraged
      that we have a candidate for mayor of New York, Mr. Mamdani, that cannot walk
      back or cannot condemn the words “globalize the intifada” and his nuance of, “Well,
      it means different things for different people.” Well, let me tell you what it
      means to a Jew—it means violence. Brutal suppression of protest The first Intifada
      embraced principles of nonviolent resistance championed by Martin Luther King
      Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. My cousin, Mubarak Awad , who established the Palestinian
      Center for the Study of Nonviolence, encouraged boycotts of Israeli products,
      labor strikes and grassroots economic development in preparation for statehood.
      He translated, printed and distributed Arabic translations of Gene Sharp’s writings
      on nonviolence throughout the occupied territories. Mubarak was deported on the
      eve of the Intifada by then–Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. After Shamir
      came Yitzhak Rabin, who called publicly to “ break the bones ” of Palestinian
      stone throwers. During the first Intifada, Israeli soldiers and settlers responded
      to the nonfatal protests with extreme violence. In the first phase of the uprising—a
      little more than a year—332 Palestinians were killed, along with 12 Israelis (
      Middle East Monitor , 12/8/16 ). This brutality did not suppress the protests,
      but merely escalated the violence: At the end of six years, more than 1,500 Palestinians,
      including more than 300 children, and 400 Israelis—18 of whom were children—were
      dead , according to the Israeli human rights group B’tselem. The same pattern
      recurred in the second Intifada: Only after the initial protests were met with
      massively disproportionate force did Palestinians, led by Hamas, turn to suicide
      bombing as a desperation tactic ( Al Jazeera , 9/28/20 ). To treat the response
      to the brutal suppression of protest as though it represented the essential nature
      of intifada is intellectually lazy and politically cynical. Zohran Mamdani never
      used the words “global intifada.” But he refused to denounce calls for the world
      to wake up and speak out against atrocities in Gaza. His victory in the Democratic
      primary—supported in part by Jewish New Yorkers—shows he is neither antisemitic
      nor willing to renounce an Arabic word that has been hijacked and misused by people
      who would rather Palestinians remain silent and submissive under occupation. Research

      Ludwig / Truthout Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska cast a deciding vote
      for the GOP’s unpopular budget package after publicly admitting the bill is “bad”
      and would disadvantage people across the United States. After negotiating carveouts
      to protect some of her own constituents, Murkowski urged House Republicans to
      make revisions before sending the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk. Polls
      show the package is historically unpopular given its size and scope, but even
      Republicans who raised concerns about harming their own constituents fell in line.
      “I know that in many parts of the country, there are Americans who are not going
      to be advantaged by this bill,” Murkowski told reporters after voting for the
      package. “I don’t like that.” However, the House quickly voted along party lines
      to pass the bill, including multiple Republicans who previously expressed concern
      over deep cuts to health care and nutrition programs their constituents rely on.
      The cuts will pay for Trump’s brutal immigration crackdown as well as tax cuts
      to benefit his wealthy donors; all in all, the bill is projected to cost low-income
      families about $1,600 each year while boosting incomes for the highest earners
      by $12,000. At least two Republicans announced early retirement from Congress
      after facing controversy over Medicaid cuts that will push millions off health
      insurance. Trump signed the legislation into law on July 4. With at least one
      safety net hospital in Nebraska already announcing plans to close due to funding
      insecurity, and Democrats chomping at the bit for the midterms, why did so many
      vulnerable Republicans fall in line? Democrats say Republicans are terrified of
      Trump, but according to Omar Noureldin, the senior vice president for policy and
      litigation at Common Cause, the corruptive influence of big money in politics
      is a key reason why a bill like this one could pass. That influence exploded after
      the Supreme Court’s 2010 landmark decision in Citizens United vs. FEC , which
      dissolved decades-old restrictions on corporate political spending and ushered
      in the era of super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money. The
      cost of campaigns skyrocketed , and tens of billions of dollars now pour into
      federal elections during a single season. “A budget is a moral document. The reason
      why a bill like that can pass even though it has destructive effects on communities
      in red states and blue states is because of the corruptive influence of money
      in politics,” Noureldin said in an interview. “We’re at a place where a billionaire’s
      budget passed because money prevailed over morals.” Along with a coalition of
      public interest groups, Common Cause was instrumental in passing the Federal Election
      Campaign Act of 1971, which created the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) and
      set limits and rules for political contributions that became the bedrock of modern
      campaign finance law. Republicans and right-wing groups have challenged the law
      in court ever since, allowing conservative judges to chip away at contribution
      limits with Citizens United and related cases over the years. As Republicans deliberated
      over Trump’s bill on June 30, the Supreme Court agreed to consider another GOP
      lawsuit against the FEC. “You can’t begin to understand why one party would pass
      a bill that is unbelievably unpopular for stripping health care from poor people
      unless you understand Citizens United,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of
      the watchdog group Public Citizen, in an interview. The case that the Supreme
      Court agreed to hear calls on the First Amendment in an attempt to dismantle one
      of the last remaining pillars of campaign finance law. With Trump appointees among
      a solid conservative majority, the court will consider whether to strike down
      limits on coordinated campaign spending between candidates and political parties,
      which would blow the cap off the amount of money wealthy donors can funnel toward
      their preferred candidate through partisan “coordination” committees. The effort
      is a longtime priority for Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former GOP Senate majority
      leader who has long argued for more money in politics and filed a brief in support
      of the lawsuit in January. The Justice Department has traditionally defended the
      FEC regardless of which party controls the White House. However, the Trump administration
      refused to intervene in this case, leaving the job of defending limits on coordinated
      campaign spending to the Democratic Party. For the first time, Trump’s 2024 reelection
      campaign outsourced many key functions to super PACs and outside groups funded
      by a handful of wealthy donors, including tech mega-billionaire and DOGE founder
      Elon Musk , who was rewarded with a powerful, if temporary, position inside the
      White House. Musk is now attempting to forge his own political party after falling
      out with Trump. “We refuse to sit on the sidelines as Trump’s DOJ and the Republican
      Party attempt to throw out longstanding election laws for their own benefit,”
      said Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, in a joint statement
      with other party leaders last week. “Republicans know their grassroots support
      is drying up across the country, and they want to drown out the will of the voters.”
      At issue are limits on how closely campaigns and political parties can coordinate
      the spending of donations from wealthy supporters of a particular candidate. Republicans
      argue political parties exist to elect candidates, so limits on campaign spending
      violate their First Amendment rights. However, Weissman said the GOP conflates
      the right to speak freely with the ability of the ultra-rich to drown out competing
      voices during election season. The Supreme Court has agreed with Republicans in
      past cases, including Citizens United , which famously granted corporations free
      speech rights. “The shell of what’s left is dollar restrictions on direct contributions
      to candidates,” Weissman said. “There’s already unlimited spending by rich people
      and corporations on outside entities such as super PACs … but if the outside entities
      are the specific party structure and can coordinate with candidates, then that
      direct contribution restriction is of diminishingly microscopic importance.” In
      other words, a billionaire seeking to influence a political candidate can skirt
      contribution limits by funneling money through the candidate’s political party,
      and without the current rules on the books, the party could coordinate directly
      with the candidate to spend the billionaire’s cash on millions of targeted ads.
      Campaign “coordination” committees already exist and are used extensively by both
      parties — the deadlocked FEC rarely enforces existing law — but a Supreme Court
      ruling against the FEC would further open the campaign cash floodgates and set
      a dangerous precedent, according to Noureldin. “This challenge would allow for
      there to be basically unlimited spending by political parties to get their candidates
      elected, and right now there are limits on their coordinated spending depending
      on the rules for Senate and House races,” Noureldin said. Billionaires are already
      taking advantage of holes in campaign finance law and a weak FEC. Noureldin said
      transparency proponents may be tempted to see an upside to parties spending unlimited
      donations in coordination with campaigns, because at least the names of those
      donors and the dollar amounts they spend must be reported to the public — a contrast
      to the so-called “dark money” that has exploded in politics, allowing the wealthy
      to influence elections anonymously. Currently, donations from an individual donor
      to a federal candidate’s campaign is capped at $3,500 per election under FEC rules,
      but donors can funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars each election cycle through
      “additional accounts” at national party committees used to pay for presidential
      nominating conventions and legal challenges against election results, for example.
      Under these rules, Musk openly spent $277 million to elect Trump and Republicans
      in the last election and went on to dismantle lifesaving USAID programs through
      DOGE , which researchers say could lead to more than 14 million deaths worldwide
      over the next five years. Noureldin noted an FEC guidance for the 2024 election
      that defined “coordination” between campaigns and parties as “public” communication
      such as TV ads. However, fundraising solicitations and canvassing did not fall
      under the “public” category, allowing Musk to spend $100 million on Trump’s door-to-door
      ground game in 2024 while Trump centralized the Republican Party fundraising under
      his control . “What we’re having here is an all-out assault on any regulation
      on big money in politics,” Noureldin said, adding that as of May, the FEC lacks
      a quorum and its ability to do anything at this point is limited. “Congress is
      not looking at these issues anymore, because for one, there is a benefit to having
      this unlimited money in politics, and that is the sort of ‘soft corruption’ we’ve
      been talking about.” Noureldin and Weissman said there are already anti-corruption
      laws on the books against bribing politicians; the point of campaign finance regulation
      is to prevent billionaires like Musk from skirting these laws through third parties
      — including political parties. The Supreme Court has traditionally weighed the
      First Amendment claims made by Republican challengers in defense of billionaires,
      megadonors and, in this case, political parties, against the corrupting influence
      of unlimited campaign cash. Noureldin said conservative Supreme Court justices
      tend to take an “absolutist” view on corruption and have sided with the GOP’s
      free speech claims in Citizens United and other cases, which discourages Congress
      from regulating money in politics. “What the Supreme Court does not do is make
      policy decisions about how much or in what context we should have tighter disclosure
      requirements or do other things to mitigate the harms of political spending,”
      Noureldin said. “Our view is that this requires more nuanced policymaking, and
      that is for Congress to do. But once the Supreme Court makes this a constitutional
      issue, then no Congress in the future can do anything, and that is what the court
      has been doing in these cases going all the way back to Buckley vs. Valeo , ”
      referring to the 1976 landmark decision that struck down limits on expenditures
      by candidates and parties in federal elections. Noureldin said it’s not just the
      soft corruption associated with unlimited campaign donations that advocates are
      worried about, but the perception of corruption among the voting public. After
      Musk and other billionaires spent billions of dollars to elect Trump and the Republicans
      who just voted to slash the social safety net, the latest campaign finance case
      before the Supreme Court could become a flashpoint ahead of the 2026 midterms
      elections. “If the public believes their vote doesn’t matter, and that wealthy
      people are always going to get their way because of the amount of money they paid
      to get a candidate elected, then folks sit out elections,” Noureldin said. A Pew
      survey in 2023 found that 85 percent of Americans said the cost of running a political
      campaign makes it hard for “good people” to run for office, and a solid majority
      (63 percent) said all or most elected officials ran for office out of self-interest
      and a desire to make money. The public also rates members of Congress poorly on
      listening to people in their districts, making compromises with the other party,
      and “taking responsibility for their actions.” That’s why it must be lawmakers
      themselves, not the Supreme Court, who call out the problem and legislate new
      solutions for reducing the corruptive influence of big money in politics, Noureldin
      said. “We do need a new national conversation about money in politics, and that
      needs to be led by our elected legislators, for them to come out and say, ‘Yes,
      the soft corruption and corrosive influence is real. I’m a member of Congress,
      and I am telling you.’” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once vaunted model

    paragraph_summary: In a controversial move, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of
      Alaska voted in favor of a budget package that she publicly criticized as "bad"
      and detrimental to many Americans. Despite acknowledging the bill's unpopularity
      and its potential negative impact on her constituents, Murkowski negotiated specific
      protections for them and urged House Republicans to revise the legislation before
      it reached President Trump's desk. The House passed the bill along party lines,
      with several Republicans who had previously expressed concerns about cuts to essential
      health care and nutrition programs ultimately supporting it. The legislation,
      which aims to fund Trump's immigration policies and tax cuts for the wealthy,
      is expected to cost low-income families approximately $1,600 annually while providing
      significant financial benefits to high earners. Following backlash over the Medicaid
      cuts, which threaten millions of health insurance recipients, some Republicans
      announced their retirement. The bill was signed into law on July 4, raising questions
      about the motivations behind the party's unity in the face of potential electoral
      repercussions.

      Ludwig / Truthout Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska cast a deciding vote
      for the GOP’s unpopular budget package after publicly admitting the bill is “bad”
      and would disadvantage people across the United States. After negotiating carveouts
      to protect some of her own constituents, Murkowski urged House Republicans to
      make revisions before sending the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk. Polls
      show the package is historically unpopular given its size and scope, but even
      Republicans who raised concerns about harming their own constituents fell in line.
      “I know that in many parts of the country, there are Americans who are not going
      to be advantaged by this bill,” Murkowski told reporters after voting for the
      package. “I don’t like that.” However, the House quickly voted along party lines
      to pass the bill, including multiple Republicans who previously expressed concern
      over deep cuts to health care and nutrition programs their constituents rely on.
      The cuts will pay for Trump’s brutal immigration crackdown as well as tax cuts
      to benefit his wealthy donors; all in all, the bill is projected to cost low-income
      families about $1,600 each year while boosting incomes for the highest earners
      by $12,000. At least two Republicans announced early retirement from Congress
      after facing controversy over Medicaid cuts that will push millions off health
      insurance. Trump signed the legislation into law on July 4. With at least one
      safety net hospital in Nebraska already announcing plans to close due to funding
      insecurity, and Democrats chomping at the bit for the midterms, why did so many
      vulnerable Republicans fall in line? Democrats say Republicans are terrified of
      Trump, but according to Omar Noureldin, the senior vice president for policy and
      litigation at Common Cause, the corruptive influence of big money in politics
      is a key reason why a bill like this one could pass. That influence exploded after
      the Supreme Court’s 2010 landmark decision in Citizens United vs. FEC , which
      dissolved decades-old restrictions on corporate political spending and ushered
      in the era of super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money. The
      cost of campaigns skyrocketed , and tens of billions of dollars now pour into
      federal elections during a single season. “A budget is a moral document. The reason
      why a bill like that can pass even though it has destructive effects on communities
      in red states and blue states is because of the corruptive influence of money
      in politics,” Noureldin said in an interview. “We’re at a place where a billionaire’s
      budget passed because money prevailed over morals.” Along with a coalition of
      public interest groups, Common Cause was instrumental in passing the Federal Election
      Campaign Act of 1971, which created the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) and
      set limits and rules for political contributions that became the bedrock of modern
      campaign finance law. Republicans and right-wing groups have challenged the law
      in court ever since, allowing conservative judges to chip away at contribution
      limits with Citizens United and related cases over the years. As Republicans deliberated
      over Trump’s bill on June 30, the Supreme Court agreed to consider another GOP
      lawsuit against the FEC. “You can’t begin to understand why one party would pass
      a bill that is unbelievably unpopular for stripping health care from poor people
      unless you understand Citizens United,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of
      the watchdog group Public Citizen, in an interview. The case that the Supreme
      Court agreed to hear calls on the First Amendment in an attempt to dismantle one
      of the last remaining pillars of campaign finance law. With Trump appointees among
      a solid conservative majority, the court will consider whether to strike down
      limits on coordinated campaign spending between candidates and political parties,
      which would blow the cap off the amount of money wealthy donors can funnel toward
      their preferred candidate through partisan “coordination” committees. The effort
      is a longtime priority for Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former GOP Senate majority
      leader who has long argued for more money in politics and filed a brief in support
      of the lawsuit in January. The Justice Department has traditionally defended the
      FEC regardless of which party controls the White House. However, the Trump administration
      refused to intervene in this case, leaving the job of defending limits on coordinated
      campaign spending to the Democratic Party. For the first time, Trump’s 2024 reelection
      campaign outsourced many key functions to super PACs and outside groups funded
      by a handful of wealthy donors, including tech mega-billionaire and DOGE founder

      Less than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a budget package that
      pushes annual military spending past $1 trillion, researchers on Tuesday published
      a report detailing how much major Pentagon contractors have raked in since 2020.
      Sharing The Guardian ‘s exclusive coverage of the paper on social media, U.K.-based
      climate scientist Bill McGuire wrote : “Are you a U.S. taxpayer? I am sure you
      will be delighted to know where $2.4 TRILLION of your money has gone.” The report
      from the Costs of War Project at Brown University’s Watson School of International
      and Public Affairs and the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft shows that
      from 2020-24 private firms received $2.4 trillion in Department of Defense contracts,
      or roughly 54% of DOD’s $4.4 trillion in discretionary spending for that five-year
      period. The publication highlights that “during those five years, $771 billion
      in Pentagon contracts went to just five firms: Lockheed Martin ($313 billion),
      RTX (formerly Raytheon, $145 billion), Boeing ($115 billion), General Dynamics
      ($116 billion), and Northrop Grumman ($81 billion).” In a statement about the
      findings, Stephanie Savell, director of the Costs of War Project, said that “these
      figures represent a continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to
      fund war and weapons manufacturing.” “This is not an arsenal of democracy—it’s
      an arsenal of profiteering,” Savell added. “We should keep the enormous and growing
      power of the arms industry in mind as we assess the rise of authoritarianism in
      the U.S. and globally.” Between 2020 and 2024, $771 billion in Pentagon contracts
      went to just five firms: Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop
      Grumman. By comparison, the total diplomacy, development, and humanitarian aid
      budget, excluding military aid, was $356 billion. [5/12] [image or embed] — The
      Costs of War Project ( @costsofwar.bsky.social ) July 8, 2025 at 2:43 PM The paper
      points out that “by comparison, the total diplomacy, development, and humanitarian
      aid budget, excluding military aid, was $356 billion. In other words, the U.S.
      government invested over twice as much money in five weapons companies as in diplomacy
      and international assistance.” “Record arms transfers have further boosted the
      bottom lines of weapons firms,” the document details. “These companies have benefited
      from tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel and Ukraine, paid for
      by U.S. taxpayers. U.S. military aid to Israel was over $18 billion in just the
      first year following October 2023; military aid to Ukraine totals $65 billion
      since the Russian invasion in 2022 through 2025.” “Additionally, a surge in foreign-funded
      arms sales to European allies, paid for by the recipient nations—over $170 billion
      in 2023 and 2024 alone—have provided additional revenue to arms contractors over
      and above the funds they receive directly from the Pentagon,” the paper adds.
      The 23-page report stresses that “annual U.S. military spending has grown significantly
      this century,” as presidents from both major parties have waged a so-called Global
      War on Terror and the DOD has continuously failed to pass an audit. Specifically,
      according to the paper, “the Pentagon’s discretionary budget—the annual funding
      approved by Congress and the large majority of its overall budget—rose from $507
      billion in 2000 to $843 billion in 2025 (in constant 2025 dollars), a 66% increase.
      Including military spending outside the Pentagon—primarily nuclear weapons programs
      at the Department of Energy, counterterrorism operations at the Federal Bureau
      of Investigation (FBI), and other military activities officially classified under
      ‘Budget Function 050’— total military spending grew from $531 billion in 2000
      to $899 billion in 2025, a 69% increase.” Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill
      Act passed earlier this month “adds $156 billion to this year’s total, pushing
      the 2025 military budget to $1.06 trillion,” the document notes. “After taking
      into account this supplemental funding, the U.S. military budget has nearly doubled
      this century, increasing 99% since 2000.” Noting that “taxpayers are expected
      to fund a $1 trillion Pentagon budget,” Security Policy Reform Institute co-founder
      Stephen Semler said the paper, which he co-authored, “illustrates what they’ll
      be paying for: a historic redistribution of wealth from the public to private
      industry.” Semler produced the report with William Hartung, senior research fellow
      at the Quincy Institute. Hartung said that “high Pentagon budgets are often justified
      because the funds are ‘for the troops.''” “But as this paper shows, the majority
      of the department’s budget goes to corporations, money that has as much to do
      with special interest lobbying as it does with any rational defense planning,”
      he continued. “Much of this funding has been wasted on dysfunctional or overpriced
      weapons systems and extravagant compensation packages.” The arms industry has
      used an array of tools of influence to create an atmosphere where a Pentagon budget
      that is $1 trillion per year is deemed “not enough” by some members of Congress.

      July 8, 2025 at 2:43 PM In addition to spotlighting how U.S. military budgets
      funnel billions of dollars to contractors each year, the report shines a light
      on the various ways the industry influences politics. “The ongoing influence of
      the arms industry over Congress operates through tens of millions in campaign
      contributions and the employment of 950 lobbyists, as of 2024,” the publication
      explains. “Military contractors also shape military policy and lobby to increase
      military spending by funding think tanks and serving on government commissions.”
      “Senior officials in government often go easy on major weapons companies so as
      not to ruin their chances of getting lucrative positions with them upon leaving
      government service,” the report notes. “For its part, the emerging military tech
      sector has opened a new version of the revolving door—the movement of ex-military
      officers and senior Pentagon officials, not to arms companies per se, but to the
      venture capital firms that invest in Silicon Valley arms industry startups.” The
      paper concludes by arguing that “the U.S. needs stronger congressional and public
      scrutiny of both current and emerging weapons contractors to avoid wasteful spending
      and reckless decision-making on issues of war and peace. Profits should not drive
      policy.” “In particular,” it adds, “the role of Silicon Valley startups and the

      Less than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a budget package that
      pushes annual military spending past $1 trillion, researchers on Tuesday published
      a report detailing how much major Pentagon contractors have raked in since 2020.
      Sharing The Guardian ‘s exclusive coverage of the paper on social media, U.K.-based
      climate scientist Bill McGuire wrote : “Are you a U.S. taxpayer? I am sure you
      will be delighted to know where $2.4 TRILLION of your money has gone.” The report
      from the Costs of War Project at Brown University’s Watson School of International
      and Public Affairs and the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft shows that
      from 2020-24 private firms received $2.4 trillion in Department of Defense contracts,
      or roughly 54% of DOD’s $4.4 trillion in discretionary spending for that five-year
      period. The publication highlights that “during those five years, $771 billion
      in Pentagon contracts went to just five firms: Lockheed Martin ($313 billion),
      RTX (formerly Raytheon, $145 billion), Boeing ($115 billion), General Dynamics
      ($116 billion), and Northrop Grumman ($81 billion).” In a statement about the
      findings, Stephanie Savell, director of the Costs of War Project, said that “these
      figures represent a continuing and massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to
      fund war and weapons manufacturing.” “This is not an arsenal of democracy—it’s
      an arsenal of profiteering,” Savell added. “We should keep the enormous and growing
      power of the arms industry in mind as we assess the rise of authoritarianism in
      the U.S. and globally.” Between 2020 and 2024, $771 billion in Pentagon contracts
      went to just five firms: Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing, General Dynamics, and Northrop
      Grumman. By comparison, the total diplomacy, development, and humanitarian aid
      budget, excluding military aid, was $356 billion. [5/12] [image or embed] — The
      Costs of War Project ( @costsofwar.bsky.social ) July 8, 2025 at 2:43 PM The paper
      points out that “by comparison, the total diplomacy, development, and humanitarian
      aid budget, excluding military aid, was $356 billion. In other words, the U.S.
      government invested over twice as much money in five weapons companies as in diplomacy
      and international assistance.” “Record arms transfers have further boosted the
      bottom lines of weapons firms,” the document details. “These companies have benefited
      from tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel and Ukraine, paid for
      by U.S. taxpayers. U.S. military aid to Israel was over $18 billion in just the
      first year following October 2023; military aid to Ukraine totals $65 billion
      since the Russian invasion in 2022 through 2025.” “Additionally, a surge in foreign-funded
      arms sales to European allies, paid for by the recipient nations—over $170 billion
      in 2023 and 2024 alone—have provided additional revenue to arms contractors over
      and above the funds they receive directly from the Pentagon,” the paper adds.

      donation . By Les Leopold / Substack Many moons ago, the late Sam Myers, UAW 259
      president, asked me to run a workshop for auto mechanics in the New York area.
      Sam, an old-time socialist who somehow survived the McCarthy era labor purges,
      was eager to expose his workers to our new political economy courses. At the end
      of the first workshop, I slipped in one final question on politics: “Should labor
      support the Democrats, the Republicans, or a new party of working people?” Nearly
      everyone’s hand shot up for the prospect of a new labor party. Sam shot up too
      and said, “You can’t do that! We need to support the Democrats, no matter what.”
      And that was the end of the conversation. For many labor leaders today not much
      has changed. They are still all in for the Democrats, even though more of their
      rank-and-file members are not. Many have drifted to the Republicans. Others have
      stopped voting. And nearly all feel that the Democrats have let them down. No
      amount of cajoling will bring these disappointed workers back to the Dems. Yet
      many union leaders continue the ritual, pushing union voters toward the Democrats
      while praying that nearly half their members who vote the other way won’t rebel.
      It isn’t working. It’s time to build a political home for these disaffected working
      people, not only those who have given up on the Democrats, but also those who
      have been attracted to the Republicans’ rhetorical turn to populism. That’s certainly
      what workers say they want, according to the recent YouGov survey we conducted
      of 3,000 voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. (See here and
      here .) Our survey shows that 57 percent of the Rust Belt voters support the following
      statement. Note especially the first two policy proposals: Would you support a
      new organization, the Independent Workers Political Association, that would support
      working-class issues independent of both the Democratic and Republican parties.
      It would run and support independent political candidates committed to a platform
      that included Stop big companies that receive tax dollars from laying off workers
      who pay taxes. Guarantee everyone who wants to work has a decent-paying job, and
      if the private sector can’t provide it, the government will Raise the minimum
      wage so every family can lead a decent life Stop drug company price-gouging and
      put price controls on food cartels Every demographic group supported these proposals,
      led by 71 percent of Rust Belt voters under 30 years of age, and 74 percent of
      those who feel very insecure about losing their job. Again, please look at those
      first two policy planks. No national Democrat in memory, except for the independent
      Bernie, has said anything like that in their campaigns. And yet 57 percent of
      the voters in these Rust Belt states said they supported these radical policies,
      with only 19 percent opposed. Most labor leaders and Democratic party strategists,
      however, don’t want to hear it, no matter what our polling shows and no matter
      what their own constituents say they really want. While some unions are willing
      to flirt with fusion efforts, like the Working Families Party, they know that
      in the end fusion parties will support the Democrats. It’s understandable that
      labor leaders are gun shy about building a new political formation. They just
      don’t have the bandwidth while trying to keep their unions afloat, given incessant
      assaults by corporate forces and anti-labor politicians. They are backed into
      a corner. What they’re missing is the potential power that would flow from a new
      entity of disgruntled working people, totally independent of the two parties.
      A new independent party could help unions organize new members while also building
      stronger connections with and among their membership. Instead of dividing their
      members by pushing the tarnished Democratic brand, a new worker political formation
      could build solidarity around the issues that affect workers most. How a new party
      of working people helps progressive Democrats Imagine that a new Independent workers
      political association (maybe call it Workers USA?) formed to run more labor candidates
      in one-party races – that is in any of the 132 congressional districts and 20
      senatorial races in which the Republicans won by 25 or more percent. Doing so
      would not split the Democratic vote because that vote evaporated long ago. Dan
      Osborn, a former local union president in Nebraska, is a good example of a working-class
      candidate who nearly took down three-term Senator Deb Fischer by running on a
      strong anti-corporate populist program as an independent in 2024. The Democrats
      didn’t even bother to field a candidate. So, Osborn filled the breach, forced
      Fischer and her party to spend millions of dollars they didn’t plan on, and came
      within seven percent of Fischer in Nebraska, a state Kamala Harris lost by 20
      percent to Trump. Osborn ran unabashedly on an anti-corporate populist program
      and proved it could gain traction in a deep red state. He believes he is opening
      the working-class door to more such races: “(Our effort is) going to tell people
      all around the country that you don’t have to be a self-funding crypto billionaire
      to run for office. So, nurses, teachers, plumbers, carpenters, mechanics, they
      can all now know that they can do the same thing.” If more and more working-class
      candidates entered these one-party races and showed promise running on a strong
      populist economic platform, their successes would support those within the Democratic
      Party who want to move the party more in a progressive populist direction, and
      away from the corporatist path it has traveling since the days of Bill Clinton.
      If these ideas gain traction in traditionally red districts, offered by independent
      working-class campaigns, the Democratic Party might have no choice but to bend
      in this direction. Osborn-like political competition would breathe some new life
      into the currently gasping Democrats. And by running in one-party districts, there
      is no obvious “spoiler” downside for the Democrats who have long ago abandoned
      those races. They should be cheering on more and more independent working-class
      candidates like Osborn. What does the Labor movement gain through a new political
      formation? For more than a generation, organizing new members has been and continues
      to be an existential problem for all labor unions. Labor law is so stacked against
      union organizing that it takes nearly miraculous efforts just to maintain the
      current paltry union density of six percent in the private sector and barely 10
      percent overall. Organizing shop by shop is a Sisyphean task. Winning an election
      is extremely difficult against corporations and their high-powered and expensive
      anti-union consultants who are more than willing to break the law by firing organizers,
      threatening layoffs, and building campaigns based on lies about the union. And
      even if the union wins, it’s even harder still to secure a first contract. For
      more than 50 years, labor has struggled to level the playing field through national
      labor law reforms enacted by the Democratic Party. That strategy has utterly failed.
      Some argue that the real problem is that unions are not putting enough resources
      into organizing. They should be raiding their war chests and mortgaging their
      union hall properties to create a ten-fold increase in organizing funds. Then,
      they say, we would see a rebirth of the labor movement. I disagree. Even a ten-fold
      increase in organizing funds is likely, at best, to have marginally better results.
      Labor law is just too stacked against organizing. And those laws will only change
      when national politics changes. The first step to remold the political terrain
      is to invest a small amount of money in building a new Independent workers political
      formation that allows unions to mobilize working-class people outside of collective
      bargaining . There are no laws that interfere with people joining a new political
      organization that fights for working-class candidates and promotes ballot initiatives
      and new policies to enhance the well-being of working people. That field is wide
      open, and I believe that workers and those friendly to working-class issues, if
      given the chance, will come running. Imagine millions of workers, some in unions,
      many not, banding together to advocate and vote for candidates and issues of importance
      to them and their families. Working together on political initiatives would also
      turn up new contacts for workplace organizing and increase pressure on the companies
      they negotiate with. A popular workers’ movement certainly could spark more interest
      in labor unions, especially if unions took the lead on building this new political
      organization. What could a party of working people do? Not only could working-class
      candidates be fielded in one-party districts, but the new formation could run
      ballot initiatives that give working people an opportunity to set policy. For
      example, our polling shows that there is very strong support for a ballot initiative
      that would prohibit large corporations that receive taxpayer money from conducting
      compulsory layoffs. Instead, all layoffs in those contracting corporations would
      be voluntary based on buyouts like those corporate executives usually receive.
      No one would be forced out of their job. Our Rust Belt research suggests that
      such an initiative would be well-received and could mobilize millions of voters.
      It is even more popular than raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Why not
      give it a try in Michigan, for example, which permits ballot initiatives? Musk
      picks up the scent Thirty years ago, the late Tony Mazzocchi, a radical leader
      of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, said that if labor doesn’t build
      a new political formation, some right-wing racist charlatan will fill the breach.
      Oh, was he right. Now, we see another charlatan sense that people are sick and
      tired of a failed two-party system that delivers for the super-rich and their
      political hacks, and no one else. Elon Musk has such a large following and war
      chest that he could convincingly claim that his third party is the answer to the
      woes of workers, even though it would really give us a third party dominated by
      billionaires. Musk’s grandstanding proves the point I’ve been trying to make for
      the last several years: Building something new is in the air. Or as my astute
      colleague put it, “any argument for a progressive third party, including how to
      build it, has to acknowledge the ugly creatures already crawling into the void.”
      To fill that void, voters in key Rust Belt swing states want a new political formation,
      and they want one that fights for radical economic populism, not billionaire rip-offs.

    paragraph_summary: In a reflective piece, Les Leopold discusses the disconnect between
      labor leaders and their rank-and-file members regarding political support, particularly
      for the Democratic Party. He recounts a past experience with UAW 259 president
      Sam Myers, who insisted on unwavering support for Democrats despite a growing
      sentiment among workers for a new labor party or even support for Republicans.
      Leopold highlights a recent YouGov survey indicating that many workers feel abandoned
      by the Democrats and are seeking a political home that better represents their
      interests. He argues that it is crucial to acknowledge and address the desires
      of disaffected workers rather than continuing the traditional push towards Democratic
      support, which is increasingly ineffective.

      donation . By Les Leopold / Substack Many moons ago, the late Sam Myers, UAW 259
      president, asked me to run a workshop for auto mechanics in the New York area.
      Sam, an old-time socialist who somehow survived the McCarthy era labor purges,
      was eager to expose his workers to our new political economy courses. At the end
      of the first workshop, I slipped in one final question on politics: “Should labor
      support the Democrats, the Republicans, or a new party of working people?” Nearly
      everyone’s hand shot up for the prospect of a new labor party. Sam shot up too
      and said, “You can’t do that! We need to support the Democrats, no matter what.”
      And that was the end of the conversation. For many labor leaders today not much
      has changed. They are still all in for the Democrats, even though more of their
      rank-and-file members are not. Many have drifted to the Republicans. Others have
      stopped voting. And nearly all feel that the Democrats have let them down. No
      amount of cajoling will bring these disappointed workers back to the Dems. Yet
      many union leaders continue the ritual, pushing union voters toward the Democrats
      while praying that nearly half their members who vote the other way won’t rebel.
      It isn’t working. It’s time to build a political home for these disaffected working
      people, not only those who have given up on the Democrats, but also those who
      have been attracted to the Republicans’ rhetorical turn to populism. That’s certainly
      what workers say they want, according to the recent YouGov survey we conducted
      of 3,000 voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. (See here and
      here .) Our survey shows that 57 percent of the Rust Belt voters support the following
      statement. Note especially the first two policy proposals: Would you support a
      new organization, the Independent Workers Political Association, that would support
      working-class issues independent of both the Democratic and Republican parties.
      It would run and support independent political candidates committed to a platform
      that included Stop big companies that receive tax dollars from laying off workers
      who pay taxes. Guarantee everyone who wants to work has a decent-paying job, and
      if the private sector can’t provide it, the government will Raise the minimum
      wage so every family can lead a decent life Stop drug company price-gouging and
      put price controls on food cartels Every demographic group supported these proposals,
      led by 71 percent of Rust Belt voters under 30 years of age, and 74 percent of
      those who feel very insecure about losing their job. Again, please look at those
      first two policy planks. No national Democrat in memory, except for the independent
      Bernie, has said anything like that in their campaigns. And yet 57 percent of
      the voters in these Rust Belt states said they supported these radical policies,
      with only 19 percent opposed. Most labor leaders and Democratic party strategists,
      however, don’t want to hear it, no matter what our polling shows and no matter
      what their own constituents say they really want. While some unions are willing
      to flirt with fusion efforts, like the Working Families Party, they know that
      in the end fusion parties will support the Democrats. It’s understandable that
      labor leaders are gun shy about building a new political formation. They just
      don’t have the bandwidth while trying to keep their unions afloat, given incessant
      assaults by corporate forces and anti-labor politicians. They are backed into
      a corner. What they’re missing is the potential power that would flow from a new
      entity of disgruntled working people, totally independent of the two parties.
      A new independent party could help unions organize new members while also building
      stronger connections with and among their membership. Instead of dividing their
      members by pushing the tarnished Democratic brand, a new worker political formation
      could build solidarity around the issues that affect workers most. How a new party
      of working people helps progressive Democrats Imagine that a new Independent workers
      political association (maybe call it Workers USA?) formed to run more labor candidates
      in one-party races – that is in any of the 132 congressional districts and 20
      senatorial races in which the Republicans won by 25 or more percent. Doing so
      would not split the Democratic vote because that vote evaporated long ago. Dan
      Osborn, a former local union president in Nebraska, is a good example of a working-class
      candidate who nearly took down three-term Senator Deb Fischer by running on a
      strong anti-corporate populist program as an independent in 2024. The Democrats
      didn’t even bother to field a candidate. So, Osborn filled the breach, forced
      Fischer and her party to spend millions of dollars they didn’t plan on, and came
      within seven percent of Fischer in Nebraska, a state Kamala Harris lost by 20
      percent to Trump. Osborn ran unabashedly on an anti-corporate populist program
      and proved it could gain traction in a deep red state. He believes he is opening
      the working-class door to more such races: “(Our effort is) going to tell people
      all around the country that you don’t have to be a self-funding crypto billionaire
      to run for office. So, nurses, teachers, plumbers, carpenters, mechanics, they
      can all now know that they can do the same thing.” If more and more working-class
      candidates entered these one-party races and showed promise running on a strong
      populist economic platform, their successes would support those within the Democratic
      Party who want to move the party more in a progressive populist direction, and
      away from the corporatist path it has traveling since the days of Bill Clinton.
      If these ideas gain traction in traditionally red districts, offered by independent
      working-class campaigns, the Democratic Party might have no choice but to bend
      in this direction. Osborn-like political competition would breathe some new life
      into the currently gasping Democrats. And by running in one-party districts, there
      is no obvious “spoiler” downside for the Democrats who have long ago abandoned
      those races. They should be cheering on more and more independent working-class
      candidates like Osborn. What does the Labor movement gain through a new political
      formation? For more than a generation, organizing new members has been and continues
      to be an existential problem for all labor unions. Labor law is so stacked against
      union organizing that it takes nearly miraculous efforts just to maintain the
      current paltry union density of six percent in the private sector and barely 10
      percent overall. Organizing shop by shop is a Sisyphean task. Winning an election
      is extremely difficult against corporations and their high-powered and expensive
      anti-union consultants who are more than willing to break the law by firing organizers,
      threatening layoffs, and building campaigns based on lies about the union. And
      even if the union wins, it’s even harder still to secure a first contract. For
      more than 50 years, labor has struggled to level the playing field through national
      labor law reforms enacted by the Democratic Party. That strategy has utterly failed.
      Some argue that the real problem is that unions are not putting enough resources
      into organizing. They should be raiding their war chests and mortgaging their
      union hall properties to create a ten-fold increase in organizing funds. Then,
      they say, we would see a rebirth of the labor movement. I disagree. Even a ten-fold
      increase in organizing funds is likely, at best, to have marginally better results.
      Labor law is just too stacked against organizing. And those laws will only change
      when national politics changes. The first step to remold the political terrain
      is to invest a small amount of money in building a new Independent workers political
      formation that allows unions to mobilize working-class people outside of collective
      bargaining . There are no laws that interfere with people joining a new political
      organization that fights for working-class candidates and promotes ballot initiatives
      and new policies to enhance the well-being of working people. That field is wide
      open, and I believe that workers and those friendly to working-class issues, if
      given the chance, will come running. Imagine millions of workers, some in unions,
      many not, banding together to advocate and vote for candidates and issues of importance
      to them and their families. Working together on political initiatives would also
      turn up new contacts for workplace organizing and increase pressure on the companies
      they negotiate with. A popular workers’ movement certainly could spark more interest
      in labor unions, especially if unions took the lead on building this new political
      organization. What could a party of working people do? Not only could working-class
      candidates be fielded in one-party districts, but the new formation could run
      ballot initiatives that give working people an opportunity to set policy. For
      example, our polling shows that there is very strong support for a ballot initiative
      that would prohibit large corporations that receive taxpayer money from conducting
      compulsory layoffs. Instead, all layoffs in those contracting corporations would
      be voluntary based on buyouts like those corporate executives usually receive.
      No one would be forced out of their job. Our Rust Belt research suggests that
      such an initiative would be well-received and could mobilize millions of voters.
      It is even more popular than raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Why not
      give it a try in Michigan, for example, which permits ballot initiatives? Musk
      picks up the scent Thirty years ago, the late Tony Mazzocchi, a radical leader
      of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, said that if labor doesn’t build
      a new political formation, some right-wing racist charlatan will fill the breach.
      Oh, was he right. Now, we see another charlatan sense that people are sick and
      tired of a failed two-party system that delivers for the super-rich and their
      political hacks, and no one else. Elon Musk has such a large following and war
      chest that he could convincingly claim that his third party is the answer to the
      woes of workers, even though it would really give us a third party dominated by
      billionaires. Musk’s grandstanding proves the point I’ve been trying to make for
      the last several years: Building something new is in the air. Or as my astute
      colleague put it, “any argument for a progressive third party, including how to
      build it, has to acknowledge the ugly creatures already crawling into the void.”
      To fill that void, voters in key Rust Belt swing states want a new political formation,
      and they want one that fights for radical economic populism, not billionaire rip-offs.

      from the BRICS countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from July 6-7 for
      their 17th summit. At the summit, BRICS countries denounced the attempts by the
      United States to undermine global trade by waging a tariff war. They called for
      strengthening multilateral forums and international laws to create a more equitable
      global order, in a joint declaration adopted during the summit. The joint declaration
      titled “Strengthening Global South Cooperation for Inclusive and Sustainable Governance”
      was adopted on Sunday, July 6, calling for increased cooperation among BRICS members
      in areas such as politics and security, economy and finance, and culture and people
      to people contacts. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva led the proceedings
      of the two day summit, which began on Sunday. The summit was attended by Chinese
      Premier Li Qiang, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President
      Cyril Ramaphosa, and several heads of other member states and their representatives.
      Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the summit through a video conference.
      This is the first summit attended by Indonesia, which became the 11th full member
      of BRICS in January this year. During his inaugural speech, Lula called BRICS
      a successor of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). He claimed that since there are
      growing attacks on multilateralism and international laws and the world is witnessing
      “unprecedented” conflict since World War II, it is necessary for “BRICS to contribute”
      to bring peace and development in the world through strengthening multilateral
      forums. Lula reiterated BRICS’ resolve to work for comprehensive reforms in the
      existing multilateral forums such as the UN, including its Security Council, the
      International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and others to “increase their
      legitimacy, representativeness, effectiveness and democratic character.” Several
      other leaders, including Chinese premier Li Qiang talked about BRICS playing a
      more concrete role in international politics at a time when “unilateralism and
      protectionism” are on the rise and the principles of UN and other multilateral
      forums such as WTO are under attack. The joint declaration mentions 126 commitments
      made by the leaders of BRICS, including their resolve to enhance mutual trade,
      cooperation in science and technology, climate cooperation and so on. Multipolarity
      and representation In the joint declaration, BRICS nations agreed to enhance their
      strategic partnership for “promoting peace, a fairer and more representative international
      order, a revitalized and reformed multilateral system, sustainable development
      and inclusive growth.” BRICS believes that “multipolarity can create opportunities
      for developing countries and emerging markets” and reiterated the need for comprehensive
      reforms in the UN, including in the Security Council as stated by its Johannesburg
      summit declaration in 2023. Affirming that the Global South is “a driver of positive
      change” in the world, the BRICS countries voiced “serious concerns about the rise
      of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent
      with WTO rules.” They reiterated their collective opposition to “unilateral coercive
      measures” or sanctions, calling them contrary to international law. These unilateral
      measures violate the basic human rights of the people in the targeted countries
      and deny them the opportunity to develop and particularly affect the most vulnerable
      and poor sections of the population, BRICS members noted. The joint declaration
      announced that BRICS members “do not impose or support non-UN Security Council
      authorized sanctions.” BRICS also agreed to work on an increased quota at the
      IMF and the World Bank for emerging and developing countries. Demanding that these
      quotas should reflect the “relative positions of countries in the global economy”
      and must not favor the developed west as it does now. The Rio declaration also
      called for cooperation in “global AI governance” claiming any such move “must
      mitigate potential risks and meet the needs of all countries, including those
      in the Global South.” Making it one of the top priorities of the Brazilian presidency,
      the BRICS declaration called for global health governance by enhancing international
      cooperation and solidarity for the elimination of socially-determined diseases.
      It identifies hunger and poverty as the root of these diseases and vows for enhanced
      cooperation for their elimination. Global conflicts and wars BRICS nations unanimously
      condemned the Israeli and US military strikes inside Iran last month, calling
      them “a violation of international law and charter of the United Nations.” They
      pointed out that the attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities were in violation of
      the relevant resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
      demanded that “nuclear safeguards, safety, and security must always be upheld,
      including in armed conflicts, to protect people and the environment from harm.”
      Speaking during the summit, Iran’s Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, demanded
      that the attacks which targeted his country’s civilian infrastructure, innocent
      citizens, and protected nuclear facilities must be condemned by the global community
      as their effects are not limited to Iran and will be felt by “the whole region
      and beyond.” BRICS nations also condemned Israel’s continued war and aggression
      against Palestinians in Gaza. “We condemn all violations of international humanitarian
      law (IHL), including the use of starvation as a method of warfare,” the joint
      declaration said, also condemning Israel’s attempts to “politicize or militarize
      humanitarian assistance”. The BRICS joint declaration also demanded that Israel
      must stop its repeated violations of the ceasefire agreements with Lebanon and
      withdraw all its “occupying forces from all of the Lebanese territories”. It also
      expressed support for peace efforts in Syria, Sudan, and other parts of the world,
      emphasizing the need for local and domestic initiatives. President Lula, during
      his inaugural speech, mentioned how NATO’s recent decision to increase the defense
      expenditure to 5% of their GDP demonstrates the misplaced priorities of the global
      north. He noted that they have money for war but no money for climate action or
      helping poorer countries achieve their sustainable development goals. “It is easier
      [for NATO members] to designate 5% of the GDP to military spending than to allocate
      the 0.7% that has been promised for Official Development Assistance [for poorer

      from the BRICS countries gathered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from July 6-7 for
      their 17th summit. At the summit, BRICS countries denounced the attempts by the
      United States to undermine global trade by waging a tariff war. They called for
      strengthening multilateral forums and international laws to create a more equitable
      global order, in a joint declaration adopted during the summit. The joint declaration
      titled “Strengthening Global South Cooperation for Inclusive and Sustainable Governance”
      was adopted on Sunday, July 6, calling for increased cooperation among BRICS members
      in areas such as politics and security, economy and finance, and culture and people
      to people contacts. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva led the proceedings
      of the two day summit, which began on Sunday. The summit was attended by Chinese
      Premier Li Qiang, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, South African President
      Cyril Ramaphosa, and several heads of other member states and their representatives.
      Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the summit through a video conference.
      This is the first summit attended by Indonesia, which became the 11th full member
      of BRICS in January this year. During his inaugural speech, Lula called BRICS
      a successor of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). He claimed that since there are
      growing attacks on multilateralism and international laws and the world is witnessing
      “unprecedented” conflict since World War II, it is necessary for “BRICS to contribute”
      to bring peace and development in the world through strengthening multilateral
      forums. Lula reiterated BRICS’ resolve to work for comprehensive reforms in the
      existing multilateral forums such as the UN, including its Security Council, the
      International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and others to “increase their
      legitimacy, representativeness, effectiveness and democratic character.” Several
      other leaders, including Chinese premier Li Qiang talked about BRICS playing a
      more concrete role in international politics at a time when “unilateralism and
      protectionism” are on the rise and the principles of UN and other multilateral
      forums such as WTO are under attack. The joint declaration mentions 126 commitments
      made by the leaders of BRICS, including their resolve to enhance mutual trade,
      cooperation in science and technology, climate cooperation and so on. Multipolarity
      and representation In the joint declaration, BRICS nations agreed to enhance their
      strategic partnership for “promoting peace, a fairer and more representative international
      order, a revitalized and reformed multilateral system, sustainable development
      and inclusive growth.” BRICS believes that “multipolarity can create opportunities
      for developing countries and emerging markets” and reiterated the need for comprehensive
      reforms in the UN, including in the Security Council as stated by its Johannesburg
      summit declaration in 2023. Affirming that the Global South is “a driver of positive
      change” in the world, the BRICS countries voiced “serious concerns about the rise

      P residents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have spoken by telephone numerous
      times since the former reassumed office seven months ago. Not much appears to
      have been  accomplished by way of these exchanges, some of which have been lengthy,
      according to the accounts Washington and Moscow have provided afterward. No progress
      toward a durable settlement to end the war in Ukraine. Talk and desultory diplomatic
      contacts with a view to repairing the profligate damage successive American administrations
      have done to U.S.–Russian relations, but no substantive advances. O.K., it is
      what it is, as we say. But there was something singularly conclusive about the telephone
      conversation the U.S. and Russian leaders had last Thursday. I detect that a dead
      end has been reached. Trump was trying once again to get Putin to agree to an
      “immediate and unconditional ceasefire” in Ukraine — “the quick end to the military
      action,” as Yuri Ushakov, the Kremlin’s senior foreign policy adviser, put it.
      Putin was trying once again to explain that the time has come to structure an
      enduring settlement by addressing — the Kremlin’s favored phrase these days —
      the “root causes” of the conflict. Maybe it is the barrage of drones and missiles
      with which the Russians bombarded Kiev and other Ukrainian cities within a few
      hours of the Trump–Putin exchange that prompts me to think the two leaders or
      their diplomats are unlikely ever to get anywhere on the telephone or at the mahogany
      table. The Ukrainians, for what their word is worth, counted 539 drones and 11
      missiles, including a hard-to-intercept, high-velocity (Mach 10 hypersonic) projectile
      called the Kinzhal. This was the largest aerial attack so far in the war, by the
      Ukrainians’ reckoning, and it left Kiev smoldering last Friday morning. It is
      hard to avoid concluding the Kremlin had a point to make after the failure of
      the phone call. Trump Has Nothing to Propose Or maybe it is Trump’s remarks after
      the call that makes me think a diplomatic settlement seems simply beyond reach
      — this at least until the Ukrainian military is decisively smashed, and very possibly
      not even then. “I was very unhappy with my call with President Putin,” Trump told
      reporters aboard Air Force One afterward. “I didn’t make any progress with him
      at all. He wants to go all the way, just keep killing people, it’s no good.” You
      cannot be surprised at this current state of affairs. Trump made no progress with
      the Russian leader because he has nothing to propose that would make progress
      possible. Social media messages demanding a ceasefire, replete with capital letters
      and exclamation points, do not count and do not work as statecraft; they betoken
      nothing so much as Trump’s — read, the West’s — un-seriousness. The fundamental
      problem here is that Kiev and its sponsors are unable to accept defeat. I concluded
      more than a year ago that Ukraine and its Western powers had lost the war — “effectively
      lost,” I thought for a time, but then I dropped “effectively.” For a good long time
      now what we’ve watched is nothing more than postwar gore. If you have lost a war
      but cannot admit you have lost because the West must never lose anything, you
      are down to the old game of pretend. And so long as the U.S. and its European
      clients insist that they deserve any consequential say in the terms of negotiation —
      as if they can assert the authority of a victor — it amounts to the pointlessness
      of pretending. It is as if the Germans, if you do not mind the comparison, insisted
      they set the terms of surrender in May 1945, or had a say in the settlement concluded
      at Versailles in 1919. When a settlement is finally reached it will not be termed
      a surrender — you can count on this — but this is what it will come to. And Russia,
      to turn this question another way, will have a responsibility to avoid turning
      a finally achieved peace into another Versailles disaster — where the victors
      planted the seeds for a renewal of conflict — by asking too much. I am confident
      Moscow will hold to its currently expressed demands, which I consider eminently
      just and not at all excessive: A new security architecture in Europe; no NATO membership
      for a neutral Ukraine that must be demilitarized and de-Nazified; and recognition
      of the four oblasts that voted to join Russia. Ressentiment But I am not confident
      Ukraine and the neo–Nazis who control the military and the civilian administration
      — yes, both — will ever accept any kind of coexistence with the Russian Federation.
      The hatred is too visceral, too irrational, too atavistic, too pathological. This
      is why de–Nazification was and remains a Russian objective. The neo–Nazi beast,
      never far below the surface in post–1945 Ukraine, was sprung into the open air
      with the U.S.–cultivated coup in 2014. Washington and its clients in Kiev needed the
      neo–Nazis, especially but not only the armed militias, because they could be relied upon
      to fight the Russians with the sort of visceral animus the occasion required.
      I do not know what a de–Nazification operation would look like, given the phenomenon’s above-noted
      characteristics, but something will have to be done to rid the Ukrainian consciousness
      of this deformity. What we will see in Ukraine otherwise will prove an horrific
      case of ressentiment — enduring and poisonous. Ressentiment is a term the Germans, Friedrich Nietzsche
      among them, borrowed from the French in the 19th century because they had no term
      for the phenomenon. It denotes the hostility and anger within a group arising
      from a shared sense of inferiority in the face of another — this other becoming
      a kind of scapegoat for a society’s frustrations and complexes. Max Scheler, the
      19th and early 20th century phenomenologist, explored all this in Ressentiment
      , a brief but pithy book he published in 1912 (in English, Marquette Univ. Press,
      1994). As Scheler explained in interesting detail, a socially accepted set of
      values arises from this complex of feelings. Ressentiment is a potentially dangerous
      sentiment when it animates a society that feels itself wounded over a sustained
      period of time. We need look no further than the extreme Russophobia evident today
      among some segments of the Ukrainian population for a case in point. Against this
      historical and social backdrop, I do not see the Ukrainians as capable of reaching
      a settlement to end the war that has already torn apart the nation and its people.
      I do not see that they can achieve peace, either with others or among themselves,
      because they do not know peace and they are not capable of it. A Rockface of History
      But I see another reason peace in Ukraine will prove elusive, if not impossible,
      even as the Russians achieve it on the battlefield. (And I tend toward the latter
      probability.) This judgment arises when we put the Ukraine crisis in a larger,
      global context. I think of Ukraine as resembling the rock face in a mine, or a
      front line in a global conflict: It is where the non–West is most urgently chiseling
      a new world order into being. It is a site of insistence, let us say. And it is
      where the West proposes to stop this world-historical turn of history’s wheel
      — a turn that simply cannot be stopped. Think of Putin’s demands. Apart from de–Nazification
      — an objective that, to me, reflects considerable insight on Moscow’s part — there
      are the more encompassing “root causes.” I gather Putin used this phrase yet again
      in his call with Trump. [See: Rootin g Out the Root Causes in Ukraine ] Putin,
      Sergei Lavrov, his foreign minister, and other senior Russian officials have been clear
      on this point at least since Moscow sent those two draft treaties Westward in December
      2021 as the proposed basis of negotiations that would lead to an encompassing new
      security structure between Russia and the West. This framework would relieve the
      decades of tension along Russia’s western flank and Europe’s east and would be
      of benefit to both sides. This was and remains Moscow’s intent. Settlements that
      address the concerns of all sides, as against one side’s at the expense of another,
      is the very essence of sound statecraft. But any such settlement would stand as
      an expression of parity between West and non–West. As I have argued severally
      over the years, parity between these two spheres is a 21st century imperative.
      There will be no world order without it — only more of the disorder the Western
      powers call, altogether absurdly, “the rules-based order.” But it is precisely
      even the thought of parity that the United States and its trans–Atlantic allies
      refuse to accept. It would bring to an end the half-millennium of dominance the
      West cannot release from its grasp even as it will eventually have to do so. “It
      is no good,” Trump said after his latest telephone talk with Putin. No, and I
      do not see how it can be. Trump has nothing to offer the Russians that would amount
      to a serious address of what is genuinely at issue between America and Russia
      — between the West and non–West. I leave it to readers to conclude where this
      leaves the Ukraine conflict and the larger question of Russo–American relations. It
      is, once again, what it is — or what it is at the moment. In another column I
      will revisit this question of parity as it applies in West Asia. Editor’s Note

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Patrick Lawrence discusses the ongoing telephone
      conversations between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin
      since Trump took office again, noting that these discussions have yielded little
      progress towards resolving the Ukraine conflict or improving U.S.-Russian relations.
      Despite attempts by Trump to persuade Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire,
      the Kremlin has emphasized the need to address the "root causes" of the war. The
      situation appears stagnant, especially in light of recent Russian military actions
      against Ukraine, suggesting that meaningful diplomatic progress is unlikely. Lawrence
      concludes that the exchanges between the two leaders may have reached a dead end,
      highlighting the challenges in achieving a resolution.

      “immediate and unconditional ceasefire” in Ukraine — “the quick end to the military
      action,” as Yuri Ushakov, the Kremlin’s senior foreign policy adviser, put it.
      Putin was trying once again to explain that the time has come to structure an
      enduring settlement by addressing — the Kremlin’s favored phrase these days —
      the “root causes” of the conflict. Maybe it is the barrage of drones and missiles
      with which the Russians bombarded Kiev and other Ukrainian cities within a few
      hours of the Trump–Putin exchange that prompts me to think the two leaders or
      their diplomats are unlikely ever to get anywhere on the telephone or at the mahogany
      table. The Ukrainians, for what their word is worth, counted 539 drones and 11
      missiles, including a hard-to-intercept, high-velocity (Mach 10 hypersonic) projectile
      called the Kinzhal. This was the largest aerial attack so far in the war, by the
      Ukrainians’ reckoning, and it left Kiev smoldering last Friday morning. It is
      hard to avoid concluding the Kremlin had a point to make after the failure of
      the phone call. Trump Has Nothing to Propose Or maybe it is Trump’s remarks after
      the call that makes me think a diplomatic settlement seems simply beyond reach
      — this at least until the Ukrainian military is decisively smashed, and very possibly
      not even then. “I was very unhappy with my call with President Putin,” Trump told
      reporters aboard Air Force One afterward. “I didn’t make any progress with him
      at all. He wants to go all the way, just keep killing people, it’s no good.” You
      cannot be surprised at this current state of affairs. Trump made no progress with
      the Russian leader because he has nothing to propose that would make progress
      possible. Social media messages demanding a ceasefire, replete with capital letters
      and exclamation points, do not count and do not work as statecraft; they betoken
      nothing so much as Trump’s — read, the West’s — un-seriousness. The fundamental
      problem here is that Kiev and its sponsors are unable to accept defeat. I concluded
      more than a year ago that Ukraine and its Western powers had lost the war — “effectively
      lost,” I thought for a time, but then I dropped “effectively.” For a good long time
      now what we’ve watched is nothing more than postwar gore. If you have lost a war
      but cannot admit you have lost because the West must never lose anything, you
      are down to the old game of pretend. And so long as the U.S. and its European
      clients insist that they deserve any consequential say in the terms of negotiation —
      as if they can assert the authority of a victor — it amounts to the pointlessness
      of pretending. It is as if the Germans, if you do not mind the comparison, insisted
      they set the terms of surrender in May 1945, or had a say in the settlement concluded
      at Versailles in 1919. When a settlement is finally reached it will not be termed
      a surrender — you can count on this — but this is what it will come to. And Russia,
      to turn this question another way, will have a responsibility to avoid turning
      a finally achieved peace into another Versailles disaster — where the victors
      planted the seeds for a renewal of conflict — by asking too much. I am confident
      Moscow will hold to its currently expressed demands, which I consider eminently
      just and not at all excessive: A new security architecture in Europe; no NATO membership
      for a neutral Ukraine that must be demilitarized and de-Nazified; and recognition
      of the four oblasts that voted to join Russia. Ressentiment But I am not confident
      Ukraine and the neo–Nazis who control the military and the civilian administration
      — yes, both — will ever accept any kind of coexistence with the Russian Federation.
      The hatred is too visceral, too irrational, too atavistic, too pathological. This
      is why de–Nazification was and remains a Russian objective. The neo–Nazi beast,
      never far below the surface in post–1945 Ukraine, was sprung into the open air
      with the U.S.–cultivated coup in 2014. Washington and its clients in Kiev needed the
      neo–Nazis, especially but not only the armed militias, because they could be relied upon
      to fight the Russians with the sort of visceral animus the occasion required.
      I do not know what a de–Nazification operation would look like, given the phenomenon’s above-noted
      characteristics, but something will have to be done to rid the Ukrainian consciousness
      of this deformity. What we will see in Ukraine otherwise will prove an horrific
      case of ressentiment — enduring and poisonous. Ressentiment is a term the Germans, Friedrich Nietzsche
      among them, borrowed from the French in the 19th century because they had no term
      for the phenomenon. It denotes the hostility and anger within a group arising
      from a shared sense of inferiority in the face of another — this other becoming
      a kind of scapegoat for a society’s frustrations and complexes. Max Scheler, the
      19th and early 20th century phenomenologist, explored all this in Ressentiment
      , a brief but pithy book he published in 1912 (in English, Marquette Univ. Press,
      1994). As Scheler explained in interesting detail, a socially accepted set of
      values arises from this complex of feelings. Ressentiment is a potentially dangerous
      sentiment when it animates a society that feels itself wounded over a sustained
      period of time. We need look no further than the extreme Russophobia evident today
      among some segments of the Ukrainian population for a case in point. Against this
      historical and social backdrop, I do not see the Ukrainians as capable of reaching
      a settlement to end the war that has already torn apart the nation and its people.
      I do not see that they can achieve peace, either with others or among themselves,
      because they do not know peace and they are not capable of it. A Rockface of History
      But I see another reason peace in Ukraine will prove elusive, if not impossible,
      even as the Russians achieve it on the battlefield. (And I tend toward the latter
      probability.) This judgment arises when we put the Ukraine crisis in a larger,
      global context. I think of Ukraine as resembling the rock face in a mine, or a
      front line in a global conflict: It is where the non–West is most urgently chiseling
      a new world order into being. It is a site of insistence, let us say. And it is
      where the West proposes to stop this world-historical turn of history’s wheel
      — a turn that simply cannot be stopped. Think of Putin’s demands. Apart from de–Nazification
      — an objective that, to me, reflects considerable insight on Moscow’s part — there
      are the more encompassing “root causes.” I gather Putin used this phrase yet again
      in his call with Trump. [See: Rootin g Out the Root Causes in Ukraine ] Putin,
      Sergei Lavrov, his foreign minister, and other senior Russian officials have been clear
      on this point at least since Moscow sent those two draft treaties Westward in December
      2021 as the proposed basis of negotiations that would lead to an encompassing new
      security structure between Russia and the West. This framework would relieve the
      decades of tension along Russia’s western flank and Europe’s east and would be
      of benefit to both sides. This was and remains Moscow’s intent. Settlements that
      address the concerns of all sides, as against one side’s at the expense of another,
      is the very essence of sound statecraft. But any such settlement would stand as
      an expression of parity between West and non–West. As I have argued severally
      over the years, parity between these two spheres is a 21st century imperative.
      There will be no world order without it — only more of the disorder the Western
      powers call, altogether absurdly, “the rules-based order.” But it is precisely
      even the thought of parity that the United States and its trans–Atlantic allies
      refuse to accept. It would bring to an end the half-millennium of dominance the
      West cannot release from its grasp even as it will eventually have to do so. “It
      is no good,” Trump said after his latest telephone talk with Putin. No, and I
      do not see how it can be. Trump has nothing to offer the Russians that would amount
      to a serious address of what is genuinely at issue between America and Russia
      — between the West and non–West. I leave it to readers to conclude where this
      leaves the Ukraine conflict and the larger question of Russo–American relations. It
      is, once again, what it is — or what it is at the moment. In another column I
      will revisit this question of parity as it applies in West Asia. Editor’s Note

    one_sentence_summary: Despite multiple lengthy phone conversations between President
      Trump and President Putin since Trump's return to office, there has been little
      progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict or improving U.S.-Russian relations.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Patrick Lawrence discusses the ongoing telephone
      conversations between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin
      since Trump took office again, noting that these discussions have yielded little
      progress towards resolving the Ukraine conflict or improving U.S.-Russian relations.
      Despite attempts by Trump to persuade Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire,
      the Kremlin has emphasized the need to address the "root causes" of the war. The
      situation appears stagnant, especially in light of recent Russian military actions
      against Ukraine, suggesting that meaningful diplomatic progress is unlikely. Lawrence
      concludes that the exchanges between the two leaders may have reached a dead end,
      highlighting the challenges in achieving a resolution.

      the outcomes of Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the White House on Monday and the
      latest scenario for a ceasefire in Gaza, a bilateral policy of genocide has united
      the Israeli and U.S. governments in a pact of literally breath-taking cruelty.
      That pact and its horrific consequences for Palestinian people either continue
      to shock Americans or gradually normalize indifference toward ongoing atrocities
      on a massive scale. Recent news reporting that President Trump has pushed for
      a ceasefire in Gaza is an echo of a familiar refrain about peace-seeking efforts
      from the Biden and Trump administrations. The spin remained in sync with the killing
      – not only with American bombs and bullets but also with Israel’s refusal to allow
      more than a pittance of food and other essentials into Gaza. Last year began with
      a United Nations statement that “Gazans now make up 80 per cent of all people
      facing famine or catastrophic hunger worldwide, marking an unparalleled humanitarian
      crisis in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s continued bombardment and siege.” The UN
      quoted experts who said: “Currently every single person in Gaza is hungry, a quarter
      of the population are starving and struggling to find food and drinkable water,
      and famine is imminent.” In late February 2024, President Biden talked to journalists
      about prospects for a “ceasefire” (which did not take place) while holding a vanilla
      ice cream cone. “My national security adviser tells me that we’re close, we’re
      close, we’re not done yet,” Biden said , before sauntering off. He spoke during
      a photo op at an ice cream parlor in Manhattan, while the UN was sounding an alarm
      that “very little humanitarian aid has entered besieged Gaza this month.” During
      the 16 months since then, variants of facile verbiage from top U.S. government
      officials have repeated endlessly, while normalizing genocide with a steep race
      to the ethical bottom, so that – in Orwellian terms, much like “war is peace,
      freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength” – genocide is not genocide. Refusal
      to acknowledge the complicity and impunity is most of all maintained by avoidance
      and silence. The process makes a terrible truth inadmissible rather than admittable.
      All the doublethink and newspeak must detour around the reality that the U.S.-supported
      Israeli siege of Gaza is genocide, which the international Genocide Convention
      defines as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
      ethnical, racial or religious group” – with such actions as “deliberately inflicting
      on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction
      in whole or in part.” Israel’s actions in Gaza clearly meet that definition, as
      Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have unequivocally concluded with
      exhaustive reports. But under the cloaks of the Israeli and American flags, the
      official stories insist that the unconscionable should be invisible. Liberal Zionist
      groups in the United States are part of the process. Here’s what I wrote in an
      article for The Nation early this year after examining public statements by the
      “pro-Israel, pro-peace” group J Street: “Routinely, while calling for the release
      of the Israeli hostages, the organization also expressed concern about the deaths
      and suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. But none of J Street’s 132 news
      releases between October 7 and the start of the [temporary] ceasefire in late
      January 2025 called for an end to shipments of the U.S. bombs and weapons that
      were killing those civilians while enforcing Israel’s policy of using starvation
      as a weapon of war – a glaring omission for a group that declares itself to be
      ‘pro-peace.’ It was as if J Street thought that vague humanistic pleas could paper
      over these gaping cracks in its stance. “However, J Street felt comfortable taking
      a firm line on the question of whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.
      Here, it aligned itself completely with the position of the U.S. and Israeli governments.
      In mid-January 2024, when oral arguments ended at the International Court of Justice
      in the case brought by South Africa that charged the Israeli government with violating
      the Genocide Convention in Gaza, a news release declared that ‘J Street rejects
      the allegation of genocide against the State of Israel.’ Four months later, on
      May 24, J Street responded quickly when the ICJ ordered Israel to ‘immediately
      halt its military offensive’ in Rafah. ‘J Street continues to reject the allegation
      of genocide in this case,’ a news release said.” Likewise, with rare exceptions,
      U.S. news media and members of Congress dodge the reality of genocide against
      Palestinians in Gaza. Meanwhile, the events in Gaza and the evasions in the United
      States have been enormously instructive, shattering illusions along the way. Many
      Americans, especially young people, know much more about their country and its
      government than they did just two years ago. What has come to light includes mass
      murder of certain other human beings as de facto policy and functional ideology.

      in 2009 as if it had found a smoking gun. The ensuing controversy has done nothing
      to hurt Mamdani politically but engulfed the Times, further damaging the paper’s
      credibility. The July 3 article, titled “ Mamdani Identified as Asian and African
      American on College Application ” was based on a hack of Columbia University admissions
      records by a right-wing white nationalist and suggested that at 18, Mamdani lied
      about his identity in his 2009 application to Columbia by checking boxes stating
      that he was “Asian” and “Black or African-American.” Mamdani didn’t get in. As
      the Times noted in gotcha style, Mamdani says on the campaign trail that he is
      Muslim of South Asian heritage but “claimed another label” when he was a teenager.
      “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked
      multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background,” Mamdani explained
      to the Times . Mamdani was born in 1991 in Uganda, where his father’s Gujarati
      family had lived for 100 years. The budding pol spent his first 7 years in Uganda
      and has expressed pride in his African roots. The article’s gravity and length
      and very-thin accusation have been condemned by Mamdani supporters as a smear
      and a weak one, but have already predictably been picked up by pro-Israel groups
      that hate Mamdani and his movement. The charge’s weakness was clear when House
      minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, who still has not endorsed Mamdani, was asked
      about it on MSNBC and changed the subject. He knows this is a foolish claim. Meanwhile,
      the outrage over the article has again put the Times on the defensive over its
      dismissive coverage of Mamdani. The paper is obviously at war with itself. Editors
      have sought to justify the investigation, not very convincingly, and Times columnist
      Jamelle Bouie posted, “i think you should tell readers if your source is a nazi.”
      He then deleted the post. But later posted, “NYT & many of its elite white readers
      are still obsessed with race-conscious college admissions,” according to Semafor
      . The investigation is absurd and malignant for several reasons. Even if you buy
      the premise that Mamdani stretched his identity at 18 to try and get into Columbia,
      the story is laughable. We all know kids who have played up one part or another
      of their identity. Big deal. And anyway, the evidence is not convincing. Mamdani’s
      father was a professor of political science at Columbia at the time, so the admissions
      office likely knew who he was. Mahmood Mamdani had lately published a book, “Good
      Muslim, Bad Muslim,” in which he identified himself as a “third generation East
      African of Indian descent” who “grew up in Kampala, Uganda.” But no one should
      buy the premise here, because it is so ugly. That premise is that people have
      fixed racial identities, and these categories are strict. The most disturbing
      line in the article is this righteous bit—“asked if any of his family had intermarried
      while in East Africa, he said in the interview on Thursday, ‘They’re all of Indian
      origin, from Gujarat.’” As if Mamdani would be a legitimate “African” if his South
      Asian family had mixed its blood with blacks? You’d think that pseudo-race science
      would have no place in our best newspaper. Countless Americans today have fluid
      identities, and we should respect their choices about what is important to them
      in their own backgrounds. Barack Obama made such a choice, and it was honored.
      It is hard to believe the NYT could possibly think this is a story. So yes, the
      motivation is clear, they were trying to make it a scandal: all you have to do
      is throw this out there and conservatives all over Twitter are saying he is a
      commie Muslim liar… That’s another reason the investigation is absurd. This is
      all they could come up with? The story doesn’t hurt Mamdani politically. His base
      is appalled by it, and Democratic voters don’t care, as Hakeem Jeffries has indicated.
      Jeffries is aware of the profound shifts taking place in the Democratic base that
      Michael Arria and Peter Feld have documented here . Jeffries knows that when Mamdani
      refused to apologize for defending the phrase “globalize the intifada,” the story
      disappeared, but that when Senator Kirsten Gillibrand revived that line of attack
      on WNYC by claiming that Mamdani supports jihad, she was forced to apologize for
      Islamophobia. Young Democrats are aware and somewhat radicalized, and Jeffries
      needs them if he is going to counter Trumpism. The Times is out of step with that
      base. Of course, a newspaper gets to choose what it believes in. But the Times
      is the most important newspaper in the country and a generally liberal voice,
      and it is making grievous political and ethical errors in its coverage of a young
      politician who excites a wide coalition for idealistic reasons. Because he is
      optimistic and energetic and inclusive and offers a stirring vision for the future.
      Some day the Times is sure to reflect this American political movement. But now
      it is stuck by its own choice in the worst muck of the Israel lobby. The core
      issue here is Israel. The young are mobilized by the horror of the Gaza genocide.
      The Democratic base demands that its leaders express their outrage at Israel’s
      rolling massacres and stop sending arms to war criminals. The Times has pointedly
      refused to honor that point of view. The Times ’s acceptance of the genocide is
      best captured by a piece by Nicholas Kristof, a liberal columnist at the paper,
      when he wrote in April, “the Netanyahu government is now again escalating in Gaza.
      Is this really the best use of American weaponry?” Is this really the best use
      of American weaponry? This is a morally idiotic question. We know the answer,

    one_sentence_summary: The New York Times faced backlash for publishing a controversial
      investigation into Zohran Mamdani's racial identity on a college application,
      which has not harmed his political standing but has further damaged the paper's
      credibility.
    paragraph_summary: The New York Times recently published a controversial article
      scrutinizing Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, regarding his racial
      identity on a college application from 2009, suggesting he misrepresented himself
      by identifying as both "Asian" and "Black or African-American." This investigation,
      stemming from a hack of Columbia University admissions records, has been criticized
      as a smear by Mamdani's supporters, who argue it disrespects the voters who have
      propelled his political rise. Mamdani clarified that he checked multiple boxes
      to reflect his diverse heritage, as there was no specific option for his Indian-Ugandan
      background. Despite the article's intent to undermine him, it has not negatively
      impacted Mamdani's campaign and has instead drawn attention to the Times' credibility,
      while also being seized upon by pro-Israel groups opposed to his political stance.

      Weiss / Mondoweiss In a clear sign that it intends to batter Zohran Mamdani, the
      Democratic nominee for mayor, and disrespect the voters who have generated the
      leftwinger’s spectacular rise, the New York Times last week published a lengthy
      investigation of Mamdani’s statement about his racial identity as a college applicant
      in 2009 as if it had found a smoking gun. The ensuing controversy has done nothing
      to hurt Mamdani politically but engulfed the Times, further damaging the paper’s
      credibility. The July 3 article, titled “ Mamdani Identified as Asian and African
      American on College Application ” was based on a hack of Columbia University admissions
      records by a right-wing white nationalist and suggested that at 18, Mamdani lied
      about his identity in his 2009 application to Columbia by checking boxes stating
      that he was “Asian” and “Black or African-American.” Mamdani didn’t get in. As
      the Times noted in gotcha style, Mamdani says on the campaign trail that he is
      Muslim of South Asian heritage but “claimed another label” when he was a teenager.
      “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked

      Sanity (VIPS) / Consortium News July 5, 2025 MEMORANDUM FOR: The President FROM:
      Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) SUBJECT: Data Collection
      Can Be Effective and Legal Introduction It’s an Artificial Conundrum I t is not
      necessary to make an end-run around the U.S. Constitution to thwart terrorism
      and other crimes. Those claiming otherwise have been far from candid – especially
      since June 2013, when Edward Snowden revealed gross violations of the Fourth Amendment
      by NSA’s bulk electronic collection. U.S. citizens have been widely misled into
      believing that their Constitutional right to privacy had to yield to a superseding
      need to combat terrorism. The choice was presented as an Either-Or conundrum.
      In what follows, we will show that this is a false choice. Rather, the “choice”
      can be a Both-And . In sum, all that is needed is to place advanced technology
      that has been already demonstrated into the hands of officials not driven by lust
      for a cushy retirement. Sophisticated collection and processing technology that
      also protects the right to privacy has been available for decades, enabling highly
      efficient and discriminating collection. Despite that, top officials have opted
      for quasi-legal, cumbersome, ineffective – and wildly expensive – technology that
      has done little more than line the pockets of contractors and “old-friend” retirees.
      U.S. officials have been caught lying under oath – with impunity – with false
      claims about the effectiveness of the intrusive, high price-tag technology they
      procured and implemented. In the Annex to this Memo we briefly portray the illustrative
      behavior of one such senior official. We do so in the belief that a short case
      study may shed light on the apparent motivation of many senior officials who seem
      to take far too lightly their oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the
      United States. We took the same oath. It has no expiration date. Security and
      Privacy: NOT Incompatible Technology already available – and already demonstrated
      to be effective – makes it possible for law-abiding officials, together with experienced
      technical people to create a highly efficient system in which both security and
      privacy can be assured. Again, the basic problems are corruption in government
      and the prevailing incestuous relationships with contractors. Advanced technology
      can pinpoint and thwart corruption in the intelligence, military, and civilian
      domain. At its core, this requires automated analysis of attributes and transactional
      relationships among individuals. The large data sets in government files already
      contain the needed data. And proven methodologies can automatically isolate activity
      of interest and equate this activity to profiles of interest, with inference to
      intentions and capabilities. To implement this approach requires assigning trustworthy
      people with deep knowledge of relevant activities in government agencies. This
      is a monumental task as these government agencies have been evolving and operating
      in their own way for decades and cloning their work force to perpetually operate
      in that way. So, the real problem goes beyond top management. Sweeping changes
      are required at all levels of management. Managing Intelligence Databases On the
      Intelligence Community side, there are ways to purge databases of irrelevant data
      and deny government officials the ability to spy on anyone they want. These methodologies
      protect the privacy of innocent people, while enhancing the ability to discover
      criminal threats. This process creates a rich but scaled-down environment to focus
      analysts for optimum success. If this method had been in place in 2016, it would
      have been impossible to spy on the president. In addition, this approach would
      provide a basis to monitor other government activities – like use or testing of
      biological or Directed Energy Weapons inside the U.S. – or other kinds of illegal
      activity by any government agency. It also means honest expert input is available
      to make sure the intelligence community does not deprive the White House of what
      it needs to know about the collection systems of NSA and others – like those exposed
      by Edward Snowden. This acquisition system can collect and store virtually all
      data passed on the worldwide web and the public switched telephone network. Legal
      Compliance In order to ensure continuous legal compliance with these changes,
      it is necessary to establish a central technical group or organization to continuously
      monitor and validate compliance with the Constitution and U.S. law. Such a group
      would need to have the highest-level access to all agencies to ensure compliance
      behind the classification doors. It must be able to go into any agency to inspect
      its activity at any time. In addition, whenever possible, it would be best to
      make government financial and operational transactions open to the public for
      review as a means of assuring the public that government agencies are doing their
      job properly. This new organization would be responsible for verifying that all
      government agencies are continuing to play by the rules, thus validating compliance
      with the law. Last, but hardly least, unbiased monitors must be in place to ensure
      funds are invested on the basis of merit not on the age-old practice of “who you
      know.” Potential For Abuse All the above-mentioned areas, and still more (e.g.,
      import and export smuggling) can be exposed using these automated analytic processes.
      But we need to emphasize that this could become a double-edged sword. These techniques
      can be used against innocent people. Actually, data from NSA’s mass collection
      is currently used by DOJ, F.B.I., DEA and DHS to target U.S. citizens, most of
      them innocent. If automated analytic technology was added to the current state
      of surveillance and combined with AI, robotics and drone technology, the result
      would be devastating to privacy and to democracy. This is precisely why it is
      absolutely critical to create a separate, independent, highly technical group
      to inspect government agency activities at all classification levels and to give
      that group the power to terminate special access programs that happen to be illegal,
      but kept hidden. In addition, this group should also be given authority to perform
      automated analysis of all government network logs. This, too, is key: a fail-safe
      method to detect any attempt to hide activity from oversight and inspection. To
      make this group or organization fully acceptable, it’s charter would probably
      require it to report to all three branches of government. Such an organization
      would go a long way toward making government truly transparent to the public in
      these areas. Moreover, automated analysis of network logs could also make intrusion
      detection easier to detect and thus improve cyber security. This would make it
      possible to stop intruders before they do damage – no matter the nature of the
      attack. Techniques That Are Both Legal and Effective In the above context, we
      suggest the following techniques for the Intelligence Community and broader government
      to manage mass surveillance data in a way that protects privacy, while maximizing
      the probability of threat detection. (Again, what we propose has been tested.
      In sum, it amounts to proof positive that it is unnecessary to sacrifice the right
      to privacy for some perceived measure of enhanced security.) First, do a focused
      professional study based on attributes and transactions that form the basis of
      probable cause. These techniques could also be used to purge current data bases
      of irrelevant data and enhance smart data collection. The following analytic techniques
      would protect privacy, detect impending threats, and optimize productivity of
      analysis: Focus on entities within two degrees of separation in communications
      or transactional relationships. Here, the second degree must not go through a
      commercial or government entity as this would pull in large numbers of irrelevant
      entities and bury analysts in too much information making them dysfunctional.
      This approach lets analysts focus on known targets and the ability to monitor
      new or expanding elements of these threats. Target surveillance on entities that
      have attributes like: frequent use of satellite phones in areas of the world where
      terrorists, drug smugglers, or other criminal activities are prevalent; target
      entities that frequently visit Internet sites that advocate violence, bomb making,
      pedophilia, and other types of criminality; target entities based on asset or
      informant information. Based on metadata, examine first degree networks in the
      communications or transactional relationships that cluster in areas where criminal
      activity is prevalent. This enables discovery of targets of interest previously
      unknown. Created, Tested, Proven In-House: Then Thwarted By early 1998, our NSA
      team in the SIGINT Automation Research Center (SARC) developed the ability to
      reconstruct files at fiber optic rates in the worldwide Internet. This meant NSA
      no longer had to select only a small percentage of internet data to process, but
      could get all data. Now, the only limitation was available power and space for
      equipment to process information. In August 1998, we gave a copy of this code
      to an NSA station in Bad Aibling, Bavaria, Germany to test and critique. The specialists
      at Bad Aibling found our method so superior to what they were using at the time
      that they installed it across the entire site late on a Friday night. However,
      they did not adopt our smart selection approach and continued to use the existing
      selection system. This meant, when our system reconstructed virtually everything
      on the lines, their existing selection system forwarded almost all of it. Consequently,
      eight to twelve hours later the NSA data storage system was about to crash. We
      were called in to shut down the input and prevent the impending crash. This event
      made it clear to NSA management not only the magnitude of the data explosion in
      the internet, but also that there were smart ways to address that data. That methodology
      had been created in-house and were dirt cheap. Creation of Google In his book,
      Pay Any Price (page 237), James Risen noted that at the time of the Bad Aibling
      event, there was a near simultaneous development in the ultimate creation of what
      became Google. It became clear several years later that both NSA and C.I.A. solicited
      and funded efforts to develop Google in September 1998 just one month after the
      Bad Aibling demonstration. So, in effect, the distributed data storage, metadata
      indexed, content management, profile development system we had operating at NSA’s
      SARC, and had been tested at Bad Aibling, was out-sourced to two beneficiaries
      at Stanford (Larry Page and Sergey Brin). With still more government funding (as
      well as access to SARC’s ingenuity and creative in-house system) Page and Brin
      went on to develop Google. What followed inside NSA after the Bad Aibling event
      was an effort to stop development of our in-house system – the one that had been
      proven to work, but had now been given to Page and Brin. NSA management officially
      shut SARC down in August 2001. Corruption The only fault in the unprecedentedly
      efficient system we had created was not a technical flaw, but a matter of cost,
      but it is not what you may be thinking. The system worked so well that it simply
      cost too little. The contractor systems NSA ended up buying were much less efficient
      but had the “advantage” of costing a lot more. Opting for outside systems required
      a much bigger budget and more staff to manage and perform related functions for
      the IC agencies involved. In addition, the mass data collection systems chosen
      lacked privacy protections and gave government agencies information on virtually
      everyone on the planet. (So much for the Fourth Amendment!) In sum, for the government
      and for Silicon Valley, there were huge financial and bureaucratic motives to
      stop us. For example, to develop our system to full capability in the NSA system
      would have cost about 3.2 million dollars. In contrast, the development of other
      privatized systems has cost the government 10’s of billions of dollars since 2001.
      A good deal of that cost went to formulating an effective process to analyze data.
      This effort was being done by contractors with expertise in classical technical
      skills like computer programming. The basic skills required to resolve such issues,
      however, are experience in intelligence analysis and in applying mathematics to
      organizations. Annex: A Case Study In spring 2013, after Edward Snowden exposed
      NSA abuses, U.S. intelligence directors misled Congress. In retrospect, it seems
      clear they wanted to avoid being held accountable long enough to retire and cash
      in (literally) on their experience managing technology centers and hiring contractors.
      One example may suffice. Alexander the Great (Prevaricator) For one such official
      this gambit worked like a charm. In 2013, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander went
      on the offensive, accusing Edward Snowden of breaking the law and endangering
      Americans. The supreme irony is that the lawbreaker was not Snowden. Rather, those
      breaking the law were NSA directors like Alexander playing fast and loose with
      the Fourth Amendment, and then claiming success in thwarting terrorism. After
      9/11 it was child’s play to manipulate members of Congress to take liberties with
      the Constitution and approve methods of dubious legality ostensibly to apprehend
      terrorists. Few in Congress would risk voting against legislation that officials
      like Gen. Alexander could later claim “might have prevented” an act of terrorism.
      As explained above, the technical collection methods they chose were not only,
      arguably, illegal. They were also so inefficient as to hinder, rather than help,
      intelligence efforts to thwart terrorist attacks. Not to worry: the contractors
      who introduced those systems profiteered grandly. So did the senior government
      officials who awarded multiple contracts and then slipped into highly comfortable
      retirement. Mr. Alexander is but one example. The public record shows that Alexander
      lied repeatedly in sworn testimony to members of Congress, who were intimidated
      into going along with his disingenuousness. After the Snowden disclosures, Alexander
      testified under oath that 54 terrorist plots had been foiled by the bulk collection
      in NSA’s vast phone records database. Under follow-up congressional questioning,
      Alexander admitted that only 13 of those 54 cases had any connection to the U.S.
      and that in only one, or perhaps two, of the 13 cases had a crime been foiled.
      At a hearing on Oct. 7, 2013, Senate Judiciary chair Patrick Leahy (D, VT) corrected
      Alexander’s prior testimony: “ There is no evidence that [bulk] phone records
      collection helped to thwart dozens or even several terrorist plots. These weren’t
      all plots and they weren’t foiled.” Lucrative Retirement When Gen. Alexander retired
      in early 2014, he landed a multi-million-dollar technical consulting job. Members
      of Congress accused him of profiteering by trading secrets for cash. Rep. Alan
      Grayson (D-FL), for example, charged him with disclosing “classified information
      to bank trade groups for monthly fees of up to $1,000,000.” In May 2014 Alexander
      founded IronNet Cybersecurity. He made about $5 million in early stock sales and
      bought a Florida mansion worth the same amount. Listed on the NYSE in 2021, IronNet
      Cybersecurity was delisted in August 2023, leaving investors with worthless shares.

      Sanity (VIPS) / Consortium News July 5, 2025 MEMORANDUM FOR: The President FROM:
      Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) SUBJECT: Data Collection
      Can Be Effective and Legal Introduction It’s an Artificial Conundrum I t is not
      necessary to make an end-run around the U.S. Constitution to thwart terrorism
      and other crimes. Those claiming otherwise have been far from candid – especially
      since June 2013, when Edward Snowden revealed gross violations of the Fourth Amendment
      by NSA’s bulk electronic collection. U.S. citizens have been widely misled into
      believing that their Constitutional right to privacy had to yield to a superseding
      need to combat terrorism. The choice was presented as an Either-Or conundrum.
      In what follows, we will show that this is a false choice. Rather, the “choice”
      can be a Both-And . In sum, all that is needed is to place advanced technology
      that has been already demonstrated into the hands of officials not driven by lust
      for a cushy retirement. Sophisticated collection and processing technology that
      also protects the right to privacy has been available for decades, enabling highly
      efficient and discriminating collection. Despite that, top officials have opted
      for quasi-legal, cumbersome, ineffective – and wildly expensive – technology that
      has done little more than line the pockets of contractors and “old-friend” retirees.
      U.S. officials have been caught lying under oath – with impunity – with false
      claims about the effectiveness of the intrusive, high price-tag technology they
      procured and implemented. In the Annex to this Memo we briefly portray the illustrative
      behavior of one such senior official. We do so in the belief that a short case
      study may shed light on the apparent motivation of many senior officials who seem
      to take far too lightly their oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the
      United States. We took the same oath. It has no expiration date. Security and
      Privacy: NOT Incompatible Technology already available – and already demonstrated
      to be effective – makes it possible for law-abiding officials, together with experienced
      technical people to create a highly efficient system in which both security and
      privacy can be assured. Again, the basic problems are corruption in government
      and the prevailing incestuous relationships with contractors. Advanced technology
      can pinpoint and thwart corruption in the intelligence, military, and civilian
      domain. At its core, this requires automated analysis of attributes and transactional
      relationships among individuals. The large data sets in government files already
      contain the needed data. And proven methodologies can automatically isolate activity
      of interest and equate this activity to profiles of interest, with inference to
      intentions and capabilities. To implement this approach requires assigning trustworthy
      people with deep knowledge of relevant activities in government agencies. This
      is a monumental task as these government agencies have been evolving and operating
      in their own way for decades and cloning their work force to perpetually operate
      in that way. So, the real problem goes beyond top management. Sweeping changes
      are required at all levels of management. Managing Intelligence Databases On the
      Intelligence Community side, there are ways to purge databases of irrelevant data
      and deny government officials the ability to spy on anyone they want. These methodologies
      protect the privacy of innocent people, while enhancing the ability to discover
      criminal threats. This process creates a rich but scaled-down environment to focus
      analysts for optimum success. If this method had been in place in 2016, it would
      have been impossible to spy on the president. In addition, this approach would
      provide a basis to monitor other government activities – like use or testing of
      biological or Directed Energy Weapons inside the U.S. – or other kinds of illegal
      activity by any government agency. It also means honest expert input is available
      to make sure the intelligence community does not deprive the White House of what
      it needs to know about the collection systems of NSA and others – like those exposed
      by Edward Snowden. This acquisition system can collect and store virtually all
      data passed on the worldwide web and the public switched telephone network. Legal
      Compliance In order to ensure continuous legal compliance with these changes,
      it is necessary to establish a central technical group or organization to continuously
      monitor and validate compliance with the Constitution and U.S. law. Such a group
      would need to have the highest-level access to all agencies to ensure compliance
      behind the classification doors. It must be able to go into any agency to inspect
      its activity at any time. In addition, whenever possible, it would be best to
      make government financial and operational transactions open to the public for
      review as a means of assuring the public that government agencies are doing their
      job properly. This new organization would be responsible for verifying that all
      government agencies are continuing to play by the rules, thus validating compliance
      with the law. Last, but hardly least, unbiased monitors must be in place to ensure
      funds are invested on the basis of merit not on the age-old practice of “who you
      know.” Potential For Abuse All the above-mentioned areas, and still more (e.g.,
      import and export smuggling) can be exposed using these automated analytic processes.
      But we need to emphasize that this could become a double-edged sword. These techniques
      can be used against innocent people. Actually, data from NSA’s mass collection
      is currently used by DOJ, F.B.I., DEA and DHS to target U.S. citizens, most of
      them innocent. If automated analytic technology was added to the current state
      of surveillance and combined with AI, robotics and drone technology, the result
      would be devastating to privacy and to democracy. This is precisely why it is
      absolutely critical to create a separate, independent, highly technical group
      to inspect government agency activities at all classification levels and to give
      that group the power to terminate special access programs that happen to be illegal,
      but kept hidden. In addition, this group should also be given authority to perform
      automated analysis of all government network logs. This, too, is key: a fail-safe
      method to detect any attempt to hide activity from oversight and inspection. To
      make this group or organization fully acceptable, it’s charter would probably
      require it to report to all three branches of government. Such an organization
      would go a long way toward making government truly transparent to the public in
      these areas. Moreover, automated analysis of network logs could also make intrusion
      detection easier to detect and thus improve cyber security. This would make it
      possible to stop intruders before they do damage – no matter the nature of the
      attack. Techniques That Are Both Legal and Effective In the above context, we
      suggest the following techniques for the Intelligence Community and broader government
      to manage mass surveillance data in a way that protects privacy, while maximizing
      the probability of threat detection. (Again, what we propose has been tested.
      In sum, it amounts to proof positive that it is unnecessary to sacrifice the right
      to privacy for some perceived measure of enhanced security.) First, do a focused
      professional study based on attributes and transactions that form the basis of
      probable cause. These techniques could also be used to purge current data bases
      of irrelevant data and enhance smart data collection. The following analytic techniques
      would protect privacy, detect impending threats, and optimize productivity of
      analysis: Focus on entities within two degrees of separation in communications
      or transactional relationships. Here, the second degree must not go through a
      commercial or government entity as this would pull in large numbers of irrelevant
      entities and bury analysts in too much information making them dysfunctional.
      This approach lets analysts focus on known targets and the ability to monitor
      new or expanding elements of these threats. Target surveillance on entities that
      have attributes like: frequent use of satellite phones in areas of the world where
      terrorists, drug smugglers, or other criminal activities are prevalent; target
      entities that frequently visit Internet sites that advocate violence, bomb making,
      pedophilia, and other types of criminality; target entities based on asset or
      informant information. Based on metadata, examine first degree networks in the
      communications or transactional relationships that cluster in areas where criminal
      activity is prevalent. This enables discovery of targets of interest previously
      unknown. Created, Tested, Proven In-House: Then Thwarted By early 1998, our NSA
      team in the SIGINT Automation Research Center (SARC) developed the ability to
      reconstruct files at fiber optic rates in the worldwide Internet. This meant NSA
      no longer had to select only a small percentage of internet data to process, but
      could get all data. Now, the only limitation was available power and space for
      equipment to process information. In August 1998, we gave a copy of this code
      to an NSA station in Bad Aibling, Bavaria, Germany to test and critique. The specialists
      at Bad Aibling found our method so superior to what they were using at the time
      that they installed it across the entire site late on a Friday night. However,
      they did not adopt our smart selection approach and continued to use the existing
      selection system. This meant, when our system reconstructed virtually everything
      on the lines, their existing selection system forwarded almost all of it. Consequently,
      eight to twelve hours later the NSA data storage system was about to crash. We
      were called in to shut down the input and prevent the impending crash. This event
      made it clear to NSA management not only the magnitude of the data explosion in
      the internet, but also that there were smart ways to address that data. That methodology
      had been created in-house and were dirt cheap. Creation of Google In his book,
      Pay Any Price (page 237), James Risen noted that at the time of the Bad Aibling
      event, there was a near simultaneous development in the ultimate creation of what
      became Google. It became clear several years later that both NSA and C.I.A. solicited
      and funded efforts to develop Google in September 1998 just one month after the
      Bad Aibling demonstration. So, in effect, the distributed data storage, metadata
      indexed, content management, profile development system we had operating at NSA’s
      SARC, and had been tested at Bad Aibling, was out-sourced to two beneficiaries
      at Stanford (Larry Page and Sergey Brin). With still more government funding (as
      well as access to SARC’s ingenuity and creative in-house system) Page and Brin
      went on to develop Google. What followed inside NSA after the Bad Aibling event
      was an effort to stop development of our in-house system – the one that had been
      proven to work, but had now been given to Page and Brin. NSA management officially
      shut SARC down in August 2001. Corruption The only fault in the unprecedentedly
      efficient system we had created was not a technical flaw, but a matter of cost,
      but it is not what you may be thinking. The system worked so well that it simply
      cost too little. The contractor systems NSA ended up buying were much less efficient
      but had the “advantage” of costing a lot more. Opting for outside systems required
      a much bigger budget and more staff to manage and perform related functions for
      the IC agencies involved. In addition, the mass data collection systems chosen
      lacked privacy protections and gave government agencies information on virtually
      everyone on the planet. (So much for the Fourth Amendment!) In sum, for the government
      and for Silicon Valley, there were huge financial and bureaucratic motives to
      stop us. For example, to develop our system to full capability in the NSA system
      would have cost about 3.2 million dollars. In contrast, the development of other
      privatized systems has cost the government 10’s of billions of dollars since 2001.
      A good deal of that cost went to formulating an effective process to analyze data.
      This effort was being done by contractors with expertise in classical technical
      skills like computer programming. The basic skills required to resolve such issues,
      however, are experience in intelligence analysis and in applying mathematics to
      organizations. Annex: A Case Study In spring 2013, after Edward Snowden exposed

      Reed / The Grayzone On July 2, the Associated Press released an exposé containing
      short videos which appeared to show American mercenaries associated with the Gaza
      Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) opening fire on aid-seekers in Gaza during an incident
      in southern Gaza this May. The footage was supplied by a former employee of UG
      Solutions, a firm charged with securing GHF distribution sites. “I think you hit
      one,” one soldier of fortune says to another following a loud burst of gunfire.
      “Hell yeah, boy!” another exclaims. In an apparent attempt to control the damage
      from the AP investigation, UG Solutions has distributed a pair of videos comprising
      over seven minutes of footage to the press. The newly released footage offers
      an unprecedented glimpse of the disturbing interactions between the starving population
      of Gaza and well-armed, clearly unprepared Americans hired to provide security
      for GHF’s chaotic aid operations. Filmed by one of its own employee, the recordings
      were seemingly distributed in an effort to show UG Solutions’ agents have not
      fired live bullets on unarmed crowds of Palestinians. According to a UG Solutions
      statement, the videos “not only clarify what happened, but provide critical context,
      which contradicts that [sic] AP’s reporting and shows that the accusations are
      unfounded.” However, a closer examination by The Grayzone demonstrates that the
      video was anything but exculpatory. In one video, a ragtag group of mercenaries
      can be seen firing what they called “warning shots” toward a crowd of Palestinian
      civilians, whom they acknowledged to be non-threatening, before radioing the notoriously
      trigger-happy Israeli military for backup. Following a series of nearby gunshots,
      a UG Solutions mercenary can be heard radioing the IDF to inform them, “We are
      firing warning shots. Warning shots – that’s from us,” he says. Like all others
      heard in the video, he speaks in an American accent. Seconds before the gunshots
      ring out, a UG Solutions agent can be seen in the lower left hand corner of the
      screen aiming his rifle in the direction of a crowd of aid seekers. These crucial
      pieces of evidence undermine claims by a UG Solutions spokesman, who told the
      AP he was “unaware of video showing gunfire from someone believed to be a UG Solutions
      contractor.” While eroding the mercenary firm’s defense, the UG Solutions video
      also underscores the shambolic state of GHF’s supposedly humanitarian operations.
      Mercenary candid camera exposes “amateur hour” In the footage, the mercenary filming
      acknowledges that he and his fellow guns for hire are unable to exchange even
      basic Arabic phrases with the starving crowds. “Think I’m gonna write down some…
      Arabic words,” he says, before rattling off a series of expressions that reflected
      his team’s lack of training and utter inability to communicate: “Tomorrow. Back.
      Go home. Stop.” The mercenary tacitly acknowledges that in the absence of translation
      help, he and his team have been forced to rely on English speaking Gazan aid seekers.
      “There were a couple [Palestinians] that, like you said, spoke decent English,
      that were pretty helpful.” “I think for the most part they don’t have any mal
      intent, because they’re desperate,” the American continues, noting the absence
      of genuine security threats. A nearby mercenary chimes in, “They’re desperate
      as fuck.” Later, the cameraman complains that refugees hauled off a light pole
      and a nearby tree — presumably for firewood — before grumbling that the desperate
      crowds took GHF’s distribution tables from the site as well. The unsettling video
      seems to corroborate a high ranking UG Solutions contractor’s characterization
      of the firm’s Gaza operations as “amateur hour.” US spooks and ISIS affiliates
      team up with Israel. What could go wrong? UG Solutions splits armed operations
      in the besieged Gaza Strip with another US private mercenary firm, Safe Reach
      Solutions, which was founded by former CIA operative Philip Reilly. Both operate
      under the auspices of the Trump-aligned Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which received
      an initial investment from McNally Capital, a private equity firm founded by mapping
      heir Ward McNally. The Grayzone has reported that GHF also appears to have received
      substantial funding from Israel’s Mossad and Ministry of Defense. The US Department
      of State has since pledged $30 million dollars to keep the scandal-stained GHF
      operations afloat. As of July 6, 2025, over 700 people had been killed at the
      hands of the only armed factions operating in the so-called “humanitarian zones”:
      the GHF, Israel, and the formerly ISIS-aligned clan of Bedouin gang leader Yasser
      Abu Shabab , who was recently deputized as Israel’s local enforcers. Several Israeli
      soldiers have told Haaretz that they received orders to fire at aid seekers drawn
      to GHF distribution hubs, causing high numbers of deaths and injuries. “Where
      I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day,” one soldier
      told the Israeli paper. “They’re treated like a hostile force – no crowd-control
      measures, no tear gas – just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine
      guns, grenade launchers, mortars.” Editor’s Note : A t a moment when the once

      donation . By Victoria Malis, Katherine Dailey and Sadie Leite, Medill Investigative
      Lab, and Debbie Cenziper and Megan Rose, ProPublica Inspectors charged with safeguarding
      America’s drug supply say they are reeling from deep cuts at the Food and Drug
      Administration despite promises by the Trump administration to preserve the work
      of the agency’s investigative force. Dozens of people who help coordinate travel
      for complex inspections of foreign drug-making factories have been let go, and
      though some have since been rehired, inspectors said the ongoing strain of policing
      an industry spread across more than 90 countries has exhausted staff and could
      compromise the safety of medications used by millions of people. For years, inspectors
      have uncovered dirty equipment, contaminated supplies and fraudulent testing records
      in some overseas factories — serious safety and quality breaches that can sicken
      or kill consumers. Last month, ProPublica reported that a generic immunosuppression
      drug for transplant patients could dissolve too quickly when ingested, increasing
      the risk of kidney failure. The drug was made at an Indian factory with a history
      of quality violations that was banned from the U.S. market. The company previously
      told ProPublica it believes the medication is safe. In April, more than 3,500
      FDA employees were laid off under U.S. Department and Health and Human Services
      Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a roughly 15% reduction in force. “We aren’t
      just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its
      core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,”
      Kennedy said . At the time, the agency said the reductions would not impact inspectors.
      Kennedy has since announced that HHS would reverse 20% of the cuts across the
      agency. Amid news reports describing the layoffs at the FDA, Kennedy did not specify
      how many people would be reinstated. ProPublica spoke to 10 current and former
      FDA staff members and leaders in recent weeks, including inspectors who said that
      the loss of support staff has slowed critical investigations and that little relief
      has materialized. Most declined to be named because they were not authorized to
      speak publicly or feared backlash within the industry as they search for new jobs.
      One veteran drug inspector said nearly 70 people who helped arrange travel, budgets,
      translators and contingency plans for investigations were laid off. Only about
      one-third have been brought back, forcing a handful of busy managers to coordinate
      travel clearances and visas for inspections that can span weeks and include stops
      in multiple countries. “It’s difficult to get inspections done,” the investigator
      said. “The pace has slowed down. You can’t inspect as many sites.” In an email,
      an HHS spokesperson said inspections have not been affected by downsizing. The
      agency did not address questions about how many people have been let go or reinstated
      or whether additional help will be brought on. “To be clear, FDA inspectors were
      not impacted, and this critical work continues,” the agency said. Two former FDA
      commissioners and the agency’s longtime head of drug safety, however, said that
      the loss of support staff has undermined one of the FDA’s most essential missions
      at a time when Americans get most of their generic drugs from overseas manufacturers.
      That includes chemotherapy treatments, sedatives, antibiotics and medications
      on hospital crash carts. “It’s like saying, ‘Oh we didn’t fire any of the doctors
      or nurses at the hospital, but we fired all the lab techs, all the orderlies,
      all the phlebotomists … oh, but the doctors and nurses are still left so it’s
      fine,’” said Janet Woodcock, who ran the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and
      Research for more than two decades and retired in 2004. “A lot of the connective
      tissue that deals with drug safety and similar things are going to be missing.”
      Beyond the staff cuts, the departures of some longtime investigators and leaders
      in recent months have left less experienced people tasked with rooting out dangerous
      and sometimes deceptive manufacturing practices. The investigative unit, which
      looks into potential safety issues with drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other
      products, has had a retention problem for years. Inspectors leave so often that
      even with hiring blitzes, the FDA has been unable to get ahead. Between 2022 and
      2024, the agency hired 105 inspectors but about the same number left, leaving
      the inspection pool with about 230 people, according to the Government Accountability
      Office , the watchdog arm of Congress. About one-third did not have the experience
      to conduct independent foreign inspections, the GAO found. Two FDA inspectors
      said the agency needs an additional 100 to 200 experienced investigators to do
      the work. The job can be grueling. Some inspectors who travel to overseas drug-making
      factories can be away for as long as 15 weeks a year. Some have described threats
      of violence by company managers, days on planes and trains in oppressive heat
      and long nights preparing inspection reports before they head to the next stop.
      The loss of experienced investigators and cuts to support staff have also hamstrung
      other inspectors. “I am in utter shock that they don’t support and promote those
      of us who can do a decent inspection,” said one investigator who scrutinizes factories
      that produce vaccines, cell therapies and other biological products. “You’re adding
      to the chaos.” Dozens of employees who handled technology support, facilities,
      supplies and equipment were dismissed as well, snarling some day-to-day operations
      at the agency. One current employee recalled how a colleague couldn’t find replacement
      batteries for a computer mouse and how another locked herself out of her office
      and couldn’t get back in because there was no one to open the door. Even before
      the layoffs, the FDA’s investigative force struggled to monitor drug-making factories
      in countries that include India and China, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,
      raising alarms in Congress that serious manufacturing lapses may have gone unchecked.
      The FDA received more than 1 million reports from doctors, patients and others
      in 2023 about product quality issues or consumers who had adverse reactions to
      drugs, FDA data shows. “Things will be missed,” former FDA inspector Patrick Stone
      said about the layoffs. “We are going to have a lot less safe drugs.” The Trump
      administration has said little about the layoffs in recent weeks, though Kennedy
      told Congress late last month that more than 900 employees at the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health had been
      reinstated. The FDA announced in May that it would expand the use of unannounced
      inspections at overseas factories, a move that some members of Congress have been
      pushing for years. And FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that a new AI tool
      known as Elsa would help identify inspection targets. Current and former employees
      others say that won’t make up for the losses. “You can’t just expect the inspector
      to take care of all the complexities of organizing their trips overseas,” said
      former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, who served under the Obama administration.
      “Even though it might be said we’ve kept the inspectors, that doesn’t mean that
      they’ve kept the infrastructure … that actually supports safe and meaningful inspections.”

      Administration (FDA), despite prior assurances from the Trump administration that

      coordinating inspections of foreign drug manufacturing facilities, have left remaining

      for millions. Investigations have revealed serious violations in overseas factories,
      including contaminated supplies and fraudulent testing records, raising alarms
      about the quality of drugs like a generic immunosuppression medication linked
      to kidney failure risks. The FDA's workforce reduction, which amounted to about
      15%, was implemented under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy
      Jr., who claimed it was part of a realignment of the agency's priorities, despite
      earlier assurances that inspection capabilities would remain intact.

      Kennedy said . At the time, the agency said the reductions would not impact inspectors.
      Kennedy has since announced that HHS would reverse 20% of the cuts across the
      agency. Amid news reports describing the layoffs at the FDA, Kennedy did not specify
      how many people would be reinstated. ProPublica spoke to 10 current and former
      FDA staff members and leaders in recent weeks, including inspectors who said that
      the loss of support staff has slowed critical investigations and that little relief
      has materialized. Most declined to be named because they were not authorized to
      speak publicly or feared backlash within the industry as they search for new jobs.
      One veteran drug inspector said nearly 70 people who helped arrange travel, budgets,
      translators and contingency plans for investigations were laid off. Only about
      one-third have been brought back, forcing a handful of busy managers to coordinate
      travel clearances and visas for inspections that can span weeks and include stops
      in multiple countries. “It’s difficult to get inspections done,” the investigator
      said. “The pace has slowed down. You can’t inspect as many sites.” In an email,
      an HHS spokesperson said inspections have not been affected by downsizing. The
      agency did not address questions about how many people have been let go or reinstated
      or whether additional help will be brought on. “To be clear, FDA inspectors were
      not impacted, and this critical work continues,” the agency said. Two former FDA
      commissioners and the agency’s longtime head of drug safety, however, said that
      the loss of support staff has undermined one of the FDA’s most essential missions
      at a time when Americans get most of their generic drugs from overseas manufacturers.
      That includes chemotherapy treatments, sedatives, antibiotics and medications
      on hospital crash carts. “It’s like saying, ‘Oh we didn’t fire any of the doctors
      or nurses at the hospital, but we fired all the lab techs, all the orderlies,
      all the phlebotomists … oh, but the doctors and nurses are still left so it’s
      fine,’” said Janet Woodcock, who ran the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and
      Research for more than two decades and retired in 2004. “A lot of the connective
      tissue that deals with drug safety and similar things are going to be missing.”
      Beyond the staff cuts, the departures of some longtime investigators and leaders
      in recent months have left less experienced people tasked with rooting out dangerous
      and sometimes deceptive manufacturing practices. The investigative unit, which
      looks into potential safety issues with drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other
      products, has had a retention problem for years. Inspectors leave so often that
      even with hiring blitzes, the FDA has been unable to get ahead. Between 2022 and
      2024, the agency hired 105 inspectors but about the same number left, leaving
      the inspection pool with about 230 people, according to the Government Accountability
      Office , the watchdog arm of Congress. About one-third did not have the experience
      to conduct independent foreign inspections, the GAO found. Two FDA inspectors
      said the agency needs an additional 100 to 200 experienced investigators to do
      the work. The job can be grueling. Some inspectors who travel to overseas drug-making
      factories can be away for as long as 15 weeks a year. Some have described threats
      of violence by company managers, days on planes and trains in oppressive heat
      and long nights preparing inspection reports before they head to the next stop.
      The loss of experienced investigators and cuts to support staff have also hamstrung
      other inspectors. “I am in utter shock that they don’t support and promote those
      of us who can do a decent inspection,” said one investigator who scrutinizes factories
      that produce vaccines, cell therapies and other biological products. “You’re adding
      to the chaos.” Dozens of employees who handled technology support, facilities,
      supplies and equipment were dismissed as well, snarling some day-to-day operations
      at the agency. One current employee recalled how a colleague couldn’t find replacement
      batteries for a computer mouse and how another locked herself out of her office
      and couldn’t get back in because there was no one to open the door. Even before
      the layoffs, the FDA’s investigative force struggled to monitor drug-making factories
      in countries that include India and China, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic,
      raising alarms in Congress that serious manufacturing lapses may have gone unchecked.
      The FDA received more than 1 million reports from doctors, patients and others
      in 2023 about product quality issues or consumers who had adverse reactions to
      drugs, FDA data shows. “Things will be missed,” former FDA inspector Patrick Stone
      said about the layoffs. “We are going to have a lot less safe drugs.” The Trump
      administration has said little about the layoffs in recent weeks, though Kennedy
      told Congress late last month that more than 900 employees at the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health had been
      reinstated. The FDA announced in May that it would expand the use of unannounced
      inspections at overseas factories, a move that some members of Congress have been
      pushing for years. And FDA Commissioner Marty Makary announced that a new AI tool
      known as Elsa would help identify inspection targets. Current and former employees
      others say that won’t make up for the losses. “You can’t just expect the inspector
      to take care of all the complexities of organizing their trips overseas,” said
      former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, who served under the Obama administration.
      “Even though it might be said we’ve kept the inspectors, that doesn’t mean that
      they’ve kept the infrastructure … that actually supports safe and meaningful inspections.”

      Administration (FDA), despite prior assurances from the Trump administration that
      their work would be preserved. The layoffs, which included the loss of personnel
      coordinating inspections of foreign drug manufacturing facilities, have left remaining
      staff overwhelmed and concerned about the potential compromise of medication safety
      for millions. Investigations have revealed serious violations in overseas factories,
      including contaminated supplies and fraudulent testing records, raising alarms
      about the quality of drugs like a generic immunosuppression medication linked
      to kidney failure risks. The FDA's workforce reduction, which amounted to about
      15%, was implemented under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy
      Jr., who claimed it was part of a realignment of the agency's priorities, despite
      earlier assurances that inspection capabilities would remain intact.

      At least 82 people have died and dozens are still unaccounted for after flash
      flooding in central Texas over the weekend, when the Guadalupe River rose about
      26 feet in less than an hour on Friday amid torrential downpours. At least 10
      girls who attended Camp Mystic, a girls’ summer camp located on the banks of the
      river, are among the missing. In Kerr County, the most devastated area, at least
      40 adults and 28 children have died. The speed and scale of the natural disaster
      has raised questions about why officials weren’t better prepared, and whether
      the Trump administration’s cuts to scientific positions exacerbated the situation.
      “The National Weather Service, like a lot of federal agencies, went through significant
      loss of staff back in the spring,” says retired NOAA meteorologist Alan Gerard,
      now the CEO of Balanced Weather, which provides critical weather and climate alerts.
      Gerard says that while it appears there was appropriate staffing ahead of the
      Texas flood, the impact of current budget cuts and even deeper reductions being
      considered by the administration are a cause for concern. “We still have all of
      hurricane season to deal with,” he says. Transcript This is a rush transcript.
      Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: The death toll from the catastrophic
      flooding in central Texas has reached 82 people. Dozens are still unaccounted
      for following flash flooding over the weekend. The Guadalupe River rose some 26
      feet in less than an hour Friday amidst torrential downpours. The rain followed
      a long drought in the region that left the soil bone dry and increased the potential
      for flooding. Among the missing are at least 10 girls who attended Camp Mystic,
      located on the banks of the river. In Kerr County, the most devastated area, at
      least 40 adults and 28 children have died. This is Kerrville resident Scott Walden
      describing the terrifying moments before he was swept almost 200 feet by raging
      floodwaters. SCOTT WALDEN: About 6:30 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning, we
      heard some thumps. I had a shed around the corner, and the shed started banging
      against the house. And my wife jumped up, and she looked out the back, and she
      said, “There’s a river back there.” And so we ran to the front. And by the time
      we grabbed two dogs and a set of keys, the water had risen, covered four motorcycles
      and flooded a jeep and then flooded a big truck. AMY GOODMAN: Rescue workers and
      volunteers are continuing their search for the fourth day. Questions and anger
      are mounting over local authorities’ preparedness warnings ahead of the disaster,
      as well as the current and future role of federal authorities. Experts say staff
      shortages at local offices of the National Weather Service and the lack of a local
      severe weather warning system, which the state wouldn’t fund, may have been part
      of the problem. President Trump has said he plans to phase out FEMA by the end
      of this year’s hurricane season and shift those responsibilities to states. A
      reporter asked Trump about his plans for FEMA Sunday. REPORTER: Are you still
      planning to phase out FEMA? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, FEMA is something we
      can talk about later, but right now they’re busy working, so we’ll leave it at
      that. AMY GOODMAN: Trump was also asked if the federal government should hire
      back any of the meteorologists that have been fired in recent months, to which
      President Trump said, quote, “I wouldn’t know that, and I would think not,” unquote.
      Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s 2026 budget promises to dismantle critical
      scientific research programs that could improve early warning capabilities and
      upgrade technology. That’s according to our next guest, who knows these programs
      extremely well. Dr. Alan Gerard is the CEO of Balanced Weather and a retired NOAA meteorologist
      with more than three decades of experience. He’s the former head of the Warning
      Research and Development Division of the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory.
      He’s been following the flooding closely on his Substack , Balanced Weather .
      Welcome to Democracy Now! , Alan Gerard. Thank you so much for being with us.
      This is absolutely devastating. It looks like well over a hundred people have
      died. About a quarter of them are children. We just heard Trump’s response, both
      on not hiring meteorologists that have been fired and not clear whether FEMA will
      continue, yet we hear local officials saying how desperate they are to continue
      to work with the National Weather Service. Can you talk about what took place
      and the fact that part of the severe flash flooding was caused by a drought? ALAN GERARD:
      Yeah. So, we’ll start with the flash flood. That area of the country is very vulnerable
      to flash flooding due to a number of factors, partially just due to the proximity
      of the Gulf and the moisture that can come up from there. And then also, that
      soil in central Texas, which is also very hilly, when there’s a prolonged drought,
      becomes almost like concrete, so the heavy rainfall just runs off into these river
      basins that, you know, runs through the Hill Country and can create these massive
      flood waves, like what we saw, unfortunately, on the south fork of the Guadalupe.
      AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the National Weather Service — in a moment,
      we’re going to talk about the new law, the budget law that went into effect — but
      the National Weather Service and the depletion of jobs and what is missing, what
      — most importantly, as we look forward, what is needed? ALAN GERARD: Yeah, so,
      the National Weather Service, you know, like a lot of federal agencies, went through
      significant loss of staff back in the spring with federal buyouts under the plans
      of DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management, and a number of experienced staff
      were lost. The office in Austin/San Antonio, which is the office that was responsible
      the flash flood warnings in this case, have lost two of their most senior staff
      as part of that: their warning coordination meteorologist, who’s responsible for
      the outreach to emergency management, and the science and operations officer,
      who oversees the operations and training of the meteorology staff. So, obviously,
      those are critical positions. I will say that it does appear like, overall, for
      the actual event, when it occurred, the warnings went out as they should have,
      that the office was staffed appropriately. But it is definitely a concern overall,
      you know, how well the staff, overall, would have been prepared, given those losses,
      and how well they’ll be prepared going forward, as we still have all of hurricane
      season to deal with. And then, kind of from a longer-term perspective, as you
      mentioned, the 2026 presidential budget proposal would make significant cuts to NOAA,
      including completely eliminating NOAA’s research line office, the Office of Oceanic
      and Atmospheric Research. And obviously, if that were to happen, all of this research
      that’s being done to try to improve warnings for events like this would be terminated.
      AMY GOODMAN: In fact, isn’t this weather research lab in Norman, where you are,
      Norman, Oklahoma, in the crosshairs of the cuts at the federal level, where you
      worked as you were former head of the warning research unit there? ALAN GERARD:
      Yes, the division that I was in charge of actually does a lot of research to improve
      flash flood warnings. The system that the National Weather Service uses to, in
      real time, estimate the probability of flash flooding and help issue their warnings
      was developed here in our division at the National Severe Storms Lab. And under
      the current presidential budget, it would be closed along with all of the other NOAA weather
      and climate labs. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, from the heat dome that we’re seeing in
      this country and in Europe — I was just in Geneva; it’s just scalding — in Spain,
      the fires outside Barcelona, can you end by talking about how serious the threat
      of climate change is right now to the planet, beginning right there in Texas,
      in this horrific flash flooding event that has killed, it looks like, well, over
      80, probably over a hundred, half — a quarter of them children? ALAN GERARD: Yeah,
      as someone that’s been doing this for 35 years, I’ll admit that early in my career
      I was a little skeptical about how much climate change would actually impact the
      weather events that I would see in my career. But after doing it for three decades
      and seeing the research and actually watching the weather every single day and
      seeing the increased frequency of these type of events, it’s a huge concern for
      me. And, you know, that’s part of the reason why, even in retirement, I’m doing
      the Substack, trying to speak out about this, because I’m extremely concerned
      about the threat of climate change and having more increased flash floods, wildfires,
      heat waves. And regardless of the politics of it, we need to be prepared. And
      really, my focus is just trying to improve our resilience and our ability to be
      prepared for these kind of events. And obviously, I strongly believe that having
      a robust NOAA and a robust National Weather Service, a robust research program
      from NOAA, is an important part of all of that, of keeping us as safe as we can
      be as the climate continues to change. AMY GOODMAN: This final point, Alan Gerard,
      Elon Musk’s own AI bot Grok also blamed the rising death toll in Texas on cuts
      made by the Trump administration and DOGE — right, Doge that was run by Elon Musk
      — saying, “While absolute proof of counterfactuals is impossible, evidence strongly
      suggests yes: Pre-cut NWS” — National Weather Service — “models accurately predicted
      similar floods (e.g. Vermont 2023). 2025 cuts reduced staff and balloon launches
      by 25%, leading to underestimated rainfall forecasts for Kerr County. Experts,
      including ex-NOAA heads, say this delayed warnings, preventing Camp Mystic evacuation
      and contributing to the 24 deaths. Sources: PBS, NPR, Guardian .” Your final 30
      seconds. Alan Gerard, on Democracy Now! today. ALAN GERARD: Not to contradict
      Grok, but I will say that this event did have quite a bit different than, like,
      the Vermont event that it cited. This was a very small-scale event that was very
      difficult for the computer models and for humans to really forecast, you know,
      very far in advance. Having said that, there is no question that the Weather Service
      is being left in a more vulnerable state. And whether it was this event or whether
      it’s going to be with future hurricane flood events like this, we’re needlessly
      putting ourselves into increased danger by these cuts to NOAA and the Weather
      Service and NOAA Research. And hopefully, you know, this is a horrible tragedy
      that, you know, is really unspeakable, but if anything positive could come out
      of it, maybe it will be a reconsideration of some of these cuts. AMY GOODMAN:
      Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us from Norman, Oklahoma, Alan
      Gerard, retired NOAA — that’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

      AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the National Weather Service — in a moment,
      we’re going to talk about the new law, the budget law that went into effect — but
      the National Weather Service and the depletion of jobs and what is missing, what
      — most importantly, as we look forward, what is needed? ALAN GERARD: Yeah, so,
      the National Weather Service, you know, like a lot of federal agencies, went through
      significant loss of staff back in the spring with federal buyouts under the plans
      of DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management, and a number of experienced staff
      were lost. The office in Austin/San Antonio, which is the office that was responsible
      the flash flood warnings in this case, have lost two of their most senior staff
      as part of that: their warning coordination meteorologist, who’s responsible for
      the outreach to emergency management, and the science and operations officer,
      who oversees the operations and training of the meteorology staff. So, obviously,
      those are critical positions. I will say that it does appear like, overall, for
      the actual event, when it occurred, the warnings went out as they should have,
      that the office was staffed appropriately. But it is definitely a concern overall,
      you know, how well the staff, overall, would have been prepared, given those losses,
      and how well they’ll be prepared going forward, as we still have all of hurricane
      season to deal with. And then, kind of from a longer-term perspective, as you
      mentioned, the 2026 presidential budget proposal would make significant cuts to NOAA,
      including completely eliminating NOAA’s research line office, the Office of Oceanic
      and Atmospheric Research. And obviously, if that were to happen, all of this research
      that’s being done to try to improve warnings for events like this would be terminated.
      AMY GOODMAN: In fact, isn’t this weather research lab in Norman, where you are,
      Norman, Oklahoma, in the crosshairs of the cuts at the federal level, where you
      worked as you were former head of the warning research unit there? ALAN GERARD:
      Yes, the division that I was in charge of actually does a lot of research to improve
      flash flood warnings. The system that the National Weather Service uses to, in
      real time, estimate the probability of flash flooding and help issue their warnings
      was developed here in our division at the National Severe Storms Lab. And under
      the current presidential budget, it would be closed along with all of the other NOAA weather
      and climate labs. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, from the heat dome that we’re seeing in
      this country and in Europe — I was just in Geneva; it’s just scalding — in Spain,
      the fires outside Barcelona, can you end by talking about how serious the threat
      of climate change is right now to the planet, beginning right there in Texas,
      in this horrific flash flooding event that has killed, it looks like, well, over
      80, probably over a hundred, half — a quarter of them children? ALAN GERARD: Yeah,
      as someone that’s been doing this for 35 years, I’ll admit that early in my career
      I was a little skeptical about how much climate change would actually impact the
      weather events that I would see in my career. But after doing it for three decades
      and seeing the research and actually watching the weather every single day and
      seeing the increased frequency of these type of events, it’s a huge concern for
      me. And, you know, that’s part of the reason why, even in retirement, I’m doing
      the Substack, trying to speak out about this, because I’m extremely concerned
      about the threat of climate change and having more increased flash floods, wildfires,
      heat waves. And regardless of the politics of it, we need to be prepared. And
      really, my focus is just trying to improve our resilience and our ability to be
      prepared for these kind of events. And obviously, I strongly believe that having
      a robust NOAA and a robust National Weather Service, a robust research program
      from NOAA, is an important part of all of that, of keeping us as safe as we can
      be as the climate continues to change. AMY GOODMAN: This final point, Alan Gerard,
      Elon Musk’s own AI bot Grok also blamed the rising death toll in Texas on cuts
      made by the Trump administration and DOGE — right, Doge that was run by Elon Musk
      — saying, “While absolute proof of counterfactuals is impossible, evidence strongly
      suggests yes: Pre-cut NWS” — National Weather Service — “models accurately predicted
      similar floods (e.g. Vermont 2023). 2025 cuts reduced staff and balloon launches
      by 25%, leading to underestimated rainfall forecasts for Kerr County. Experts,
      including ex-NOAA heads, say this delayed warnings, preventing Camp Mystic evacuation
      and contributing to the 24 deaths. Sources: PBS, NPR, Guardian .” Your final 30
      seconds. Alan Gerard, on Democracy Now! today. ALAN GERARD: Not to contradict
      Grok, but I will say that this event did have quite a bit different than, like,
      the Vermont event that it cited. This was a very small-scale event that was very
      difficult for the computer models and for humans to really forecast, you know,
      very far in advance. Having said that, there is no question that the Weather Service
      is being left in a more vulnerable state. And whether it was this event or whether
      it’s going to be with future hurricane flood events like this, we’re needlessly
      putting ourselves into increased danger by these cuts to NOAA and the Weather
      Service and NOAA Research. And hopefully, you know, this is a horrible tragedy
      that, you know, is really unspeakable, but if anything positive could come out
      of it, maybe it will be a reconsideration of some of these cuts. AMY GOODMAN:
      Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us from Norman, Oklahoma, Alan
      Gerard, retired NOAA — that’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

    one_sentence_summary: Flash flooding in central Texas has resulted in at least 82
      deaths and many missing, raising concerns about emergency preparedness and the
      impact of federal staffing cuts on disaster response.
    paragraph_summary: At least 82 people have died and many remain unaccounted for
      following catastrophic flash flooding in central Texas, where the Guadalupe River
      surged 26 feet in under an hour due to torrential rains. The flooding has particularly
      devastated Kerr County, resulting in the deaths of 40 adults and 28 children,
      including at least 10 missing girls from Camp Mystic, a summer camp situated along
      the river. The rapid onset of the disaster has raised concerns about the preparedness
      of local officials, especially in light of staffing cuts to the National Weather
      Service attributed to the Trump administration. Experts warn that ongoing budget
      reductions could hinder effective responses to future weather events, particularly
      with hurricane season still ahead.

      donation . By Mitchell Plitnick / Mondoweiss U.S. President Donald Trump seems
      to have largely moved on from Iran and is now setting his sights on instituting
      a broader new order in the Middle East. Trump’s vision consists of an Israel-centric
      regional order that sees Iran and Hezbollah defeated and normalization with Israel
      spreading across the region, from Lebanon and Syria to Oman and Saudi Arabia.
      Joining him in creating this vision is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
      who is slated to visit the White House on Monday. While there are potentially
      many obstacles to enacting this U.S./Israeli plan, it is clear that one focus
      is to quash any Palestinian aspirations for freedom. The aftermath of the attack
      on Iran Trump had little to say about Iran’s decision to suspend its cooperation
      with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), contenting himself with a
      State Department statement calling the decision “unacceptable.” For his own part,
      Trump has downplayed any continuing negotiations with Iran, claiming they would
      serve no purpose, given that he claims ( inaccurately ) that American strikes
      have “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear program. Meanwhile, Trump has been pressing
      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to find an off-ramp in Gaza. He claims
      that Israel has accepted an American proposal for a 60-day ceasefire that would
      see the return of ten living Israeli hostages and an additional 15 bodies of hostages
      who died or were killed while in captivity. Israel has yet to confirm, despite
      misleading reports to the contrary. Whether there is a path toward Hamas accepting
      such a proposal is unclear, given that Hamas has insisted that they will only
      agree to a deal if it means freeing all the hostages in exchange for a permanent
      end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Ha’aretz reported on Thursday that Hamas “was
      satisfied” with the terms of the American proposal, but their source for this
      news, the New York Times, contained no mention of such satisfaction. Yet the Trump
      administration is clearly trying to get a ceasefire, and there is good reason
      to believe they do want to end the genocide. How far they will go to achieve that
      goal is an open question, but there is also the possibility that Netanyahu might
      be more amenable than he has been in the past. The reason for all of this has
      nothing to do with the Palestinians, but rather the region at large and domestic
      Israeli politics. Netanyahu’s strengthened position In the wake of the strikes
      on Iran, Netanyahu is in a stronger position politically than he has been in a
      long time. Polls suggest that neither he nor the opposition can cobble together
      a coalition if elections were held today. That’s familiar territory for Netanyahu.
      The problem he still faces is the corruption charges for which his trial is never-ending.
      Trump’s intervention, calling for the charges against Netanyahu to be dropped
      , is telling in this regard. While it is unlikely that Trump’s call will move
      the attorney general (whom Netanyahu is trying to fire) to drop the charges or
      for the President, Isaac Herzog, to pardon Netanyahu (something it is not clear
      he can do without Netanyahu being convicted first), it does indicate that Trump
      recognizes the need to remove this trial from Netanyahu’s path. Trump has certainly
      heard from Netanyahu that he cannot end the genocide in Gaza — because if he does,
      this trial will swallow him up and end his premiership in Israel. That is the
      sort of self-interest that Trump understands. But he also knows that the ambition
      he has for the region, which centers on a massive expansion of the Abraham Accords
      and widespread normalization between key Arab states and Israel, cannot move forward
      while the genocide continues. If Netanyahu’s government lasts until the next elections,
      which are scheduled for the end of October 2026, it is possible he could postpone
      them if he can make the case that the “security situation” demands it. But, given
      the diminished capacities of Iran and Hezbollah, the fall of Bashar al-Assad,
      and the fact that Hamas and other Palestinian groups are both diminished in terms
      of arms and too busy getting bombed and starving to pose much of a threat to Israeli
      citizens, that would be a difficult case to make. So, for Netanyahu, everything
      hinges on the corruption trial disappearing. It’s less crucial for Trump, as his
      plans would probably be supported by anyone who could defeat Netanyahu, be that
      former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, or opposition leaders Yair Lapid or Gadi
      Eizenkot (Benny Gantz, who last opposed Netanyahu, has faded badly). But the coalition
      they would form would be less militant, as it would not feature extreme ideologues
      like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir or supportive religious parties such
      as Shas and United Torah Judaism. It would still have plenty of right-wing figures,
      like Bennett and Avigdor Liberman, but it would be a coalition that was at once
      a bit more pragmatic than Netanyahu’s and a bit less in tune with Trump’s brand
      of right-wing populism. On top of all of that, the moment of triumphalism over
      the strikes on Iran is now. Already, more and more people are becoming aware of
      the fact that the operations against Iran, though devastating in many ways, did
      not “obliterate” Iran’s nuclear program . But they did change a lot of minds in
      Iran that had been reluctant to pursue a nuclear weapon. Although Iran is sticking
      with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for the moment, its decision to quit
      cooperating with the IAEA opens the door for leaving the NPT. The attacks on Iran
      have convinced many Iranians that only a nuclear deterrent will stop future attacks
      by Israel and the U.S. What does Trump want? In the wake of the American attack
      on Iranian nuclear facilities, Donald Trump’s key mediator, Steve Witkoff, teased
      that there were potentially several new and surprising countries that might soon
      join the Abraham Accords. One can only guess at what countries Witkoff was referring
      to, but some Israeli and Arab diplomats suggested that Saudi Arabia might be willing
      to at least resume discussions on normalization and that Oman might be willing
      to entertain normalization talks. Both would only happen if the genocide in Gaza
      stops. There is also Syria. Ahmad al-Sharaa, the country’s new leader, has made
      no secret of his willingness to find an accommodation with Israel. For Trump,
      this means normalization. But the situation there is far more fraught than Trump
      might think. There are major obstacles to normalization with Israel. Beyond the
      ongoing genocide in Gaza, there is the outstanding issue of the Golan Heights.
      Trump may have recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the portion of the Golan that
      Israel captured before the armistice with Syria in 1974, but the rest of the world,
      and certainly the Syrian people across the ethnic and political spectrum, have
      not. Al-Sharaa is not in a very secure position in Syria, to say the least. Skepticism
      about his rule remains in the country as well as in the wider Arab world and the
      West. Years ago, there were various scenarios about compromise on the Golan, mostly
      pursued under the rule of Hafez al-Assad. But it’s been many years since any substantive
      discussions took place. They were controversial in Syria then, and they would
      be even more so now. A deal with Israel and the American support it would bring
      would be a huge boon to the shattered Syrian economy, which gives al-Sharaa some
      room to maneuver. Syria has been said to have proposed two scenarios in which
      it would get back part of the Golan that Israel seized prior to the armistice
      between the two states in 1974. Israel would have to be willing, however, to make
      that compromise and withdraw from all of the territory it invaded after Bashar
      al-Assad’s fall and, obviously, cease all its attacks in Syria. Whether Israel
      would be willing to do that is very much open to question. More than that, al-Sharaa
      has to consider the response to compromising any part of the Golan domestically.
      If he gets a significant part of the Golan back, it might be enough, given the
      dire need in Syria and the potential for a deal to address that need. But Israeli
      Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said recently that, “Israel applied its laws to
      the Golan Heights over 40 years ago, and in any peace agreement, the Golan will
      remain an inseparable part of the State of Israel.” Lebanon has also attracted
      Trump’s attention. It is doubtful that even in his most wide-eyed moments, Trump
      believes the shaky Lebanese government could agree to relations with Israel, even
      if Israel withdrew from the areas of southern Lebanon it still occupies and stopped
      its ongoing (though rarely reported very widely) attacks in Lebanon. Instead,
      Trump wants to see Hezbollah fully disarmed, a goal shared by Lebanon’s new President,
      Joseph Aoun. But where Aoun wants to do this gradually, through dialogue as a
      path to Lebanese unity, Trump wants it done quickly and in a way that visibly
      diminishes Hezbollah — not only as a military force but as a political power.
      U.S. envoy Tom Barrack has been pushing the government to quickly move to disarm
      Hezbollah. That indicates a reckless impatience on the part of the Trump administration
      that threatens to undermine the efforts by the Lebanese government under Aoun
      to negotiate Hezbollah’s disarmament and establish the Lebanese Armed Forces as
      the sole defender of Lebanon. Hezbollah has already stated its refusal to the
      American plan. It has indicated its willingness to engage in dialogue with Aoun,
      but its position is that it will not disarm. Aoun would have to negotiate a deal
      to change their minds. He has also demanded that progress on disarming Hezbollah
      be met with steps by Israel to back out of its ongoing occupation of Lebanese
      territory and its routine attacks. Israel, for its part, is not showing much flexibility,
      demanding that Hezbollah be disarmed immediately, that its forces be moved even
      farther north than they’ve already gone, and indicating it will not give up its
      positions in southern Lebanon, offering to abandon only one of the five sites
      it occupies. The vision for Netanyahu’s visit What emerges from all of this is
      that Trump envisions Syria joining Jordan and Egypt as neighbors that make peace
      with Israel, with Lebanon joining that group sometime in the future. If Oman can
      be persuaded to join the Abraham Accords alongside Gulf Arab states Bahrain and
      the UAE, this would pave the way for Saudi Arabia to join as well. With what Trump
      sees as a chastened Iran forced to watch from the sidelines, that would create
      a Middle East whose center is in an exclusively Israeli Jerusalem. Iran, Iraq,
      and even Yemen would be forced to reckon with a playing field that forefronts
      Israel, relegates the Palestinians to an afterthought, and strongly incentivizes
      states that haven’t normalized with Israel to find an accommodation with Israel
      and its Arab partners. In Trump’s view, this could all be accomplished merely
      by ending the genocide in Gaza, not requiring an actual Palestinian state or any
      other measure of freedom for the Palestinian people. Is that realistic? Certainly
      not within the kind of timeframe Trump envisions. The Saudis would, if the genocide
      ended and a number of other states normalized relations with Israel, find a reason
      to join, given the right amount of bribes from Washington, probably including
      help on a Saudi nuclear program and significantly upgraded weapon sales. They
      would likely go back to demanding some vague roadmap to a Palestinian state, but
      would not demand a more solid commitment to a process as they are doing now. But
      in Syria and Lebanon, the opposition would be tremendous, and it would very likely
      be supported by many voices in Jordan and Egypt, and obviously, in Iran, Iraq,
      and Yemen. The repression against such solidarity would need to be draconian,
      and it’s not at all clear that Syria or Lebanon has either the security capacity
      or the political space to do that. Indeed, abandoning the Palestinians to that
      degree, while perhaps not unprecedented for Arab leaders, would spark considerable
      outrage in both Jordan and Egypt as well and, at least in Jordan, could very well
      be fatally destabilizing. Netanyahu might be willing to embrace this as a long-term
      vision as he sits with Trump in Washington next week. But he knows it can’t be
      achieved in the short term. Instead, he is going to move forward with the genocide
      in Gaza until Trump makes him stop. Meanwhile, pressure from Netanyahu’s Likud
      party to annex the West Bank is growing, with some ultra-nationalists also calling
      to annex Gaza . Netanyahu is not likely to approve such moves as long as Trump’s
      efforts to expand normalization keep moving forward. If and when they fail, however,
      Netanyahu will be ready with annexation. This is likely a tool Trump will use
      in pressing Arab leaders to normalize relations with Israel. In all of it, whichever
      direction events move, the Palestinians are, once again, being set up for abandonment.
      The question is how long Arab leaders can keep a lid on the outrage throughout
      the region and how long Western leaders will continue to ignore and repress the
      growing anger over the support Israel is getting from our governments. Please

      By Juan Cole / Informed Comment Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – The fascist government
      of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to wage war on Gaza civilians,
      in the longest and most intense violation of the Geneva Conventions, the Rome
      Statute and other elements of International Humanitarian Law in this century.
      The United Nations Human Rights office in the Occupied Palestinian territories
      recently revealed that the Israeli military continues to subject the al-Mawasi
      region in western Khan Younis to military strikes, which for the most part “appear
      to target directly makeshift tents” and so manage to wipe out entire families.
      The UN says, “Between 18 March and 16 June 2025, OHCHR recorded 112 attacks on
      Al Mawasi, killing 380 people, including at least 158 women and children.” At
      the same time, sadistic commanders are ordering Palestinian civilians from other
      parts of Gaza to go to “known shelters” in that very Al Mawasi area where such
      shelters are being bombarded. Since last March when Israel violated the ceasefire
      negotiated by the Trump administration, its minions have forced over 300,000 people
      into Al Mawasi, an area of about 3.5 square miles. There are now 425,000 people
      huddling there, mostly in so-called “tents” — really just odd bits of plastic
      and cloth. And they are sometimes being shot at like fish in a barrel, even as
      Israel’s military attacks in Rafah and Khan Younis have become more intense. At
      the same time, Israeli commanders continue deliberately to starve the civilian
      population, continuing in some form a blockade on staples they began on March
      2, when they began violating the ceasefire arranged by President Trump, according
      to Amnesty International. The blockade on food and other aid has been only slightly
      adjusted in recent weeks, leaving many people hungry — including children. That’s
      right, Israel is deliberately starving children. The UN Office for the Coordination
      of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated in mid-June that 18,741 children have
      been hospitalized for acute malnutrition since the beginning of the year. And
      mind you, few hospitals are functioning even at a basic level in Gaza, because
      Israeli troops have deliberately destroyed them. The harried doctors and nurses
      who haven’t been assassinated by the Israeli army are trying to deal with those
      injured in the war, and you wonder if they can do much for children with stick-like
      arms and distended bellies. They don’t have food aid to give out, and what food
      there is has become extremely expensive. That is, by the way, typical of famine
      situations, which usually develop not because there is no food at all but because
      people cannot afford what little there is. That is how a million Irish died during
      the Potato Famine in the mid-nineteenth century, when British landlords continued
      to export food from the country. Amnesty quotes Susan Maarouf of the Benevolent
      Friend Patient Hospital in Gaza City: “But this year for us the situation began
      to drastically get worse again in April. Since then, out of approximately 200-250
      children we have screened daily for malnutrition. Nearly 15% showed signs associated
      with severe or moderate malnutrition.” They exhibited signs such as “pale skin,
      falling hair and nails, and alarming weight loss.” There are a million minors
      in Gaza, so we could be talking about 150,000 children with malnutrition, if Maarouf’s
      sample is representative. Please share this story and help us grow our network!

      By Peoples Health Dispatch / Peoples Dispatch


      More than 1 million people in the European Union died from avoidable causes in
      2022, according to new data from a Eurostats report. Of these, over 386,000 deaths
      were attributed to diseases treatable with quality healthcare, while at least
      725,000 could have been prevented through effective public health interventions.


      The conditions cited include heart disease, COVID-19, and several cancers – such
      as colon, breast, and lung cancer – that experts have long said could be more
      effectively addressed with proper investment in screening and treatment. Despite
      these warnings, European authorities continue to slash funding for health and
      care services while committing record sums to military spending.


      Eurostat’s report indicates that Eastern European countries are disproportionately
      affected. Latvia had the highest rate, with 543 preventable deaths per 100,000
      people, followed by Romania, Hungary, and Lithuania: countries where public health
      systems have been severely weakened by fiscal constraints and transition to profit-oriented
      services. In comparison, Sweden and Luxembourg recorded 169 and 180 preventable
      deaths per 100,000, respectively.


      “It is shocking and unacceptable that more than a million people are losing their
      lives every year in the EU to avoidable conditions because our healthcare services
      are not properly funded,” said Esther Lynch, General Secretary of the European
      Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). “It also shows there is absolutely no room to
      reallocate resources from social spending to defense.”


      In response, trade unions have renewed their call to end austerity and ensure
      that the wealthiest contribute fairly to the functioning of public services. “The
      resources exist: even a modest 1% tax on extreme wealth would be sufficient to
      cover staff shortages in health,” stated Jan Willem Goudriaan of the European
      Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU). “Our public services need more investment
      and the wealthiest should pay their fair share in the wake of record corporate
      profits and dividend payouts,” added Lynch.


      A key trade union demand is increased funding for the training and hiring of healthcare
      workers. OECD data shows a current shortage of at least 1.2 million healthcare
      workers in Europe: this figure is likely underestimated, as it is based on minimum
      Universal Health Coverage (UHC) thresholds rather than the actual requirements
      for universal care.


      The staffing crisis is taking a serious toll on both workers and patients, with
      widespread reports of burnout and unsafe conditions, including overcrowded corridors
      and inadequate staffing ratios. “Commercialization and privatization do not solve
      these issues,” Goudriaan said. “We urgently need more public funding to address
      this. ‘Austerity kills’ is not just a slogan – it’s the reality faced daily by
      patients and health professionals.”

      By Kit Klarenberg / The Cradle


      Ever since Israel launched its illegal war of aggression against Iran on 13 June,
      speculation has swirled around the role played by MOSAIC – a tool created by shadowy
      spy-tech firm Palantir.


      This software has been deeply embedded within the International Atomic Energy
      Agency’s (IAEA) operations, particularly its “safeguarding” mission: inspections
      and monitoring state compliance with non-proliferation agreements.


      MOSAIC has been central to this work for a decade and was quietly integrated by
      former US president Barack Obama’s administration into the July 2015 Joint Comprehensive
      Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal with Iran.


      Espionage disguised as oversight


      The deal granted IAEA inspectors unfettered access to Iran’s nuclear facilities
      to confirm the absence of a nuclear weapons program. In the process, the agency
      accumulated an immense trove of data: surveillance imagery, sensor measurements,
      facility documents – all of which were fed into MOSAIC’s predictive system.


      Yet the software’s pivotal role in the deal remained concealed until a Bloomberg
      exposé in May 2018, just days before US President Donald Trump, during his first
      term, unilaterally tore up the agreement and launched Washington’s so-called “maximum
      pressure” campaign against Tehran.


      Despite Trump tearing up the deal, inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities continued,
      as did MOSAIC’s monitoring of Tehran’s nuclear program. As Bloomberg noted, Palantir’s
      technology helped the IAEA scrutinize vast swaths of information from disparate
      sources, including 400 million “digital objects” globally, such as “social media
      feeds and satellite photographs inside Iran” – a capability that “raised concern
      the IAEA may overstep the boundary between nuclear monitoring and intelligence-gathering.”


      The Bloomberg piece also provided fodder for an oft-stated Iranian concern that
      Mosaic was helping Israelis track Iranian scientists for assassination:


      “The tool is at the analytical core of the agency’s new $50 million MOSAIC platform,
      turning databases of classified information into maps that help inspectors visualize
      ties between the people, places and material involved in nuclear activities, IAEA
      documents show.”


      Bloomberg quoted the head of a British company that “advises governments on verification
      issues” on the hazards of false data being fed into MOSAIC, “either by accident
      or design”:


      “You will generate a false return if you add a false assumption into the system
      without making the appropriate qualifier …You’ll end up convincing yourself that
      shadows are real.”


      The underlying and ongoing concern for Tehran is that MOSAIC is heavily influenced
      by Palantir’s “predictive-policing software.” Employed by many law enforcement
      agencies across the western world at enormous expense, this technology is highly
      controversial and has been found to exhibit dangerous, misleading biases, leading
      to erroneous “pre-crime” interventions.


      Indeed, MIT Technology Review has flat-out called for the dismantlement of predictive
      tech in a report that looks at how dangerous the technology has been in analyzing
      even domestic criminal data:


      “Lack of transparency and biased training data mean these tools are not fit for
      purpose. If we can’t fix them, we should ditch them.”


      Given the inclusion of dubious intelligence – such as the Mossad-stolen Iranian
      nuclear archive, openly celebrated by the Israeli agency for its deception – it
      is highly probable that such corrupted data triggered unjustified inspections.
      Bloomberg quoted a negotiator who helped craft the 2015 deal, expressing concern
      over how “dirty or unstructured data” could lead to “a flurry of unnecessary snap
      inspections.”


      Palantir’s software specifically helped the IAEA “plan and justify unscheduled
      probes” – at least 60 of these conducted until US-Israeli strikes put an end to
      inspections.


      Data as a weapon


      On 31 May, the IAEA released a report suggesting Iran may still be developing
      nuclear weapons. Although it presented no new evidence, its dubious charges related
      “to activities dating back decades” at three sites where, purportedly, until the
      early 2000s, “undeclared nuclear material” was handled.


      Its findings prompted the UN nuclear watchdog’s Board of Governors to charge Iran
      as “in breach of its non-proliferation obligations” on 12 June, providing Tel
      Aviv with a propaganda pretext for its illegal attack the next day.


      On 17 June, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi conceded that the agency had “no proof of
      a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon” by Tehran. Still, the damage
      was done. Iranian lawmakers, citing the IAEA’s secret sharing of sensitive data
      with Tel Aviv and Grossi’s covert collusion with Israeli officials, suspended
      all cooperation with the agency.


      This may be the wisest course for other states under IAEA scrutiny. MOSAIC is
      now so entwined with the agency’s daily function that any country targeted for
      regime change could find itself accused of nuclear ambitions based on manufactured
      evidence.


      A 2017 IAEA document reveals MOSAIC is comprised of “over 20 different software
      development projects.” Launched in May 2015, it was hoped to revolutionize “safeguarding”
      the world over.


      The report described MOSAIC as providing inspectors with “a suite of tools with
      which to face the challenges of tomorrow.” For instance, the Electronic Verification
      Package (EVP) enables field data – including planning, reporting, and review –
      to be automatically collected and processed. When inspectors visit a facility,
      they record vast amounts of information – instantly analyzed at headquarters via
      EVP.


      Elsewhere, the Collaborative Analysis Platform (CAP) enables deep cross-referencing
      of internal and open-source data, including overhead imagery. It supports the
      IAEA’s core safeguarding processes: “planning, information collection and analysis,
      verification, and evaluation.”


      CAP gives the IAEA “the capability to search, collect, and integrate multiple
      data and information sources to enable comprehensive analysis.” An IAEA official
      quoted in the document declared the platform represented “a major leap forward
      in analytics” and “a game changer”, allowing the IAEA to collect “a much greater
      amount of information, and also analyze that information in greater depth than
      before.”


      Such analytical capacity grants inspectors “the ability to establish relationships
      between information from multiple sources, across time,” and “make sense out of
      huge amounts of data.”


      CAP also assists in the collection and evaluation of open-source information.
      The document noted the platform could “process much more open-source information
      than the Department currently has capacity for,” and lets staff “search information
      across the entire repository; carefully cross-check different types of information;
      and utilize information in visual formats,” such as “overhead imagery.”


      ‘Extra-budgetary contributions’ from the US government


      All of this intelligence is highly sensitive and would be a treasure trove for
      states intent on military action against nations in the IAEA’s crosshairs. According
      to the 2017 report, inspectors spent 13,248 days in the field in 2015 and inspected
      709 nuclear facilities. Those figures have since grown. All the while, MOSAIC
      – a little-known tool for the “early detection of the misuse of nuclear material
      or technology” – has remained operational.


      The report noted that MOSAIC was financed through the IAEA’s regular budget, the
      Major Capital Investment Fund, and “extra-budgetary contributions.” Its cost at
      the time was around €41 million (approximately $44.15 million) – almost 10 percent
      of the agency’s total annual budget. The source and size of those extra-budgetary
      contributions remain vague, perhaps deliberately, but a Congressional Research
      Service briefing note indicates Washington formally funds the IAEA to the tune
      of over $100 million annually.


      Moreover, the US consistently provides in excess of $90 million in extra-budgetary
      contributions every year. In other words, almost half of the IAEA’s budget flows
      from Stateside, suggesting MOSAIC was created wholly on Washington’s dime.


      The timing of its rollout – two months prior to the Obama administration’s nuclear
      deal being agreed – could further indicate it was explicitly funded with Iran
      in mind. As then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano revealed in March 2018, the
      association’s penetration of Tehran was unprecedented.


      At a press conference, Amano referred to the IAEA’s nuclear “verification regime”
      in Iran as “the world’s most robust.” The organization’s inspectors spent “3,000
      calendar days per year on the ground” in the country, capturing “hundreds of thousands
      of images captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras,” which was
      “about half of the total number of such images that we collect throughout the
      world.”


      In all, “over one million pieces of open source information” were collected by
      the IAEA monthly.


      The IAEA’s fixation on Iran, coupled with suspicions that it provided the names
      of nuclear scientists – later assassinated by Israel – raises the question: Was
      the 2015 deal always an industrial-scale espionage operation designed to prepare
      for war?


      A wave of assassinations of nuclear scientists and IRGC commanders in the early
      stages of Tel Aviv’s failed war on Iran appears to support that conclusion.


      Iranian officials not only suspended cooperation with the IAEA and ordered the
      dismantlement of inspection cameras, but also rejected Grossi’s request to visit
      bombed nuclear sites. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi branded the IAEA chief’s
      insistence on visiting under the pretext of safeguards “meaningless and possibly
      even malign in intent.”


      What is clear is that any state still cooperating with the IAEA must now reckon
      with the possibility that it is not being monitored – it is being mapped for war.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the controversial role of MOSAIC, a software
      developed by Palantir, in the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) monitoring
      of Iran's nuclear program, particularly following Israel's military actions against
      Iran. Initially integrated into the 2015 nuclear deal under the Obama administration,
      MOSAIC has been used to analyze vast amounts of data, including surveillance imagery
      and social media, raising concerns about its potential misuse for espionage rather
      than purely for oversight. Critics argue that the software could lead to unjustified
      inspections and has been implicated in facilitating the tracking of Iranian scientists
      for assassination. The IAEA's reliance on MOSAIC, funded significantly by the
      U.S., has led to fears that its operations may serve as a pretext for military
      action against Iran, prompting Iranian officials to suspend cooperation with the
      agency. The article highlights the implications of using such technology in international
      relations, suggesting that countries under IAEA scrutiny could be at risk of being
      mapped for potential military intervention rather than being monitored for compliance.

      By Vijay Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research


      A decade ago, I was a fly on the wall during a trade negotiation between the United
      States and a small country in Southeast Asia. What interested me was not the substance
      of the negotiation, the deliberations around an issue of minor concern to world
      affairs but of great concern to this one country, but the disproportionality between
      the personnel at the negotiating table.


      The delegation from the United States that arrived at this nondescript office
      in Geneva, Switzerland, was considerable in two respects: first, it had an overabundance
      of lawyers and associates, and second, they came armed with a large number of
      binders that had all the paperwork for their case, replete with labelled page-holders
      so that they could dive directly into the points they needed to make in the discussion.
      The contingent from the Asian country, on the other hand, was sparse: it was made
      up of a lone representative from its United Nations office in Geneva who was neither
      a trade specialist nor a lawyer and who came armed only with a manila folder holding
      a few sheets of paper. The negotiations reflected this unevenness, with the US
      trade representatives running circles around the junior Asian bureaucrat. I went
      to have a coffee with this bureaucrat afterwards. He was rattled. He felt robbed.


      A few years ago, a mid-level official from an East African country told me that
      he had signed a loan agreement with an Asian bank without having the skills to
      understand the loan document or the time to read it from start to finish. Around
      the same time, an official from a ministry in Latin America told me that they
      outsource their analysis of trade documents to a foundation linked to a non-profit
      organisation from the United States. In other words, their negotiations are based
      on the briefs provided by this foundation and not their own analysis and assessment.
      These examples could easily be multiplied, the stories recounted vaguely so as
      not to embarrass colleagues and countries that have been put in very difficult
      circumstances by neocolonial structures.


      It is hard to quantify the impact of such institutional imbalances, largely because
      there is no international agency that collects data on government officials in
      general or on negotiators in particular. Among the sparse data that exists in
      this arena is the World Bank’s Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators Dashboard, which
      shows that roughly 18.6% of the total working population in the Global North is
      employed by the government, while in the Global South that number is closer to
      10%. An International Labour Organisation study on Africa shows us that the numbers
      are much lower in many countries, below 3% in African countries such as Chad,
      Côte d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, and Tanzania. While there is no granular data
      on the number of trade negotiators or trade lawyers in the government, for instance,
      the above is a reasonable picture of the general disparity between the state capacity
      in the North and South.


      The scale of this disparity is incredible (the exceptions are socialist state
      projects, such as China and Vietnam, where government officials remain well trained
      and in larger numbers – making up about a fifth of the workforce in China). Many
      of the reasons for this inequality are obvious, but they are worth listing at
      any rate:


      Most public administration schools in the Global South have seen enormous budget
      cuts induced by the International Monetary Fund’s debt-austerity policies, impacting,
      for instance, the ability to train teachers and create syllabi that are both up
      to date and relevant to the specific national conditions in which these future
      public servants will have to operate. Alongside the austerity measures imposed
      on public administration schools, there has also been a steady closure or contraction
      of state planning commissions and research departments. These are the institutions
      that would normally provide government cadres with an intellectual orientation
      toward their country’s position in the international economy and the immediate
      tasks for a national development programme. The lack of such institutions leaves
      cadres without a clear mandate or direction. There has been an attrition of general
      patriotic and anti-colonial sentiment among government employees who are underpaid
      and undertrained. This psychological warfare brought about by neoliberalism and
      cultural imperialism means that newer generations of public servants are both
      unable to argue the case for the well-being of their people and are prone to inducements
      of different kinds (including corruption). An increased sense of individualism
      among the population has also led to careerism and the accumulation of personal
      wealth and privileges at the expense of national interest. As state-run institutions
      have been closed or shrunk, Western-funded non-governmental organisations have
      emerged to provide ‘technical assistance’. These programmes are often staffed
      by people who are trained in foreign universities, have a class background that
      is not necessarily aligned with the vast majority of the population, and have
      a limited understanding of the historical and sociological developments in their
      country. Moreover, the agendas of these institutions are designed by their foreign
      benefactors who are often driven by their own self-interest.


      The attrition of public administration schools, combined with the lack of political
      will within governments to assert the sovereignty of their societies, has allowed
      the ambitions of multinational corporations and international financial institutions
      to set the direction of these countries. This lack of capacity and political clarity
      has meant that states in the Global South routinely surrender to the well-developed
      agendas of foreign institutions that are often much clearer about what they want.
      The need to build administrative capacities in the Global South goes hand in hand
      with the broader need for a new development theory for the South so that we may
      be able to define our own agenda, against that of the neocolonial interlopers.


      Sitting in that meeting in Geneva some years ago, watching the US officials and
      their lawyers walk circles around the junior Southeast Asian official, I thought
      of Nizar Qabbani’s 1967 poem ‘Footnotes to the Book of the Setback’, written shortly
      after the Palestinians’ defeat in the Six-Day War. The poem, published in Damascus,
      Syria, was subsequently banned and smuggled into countries across the Arab world.
      Two lines from the poem ricocheted around my mind:


      Our enemies did not cross our borders.


      They crept through our weaknesses like ants.


      We must strengthen our weaknesses.

      South, illustrated through personal anecdotes from trade negotiations and loan
      agreements. He emphasizes the institutional weaknesses faced by countries in the
      Global South, stemming from budget cuts to public administration schools and the
      contraction of state planning commissions due to austerity measures imposed by
      international financial institutions. This has resulted in a lack of trained personnel
      capable of effectively representing their nations' interests in international
      negotiations, leading to a reliance on foreign NGOs for technical assistance,
      which often do not align with local needs. Prashad argues that the erosion of
      national sovereignty and capacity allows multinational corporations and foreign
      institutions to dictate terms, underscoring the urgent need for the Global South
      to build administrative capacities and develop a new framework for self-determined
      progress against neocolonial influences.

      By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News


      On Tuesday, July 1, 2025, African Stream published its final video, a defiant
      farewell message. With that, the once-thriving pan-African media outlet confirmed
      it was shutting down for good. Not because it broke the law. Not because it spread
      disinformation or incited violence. But because it told the wrong story, one that
      challenged U.S. power in Africa and resonated too deeply with Black audiences
      around the world. When Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused it of being a
      Kremlin front, Big Tech didn’t hesitate, and within hours, the platform was erased
      from nearly every major social media site.


      In September, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made the call and announced
      an all-out war against the organization, claiming, without evidence, that it was
      a Russian front group. “Russian state-funded media outlet RT secretly runs the
      online platform, African Stream, across a wide range of social media platforms,”
      he said, adding:


      According to the outlet’s website, ‘African Stream is’ – and I quote ‘a pan-African
      digital media organization based exclusively on social media platforms, focused
      on giving a voice to all Africans, both at home and abroad.’ In reality, the only
      voice it gives is to Kremlin propagandists.”


      Within hours, big social media platforms jumped into action. Google, YouTube,
      Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok all deleted African Stream’s accounts, while Twitter
      demonetized the organization.


      AFRICAN STREAM IS CLOSING DOWN




      This is, sadly, a farewell to you, our loyal followers and supporters. Under relentless
      attack, we’ve made the painful decision to shut down African Stream—a platform
      that many of you’ve come to trust and love. This decision was not made lightly.…
      pic.twitter.com/LNRbT00Lkv — African Stream (@african_stream) June 22, 2025


      African Stream attempted to continue, but it finally ceased operations this week.
      MintPress News spoke with the company’s founder and CEO, Ahmed Kaballo, who told
      us that, with just one statement, Washington was able to destroy their entire
      operation, stating:


      We are shutting down because the business has become untenable. After we got attacked
      by Antony Blinken, we really tried to continue, but without a platform on YouTube,
      Instagram, TikTok, and being demonetized on X, it just meant the ability to generate
      income became damn near impossible.”


      The news has disappointed the Nairobi, Kenya-based outlet’s large and rapidly
      growing follower base. At the time of the coordinated operation against it, the
      account boasted almost one million followers on TikTok, almost 880,000 on Instagram,
      and almost half a million on YouTube, reaching 30-40 million people per month.
      Growing from nothing in 2022, it expanded rapidly, offering a pan-African perspective
      on global events, and worked to expose the role of imperialism on the continent.


      African Stream cultivated a large and committed audience among African Americans,
      with celebrities, rappers, and NBA basketball stars regularly sharing their content.
      It was this combination of anti-imperialist messaging and influence with Black
      America that Kaballo believes triggered the State Department smears, explaining
      that:


      We criticized the Republicans and the Democrats. We followed the pan-African tradition
      of Malcolm X, who said that there is no difference between the fox and the wolf,
      you get bitten either way. And because we had so much influence on the Black community
      in the U.S., we were seen to be a threat to the Democratic Party. That’s why we
      feel like it was a partisan attack.”


      Blinken’s attack was not the first African Stream had received. Last June, NBC
      News claimed (without providing examples) that African Stream sought to undermine
      the 2024 elections by spreading disinformation. Then, in August, U.S. government-funded
      media outlet Voice of America wrote that Kaballo’s organization “distorts the
      U.S. military’s mission in Somalia,” insisting that the U.S. is bombing one of
      the continent’s poorest countries to “protect civilians.” Leaked documents also
      show that the British Foreign Office plotted to run a smear campaign against them.


      Kaballo told MintPress that he expected the attacks. “It’s no real surprise,”
      he said. “The surprise was that big tech, with no evidence whatsoever, decided
      to take us down.”


      However, given the extremely close ties between Silicon Valley and the U.S. national
      security state – something that MintPress has consistently reported on – Kaballo
      should perhaps have been more prepared for this outcome.


      Google’s Director of Security and Public Trust, Ben Randa, for example, was formerly
      NATO’s Strategic Planning and Information Officer. Meanwhile, Facebook’s Senior
      Misinformation Policy Manager, Aaron Berman, the individual most responsible for
      determining the platform’s political direction, is a former high-ranking CIA agent.
      Like other platforms, TikTok has also hired dozens of former officials from the
      FBI, CIA, and State Department to oversee its most sensitive internal affairs.


      If Blinken genuinely wanted to unearth a government-sponsored influence operation,
      he would not have to look far. Earlier this year, a funding freeze at the U.S.
      government agency USAID exposed a global network of supposedly “independent” media
      outlets that Washington secretly bankrolled. The scale of this operation was vast:
      more than 6,200 journalists at nearly 1,000 organizations across five continents
      had their salaries secretly paid in whole or in part by the U.S. government.


      While the outlooks of these media groups differed, they all shared one similarity:
      an unwavering commitment to promoting Washington’s interests.


      The pause in funding was keenly felt in Ukraine. Oksana Romanyuk, the director
      of the country’s Institute for Mass Information, lamented that almost 90% of local
      media outlets were funded by USAID, including many with no other source of income.


      In neighboring Belarus, a survey of 20 leading outlets found that 60% of their
      budgets came directly from Washington.


      Following the freeze, anti-government Cuban media were plunged into an existential
      crisis. Miami-based CubaNet, for instance, published an editorial soliciting donations
      from its readers. “We are facing an unexpected challenge: the suspension of key
      funding that sustained part of our work,” they wrote; “If you value our work and
      believe in keeping the truth alive, we ask for your support.”


      In 2024, CubaNet received around half a million dollars from USAID alone. U.S.-backed
      Iranian media, meanwhile, resorted to mass layoffs of their staff.


      The African Stream story highlights the sorry state of global communications,
      where the United States has the power to choke, and even simply delete, media
      outlets that stand for an alternative vision of the world. Washington both funds
      thousands of journalists around the planet to produce pro-U.S. propaganda, and,
      through its close connections to Silicon Valley, has the power to destroy those
      that do not toe the line.


      African Stream is far from the first independent, anti-imperialist news organization
      to have been targeted by Washington. MintPress itself has been repeatedly attacked
      and smeared as a secret Iranian, Chinese, Russian, Syrian, or even Venezuelan
      operation. Our reach on social media has been throttled, and we have been debanked
      by PayPal. Other leading alternative media outlets tell a similar story.


      It is a similar story in Europe, where the region’s support for Israeli actions
      in Palestine has sparked a crackdown on independent journalism. British journalists
      Richard Medhurst and Asa Winstanley have had their homes raided by police, while
      the European Union has sanctioned Hüseyin Dogru for his coverage of pro-Palestine
      protests.


      In what may prove to be their final post, on Tuesday, July 1, African Stream released
      a video of their staff dancing, accompanied by the words:


      It’s tough to accept that we had to shut down over baseless accusations by the
      U.S. government. But instead of bowing out in silence, the team chose to resist,
      just as our ancestors often did, through dance. You can deplatform us. You can
      smear us. But you can’t stop us dancing.”


      On the surface, the overt censorship of a Kenyan media outlet by the U.S. government
      may be a depressing story. Yet Kaballo remained upbeat about the situation, noting
      that the state of radical African media has drastically improved since 2022, with
      many channels taking up a pan-African, anti-imperialist message. “In the next
      few years, hopefully there will be 20 or 30 different versions of African Stream,
      hitting people with high-quality content,” he said.

      By Ben Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report


      The Global South-led organization BRICS continues to expand.


      While the United States and Israel were busy waging war on Iran in June, BRICS
      quietly announced that Vietnam had accepted the group’s invitation to join as
      a partner country.


      With the addition of Vietnam, the extended BRICS+ has 20 members and partners,
      as of July 2025.


      The 10 BRICS members are Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia,
      Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.


      The 10 BRICS partners are Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria,
      Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.


      Together, the BRICS 20 make up 43.93% of the global economy, when their combined
      GDP is measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), according to IMF data.


      The BRICS 20 have a combined population of 4.45 billion, out of a global population
      of 8.01 billion in 2025, based on IMF data.


      This means that BRICS+ represents 55.61% of the world population.


      BRICS was initially founded as BRIC – by Brazil, Russia, India, and China – in
      2009. South Africa joined in 2010, and it became BRICS.


      The Global South-led organization first expanded at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg,
      South Africa in 2023, adding new members.


      At its 2024 summit in Kazan, Russia, BRICS invited a dozen more countries to join
      as “partner states”.


      Since it has expanded, the group has frequently been referred to as BRICS+, although
      there is not a fixed definition of this term, and both names are used.


      Vietnam had been invited to become a BRICS partner at the summit in October 2024,
      but it waited to accept the invitation until June 2025.


      USA fails to divide China and Vietnam: Hanoi maintains non-alignment


      Vietnam’s decision to join BRICS is deeply symbolic, because it reaffirms the
      country’s independent foreign policy and strategic non-alignment.


      BRICS itself shares many commonalities with the Non-Aligned Movement, which was
      founded by anti-colonial Global South leaders who refused to participate in the
      First Cold War.


      In the 21st century, the United States has sought to divide Vietnam from China,
      as part of the Second Cold War that Washington is waging against Beijing.


      The US government plans to reroute supply chains through Vietnam to exclude China,
      in an example of what has been dubbed “friendshoring”.


      Washington has pressured US companies to technologically “decouple” from China,
      to pull their investments out of the country, and to instead relocate to Vietnam.


      This divide-and-conquer policy has been pursued by both the Donald Trump and Joe
      Biden administrations.


      US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager from Wall
      Street, sought to recruit Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, and India to isolate China
      in what Bloomberg described as a “grand encirclement” strategy.


      Vietnam, however, has adamantly resisted US efforts to sabotage its relations
      with China.


      In fact, relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in recent years, following
      the tumultuous decades of the First Cold War and the Sino-Soviet split, when Vietnam
      had leaned much closer to the USSR.


      China is Vietnam’s largest trading partner. The US is the second-biggest.


      Donald Trump’s threat to impose high tariffs on Vietnam, whose economy depends
      a lot on exports to the US market, has only encouraged Hanoi and Beijing to move
      closer together.


      Today, Vietnam promotes non-alignment, based on the policy of the “Four Nos”,
      which the Vietnamese government has defined as follows:


      no partaking in military alliances,


      no siding with one country to act against another,


      no foreign military bases in the Vietnamese territory or using Viet Nam as leverage
      to counteract other countries, and


      no using force or threatening to use force in international relations.


      Despite their geopolitical differences after the Sino-Soviet split, the People’s
      Republic of China and Socialist Republic of Vietnam have very similar political
      and economic systems, especially after both carried out a market reform process.


      China describes its system as a socialist market economy. Vietnam calls its system
      a socialist-oriented market economy.


      The market-socialist models in China and Vietnam have been remarkably successful
      in economically developing, reducing poverty, raising incomes of the working class,
      and moving up the global value chain of industrial manufacturing.

      By DemocracyNow!


      In our July Fourth special broadcast, we revisit our interview with longtime technology
      reporter Karen Hao, author of the new book Empire of AI, which unveils the accruing
      political and economic power of AI companies — especially Sam Altman’s OpenAI.
      Her reporting uncovered the exploitation of workers in Kenya, attempts to take
      massive amounts of freshwater from communities in Chile, along with numerous accounts
      of the technology’s detrimental impact on the environment. “This is an extraordinary
      type of AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental
      harms,” says Hao, in an extended interview.


      Transcript


      This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.


      AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
      I’m Amy Goodman.


      We turn now to the Empire of AI. That’s the name of a new book by the journalist
      Karen Hao, who’s closely reported on the rise of the artificial intelligence industry
      with a focus on Sam Altman’s OpenAI. That’s the company behind ChatGPT. Karen
      Hao compares the actions of the AI industry to those of colonial powers in the
      past. She writes, quote, “The empires of AI are not engaged in the same overt
      violence and brutality that marked this history. But they, too, seize and extract
      precious resources to feed their vision of artificial intelligence: the work of
      artists and writers; the data of countless individuals posting about their experiences
      and observations online; the land, energy, and water required to house and run
      massive data centers and supercomputers,” she writes.


      Karen Hao is a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal and MIT Technology Review,
      where she became the first journalist to profile OpenAI. Democracy Now!’s Juan
      González and I spoke to her in May. I began by asking her to explain what artificial
      intelligence is.


      KAREN HAO: So, AI is a collection of many different technologies, but most people
      were introduced to it through ChatGPT. And what I argue in the book, and what
      the title refers to, Empire of AI, it’s actually a critique of the specific trajectory
      of AI development that led us to ChatGPT and has continued since ChatGPT. And
      that is specifically Silicon Valley’s scale-at-all-costs approach to AI development.


      AI models in modern day, they are trained on data. They need computers to train
      them on that data. But what Silicon Valley did, and what OpenAI did in the last
      few years, is they started blowing up the amount of data and the size of the computers
      that need to do this training. So, we are talking about the full English-language
      internet being fed into these models — books, scientific articles, all of the
      intellectual property that has been created — and also massive supercomputers
      that run tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of computer chips that
      are the size of dozens, maybe hundreds, of football fields and use practically
      the entire energy demands of cities now. So, this is an extraordinary type of
      AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental harms.
      And that is ultimately why I evoke this analogy to empire.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Karen, could you talk some more about not only the energy
      requirements, but the water requirements of these huge data centers that are,
      in essence, the backbone of this widening industry?


      KAREN HAO: Absolutely. I’ll give you two stats on both the energy and the water.
      When talking about the energy demand, McKinsey recently came out with a report
      that said in the next five years, based on the current pace of AI computational
      infrastructure expansion, we would need to put as much energy on the global grid
      as what is consumed by two to six times the energy consumed annually by the state
      of California, and that will mostly be serviced by fossil fuels. We’re already
      seeing reporting of coal plants with their lives being extended. They were supposed
      to retire, but now they cannot, to support this data center development. We are
      seeing methane gas turbines, unlicensed ones, being popped up to service these
      data centers, as well.


      From a freshwater perspective, these data centers need to be trained on freshwater.
      They cannot be trained on any other type of water, because it can corrode the
      equipment, it can lead to bacterial growth. And most of the time, it actually
      taps directly into a public drinking water supply, because that is the infrastructure
      that has been laid to deliver this clean freshwater to different businesses, to
      different homes. And Bloomberg recently had an analysis where they looked at the
      expansion of these data centers around the world, and two-thirds of them are being
      placed in water-scarce areas. So they’re being placed in communities that do not
      have access to freshwater. So, it’s not just the total amount of freshwater that
      we need to be concerned about, but actually the distribution of this infrastructure
      around the world.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And most people are familiar with ChatGPT, the consumer aspect
      of AI, but what about the military aspect of AI, where, in essence, we’re finding
      Silicon Valley companies becoming the next generation of defense contractors?


      KAREN HAO: One of the reasons why OpenAI and many other companies are turning
      to the defense industry is because they have spent an extraordinary amount of
      money in developing these technologies. They’re spending hundreds of billions
      to train these models. And they need to recoup those costs. And there are only
      so many industries and so many places that have that size of a paycheck to pay.
      And so, that’s why we’re seeing a cozying up to the defense industry. We’re also
      seeing Silicon Valley use the U.S. government in their empire-building ambitions.
      You could argue that the U.S. government is also trying to use Silicon Valley,
      vice versa, in their empire-building ambitions.


      But certainly, these technologies are not — they are not designed to be used in
      a sensitive military context. And so, the aggressive push of these companies to
      try and get those defense contracts and integrate their technologies more and
      more into the infrastructure of the military is really alarming.


      AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to the countries you went to, or the stories you covered,
      because, I mean, this is amazing, the depth of your reporting, from Kenya to Uruguay
      to Chile. You were talking about the use of water. And I also want to ask you
      about nuclear power.


      KAREN HAO: Yeah.


      AMY GOODMAN: But in Chile, what is happening there around these data centers and
      the water they would use and the resistance to that?


      KAREN HAO: Yeah. So, Chile has an interesting history in that it’s been under
      — it was under a dictatorship for a very long time. And so, during that time,
      most public resources were privatized, including water. But because of an anomaly,
      there’s one community in the greater Santiago metropolitan region that actually
      still has access to a public freshwater resource that services both that community,
      as well as the rest of the country in emergency situations. That is the exact
      community that Google chose to try to put a data center in. And they proposed
      for their data center to use a thousand times more freshwater than that community
      used annually.


      AMY GOODMAN: And it would be free.


      KAREN HAO: And it — you know, I have no idea. That is a great question. But what
      the community told me was they weren’t even paying taxes for this, because they
      believed, based on reading the documentation, that the taxes that Google was paying
      was, in fact, to where they had registered their offices, their administrative
      offices, not where they were putting down the data center. So they were not seeing
      any benefit from this data center directly to that community, and they were seeing
      no checks placed on the freshwater that this data center would have been allowed
      to extract.


      And so, these activists said, “Wait a minute. Absolutely not. We’re not going
      to allow this data center to come in, unless they give us a legitimate reason
      for why it benefits us.” And so, they started doing boots-on-the-ground activism,
      pushing back, knocking on every single one of their neighbors’ doors, handing
      out flyers to the community, telling them, “This company is taking our freshwater
      resources without giving us anything in return.”


      And so, they escalated so dramatically that it escalated to Google Chile. It escalated
      to Google Mountain View, which, by the way, then sent representatives to Chile
      that only spoke English. But then, it eventually escalated to the Chilean government.
      And the Chilean government now has roundtables where they ask these community
      residents and the company representatives and representatives from the government
      to come together to actually discuss how to make data center development more
      beneficial to the community.


      The activists say the fight is not over. Just because they’ve been invited to
      the table doesn’t mean that everything is suddenly better. They need to stay vigilant.
      They need to continue scrutinizing these projects. But thus far, they’ve been
      able to block this project for four to five years and have gained that seat at
      the table.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how is it that these Western companies, in essence, are exploiting
      labor in the Global South? You go into something called data annotation firms.
      What are those?


      KAREN HAO: Yeah, so, because AI, modern-day AI systems are trained on massive
      amounts of data, and they’re scraped — that’s scraped from the internet, you can’t
      actually pump that data directly into your AI model, because there are a lot of
      things within that data. It’s heavily polluted. It needs to be cleaned. It needs
      to be annotated. So, this is where data annotation firms come in. These are middle-man
      firms that hire contract labor to provide to these AI companies to do that kind
      of data preparation.


      And OpenAI, when it was starting to think about commercializing its products and
      thinking about, “Let’s put text-generation machines that can spew any kind of
      text into the hands of millions of users,” they realized they needed to have some
      kind of content moderation. They needed to develop a filter that would wrap around
      these models and prevent these models from actually spewing racist, hateful and
      harmful speech to users. That would not make a very good, commercially viable
      product.


      And so, they contracted these middle-man firms in Kenya, where the Kenyan workers
      had to read through reams of the worst text on the internet, as well as AI-generated
      text, where OpenAI was prompting its own AI models to imagine the worst text on
      the internet and then telling these Kenyan workers to detail — to categorize them
      in detailed taxonomies of “Is this sexual content? Is this violent content? How
      graphic is that violent content?” in order to teach its filter all the different
      categories of content it had to block.


      And this is an incredibly uncommon form of labor. There are lots of other different
      types of contract labor that they use. But these workers, they’re paid a few bucks
      an hour, if at all. And just like the era of social media, these content moderators
      are left very deeply psychologically traumatized. And ultimately, there is no
      real philosophy behind why these workers are paid a couple bucks an hour and have
      their lives destroyed, and why AI researchers who also contribute to these models
      are paid million-dollar compensation packages simply because they sit in Silicon
      Valley, in OpenAI’s offices. That is the logic of empire, and that harkens back
      to my title, Empire of AI.


      AMY GOODMAN: So, let’s go back to your title, Empire of AI, the subtitle, Dreams
      and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI. So, tell us the story of Sam Altman and
      what OpenAI is all about, right through to the deal he just made in the Gulf,
      when President Trump, Sam Altman and Elon Musk were there.


      KAREN HAO: Altman is very much a product of Silicon Valley. His career was first
      as a founder of a startup, and then as the president of Y Combinator, which is
      one of the most famous startup accelerators in Silicon Valley, and then the CEO
      of OpenAI. And there’s no coincidence that OpenAI ended up introducing the world
      to the scale-at-all-costs approach to AI development, because that is the way
      that Silicon Valley has operated in the entire time that Altman came up in it.


      And so, he is a very strategic person. He is incredibly good at telling stories
      about the future and painting these sweeping visions that investors and employees
      want to be a part of. And so, early on at YC, he identified that AI would be one
      of the trends that could take off. And he was trying to build a portfolio of different
      investments and different initiatives to place himself in the center of various
      different trends, depending on which one took off. He was investing in quantum
      computing, he was investing in nuclear fusion, he was investing in self-driving
      cars, and he was developing a fundamental AI research lab. Ultimately, the AI
      research lab was the ones that started accelerating really quickly, so he makes
      himself the CEO of that company.


      And originally, he started it as a nonprofit to try and position it as a counter
      to for-profit-driven incentives in Silicon Valley. But within one-and-a-half years,
      OpenAI’s executives identified that if they wanted to be the lead in this space,
      they “had to” go for this scale-at-all-costs approach — and “had to” should be
      in quotes. They thought that they had to do this. There are actually many other
      ways to develop AI and to have progress in AI that does not take this approach.


      But once they decided that, they realized the bottleneck was capital. It just
      so happened Sam Altman is a once-in-a-generation fundraising talent. He created
      this new structure, nesting a for-profit arm within the nonprofit, to become this
      fundraising vehicle for the tens of billions, and ultimately hundreds of billions,
      that they needed to pursue the approach that they decided on. And that is how
      we ultimately get to present-day OpenAI, which is one of the most capitalistic
      companies in the history of Silicon Valley, continuing to raise hundreds of billions,
      and, Altman has joked, even trillions, to produce a technology that ultimately
      has a middling economic impact thus far.


      AMY GOODMAN: We’ll return to our conversation in a minute with Karen Hao, author
      of the new book, Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI. Stay
      with us.

      By Ana Vračar / Peoples Dispatch


      With a majority of 385 to 26, British parliamentarians voted on Wednesday to proscribe
      the direct action group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation, moving
      one step closer to criminalizing public support for its campaigns. The move, announced
      by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper after activists threw red paint on two Royal Air
      Force (RAF) planes, has drawn widespread condemnation as an assault on free speech
      and dissent, and has already sparked protests.


      “The British government deciding that Palestine Action should be proscribed as
      a terrorist organization is insanity, but not quite as insane at the continued
      support of Israel, an apartheid and genocidal state,” a Palestine Action activist
      told Peoples Dispatch. But the goal of this decision goes much further than a
      single group. “This is about silencing support of Palestine and silencing support
      of the resistance. Whilst mainstream media and everyone’s focus is on this, Israel
      is still murdering Palestinians daily.”


      Ahead of the vote, a group of UN experts urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration
      to reconsider, warning that the terrorism charges cited by Cooper are misleading
      and risk setting a dangerous precedent. Rather than addressing genuine acts of
      terror, the experts argued, the move will impact individuals exercising their
      rights to free opinion, peaceful assembly, and political participation. “This
      would have a chilling effect on political protest and advocacy generally in relation
      to defending human rights in Palestine,” the experts wrote.


      Attacks on the Palestine solidarity movement intensify


      Solidarity with Palestine has come under intense repression across Europe, especially
      as public opposition to government complicity in the Gaza genocide continues to
      grow louder. Artists who have expressed support on stage, as well as campaigners,
      face legal action. In the UK alone, activists Chris Nineham of Stop the War Coalition
      and Ben Jamal from Palestine Solidarity Campaign are both scheduled to stand trial
      just days after a final decision on the proscription of Palestine Action is expected.
      Activists who took direct action against enterprises complicit in genocide, including
      weapon manufacturers like Rafael, remain imprisoned. At the same time, bands like
      Kneecap and Bob Vylan face frenzied mainstream media backlash for expressing support
      for Palestinian liberation at concerts.


      “The attempt to proscribe Palestine Action as a ‘terrorist’ organization is yet
      another British colonial crime against the Palestinian people and a clear indication
      of British imperialism’s commitment to full complicity and participation in the
      ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and throughout occupied Palestine,”
      the prisoner solidarity network Samidoun said in a statement ahead of Wednesday’s
      vote.


      As the government moves to ban Palestine Action, critics highlight its own continued
      and active role in enabling Israeli war crimes. British authorities have allowed
      Israeli aircraft, including some linked to bombing campaigns in Gaza, to use RAF
      bases, including the site activists targeted with paint. “As the government criminalizes
      those engaged in protesting a genocide, it continues to shamefully facilitate
      the real violence these protestors oppose,” independent MP Jeremy Corbyn told
      Drop Site.


      Corbyn and other independent and former Labour MPs have proposed a formal inquiry
      into Britain’s complicity in the genocide, seeking to review all military, political,
      and economic cooperation with Israel since October 2023. However, few are holding
      their breath for a meaningful change in government policy, especially given ongoing
      industrial and tech ties, such as Elbit Systems’ operations in the UK and Palantir’s
      planned role in the National Health Service.


      “In coming to this decision [proscribing Palestine Action], the government has
      decided that an Israeli arms manufacturer has more rights than a British citizen
      who cannot abide killing and maiming,” the Palestinian Youth Movement wrote. Similarly,
      MP Zarah Sultana stated that Palestine Action’s true crime was shutting down Elbit
      Systems sites that provide supplies to the Israeli military. “Its true offence
      is being audacious enough to expose the blood soaked ties between this government
      and the genocidal Israeli apartheid state and its war machine,” Sultana said.


      Action against genocide as moral duty


      If Palestine Action is officially listed as a terrorist organization, activists
      could face severe prison sentences simply for displaying the group’s merchandise
      or expressing support. Journalists could also be targeted, as staff at Novara
      Media have warned, highlighting the potential for raids on homes and the seizure
      of devices just for reporting factually on the matter.


      The way the vote was orchestrated has also attracted serious criticism. Cooper
      bundled the proscription of Palestine Action with votes on far-right groups, including
      one called “Maniacs Murder Cult.” The move was widely understood as a tactic to
      block MPs from dissenting. In response, Palestine Action warned that MPs should
      be able to see through manipulations like these and oppose them. “All those who
      vote to take away everyone’s freedom of speech today must be held accountable,”
      the group wrote on Wednesday. “Putting us alongside the Maniacs Murder Cult is
      no excuse to vote for proscription.”


      If the motion passes through parliamentary procedure this week as planned, the
      ban could come into effect as early as Saturday. Despite the risk, public support
      for the group remains intact. Protesters have continued to rally in its defense,
      insisting on the legitimacy of direct action in the face of genocide. “Supporting
      a genocide is terrorism, direct action to stop a genocide is the duty of humanity,”
      wrote the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).

      By Sasha Abramsky / Truthout


      At last week’s NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that
      his country would be buying a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S., each one
      capable of carrying a payload of tactical nuclear weapons. It marks the first
      time since shortly after the end of the Cold War that U.S. nuclear weapons capable
      of being dropped from aircraft are to be stationed in the U.K.


      At the NATO summit, a triumphant Trump — who has made skepticism about NATO and,
      at best, ambivalence about its collective defense provisions centerpieces of his
      emergent political ideology over the decades – engaged in one of the most brazen
      displays of shakedown politics in modern history. In exchange for maintaining
      U.S. security commitments, the U.S. president demanded, in the weeks leading up
      to the summit, that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent
      of their GDP on defense and security, more than doubling what most NATO members,
      with the exception of Poland and the Baltic States, currently spend.


      Leaders of the NATO member countries competed with each other over who could fawn
      the most in efforts to gain Trump’s favor, and ultimately almost all of them fell
      into line, agreeing to huge defense spending hikes over the coming decade. Their
      goal is that by 2035 they will be spending at least 3.5 percent of their respective
      GDPs on core military spending, and another 1.5 percent on security and miscellaneous
      other expenditures designed to harden economies and infrastructure against cyberattacks,
      people trafficking, and additional risks and perceived risks to NATO economies.


      The one exception was Spain, the socialist government of which balked at the increased
      spending commitment and received an opt-out, to the chagrin of Trump, who launched
      a blitz of social media posts against the Spanish government and declared that,
      in consequence, Spain would have to pay twice as much in tariffs in any future
      trade deal with the U.S. (This seemingly ignores the fact that Spain is a part
      of the EU and can’t be treated differently from other bloc members in any negotiated
      agreement.)


      NATO leader Mark Rutte, ex-head of the Dutch government, lauded Trump as “Daddy,”
      and praised to the rafters his decision to pre-emptively attack Iran’s nuclear
      facilities. Photos showed him laughing and smiling at every Trump aside, like
      a courtier at the Sun King’s court, a display of quite astounding sycophancy.
      Other NATO leaders followed suit. Cumulatively, The Guardian wrote, it was an
      “orchestrated grovel,” the likes of which hadn’t previously been seen in U.S.
      relations with its allies. This wasn’t a conference of equals; rather it was a
      spectacle in which the U.S.’s strongman demanded — and received — the sort of
      accolades and over-the-top tributes that Soviet general secretaries used to demand
      from satellite state leaders in Eastern Europe, or that emperors of old required
      of conquered vassals.


      Trump’s agenda was pretty straightforward: if Europe and Canada wanted the security
      guarantees that the U.S. has provided since World War II, then they would have
      to pay through the nose for the privilege. This would be manifested through massively
      increasing military spending, reducing domestic safety net spending, and channeling
      hundreds of billions of dollars toward U.S. arms manufacturers.


      The F-35A fighter jets alone will cost the British government over 1 billion pounds,
      and, once refueling planes, which the jets will need to operate far from U.K.
      shores, and other supportive infrastructure are factored in, that cost will rise
      still further. That’s money going straight to Lockheed Martin.


      This same week, the U.K. government has been pushing for massive reductions to
      social safety-net payments for hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities
      — and has, in consequence, faced a huge rebellion from within its own Labour Party
      ranks. And that follows on from an ill-fated effort last year to curtail an energy
      assistance program intended to ensure that Brits, especially pensioners, could
      keep their heating on during the cold winter months.


      Similar trade-offs will, in coming years, be felt throughout NATO. Unlike the
      U.S., which for years has been able to tap international lenders’ willingness
      to fund an American debt spree, most other NATO members simply do not have the
      market clout — or under the rules that bind the EU together, the legal right —
      to borrow on such a massive scale. As a result, much of the increase in military
      spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and
      even pension and health care systems. Germany, for example, is planning to nearly
      double its military spending over the next five years, leaving a hole of tens
      of billions of euros in its budget. Denmark has created an “acceleration fund”
      that will channel an additional $7 billion into military spending over the coming
      two years, representing roughly 1.5 percent of its GDP. France, which has long
      battled with its own budget woes, will likely have to introduce a combination
      of tax hikes and social spending cuts to fund its military build-up. Poland has
      asked the European Commission to shift nearly $7 billion in green projects expenditures
      allotted to Poland into military spending instead. The continental commitments
      to increased military spending likely will result in a further erosion of the
      decades-old European social compact.


      Caught between Putin’s expansionist and imperialistic impulses — as demonstrated
      so brutally in Ukraine and with the increasingly militarist rhetoric coming out
      of the Kremlin — and Trump’s transactional, America First foreign policy, Europe’s
      leaders have decided to embrace the sort of massive ramp-up in military spending
      that so often serves as the prelude to war. No one wants to be caught wrongfooted
      should Putin order his military to breach NATO borders on the East, or NATO airspace
      elsewhere in Europe. No one wants to be the country that Trump steps back from
      defending — as he has, in the past explicitly said he would do, announcing he
      would encourage Putin’s forces to “do whatever the hell they want” — because they
      aren’t meeting the military spending goals that he has laid out. And thus, NATO’s
      member states have ratcheted up military expenditures to a degree that, even a
      couple of months ago, would have seemed to be both implausible and dangerously
      destructive toward Europe and Canada’s social compacts.


      Not all of that money now earmarked for military spending will flow to U.S. defense
      contractors; but given the U.S.’s pre-eminence in the field of high-tech weaponry,
      it’s a sure bet that, at least in the short term, while Europe grapples with how
      to diversify away from an unpredictable and even predatory U.S., an awful lot
      of it will.


      All of this stands to benefit the military-industrial complex mightily. The losers,
      of course, will be those who rely on the social safety net programs that get pushed
      aside in the rush to find funds to boost military spending. But it won’t happen
      without resistance: Stamer’s announcement immediately triggered opposition from
      anti-nuclear groups. During the last years of the Cold War, groups such as the
      Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament engaged in civil disobedience campaigns to pressure
      the government to remove nuclear weapons from the Greenham Common air base. Now,
      the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups have once again begun
      mobilizing for rallies, as early as this weekend, at the Royal Air Force bases
      slated to host the planes and weapons.


      It is, of course, early days. But there are signs that European populaces won’t
      uncritically rally around Trump’s demand for wholesale, breakneck rearmament.
      Of course, Europe and Canada do need to work out ways to protect their interests
      in the face of U.S. retrenchment. But what Trump is demanding is something entirely
      different; he is insisting on a form of tribute imposed via mandated weapons purchases
      — and while Europe’s leaders fawn, it’s not at all clear that their populaces
      will back them up.

    one_sentence_summary: At the 2025 NATO Summit, President Trump pressured member
      countries to significantly increase their military spending in exchange for U.S.
      security commitments, leading to a historic arms deal with the UK and raising
      concerns about the impact on social programs across Europe.
    paragraph_summary: At the NATO Summit 2025 in The Hague, British Prime Minister
      Keir Starmer announced the purchase of a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S.,
      marking the reintroduction of U.S. nuclear-capable aircraft in the U.K. since
      the Cold War. President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of NATO, leveraged
      this summit to demand that member countries significantly increase their military
      spending, aiming for 5% of GDP, which led to widespread agreement among leaders,
      except for Spain, which faced Trump's ire for resisting the increase. The summit
      showcased a stark power dynamic, with NATO leaders displaying extreme deference
      to Trump, reminiscent of historical vassal states, as they committed to massive
      military expenditure increases that could undermine social safety nets across
      Europe. This military buildup, driven by fears of Russian aggression and Trump's
      transactional foreign policy, raises concerns about the erosion of social programs
      and the potential for increased public dissent against such defense spending priorities.

      By Gregory Shupak / Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR)


      Aggression is widely understood as the most serious form of the illegal use of
      force under international law. At the post–World War II Nuremberg Trials, British
      Judge Norman Birkett said:


      To initiate a war of aggression…is not only an international crime; it is the
      supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains
      within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.


      UN General Assembly Resolution 3314 lists seven acts that constitute aggression,
      including:


      The invasion or attack by the armed forces of a state of the territory of another
      State….


      Bombardment by the armed forces of a state against the territory of another state,
      or the use of any weapons by a state against the territory of another state.


      In a clear instance of such aggression, 125 US military aircraft (along with a
      submarine) unleashed 75 weapons against Iran on June 21, including 14 GBU-57 Massive
      Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), each of which weighs 30,000 pounds (BBC, 6/23/25).
      The MOPs are the most powerful non-nuclear weapons in the US arsenal (Democracy
      Now!, 6/23/25).


      ‘Brilliant military operation’


      Rather than condemning this blatant violation of international law, US corporate
      media commentators gushed over what the Boston Globe (6/24/25) called a “brilliant
      military operation.” The Wall Street Journal (6/22/25) gave President Donald Trump
      “credit…for meeting the moment.”


      To the New York Times’ Bret Stephens (6/22/25), Trump made “a courageous and correct
      decision that deserves respect.” “The president acted before it was too late,”
      he wrote. “It is the essence of statesmanship.”


      For the Washington Post’s Max Boot (6/25/25), it’s “good news…that both Israel
      and the United States showed they can bombard Iranian nuclear facilities and other
      targets at will.”


      Rather than toasting aggression, these observers could have used their platforms
      to try to help foster a political climate that prioritizes peace and the international
      legal principles that could help create a less violent world.


      Meanwhile, some opinion mongers thought the US was at risk of insufficiently violating
      international law. The Post’s editorial board (6/22/25) said Trump


      should ensure that Iran’s nuclear program is demolished, as he appeared to claim
      it was on Saturday. This would mean the destruction of the targeted sites plus
      any residual weapons-building capacity.


      In other words, the authors are glad that the US bombed Iran in violation of international
      law, and think it might be best to do more of the same.


      A Journal editorial (6/23/25) put forth a similar view, warning that Trump will
      “squander” any “gains” that the US and Israel may have made against Iran if he
      “lets Iran take a breather, retain any enriched uranium it has secretly stored,
      and then rearm. But the last fortnight creates a rare opportunity for a more peaceful
      Middle East.” I’m not a big Orwell fan, but there’s something to his vision of
      the propaganda slogan “war is peace.”


      Upside-down world


      These celebrations of bomb-dropping occur in an upside-down world, where Iran
      is an aggressor against the United States. One form of this lie is accusing Iran
      of wantonly killing Americans or seeking to do so. The Journal (6/22/25) cited
      “1,000 Americans killed by Iran-supplied roadside bombs and other means”—referring
      to the dubious claim that Iran is responsible for US soldiers killed during the
      illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq (Progressive, 1/7/20). Thus, to the editors,
      “Mr. Trump had to act to stop the threat in front of him to protect America.”


      For Boot (6/22/25), Iran is a “predator” that the United States and Israel “will
      still have to deal with…for years to come.”


      It would be nice to be able to assess the evidence for these allegations, but
      the authors don’t so much as hint at any. What is well documented, though, is
      that the US has been the aggressor in its longrunning war with Iran.


      The US ruling class initiated the conflict by overthrowing Iran’s democratically
      elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 (NPR, 2/7/19), propping up the
      Shah’s torture regime for 26 years (BBC, 6/3/16; AP, 2/6/19), sponsoring the Iraqi
      invasion of Iran and helping Iraq use chemical weapons against Iran (Foreign Policy,
      8/26/13), supporting Israel’s years-long campaign of murdering Iranian scientists
      (Responsible Statecraft, 12/21/20), and asphyxiating Iran’s civilian population
      through economic sanctions (Human Rights Watch, 10/29/19).


      In other words, the US has been prosecuting a war against the Iranian people for
      more than 70 years, and Iran hasn’t done anything remotely comparable to the US,
      but the corporate media pretends that the inverse is true.


      The consent manufacturers went even further, characterizing Iran as a threat to
      the world more generally. The Journal (6/22/25) said “Iran has been waging regional
      and terrorist war for decades,” and that “the world is safer” because the US bombed
      the country. Stephens proclaimed the Iranian government “the world’s leading state
      sponsor of terrorism,” a claim Boot (6/25/25) echoed, writing that the nation
      has a “decades-long track record as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism.” Sickeningly,
      Antony Blinken (New York Times, 6/24/25), a leading architect of the genocide
      of Gaza’s civilian population, called Iran “a leading state sponsor of terrorism;
      a destructive and destabilizing force via its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza,
      Yemen and Iraq.”


      As usual, none of these writers bothered to say which acts of “terrorism” Iran
      has backed, never mind provide proof. Of course, if one wanted to make a serious
      argument that Iran has won the planet’s “state sponsor of terrorism” gold medal,
      then it would be necessary to show how they trumped, say, US support for Al Qaeda
      in Syria. For such a case to be convincing, it would furthermore be necessary
      to assess where bankrolling a genocide ranks in the terror-sponsoring Olympics.


      ‘A grave nuclear threat’


      In the fantasy world where Iran is a grave danger to the US and indeed the world,
      then wrongly implying that it has or is about to have nuclear weapons packs a
      heavier punch. The Journal (6/22/25) said, “President Trump’s decision to strike
      Iran’s three most significant nuclear sites on Saturday helped rid the world of
      a grave nuclear threat.” The editorial would later add, “Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
      wanted a bomb more than peace.”


      Boot (6/25/25) wrote that “preliminary Israeli intelligence assessments [of the
      US bombing of Iran] conclude that the damage to the Iranian nuclear weapons program
      was more extensive—enough to set back the program by several years.” Stephens
      began his piece:


      For decades, a succession of American presidents pledged that they were willing
      to use force to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But it was President
      Trump who, by bombing three of Iran’s key nuclear sites on Sunday morning, was
      willing to demonstrate that those pledges were not hollow and that Tehran could
      not simply tunnel its way to a bomb because no country other than Israel dared
      confront it.


      As FAIR contributor Bryce Greene (6/23/25) recently demonstrated, there is no
      proof that Iran has nuclear weapons or is close to having any. Yet the op-ed pages
      are peppered with insinuations that Iran’s imaginary nukes legitimize the US’s
      aggression against the country.


      A Boston Globe editorial (6/24/25) read:


      After years of insisting it would not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,
      Israel followed through by launching a wide-ranging attack earlier this month,
      assassinating nuclear scientists and military leaders and destroying many sites
      associated with Iran’s decades-long nuclear program. Trump initially stayed on
      the sidelines, until Saturday when US bombers delivered the coup de grâce, destroying—or
      at least heavily damaging—a key underground site that only American bunker-buster
      bombs could reach…. Stopping Iran, whose unofficial national motto is “Death to
      America,’’ from gaining a nuclear weapon has rightly been a US priority for decades.
      Iran’s nuclear program is now damaged but not destroyed.


      What’s missing from this chatter is that, even if we lived in an alternate reality
      where Iran had nuclear weapons or was hours away from having them, attacking them
      on these grounds would not be legitimate. After all, international law does not
      grant states a right to attack each other on a preventive (Conversation, 6/18/25)
      or pre-emptive basis (Conversation, 6/23/25). This crucial point was entirely
      absent in the coverage I’ve discussed.


      Also overlooked are the 90 nuclear warheads that Israel is believed to have, as
      well as the more than 5,200 that the US reportedly possesses, none of which apparently
      constitute “a grave nuclear threat,” even as it’s not Iran but the US and Israel
      that routinely carry out full-scale invasions and occupations of nations in West
      Asia.


      Whether it’s Iran’s supposed support for terrorism or Iran’s nonexistent and non-imminent
      nuclear weapons, the propaganda follows the same formula: make an unsubstantiated
      claim about Iranian malfeasance, and use that as a premise on which to defend
      Washington openly carrying out acts of aggression, perhaps the gravest violation
      of international law.


      If you want the US and Israel to stop killing and immiserating people in Iran,
      remember this pattern and get used to debunking it. Because, last week’s ceasefire
      notwithstanding, the US/Israeli war on Iran isn’t over.

    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques U.S. media and political responses to
      a recent military strike against Iran, arguing that they celebrate aggression
      and violate international law while misrepresenting Iran as the aggressor, despite
      the U.S.'s long history of hostility towards Iran.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the recent U.S. military aggression against
      Iran, highlighting a significant bombing campaign involving 125 aircraft and advanced
      weaponry, which is framed as a blatant violation of international law. It critiques
      the corporate media's portrayal of this action as a "brilliant military operation,"
      praising President Trump's decision while ignoring the historical context of U.S.-Iran
      relations, where the U.S. has been the aggressor for decades. The author argues
      that claims of Iran being a grave threat, particularly regarding nuclear weapons
      and terrorism, lack substantiation and serve to justify U.S. military actions.
      The piece calls for a reevaluation of the narrative surrounding U.S. foreign policy
      and urges readers to challenge the propaganda that supports ongoing aggression

      A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act that may define a Tyrant,
      is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Thomas Jefferson, The Declaration of
      Independence, July 4, 1776


      In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about that has been a
      beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt,
      incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in
      democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your
      voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring. Bruce Springsteen, Land
      of Hope and Dreams Tour


      Manchester, England, May 14, 2025


      In his farewell letter to the American people, President George Washington warned
      about “the impostures of pretended patriotism.” Born on my country’s birthday
      in 1946, I was proud to be an American and blessed to have been born on such a
      special day. You could say that from the very beginning I was truly, as the song
      implies, a Yankee Doodle Dandy and a real live nephew of my Uncle Sam.


      I wasn’t pretending to be a patriot. I was one from the very start. I was the
      real thing, the authentic American: red, white and blue all over. As a young boy,
      I was a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout. I read Boys Life magazine and played second
      base in the Massapequa Little League and dreamed of playing for the New York Yankees
      someday.


      But I also read the Marine Corp guidebook when I was seven, a gift from my Uncle
      Jimmy who had served as a Marine during the Korean War, and I would practice for
      hours standing at attention and saluting in front of the mirror in my room.


      l was inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s, “Ask not what your country can
      do for you, but what you can do for your country” speech in 1961 and couldn’t
      wait to serve my country as the young president had asked us to do. As soon as
      I turned 18, I joined the United States Marine Corps, volunteering for my first
      tour of duty in Vietnam. After a 13-month tour, I decided to set my own example
      of patriotism by returning to Vietnam a second time, willing to risk my life on
      behalf of my country.


      On Jan. 20, 1968, during my second tour of duty I was shot and paralyzed from
      my mid chest down and have been confined to a wheelchair ever since. I received
      several medals during my time in the Marine Corp, including the Purple Heart,
      Bronze Star with Combat V (for valor) and Navy Commendation Medal with Combat
      V.


      After my wounding and a year recuperating with other severely wounded veterans
      at a Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital paraplegic ward in the Bronx, NY, I continued
      to serve my country. Profoundly affected by what I saw in the hospital and my
      own wounding, I joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War organization and became
      deeply committed to peace and nonviolence.


      Inspired by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Gandhi,
      I often opposed my country’s foreign policy decisions. I knew there had to be
      a better way and was arrested numerous times over the years for protesting, remaining
      firmly committed to peaceful, nonviolent change.


      President Washington was speaking to all of us, to the citizens of his time and
      those of us yet to come, he clearly understood how fragile and vulnerable our
      bold new democracy was and how easily it could be taken from us.


      Now, as we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation’s birth and my 80th birthday
      on July 4th, 2026, George Washington’s prophetic farewell letter has come back
      to awaken us all: A cruel and arrogant dictator has arisen in our midst. A convicted
      criminal has arrived in the night, and our democracy is now on life support.


      Fear and intimidation now rule the land. Suddenly and without warning, a brutal
      tyranny has arrived, and the crackdown has begun. Frightening shades of Germany,
      1939: heavily armed guardsmen and Marines now occupy my city.


      Universities and freedom of speech are under attack. Foreign students are being
      dragged from their classrooms. A U.S. senator was brutally manhandled, thrown
      to the floor and handcuffed. Masked agents infiltrate our neighborhoods hunting
      immigrants, grabbing them in front of supermarkets, schools and workplaces, even
      at churches, and their children’s graduation ceremonies.


      Many are afraid to leave their homes, wary that the masked ICE agents will be
      waiting to abduct them and send them to detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz
      located in an alligator and snake infested Florida swamp, among other frightening
      detention centers. No phone call, no due process, no trial. Disappeared, lost,
      forever and forgotten.


      This is America in the spring of 2025, brutal and cruel. I cannot help but sense
      this nightmare is just beginning. Many now hide, frightened of being caught. Migrant
      farmworkers hunted down like frightened animals in the fields of Salinas, ripped
      from their families and disappeared to some awful prison in El Salvador never
      to be seen or heard from again.


      I cannot help but think of Anne Frank and her family hiding in the annex, afraid
      of being rounded up by the Gestapo. I think of what that must have felt like and
      what these poor souls in our country must be going through right now because they
      are afraid of leaving their homes with ICE agents not just arresting “hardened”
      criminals, but grabbing everyone, poor, innocent, human beings.


      The Statue of Liberty weeps tonight. (“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled
      masses yearning to be free!”) The cruel masked government men must make their
      sickening quotas. “My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I cry,
      of thee I weep, of thee I rage.”


      Never have the citizens of this country been so threatened, never before has life
      and liberty been in such peril. Not in the 250 years since our revolution have
      we as a people and a nation been at such a crucial turning point. These are dangerous
      times; a century of arrogance, brutality and aggression have come back to haunt
      us all.


      The mask has been ripped away, the lie has been exposed, and this criminal president
      and administration now stand naked before the world. These are provocative words
      and the truth may be deeply unsettling but when will we speak the truth? When
      will we end this silence? How much longer will we wait until we are ready to finally
      admit that the tyrant now lives in our house? That this government of the people,
      by the people and for the people that we entrusted long ago with the sacred task
      of protecting life and liberty, now, by its every unjust, immoral and illegal
      action now threatens the freedom of us all?


      Have we become so complacent, so cowered and intimidated by this administration
      and president that we have forgotten our own revolutionary birthright of rebellion
      and dissent? Have we become so paralyzed with fear that we would give up our liberty
      and freedom for the promise of a security that does not exist by a government
      and president that now threatens our very freedom?


      What will it take before we realize the true reality of this crisis? How many
      more human beings must suffer before we finally begin to break the silence of
      this shameful night? Let us open up our hearts and speak in a way we have never
      spoken before, knowing that lives now depend on it and the very survival of our
      democracy is now at stake. Let not our silence in this crucial moment betray us
      from our destiny.


      Some additional notes on our American Democracy at the crossroads


      The nation is stunned. The sound of military marching music and beating of drums
      fills the air, whipping the crowd into a frenzy as they obediently pay homage
      to their dear leader — the strongman, the billionaire, the genius, as a million
      frightened voices begin to sing.


      The song is a bit off key, but it doesn’t seem to matter as the Commander in Chief
      in a clown suit beats a happy tyrannical tune, “keep in step, everyone, keep in
      step!” the big boss shouts with glee. “Democracy is dead!” a woman shouts from
      the crowd and is quickly taken away.


      It is almost midnight, and I notice our rights beginning to slip away. The flag
      is now at half-mast as an ancient bugle plays a sad and mournful tune, a dirge
      to a dying nation. “A dream deferred, or does it explode?” someone whispers from
      the crowd holding up a faded photograph of the poet Langston Hughes until they
      are also taken away.


      As the band keeps playing the ghost of Jackson Pollock proudly claims he has been
      commissioned to do a painting for the 250th anniversary of America, 2026. The
      theme of the painting will be, “American democracy at the crossroads.” It is a
      gigantic canvas and the deadline to complete this great work of art is Friday,
      July 4th, 2026.


      Pollock has been working on the painting for nearly a year, but he has a problem.
      After weeks and months of effort, the canvas continues to remain blank. As the
      big day approaches and Pollock’s deadline looms, he throws his hands up in disgust
      and begins throwing paint on to canvas determined to complete his celebration
      of American democracy on time.


      He uses his legendary drip technique. It is an extremely complex piece, layer
      upon layer of paint, wild swirls of reds, whites and blues followed by an almost
      frantic black paint flung violently across the canvas in desperation as if to
      say this is it. This is the best that I can do. The following morning, exhausted
      and near collapse, Pollack finally completes his painting and immediately falls
      asleep on the floor of his South Hampton studio.


      Several hours later, as the bright afternoon sun enters the room, he slowly opens
      his eyes and, to his surprise, the canvas is again completely blank. Pollack is
      heartbroken and feels as if he has failed. Regardless, the 250th Anniversary committee
      accepts the painting where it is prominently displayed on the national mall.


      The critics hail it as a masterpiece while many, including the President and his
      minions, call it a wonderful depiction of our democracy. “Betrayal?” whispers
      a homeless veteran from the crowd as he is quickly whisked away. Never have the
      people of our country been so threatened. Never has our democracy\


      been in such grave danger. A dark shroud covers the land. The flag is drenched
      in blood and sorrow. The founders weep. Fear, confusion, shock, disbelief, a tyrant
      and unholy cabal, dark clouds, 1939, Yorktown, “The world turned upside down.”


      “My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, land of the pilgrim’s pride, land
      where our fathers lied of thee, I sing, let freedom ring, let freedom ring!”


      ——


      A disabled veteran in a wheelchair slowly wheels onto the stage and faces the
      audience. He clears his throat and almost in a whisper that grows in intensity,
      he begins to speak:


      “Two centuries and five decades ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent
      a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men
      are created equal. Now, we are engaged in a great struggle testing whether that
      nation, or any other nation, so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. It
      is all together fitting and proper that we should do this. It is for us, the living
      on this Independence Day 2025, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which
      those who long ago have thus far so nobly advanced and that we here highly resolve
      that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that this government
      of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the Earth.”


      Have hope, my fellow citizens, have confidence and faith. We are on the right
      side of history. A powerful resistance has already begun. We will reclaim our
      country and not abandon it. Millions have already gone to the streets and millions
      more will soon follow. In the spirit of nonviolence, in the spirit of Reverend
      Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, let us go forth
      and march together in growing confidence.


      Let us always seek the moral high ground with dignity and with malice toward none;
      with charity for all, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up
      the nation’s wounds, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting
      peace. Be patient and be not afraid. We are not alone. Remember the democracy
      movement and the courageous Chinese students at Tiananmen Square. Remember the
      brave young man who stood before the tank and refused to move.




      A new nation is awaiting to be born. Have no doubt about it, these are extraordinary
      times. Mandela in South Africa. Václav Havel in the Prague Spring. Rosa Parks
      in Montgomery. King and James Bevel at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. These
      are people and movements who all participated in successful struggles against
      the darkest nights.


      As the late Congressman Allard Lowenstein once said, it is better to reclaim the
      country than abandon it. This is our moment in history. This is our opportunity
      to make history and not shirk from it.


      For my country and its people, happy birthday.

      An analysis released Thursday estimates that the Republican legislation on the
      brink of final passage in Congress would deliver over $1 trillion in combined
      tax breaks to the richest 1% of Americans over the next decade—an amount roughly
      equal to the bill’s unprecedented cuts to Medicaid.


      The new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), which
      utilizes data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and other sources,
      finds that the “tiny sliver of affluent families” in the top 1% of the U.S. income
      distribution will “receive tax cuts totaling $1.02 trillion over the next decade.”


      The centerpiece of Trump''s megabill is a trillion-dollar tax cut to the wealthy,
      paid for by increasing the national debt and cutting public services. pic.twitter.com/ISr2XuIdJQ
      — ITEP (@iteptweets) July 3, 2025


      ITEP has previously shown that the Republican bill’s tax cuts—largely extensions
      of expiring provisions of the 2017 Trump-GOP tax law—would be highly skewed to
      the wealthy, with the small percentage of households at the very top receiving
      significantly more in total tax breaks than middle- and lower-income Americans.


      “Sixty-nine percent of the net tax cuts would go to the richest fifth of Americans
      in 2026, only 11% would go to the middle fifth of Americans, and less than 1%
      would go to the poorest fifth,” the group found. “The $107 billion in net tax
      cuts going to the richest 1% next year would exceed the amount going to the entire
      bottom 60% of taxpayers.”


      ITEP’s new analysis was released as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.)
      wrapped up a record-breaking, eight-hour-plus speech against the GOP legislation,
      which delayed a final vote on the measure. Republicans are expected to pass the
      unpopular bill on Thursday.

      In his first live broadcast interview since being released from ICE detention,
      Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil tells Democracy Now! about his experience
      behind bars, the ongoing threat of deportation that hangs over him and why he
      continues to speak out against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza. The Columbia
      University graduate was the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed
      by the Trump administration. Khalil is now reunited with his wife Noor and newborn
      son Deen, after he was released on bail last month by a federal judge. Khalil
      says the Trump administration’s attempts to silence him are “a distraction from
      the genocide in Palestine.” Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not
      be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org,
      The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. Officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks
      have killed over 300 Palestinians over the past 48 hours. One strike on the home
      of the renowned cardiologist Marwan al-Sultan at Indonesian Hospital killed the
      doctor, along with his mother, sister and aunt. He’s at least the 70th healthcare
      worker killed by Israel in the past 50 days. This comes as Palestinians say at
      least 33 people were slaughtered today as they lined up for aid at militarized
      aid distribution sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation. The reportedly unprovoked killings came as the Associated Press published
      recent video showing U.S. contractors at GHF sites firing live ammunition and
      stun grenades at starving Palestinians as they scrambled for food. The AP says
      it received the footage from two U.S. contractors who wish to remain anonymous
      in order to blow the whistle on abuses. The contractors report security staffers
      were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed, and seemed to have an open license
      to do whatever they wished. In this clip published by the AP, contractors erupt
      in cheers as shots ring out. JULIA FRANKEL: At that moment, bursts of gunfire
      erupt close by, at least 15 shots. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1: I think you hit one. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1:
      Hell, yeah, boy! AMY GOODMAN: This comes as the Trump administration continues
      its crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators, especially at universities across
      the United States. In a moment, we’ll be joined by the first pro-Palestinian campus
      protester to be jailed by the Trump administration: Columbia University graduate
      and Palestinian student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil. Video shows his arrest
      on March 8th, when he was detained by plainclothes officers who did not identify
      themselves. The video was filmed by his eight-month-pregnant wife, Noor Abdalla,
      whose voice you’re hearing in this clip. DR. NOOR ABDALLA: Can you — can you please
      specify what agency is taking him, please? Excuse me. They’re — nobody — they’re
      not talking to me. I don’t know. Excuse me, the lawyer would like to speak to
      somebody. Oh my god, they’re literally running away from me. AMY GOODMAN: That
      was March. Mahmoud Khalil has now reunited with his wife and newborn son, after
      he was released on bail less than two weeks ago by a federal judge following over
      100 days in a Louisiana ICE jail. Khalil spoke outside the jail in Jena, Louisiana,
      when he was freed. MAHMOUD KHALIL: No one is illegal. No human is illegal. That’s
      the message. The message is: Justice will prevail, no matter what this administration
      may try to portray. AMY GOODMAN: Two weeks ago, on Saturday, Democracy Now! was
      at Newark Airport when Mahmoud Khalil was reunited with his wife and his son.
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I just want to go back and just continue the work that I was already
      doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated
      rather than punished, as this administration wants to do. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud
      Khalil was standing next to the New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
      On Sunday, the following day, the Palestinian student leader, now graduate of
      Columbia University, stood next to his wife, Noor Abdalla, and addressed over
      a thousand supporters, as well as the press, on the Upper West Side outside the
      Cathedral of St. John the Divine here in Manhattan, blocks from his campus of
      Columbia University. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I would like to salute the courage of all
      the students at Columbia and across the nation, these students who continue to
      protest. I want to honor especially my friends at Columbia University, especially
      those who are currently battling expulsion and suspension for their consciousness
      stand. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil is lawful permanent resident green card holder
      who has not been charged with any crimes, yet he was held in a Jena, Louisiana, ICE jail
      for 104 days. This all comes amidst growing calls for Israel to be held accountable
      for alleged war crimes in Gaza, including attacks on hospitals. Mahmoud Khalil
      joins us now for his first live global broadcast since his release. Mahmoud, welcome
      to Democracy Now! MAHMOUD KHALIL: Thanks, Amy. Thanks for having me. AMY GOODMAN:
      So, I want to start with the same question I asked you at the airport: How does
      it feel to be free? MAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, absolutely, it goes without saying,
      it feels — it feels good just to be reunited with the family and with my baby
      son. But at the same time, it feels difficult watching the Palestinian people,
      like, massacred, being massacred right now in Gaza. And this really adds more
      responsibility on me to continue advocating for the rights of the Palestinians.
      And this is what we should focus on right now, because my freedom is nothing compared
      to the suffering that the Palestinian people are going through right now in Palestine.
      And this is what the message should be, that whether it’s my arrest, whether the
      focus right now on immigration, it’s just like a distraction of what’s really
      happening in Palestine, that this administration is investing and funding war
      crimes in Gaza, that this administration is unconditionally supporting Israel,
      whether politically or militarily. This is what we should focus on rather than
      individual cases, I believe. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, I’m wondering if you can take
      us back to March 8th, that day when you were taken by Homeland Security or federal
      agents. I don’t even know — at this point, do you know who it is that you were
      taken by? And what happened on that day, where you were? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      so, the Trump administration basically illegally ripped me away from my family,
      because they are simply trying to silence anyone speaking out against Israel atrocities
      against the Palestinians. The officers or the agents who kidnapped me did not
      introduce themselves. They said at first it’s police, then DHS, without giving
      any details, without even presenting an arrest warrant, which is the most basic
      thing that any law enforcement — any law enforcement should do in a country that
      proclaims justice and due process, which unfortunately did not happen. So, they
      basically kidnapped me and, for more than 30 hours, kept moving me from one place
      to another, literally moving me more than 1,400 miles across the country. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can I ask you something? One of the men who abducted you in your Columbia University
      housing, is it true that he was the Homeland Security agent who was honored by
      President Trump in his first term in office, Elvin Hernandez? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      To be honest, I don’t have concrete information about that. It has been only two
      weeks since my release. I — AMY GOODMAN: And you didn’t know at the time who he
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Inside, I didn’t have access to internet. AMY GOODMAN: You didn’t
      know at the time who these men were. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I didn’t. AMY GOODMAN: So,
      I mean — MAHMOUD KHALIL: No, no, I didn’t. Like, to be honest, the story that
      the government presented was once over — one time over another changed to sort
      of serve their part of the story. At the beginning, they said, “Well, we had an
      arrest warrant, and we arrested Mahmoud outside of Columbia, of his Columbia residence.”
      But then, when we presented the video evidence, they said, “Oh, he tried to flee.”
      So, these agents are trained to lie, are trained to just instigate violence with
      those who they are seeking to detain. AMY GOODMAN: So, we have played over and
      over the video of your wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, on the phone with the lawyer, desperately
      trying to figure out what was happening and where you were being taken. In fact,
      can you talk about when you had emailed the president of Columbia University,
      Dr. Armstrong at the time, because you were so concerned about what was happening
      to you? You wanted some kind of protection. MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. I mean, ICE, ICE acts
      as Trump’s militia arm. That’s the way that now they are functioning. And we can
      see this evident not only in my case, in just like cases across the country. In
      the weeks leading up to my arrest, I noticed a more vicious, coordinated smear
      campaign against me online, the same — the same accounts mentioning Rubio, the
      White House, mentioning also, like, just baseless claims about Mahmoud Khalil,
      who he is, like an international student, a Hamas agent and all these labels.
      So, I felt that since I didn’t have any legal, at that point, representation,
      I wanted, like, Columbia first to protect me, because these actors are Columbia
      students and faculty, the ones who were waging this smear campaign against me
      online and calling for the administration to deport me. So, this is the minimum
      that Columbia should have done, is to protect the students against these hostile
      actors. So, and that was not — I mean, I sent the email the morning of my arrest,
      I believe. And this was not the first email that we sent to Columbia and no answer.
      Unfortunately, Columbia did not and does not, until now, treat all students as
      equal. What they care about is basically money and protecting their brand, rather
      than going and listening to their students, protecting their students with their
      legitimate concerns, not to have any special treatment for the Palestinian or
      the students supporting Palestine on campus. AMY GOODMAN: I’m wondering if Columbia
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: But Columbia failed to do that. AMY GOODMAN: Did Columbia University
      support you in any way? I remember in the case of Rümeysa Öztürk, who is the Tufts
      Fulbright scholar and graduate student also abducted by federal agents, Tufts
      wrote a statement of support. And then Suri Khan, the Dr. Suri Khan at Georgetown,
      Georgetown also spoke out. What about Columbia University on your behalf? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      Columbia did not offer any sort of support when it comes to the legal case. And
      this is shameful on a university that claims to support international students
      and to support the right of freedom of speech. But this was not surprising. Columbia
      has capitulated to the Trump administration, but before then, they capitulated
      to the Zionist donors and politicians in this country. So, to see them not offer
      this kind of support absolutely was not surprising, unfortunately. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can you talk about your time in the Jena ICE jail? You were held for over a hundred
      days there. Can you talk about the other prisoners, the conditions under which
      you were held? And then I want to get to the day your baby, your baby Deen, was
      born without you there. But talk about the jail until that point. MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      So, in jail, you spend 24/7 with the same people. So, one of the things that we
      do is to just share stories from people from around the ward. And every day it’s
      just a more heartbreaking story than another, with people being snatched off the
      street or during their court hearings or ICE check-ins, where these people, like,
      they were trying to fix their documentation. They committed no crimes whatsoever.
      So, you have this shock with everyone who’s coming in around why they are there.
      I shared a dorm with over 70 men, and the stories are really heartbreaking, Amy,
      with people leaving their family outside without any kind of support, people who
      don’t have their rights — don’t know their rights, don’t know if they have any
      rights, in fact. And with ICE, who basically don’t tell anyone what their rights
      are and just deport people, I’ve seen people who unknowingly sign their deportation
      documents because ICE agents tricked them into doing so, which is a blatant violation
      of any rule of law or due process. And just, like, to say that, like, the conditions
      inside were horrible. The food was horrible, the sleep quality equally bad, and
      just the atmosphere, where you are inside, you don’t know what’s happening, and
      you’re just expecting to follow orders and wait for an ICE officer to come and
      update you on your case. Unfortunately, a lot of these detainees don’t have legal
      representation. And I was very privileged to have an amazing legal team fighting
      on my behalf. And that took us three months for me to be released, despite me
      being a legal resident in the United States. So, imagine for a lot of these individuals
      who don’t have this kind of representation and who have, like, more complications
      in their documentation. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, can you talk about the day of Deen’s
      birth, your firstborn son? How did you learn that Noor had given birth? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      That days was absolutely one of the most difficult days that I had to endure in
      my life, being away from my wife and not having the opportunity to support her
      during this moment. And I was over the phone, so I would call every hour just
      to see, like, if Noor is in labor, yeah or no. And the moment of the delivery,
      I spent like over three hours over the phone, from 1:00 — I think 1:30 in the
      morning until 4:00 or 4:30, just, like, trying to support Noor as much as I could,
      because I did not want to miss that moment at all. And what made it very difficult
      is because, like, this could have been easily avoided, were the Trump administration
      to follow the law, or at least, like, to offer me furlough, like, to go and be
      with my family for a few hours. But they refused that, because this administration
      thrives on cruelty and thrives on separation and family separation. So that was
      not surprising. AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the moment when you met Deen
      for the first time? I mean, as you describe it now, you really were with Noor
      then. Of course, you were separate, but you were there. Over the phone, you heard
      his first cries. But talk about holding him for the first time. I remember — I
      mean, it was just weeks ago. Why it was that your lawyers had to fight, a battery
      of lawyers, for so many hours for Noor and Deen, for you to be able to have a
      contact visit? I mean, you have not been charged with a crime. But in the jail
      — is that right — where it was, in Jena, Louisiana? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. As you
      said, I mean, it shouldn’t take an army of lawyers to get a one-hour contact visit
      to let me hold my son. The first time I saw my son was, in fact, through glass.
      So, he was literally in front of me, but separated by glass. I couldn’t hold him
      during the first time I saw him, which made me very, very angry about, like, a
      one-centimeter or one-inch glass separating me from holding my son. And this is
      all by design, the cruelty of this administration, because their goal is to punish
      me as much as they could and in any way that they find, because what they want
      is they want to break me. They want to make an example out of me. So, the first
      time when we managed to get a court order, in fact — imagine getting a court order
      to force ICE to let me hold my son. And we had it for literally an hour, 7:00
      in the morning. So, even when they agreed to do that — or, not agreed — even when
      they were forced to allow me to hold my son, they chose to make it at 7:00 in
      the morning in detention. So, I mean, the feeling, I don’t think I can describe
      it. I was both very happy, but at the same time very angry and sad that it took
      us all this effort to have this one hour in detention. And basically, I was really
      anxious. I was just looking at the clock, when this hour would end. I just didn’t
      want this hour to end. And the hour was the fastest hour in my life, just like
      — you know, like, it went like this. AMY GOODMAN: And so — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      Amy. AMY GOODMAN: You were released less than two weeks ago, and now you are living
      at home with your wife and your infant son. Do you feel safe? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      I don’t fully feel safe, to be honest, Amy. We all know the rhetoric that’s currently
      going around in this country, the Islamophobia, the anti-Palestinian bigotry and
      racism, and this violence that was exported by Israel to this country. I’m being
      targeted by Israeli government-affiliated groups here in the U.S. who are very
      dangerous, who would do anything to silence Palestinians, because, for them, silencing
      is much more easier than dealing with the argument, because they have no argument
      about what they are doing in Palestine. And this is why they want to shut off
      the — shut down the conversation any way they can do, even if this would mean
      hurting or harming me and my family. And it’s a huge concern. But it’s a price
      that I need to accept for advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people,
      because, once again, this is all just a distraction from the genocide in Palestine.
      And these attempts to silence me are just one way for them to attack us and to
      cut — just not to let the public know about what Israel is doing and how the U.S.
      is complicit in this genocide. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, you led a march from
      the steps of St. John the Divine up to Columbia University, wearing a Palestinian
      flag as a kind of cape, with a thousand supporters there, and you were one of
      the leaders of the encampment at Columbia that led to so many protests and encampments
      around the country on university campuses. Many of the protesters were Jewish.
      Many of the supporters for you who would march when you were detained were Jewish.
      I was wondering: What did that level of Jewish support mean to you here in the
      United States? MAHMOUD KHALIL: First of all, just a correction: The student movement
      at Columbia doesn’t have leaders. I believe all the students equally contribute
      to the movement. And it’s being mobilized by a large number of students, hundreds
      of students at Columbia University. But going back to your question, Amy, I mean,
      Jewish students are an integral part of the student movement, whether at Columbia
      or in the United States. And this is very, very important, because these Jewish
      students, they show the world that what Israel is doing is not in their name,
      is not in the name of Jewish safety, which is very important. And these, also,
      Jewish students are acting upon their values, of protecting the — protecting the
      weak or supporting justice. So, it’s really — to us, it’s very important. This
      shows that the Palestinian cause goes beyond Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims. It’s
      a universal cause for justice, for freedom and for human rights. AMY GOODMAN:
      And finally, Mahmoud, as you are free now here in New York, you still face deportation?
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I do. I mean, now I’m out on bail, which means that the court
      proceedings can continue while I am out. So, I’m still facing deportation. However,
      a judge, a federal judge, ruled that the Rubio determination on what Rubio did
      to me is likely unconstitutional, and that’s why he ordered my release on bail.
      So I’m confident that we will prevail in court, that this administration attempts
      to silence us wouldn’t succeed, and now that I will seek accountability. I will
      seek accountability from this administration, from the individuals and actors
      who contributed to my arrest, and now exploring these options with my lawyer,
      because in the first place, what I was protesting, I was protesting for accountability,
      to hold Columbia and the U.S. government accountable for their complicity in war
      crimes and genocide against the Palestinians. And I will continue to do so, because
      what happened to me shouldn’t have happened in the first place. I shouldn’t have
      been prosecuted simply for my freedom of speech, simply for speaking up for Palestinian
      rights. And those who have contributed to that in any way should be held accountable.
      AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, thanks so much for joining us, Columbia University
      graduate, Palestinian student activist, detained by ICE March 8th and held for
      104 days at the ICE jail in Jena, Louisiana. During that time, his wife, Dr. Noor
      Abdalla, gave birth to their first child, Deen. Mahmoud was released June 20th.
      You can see him coming to Newark Airport and the next day’s event in front of
      St. John the Divine with a thousand people greeting him at democracynow.org ,
      as well as our interview with Mohsen Mahdawi, who also graduated from Columbia

    one_sentence_summary: Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, recently released from
      ICE detention, discusses his experiences and the ongoing threat of deportation
      while advocating against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza in his first live
      interview since his release.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent interview with Democracy Now!, Palestinian activist
      Mahmoud Khalil, who was released from ICE detention, shared his harrowing experiences
      behind bars and the ongoing threat of deportation he faces. Khalil, a Columbia
      University graduate and the first pro-Palestinian campus protester jailed under
      the Trump administration, emphasized his commitment to speaking out against the
      U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza, which he believes is being obscured by attempts
      to silence him. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza remains dire, with officials
      reporting over 300 Palestinian deaths due to Israeli attacks in just 48 hours,
      including the killing of healthcare workers and civilians seeking aid. Recent
      footage has emerged showing U.S. contractors at aid distribution sites using live
      ammunition against desperate Palestinians, highlighting the severe humanitarian
      crisis exacerbated by the conflict.

      In his first live broadcast interview since being released from ICE detention,
      Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil tells Democracy Now! about his experience
      behind bars, the ongoing threat of deportation that hangs over him and why he
      continues to speak out against the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza. The Columbia
      University graduate was the first pro-Palestinian campus protester to be jailed
      by the Trump administration. Khalil is now reunited with his wife Noor and newborn
      son Deen, after he was released on bail last month by a federal judge. Khalil
      says the Trump administration’s attempts to silence him are “a distraction from
      the genocide in Palestine.” Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not
      be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org,
      The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. Officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks
      have killed over 300 Palestinians over the past 48 hours. One strike on the home
      of the renowned cardiologist Marwan al-Sultan at Indonesian Hospital killed the
      doctor, along with his mother, sister and aunt. He’s at least the 70th healthcare
      worker killed by Israel in the past 50 days. This comes as Palestinians say at
      least 33 people were slaughtered today as they lined up for aid at militarized
      aid distribution sites run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed so-called Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation. The reportedly unprovoked killings came as the Associated Press published
      recent video showing U.S. contractors at GHF sites firing live ammunition and
      stun grenades at starving Palestinians as they scrambled for food. The AP says
      it received the footage from two U.S. contractors who wish to remain anonymous
      in order to blow the whistle on abuses. The contractors report security staffers
      were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed, and seemed to have an open license
      to do whatever they wished. In this clip published by the AP, contractors erupt
      in cheers as shots ring out. JULIA FRANKEL: At that moment, bursts of gunfire
      erupt close by, at least 15 shots. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1: I think you hit one. U.S. CONTRACTOR 1:
      Hell, yeah, boy! AMY GOODMAN: This comes as the Trump administration continues
      its crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrators, especially at universities across
      the United States. In a moment, we’ll be joined by the first pro-Palestinian campus
      protester to be jailed by the Trump administration: Columbia University graduate
      and Palestinian student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil. Video shows his arrest
      on March 8th, when he was detained by plainclothes officers who did not identify
      themselves. The video was filmed by his eight-month-pregnant wife, Noor Abdalla,
      whose voice you’re hearing in this clip. DR. NOOR ABDALLA: Can you — can you please
      specify what agency is taking him, please? Excuse me. They’re — nobody — they’re
      not talking to me. I don’t know. Excuse me, the lawyer would like to speak to
      somebody. Oh my god, they’re literally running away from me. AMY GOODMAN: That
      was March. Mahmoud Khalil has now reunited with his wife and newborn son, after
      he was released on bail less than two weeks ago by a federal judge following over
      100 days in a Louisiana ICE jail. Khalil spoke outside the jail in Jena, Louisiana,
      when he was freed. MAHMOUD KHALIL: No one is illegal. No human is illegal. That’s
      the message. The message is: Justice will prevail, no matter what this administration
      may try to portray. AMY GOODMAN: Two weeks ago, on Saturday, Democracy Now! was
      at Newark Airport when Mahmoud Khalil was reunited with his wife and his son.
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I just want to go back and just continue the work that I was already
      doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated
      rather than punished, as this administration wants to do. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud
      Khalil was standing next to the New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
      On Sunday, the following day, the Palestinian student leader, now graduate of
      Columbia University, stood next to his wife, Noor Abdalla, and addressed over
      a thousand supporters, as well as the press, on the Upper West Side outside the
      Cathedral of St. John the Divine here in Manhattan, blocks from his campus of
      Columbia University. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I would like to salute the courage of all
      the students at Columbia and across the nation, these students who continue to
      protest. I want to honor especially my friends at Columbia University, especially
      those who are currently battling expulsion and suspension for their consciousness
      stand. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil is lawful permanent resident green card holder
      who has not been charged with any crimes, yet he was held in a Jena, Louisiana, ICE jail
      for 104 days. This all comes amidst growing calls for Israel to be held accountable
      for alleged war crimes in Gaza, including attacks on hospitals. Mahmoud Khalil
      joins us now for his first live global broadcast since his release. Mahmoud, welcome
      to Democracy Now! MAHMOUD KHALIL: Thanks, Amy. Thanks for having me. AMY GOODMAN:
      So, I want to start with the same question I asked you at the airport: How does
      it feel to be free? MAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, absolutely, it goes without saying,
      it feels — it feels good just to be reunited with the family and with my baby
      son. But at the same time, it feels difficult watching the Palestinian people,
      like, massacred, being massacred right now in Gaza. And this really adds more
      responsibility on me to continue advocating for the rights of the Palestinians.
      And this is what we should focus on right now, because my freedom is nothing compared
      to the suffering that the Palestinian people are going through right now in Palestine.
      And this is what the message should be, that whether it’s my arrest, whether the
      focus right now on immigration, it’s just like a distraction of what’s really
      happening in Palestine, that this administration is investing and funding war
      crimes in Gaza, that this administration is unconditionally supporting Israel,
      whether politically or militarily. This is what we should focus on rather than
      individual cases, I believe. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, I’m wondering if you can take
      us back to March 8th, that day when you were taken by Homeland Security or federal
      agents. I don’t even know — at this point, do you know who it is that you were
      taken by? And what happened on that day, where you were? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      so, the Trump administration basically illegally ripped me away from my family,
      because they are simply trying to silence anyone speaking out against Israel atrocities
      against the Palestinians. The officers or the agents who kidnapped me did not
      introduce themselves. They said at first it’s police, then DHS, without giving
      any details, without even presenting an arrest warrant, which is the most basic
      thing that any law enforcement — any law enforcement should do in a country that
      proclaims justice and due process, which unfortunately did not happen. So, they
      basically kidnapped me and, for more than 30 hours, kept moving me from one place
      to another, literally moving me more than 1,400 miles across the country. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can I ask you something? One of the men who abducted you in your Columbia University
      housing, is it true that he was the Homeland Security agent who was honored by
      President Trump in his first term in office, Elvin Hernandez? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      To be honest, I don’t have concrete information about that. It has been only two
      weeks since my release. I — AMY GOODMAN: And you didn’t know at the time who he
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Inside, I didn’t have access to internet. AMY GOODMAN: You didn’t
      know at the time who these men were. MAHMOUD KHALIL: I didn’t. AMY GOODMAN: So,
      I mean — MAHMOUD KHALIL: No, no, I didn’t. Like, to be honest, the story that
      the government presented was once over — one time over another changed to sort
      of serve their part of the story. At the beginning, they said, “Well, we had an
      arrest warrant, and we arrested Mahmoud outside of Columbia, of his Columbia residence.”
      But then, when we presented the video evidence, they said, “Oh, he tried to flee.”
      So, these agents are trained to lie, are trained to just instigate violence with
      those who they are seeking to detain. AMY GOODMAN: So, we have played over and
      over the video of your wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, on the phone with the lawyer, desperately
      trying to figure out what was happening and where you were being taken. In fact,
      can you talk about when you had emailed the president of Columbia University,
      Dr. Armstrong at the time, because you were so concerned about what was happening
      to you? You wanted some kind of protection. MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. I mean, ICE, ICE acts
      as Trump’s militia arm. That’s the way that now they are functioning. And we can
      see this evident not only in my case, in just like cases across the country. In
      the weeks leading up to my arrest, I noticed a more vicious, coordinated smear
      campaign against me online, the same — the same accounts mentioning Rubio, the
      White House, mentioning also, like, just baseless claims about Mahmoud Khalil,
      who he is, like an international student, a Hamas agent and all these labels.
      So, I felt that since I didn’t have any legal, at that point, representation,
      I wanted, like, Columbia first to protect me, because these actors are Columbia
      students and faculty, the ones who were waging this smear campaign against me
      online and calling for the administration to deport me. So, this is the minimum
      that Columbia should have done, is to protect the students against these hostile
      actors. So, and that was not — I mean, I sent the email the morning of my arrest,
      I believe. And this was not the first email that we sent to Columbia and no answer.
      Unfortunately, Columbia did not and does not, until now, treat all students as
      equal. What they care about is basically money and protecting their brand, rather
      than going and listening to their students, protecting their students with their
      legitimate concerns, not to have any special treatment for the Palestinian or
      the students supporting Palestine on campus. AMY GOODMAN: I’m wondering if Columbia
      — MAHMOUD KHALIL: But Columbia failed to do that. AMY GOODMAN: Did Columbia University
      support you in any way? I remember in the case of Rümeysa Öztürk, who is the Tufts
      Fulbright scholar and graduate student also abducted by federal agents, Tufts
      wrote a statement of support. And then Suri Khan, the Dr. Suri Khan at Georgetown,
      Georgetown also spoke out. What about Columbia University on your behalf? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      Columbia did not offer any sort of support when it comes to the legal case. And
      this is shameful on a university that claims to support international students
      and to support the right of freedom of speech. But this was not surprising. Columbia
      has capitulated to the Trump administration, but before then, they capitulated
      to the Zionist donors and politicians in this country. So, to see them not offer
      this kind of support absolutely was not surprising, unfortunately. AMY GOODMAN:
      Can you talk about your time in the Jena ICE jail? You were held for over a hundred
      days there. Can you talk about the other prisoners, the conditions under which
      you were held? And then I want to get to the day your baby, your baby Deen, was
      born without you there. But talk about the jail until that point. MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      So, in jail, you spend 24/7 with the same people. So, one of the things that we
      do is to just share stories from people from around the ward. And every day it’s
      just a more heartbreaking story than another, with people being snatched off the
      street or during their court hearings or ICE check-ins, where these people, like,
      they were trying to fix their documentation. They committed no crimes whatsoever.
      So, you have this shock with everyone who’s coming in around why they are there.
      I shared a dorm with over 70 men, and the stories are really heartbreaking, Amy,
      with people leaving their family outside without any kind of support, people who
      don’t have their rights — don’t know their rights, don’t know if they have any
      rights, in fact. And with ICE, who basically don’t tell anyone what their rights
      are and just deport people, I’ve seen people who unknowingly sign their deportation
      documents because ICE agents tricked them into doing so, which is a blatant violation
      of any rule of law or due process. And just, like, to say that, like, the conditions
      inside were horrible. The food was horrible, the sleep quality equally bad, and
      just the atmosphere, where you are inside, you don’t know what’s happening, and
      you’re just expecting to follow orders and wait for an ICE officer to come and
      update you on your case. Unfortunately, a lot of these detainees don’t have legal
      representation. And I was very privileged to have an amazing legal team fighting
      on my behalf. And that took us three months for me to be released, despite me
      being a legal resident in the United States. So, imagine for a lot of these individuals
      who don’t have this kind of representation and who have, like, more complications
      in their documentation. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud, can you talk about the day of Deen’s
      birth, your firstborn son? How did you learn that Noor had given birth? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      That days was absolutely one of the most difficult days that I had to endure in
      my life, being away from my wife and not having the opportunity to support her
      during this moment. And I was over the phone, so I would call every hour just
      to see, like, if Noor is in labor, yeah or no. And the moment of the delivery,
      I spent like over three hours over the phone, from 1:00 — I think 1:30 in the
      morning until 4:00 or 4:30, just, like, trying to support Noor as much as I could,
      because I did not want to miss that moment at all. And what made it very difficult
      is because, like, this could have been easily avoided, were the Trump administration
      to follow the law, or at least, like, to offer me furlough, like, to go and be
      with my family for a few hours. But they refused that, because this administration
      thrives on cruelty and thrives on separation and family separation. So that was
      not surprising. AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the moment when you met Deen
      for the first time? I mean, as you describe it now, you really were with Noor
      then. Of course, you were separate, but you were there. Over the phone, you heard
      his first cries. But talk about holding him for the first time. I remember — I
      mean, it was just weeks ago. Why it was that your lawyers had to fight, a battery
      of lawyers, for so many hours for Noor and Deen, for you to be able to have a
      contact visit? I mean, you have not been charged with a crime. But in the jail
      — is that right — where it was, in Jena, Louisiana? MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah. As you
      said, I mean, it shouldn’t take an army of lawyers to get a one-hour contact visit
      to let me hold my son. The first time I saw my son was, in fact, through glass.
      So, he was literally in front of me, but separated by glass. I couldn’t hold him
      during the first time I saw him, which made me very, very angry about, like, a
      one-centimeter or one-inch glass separating me from holding my son. And this is
      all by design, the cruelty of this administration, because their goal is to punish
      me as much as they could and in any way that they find, because what they want
      is they want to break me. They want to make an example out of me. So, the first
      time when we managed to get a court order, in fact — imagine getting a court order
      to force ICE to let me hold my son. And we had it for literally an hour, 7:00
      in the morning. So, even when they agreed to do that — or, not agreed — even when
      they were forced to allow me to hold my son, they chose to make it at 7:00 in
      the morning in detention. So, I mean, the feeling, I don’t think I can describe
      it. I was both very happy, but at the same time very angry and sad that it took
      us all this effort to have this one hour in detention. And basically, I was really
      anxious. I was just looking at the clock, when this hour would end. I just didn’t
      want this hour to end. And the hour was the fastest hour in my life, just like
      — you know, like, it went like this. AMY GOODMAN: And so — MAHMOUD KHALIL: Yeah,
      Amy. AMY GOODMAN: You were released less than two weeks ago, and now you are living
      at home with your wife and your infant son. Do you feel safe? MAHMOUD KHALIL:
      I don’t fully feel safe, to be honest, Amy. We all know the rhetoric that’s currently
      going around in this country, the Islamophobia, the anti-Palestinian bigotry and
      racism, and this violence that was exported by Israel to this country. I’m being
      targeted by Israeli government-affiliated groups here in the U.S. who are very
      dangerous, who would do anything to silence Palestinians, because, for them, silencing
      is much more easier than dealing with the argument, because they have no argument
      about what they are doing in Palestine. And this is why they want to shut off
      the — shut down the conversation any way they can do, even if this would mean
      hurting or harming me and my family. And it’s a huge concern. But it’s a price
      that I need to accept for advocating for the rights of the Palestinian people,
      because, once again, this is all just a distraction from the genocide in Palestine.
      And these attempts to silence me are just one way for them to attack us and to
      cut — just not to let the public know about what Israel is doing and how the U.S.
      is complicit in this genocide. AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, you led a march from
      the steps of St. John the Divine up to Columbia University, wearing a Palestinian
      flag as a kind of cape, with a thousand supporters there, and you were one of
      the leaders of the encampment at Columbia that led to so many protests and encampments
      around the country on university campuses. Many of the protesters were Jewish.
      Many of the supporters for you who would march when you were detained were Jewish.
      I was wondering: What did that level of Jewish support mean to you here in the
      United States? MAHMOUD KHALIL: First of all, just a correction: The student movement
      at Columbia doesn’t have leaders. I believe all the students equally contribute
      to the movement. And it’s being mobilized by a large number of students, hundreds
      of students at Columbia University. But going back to your question, Amy, I mean,
      Jewish students are an integral part of the student movement, whether at Columbia
      or in the United States. And this is very, very important, because these Jewish
      students, they show the world that what Israel is doing is not in their name,
      is not in the name of Jewish safety, which is very important. And these, also,
      Jewish students are acting upon their values, of protecting the — protecting the
      weak or supporting justice. So, it’s really — to us, it’s very important. This
      shows that the Palestinian cause goes beyond Palestinians, Arabs or Muslims. It’s
      a universal cause for justice, for freedom and for human rights. AMY GOODMAN:
      And finally, Mahmoud, as you are free now here in New York, you still face deportation?
      MAHMOUD KHALIL: I do. I mean, now I’m out on bail, which means that the court
      proceedings can continue while I am out. So, I’m still facing deportation. However,
      a judge, a federal judge, ruled that the Rubio determination on what Rubio did
      to me is likely unconstitutional, and that’s why he ordered my release on bail.
      So I’m confident that we will prevail in court, that this administration attempts
      to silence us wouldn’t succeed, and now that I will seek accountability. I will
      seek accountability from this administration, from the individuals and actors
      who contributed to my arrest, and now exploring these options with my lawyer,
      because in the first place, what I was protesting, I was protesting for accountability,
      to hold Columbia and the U.S. government accountable for their complicity in war
      crimes and genocide against the Palestinians. And I will continue to do so, because
      what happened to me shouldn’t have happened in the first place. I shouldn’t have
      been prosecuted simply for my freedom of speech, simply for speaking up for Palestinian
      rights. And those who have contributed to that in any way should be held accountable.
      AMY GOODMAN: Mahmoud Khalil, thanks so much for joining us, Columbia University
      graduate, Palestinian student activist, detained by ICE March 8th and held for
      104 days at the ICE jail in Jena, Louisiana. During that time, his wife, Dr. Noor
      Abdalla, gave birth to their first child, Deen. Mahmoud was released June 20th.
      You can see him coming to Newark Airport and the next day’s event in front of
      St. John the Divine with a thousand people greeting him at democracynow.org ,

      By Kit Klarenberg / The Grayzone


      A notorious British MI6 agent infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency
      (IAEA) on London’s behalf, according to leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone.
      The agent, Nicholas Langman, is a veteran intelligence operative who claims credit
      for helping engineer the West’s economic war on Iran.


      Langman’s identity first surfaced in journalistic accounts of his role in deflecting
      accusations that British intelligence played a role in the death of Princess Diana.
      He was later accused by Greek authorities of overseeing the abduction and torture
      of Pakistani migrants in Athens.


      In both cases, UK authorities issued censorship orders forbidding the press from
      publishing his name. But Greek media, which was under no such obligation, confirmed
      that Langman was one of the MI6 assets withdrawn from Britain’s embassy in Athens.


      The Grayzone discovered the résumé of the journeyman British operative in a trove
      of leaked papers detailing the activities of Torchlight, a prolific British intelligence
      cutout. The bio of the longtime MI6 officer reveals he “led large, inter-agency
      teams to identify and defeat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
      technology, including by innovative technical means and sanctions.”


      In particular, the MI6 agent says he “worked to prevent WMD proliferation through…
      support for the [IAEA] and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
      [OPCW] and through high level international partnerships.”


      Langman’s CV credits him with playing a major role in organizing the sanctions
      regime on Iran by “[building] highly effective and mutually supportive relations
      across government and with senior US, European, Middle and Far Eastern colleagues
      for strategy” between 2010 and 2012. He boasts in his bio that this achievement
      “enabled [the] major diplomatic success of [the] Iranian nuclear and sanctions
      agreement.”


      The influence Langman claimed to have exerted on the IAEA adds weight to Iranian
      allegations that the international nuclear regulation body colluded with the West
      and Israel to undermine its sovereignty. The Iranian government has alleged that
      the IAEA supplied the identities of its top nuclear scientists to Israeli intelligence,
      enabling their assassinations, and provided critical intelligence to the US and
      Israel on the nuclear facilities they bombed during their military assault this
      June.


      This June 12, under the direction of its Secretary General Rafael Grossi, the
      IAEA issued a clearly politicized report recycling questionable past allegations
      to accuse Iran of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The next day, Israel
      attacked the country, assassinating nine nuclear scientists as well as numerous
      top military officials and hundreds of civilians.


      Iranian former Vice President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif has since called
      for the IAEA’s Grossi to be sacked, accusing him of having “abetted the slaughter
      of innocents in the country.” This June 28, the Iranian government broke ties
      with the IAEA, refusing to allow its inspectors into the country.


      While Iranian officials may have had no idea about the involvement of a shadowy
      figure like Langman in IAEA business, it would likely come as little surprise
      to Tehran that the supposedly multilateral agency had been compromised by a Western
      intelligence agency.


      Langman’s name placed under official UK censorship order


      In 2016, Langman was named a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George,
      the same title bestowed on fictional British spy James Bond. By that point, the
      supposed secret agent held the dubious distinction of being publicly ‘burned’
      as an MI6 operative on two separate occasions.


      First, in 2001, journalist Stephen Dorril revealed that Langman had arrived in
      Paris weeks prior to Princess Diana’s fatal car crash in the city on August 31
      1997, and was subsequently charged with conducting “information operations” to
      deflect widespread public speculation British intelligence was responsible for
      her death.


      Then, in 2005, he was formally accused by Greek authorities of complicity in the
      abduction and torture of 28 Pakistanis in Athens. The Pakistanis, all migrant
      workers, were suspected of having had contact with individuals accused of perpetrating
      the 7/7 bombings in London, July 2005.


      Brutally beaten and threatened with guns in their mouths, the victims “were convinced
      their interrogators were British.” When Greek media named Langman as the MI6 operative
      who oversaw the migrants’ torture, British news outlets universally complied with
      a government D-notice – an official censorship order – and kept his identity under
      wraps when reporting on the scandal.


      London vehemently denied any British involvement in torturing the migrants, with
      then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw dismissing the charge as “utter nonsense.” In
      January 2006 though, London admitted MI6 officers were indeed present during the
      Pakistanis’ torture, although officials insisted the operatives played no active
      part in their arrests, questioning or abuse.


      Following his withdrawal from Athens, Langman returned to London to head the UK
      Foreign Office’s Iran Department, a shift which highlights his importance to MI6
      and suggests the British government had no qualms about his allegedly brutal evidence
      gathering methods.


      Britain’s Foreign Office collaborates closely with MI6, whose agents use it as
      cover just as the CIA does with State Department diplomatic postings.


      MI6’s man on Iran takes credit for “maximum pressure” strategy


      While leading the Foreign Office’s Iran Department from 2006 – 2008, Langman oversaw
      a team seeking to “develop understanding” of the Iranian government’s “nuclear
      program.”


      It’s unclear exactly what that “understanding” entailed. But the document makes
      clear that Langman then “generated confidence” in that assessment among “European,
      US and Middle Eastern agencies” in order to “delay programme [sic] and pressurise
      Iran to negotiate.” The reference to “Middle Eastern agencies” strongly implied
      MI6 cooperation with Israel’s Mossad intelligence service.


      In April 2006, Tehran announced it had successfully enriched uranium for the first
      time, although officials denied any intention to do so for military purposes.
      This development may have triggered Langman’s intervention.


      The Islamic Republic has rejected any suggestion it harbors ambitions to possess
      nuclear weapons. Its denials were corroborated by a November 2007 US National
      Intelligence Estimate expressing “high confidence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted”
      any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment remained unchanged
      for several years, and was reportedly shared by the Mossad, despite Benjamin Netanyhau’s
      constant declarations that Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon.


      Langman’s IAEA support work overlaps with Iran sanctions blitz


      International governmental attitudes towards Iran changed abruptly between 2010
      and ‘12. During this period, Western states and intergovernmental institutions
      initiated an array of harshly punitive measures against the country, while Israel
      ramped up its deadly covert operations against Iran’s nuclear scientists.


      This period precisely overlapped with Langman’s tenure at the Counter-Proliferation
      Centre of the UK Foreign Office. His bio implies he used this position to influence
      the IAEA and other UN-affiliated organizations to foment a campaign of global
      hostility towards Iran.


      In June 2010, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1929, which froze the
      Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ assets, and banned overseas financial institutions
      from opening offices in Tehran. A month later, the Obama administration adopted
      the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. This set
      off a global chain of copycat sanctions by Washington’s vassals, who often imposed
      even more stringent measures than those levied by the UN and US.


      In March 2012, the EU voted unanimously to cut Iranian banks out of the SWIFT
      international banking network. That October, the bloc imposed the harshest sanctions
      to date, restricting trade, financial services, energy and technology, along with
      bans on the provision of insurance to Iranian companies by European firms.


      BBC reporting on the sanctions acknowledged European officials merely suspected
      Tehran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but lacked concrete proof. And behind
      the scenes, the MI6 operative Langman was claiming credit for helping legitimize
      the allegations against Iran.


      Nuclear agreement lays foundations for war


      Following the Western-led campaign isolation of Iran from 2010 – 2012, over its
      purported nuclear weapon program, the Obama administration negotiated a July 2015
      agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the JCPOA’s
      terms, the Islamic Republic agreed to limit its nuclear research activities in
      return for sanctions relief. In the years that followed, the IAEA was granted
      virtually unlimited access to Tehran’s nuclear complexes, ostensibly to ensure
      the facilities were not used to develop nuclear weapons.


      Along the way, IAEA inspectors collected vast amounts of information on the sites,
      including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents. The Iranian
      government has since accused the Agency of furnishing the top secret profiles
      of its nuclear scientists to Israel. These include the godfather of Iran’s nuclear
      program, Mohsen Fakrizadeh, who was first publicly named in a menacing 2019 powerpoint
      presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The following year,
      the Mossad assassinated Fakrizadeh in broad daylight with a remote-controlled
      machine gun.


      Internal IAEA documents leaked this June indicated that IAEA Secretary General
      Rafael Grossi has enjoyed a much closer relationship with Israeli officials than
      was previously known, and suggested he leveraged his cozy ties with Tel Aviv to
      secure his current position.


      During a June 24 interview with Fox News’ war-crazed anchor Martha MacCallum,
      Grossi did not deny making the inflammatory claim that “900 pounds of potentially
      enriched uranium was taken to an ancient site near Isfahan.” Instead the IAEA
      director asserted, “We do not have any information on the whereabouts of this
      material.”


      Well before Grossi rose to the top of the IAEA with Western and Israeli backing,
      the agency appears to have been penetrated by a British intelligence agent who
      took responsibility in his bio for engineering the West’s economic attack on Iran.


      The IAEA has not responded to an email from The Grayzone seeking clarification
      on its relationship with Langman and the MI6.

      By Susan Kang / Truthout


      By now, much ink has been spilled and many takes have been shared on the resounding
      12-point victory of Zohran Mamdani over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last Tuesday
      in the New York City primary to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for
      mayor. There are many reasons for this win, including Mamdani’s talents; his clear
      progressive message focusing on affordability in one of the most expensive cities
      in the country; and his excellent use of social media, earned media, and traditional
      ads.


      Mamdani’s plans were almost immediately denounced as “unrealistic” and pie in
      the sky by political commentators. The Atlantic suggested that his accessible,
      unified message of affordability — with key policies, such as free child care,
      free bus service, and rent freezes for New York City’s 2 million rent-stabilized
      tenants — was a form of “magical realism.” Pundits and political elites repeatedly
      claimed that such universal affordability type policies did not speak to voters
      of color, but rather only appealed to highly educated white younger voters. Underlying
      the tired trope of the socialist “Bernie Bro” was the implicit idea that Mamdani’s
      voter base would be limited only to college-educated transplants, out of touch
      with the experience of working-class communities of color.


      Despite nearly universal opinions and polling data predicting a Cuomo victory,
      the underdog’s victory last week revealed many of his advantages. Commentators
      have pointed to a plethora of explanations — Cuomo’s toxicity and scandals, as
      well as Mamdani’s charisma, political talent, clear messaging, and excellent social
      media strategy and ground game. The City called his tens of thousands of volunteers
      Mamdani’s “army,” and according to the campaign, canvassers knocked on over 1
      million doors.


      All of these factors undoubtedly contributed to Mamdani’s win, but these were
      obvious factors prior to his upset victory. One factor of Mamdani’s campaign that
      gets less attention is its grassroots nature, which goes beyond merely running
      an impressive ground game door-knocking operation; Mamdani’s campaign is grassroots
      in its origins, its associations, its practice, and its theory of governance.
      The media does not quite understand this orientation, because most candidates
      and politicians are so divorced from the grassroots. The clarity of Mamdani’s
      message and his unique talent may serve as an inspiration for other insurgents,
      as might his grassroots commitments.


      While Mamdani’s affordability agenda was mocked as unrealistic, and even out of
      touch with the working-class communities he needed to win the primary, this narrative
      ignores his “man on the street” style of campaigning that he began following Donald
      Trump’s general election victory in November 2024. Specifically, Latino voters
      in the Bronx and Asian voters in Queens noticeably broke for Trump, compared to
      their voting behavior in 2020. Shortly after the 2024 election, Mamdani spoke
      with voters in the Bronx and Queens about why they chose to vote for Trump (or
      chose not to vote) and recorded their answers. The voters gave different responses:
      affordability, problems with the system, rent and food costs, general disappointment
      in the Democrats, and Israel’s U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza. Absent were mentions
      of disliking immigrants (as these neighborhoods are diverse and immigrant heavy)
      or other so-called “woke” issues. Rather, this video captured a bottom-up desire
      for Democratic politicians to respond to people’s immediate economic needs.


      Mamdani’s messaging came from countless conversations like the ones in the video.
      His unified message of affordability, universal programs, and solidarity wasn’t
      just popular — it was also digestible and easy to understand. In response, Cuomo
      came prepared with a well-funded media campaign backed by super PACs, blanketing
      the airwaves with anti-Mamdani commercials and filling mailboxes with mailers,
      spending a record-breaking $25 million. But all this propaganda, which characterized
      Mamdani as dangerous and inexperienced, did not work. And part of this is because
      of the strength of the grassroots efforts, which went beyond canvassing.


      Aaron Fernando is a member of New York City’s chapter of Democratic Socialists
      of America (DSA), a law student, and a volunteer for Mamdani’s campaign. Fernando
      told Truthout, “With an electorate as large as New York City’s, paid media like
      TV advertisements and mailers can get a campaign pretty far. And after [Kamala]
      Harris lost every swing state [in 2024] despite a gigantic field operation, many
      people declared that canvassing had become obsolete. But that’s the wrong message
      to take away.”


      The truth, Fernando says, is that while canvassing alone can’t win large-scale
      elections, it can reinforce the messaging a campaign puts out and allow voters
      to “make the connection between the information about the candidate they’ve been
      hearing [about] and the smiling canvasser at their front door.” Canvassing can
      also reach unique populations, Fernando says, “like the Muslim and South Asian
      uncles and aunties that powered Zohran’s victory.”


      “Make no mistake,” Fernando concluded. “Zohran’s operation of 50,000 volunteers
      and 1.5 million doors knocked — the end result of almost a decade of NYC-DSA’s
      trial-and-error on our campaigns — was the difference in this election.”


      In addition to the canvassing operation, Zohran Mamdani’s campaign maintained
      strong connections to left and progressive political organizations, such as the
      Working Families Party, the New York City chapter of DSA, and youth climate organizations,
      such as TREEage and the Sunrise Movement. Many of these organizations endorsed
      early and provided the volunteer muscle to share the campaigns’ message among
      diverse networks. The Mamdani campaign came out with its three key policies —
      free child care, buses, and rent freezes — but developed other policy platforms
      through collaboration with policy experts and grassroots organizations, many of
      which are grassroots Black and immigrant community-based.


      Mamdani’s dedication to openness, collaboration, and shared goals permeated his
      campaign. “A profound democratic sensibility extended through every aspect of
      the Zohran campaign — from the platform that focused on the issues that keep millions
      of working New Yorkers up at night; to the role played by millions of canvassing
      conversations with strangers about how to change our city; to the way that everyday
      people who had never been involved in politics before could get involved, build
      their skills, develop the campaign’s strategy together, and become leaders,” Mamdani
      campaign volunteer Jeremy Cohan told Truthout.


      “It’s no wonder the establishment completely dismissed it, because it is totally
      foreign to how they operate, which is fundamentally based on treating working
      people as passive consumers to whom experts try to sell a political product dreamed
      up in a boardroom with millionaire and billionaire donors,” Cohan said. “Rather
      than catering to big donors, corporate consultants, and bloviating pundits, [the
      campaign] starts from the basic belief that most people in our society are made
      to feel powerless, that this is the basis of tremendous suffering — not to mention
      of fascist reaction — and that democracy must enfranchise and involve ordinary
      people on a deep level in taking control of their lives, their society, and their
      future.”


      This message of hope and empowering everyday people, whether in their interactions
      with the mayoral candidate or through conversations with volunteers, created a
      stark contrast with the politics of fear and distrust that characterized the Cuomo
      campaign.


      But perhaps the characteristic of the Mamdani campaign that is least understood
      by both professional pundits and Democratic leadership alike is the radical model
      of governance that informed Mamdani’s tenure as an assemblymember, which has also
      been present in his campaign thus far. As part of the Socialist in Office co-governance
      committee, Mamdani, together with other socialist state legislators and city council
      members, has taken a social movement approach to governing, building power through
      mobilizing and empowering regular people to push for solutions at all levels of
      government. A 2022 article from The Nation noted how Mamdani helped constituents
      organize to solve municipal-level problems like requesting a traffic light at
      a busy intersection, even though he is a state-level legislator, because he treated
      constituent services as a way to build power and democratize local government.
      Even though the theory of change behind this co-governance model was clearly laid
      out in the article, somehow this grassroots-oriented model of political power
      remains incomprehensible to most political observers.


      Mamdani was constantly dinged on only passing “three bills” during his time in
      the legislature and he never defended this record. Instead, he continued to stress
      his social movement, grassroots orientation to prove his effectiveness as an elected
      official, pointing out his organizing with indebted taxi drivers and their advocacy
      group, in which he engaged in a 15-day hunger strike to negotiate for city debt
      relief for taxi drivers. While not carrying any bills on eviction protections,
      working with housing activists, he was arrested for protesting the end of the
      COVID-era eviction moratorium in 2021. This broader movement helped pass historic
      “Good Cause” eviction protection in New York State in 2024. In collaboration with
      the Public Power campaign and DSA Ecosocialists, Mamdani and other DSA electeds
      rallied, marched, and organized to fight for New York’s Build Public Renewables
      Act in 2023, touted as the country’s biggest climate law. The legislation allowed
      for the building of publicly owned renewable energy infrastructure, although Mamdani
      was not listed as the bill’s main sponsor. This is a non-comprehensive list that
      only scratches the surface of the grassroots governance that characterized Mamdani’s
      time in the New York State Assembly. Rather than see himself as a politician at
      the top, this theory of governance sees electeds as playing an inside-outside
      strategy, clearly embedded in grassroots and social movements.


      Mamdani’s fellow socialist in office, New York State Assembly member and housing
      activist Marcela Mitaynes, told Truthout that the goal of the campaigns and socialists
      in office is to build movements and organizers, not just one-time voters and constituents.
      “[Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams] said, ‘Oh you can’t have free buses,
      you can’t tax the rich. That’s on the state level.’ But he doesn’t understand
      how [our project] works. We are building the political community. …We are teaching
      people to do more and go beyond the typical political script,” Mitaynes said.


      “In this next stage of the campaign, we’ll be able to build that and that talk
      about governance and how it works, and then we’ll be able to pass this legislation.
      This grassroots organizing means we can push people — city council members, state
      legislators — to pass the laws we want,” Mitaynes said. “To [most politicians],
      everything is transactional. You either have the political capital to do it or
      you don’t. But we’re building it, by building up this movement. No politician
      can do this by themselves. We need to join forces with the people. We can never
      beat the money thrown at us. That’s why [we] focus on grassroots, bringing [in]
      people affected the most.”

      By William D. Hartung / TomDispatch


      The Senate is on the verge of passing the distinctly misnamed “big beautiful bill.”
      It is, in fact, one of the ugliest pieces of legislation to come out of Congress
      in living memory. The version that passed the House recently would cut $1.7 trillion,
      mostly in domestic spending, while providing the top 5% of taxpayers with roughly
      $1.5 trillion in tax breaks.


      Over the next few years, the same bill will add another $150 billion to a Pentagon
      budget already soaring towards a record $1 trillion. In short, as of now, in the
      battle between welfare and warfare, the militarists are carrying the day.


      Pentagon Pork and the People It Harms


      The bill, passed by the House of Representatives and at present under consideration
      in the Senate, would allocate tens of billions of dollars to pursue President
      Trump’s cherished but hopeless Golden Dome project, which Laura Grego of the Union
      of Concerned Scientists has described as “a fantasy.” She explained exactly why
      the Golden Dome, which would supposedly protect the United States against nuclear
      attack, is a pipe dream:


      “Over the last 60 years, the United States has spent more than $350 billion on
      efforts to develop a defense against nuclear-armed ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic
      missiles]. This effort has been plagued by false starts and failures, and none
      have yet been demonstrated to be effective against a real-world threat… Missile
      defenses are not a useful or long-term strategy for keeping the U.S. safe from
      nuclear weapons.”


      The bill also includes billions more for shipbuilding, heavy new investments in
      artillery and ammunition, and funding for next-generation combat aircraft like
      the F-47.


      Oh, and after all of those weapons programs get their staggering cut of that future
      Pentagon budget, somewhere way down at the bottom of that list is a line item
      for improving the quality of life for active-duty military personnel. But the
      share aimed at the well-being of soldiers, sailors, and airmen (and women) is
      less than 6% of the $150 billion that Congress is now poised to add to that department’s
      already humongous budget. And that’s true despite the way Pentagon budget hawks
      invariably claim that the enormous sums they routinely plan on shoveling into
      it — and the overflowing coffers of the contractors it funds — are “for the troops.”


      Much of the funding in the bill will flow into the districts of key members of
      Congress (to their considerable political benefit). For example, the Golden Dome
      project will send billions of dollars to companies based in Huntsville, Alabama,
      which calls itself “Rocket City” because of the dense network of outfits there
      working on both offensive missiles and missile defense systems. And that, of course,
      is music to the ears of Representative Mike Rogers (R-AL), the current chair of
      the House Armed Services Committee, who just happens to come from Alabama.


      The shipbuilding funds will help prop up arms makers like HII Corporation (formerly
      Huntington Ingalls), which runs a shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the home
      state of Senate Armed Services Committee chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss). The funds
      will also find their way to shipyards in Maine, Connecticut, and Virginia.


      Those funds will benefit the co-chairs of the House Shipbuilding Caucus, Representative
      Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Representative Rob Wittman (R-VA). Connecticut hosts General
      Dynamics’ Electric Boat plant, which makes submarines that carry ballistic missiles,
      while Virginia is home to HII Corporation’s Newport News Shipbuilding facility,
      which makes both aircraft carriers and attack submarines.


      The Golden Dome missile defense project, on which President Trump has promised
      to spend $175 billion over the next three years, will benefit contractors big
      and small. Those include companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon
      (now RTX) that build current generation missile defense systems, as well as emerging
      military tech firms like Elon Musk’s Space X and Palmer Luckey’s Anduril, both
      of which are rumored to have a shot at playing a leading role in the development
      of the new anti-missile system.


      And just in case you thought this country was only planning to invest in defense
      against a nuclear strike, a sharp upsurge in spending on new nuclear warheads
      under the auspices of the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Agency
      (NNSA) has been proposed for fiscal year 2026. Thirty billion dollars, to be exact,
      which would represent a 58% hike from the prior year’s budget. Meanwhile, within
      that agency, nonproliferation, cleanup, and renewable energy programs are set
      to face significant cuts, leaving 80% of NNSA’s proposed funding to be spent on
      — yes! — nuclear weapons alone. Those funds will flow to companies like Honeywell,
      Bechtel, Jacobs Engineering, and Fluor that help run nuclear labs and nuclear
      production sites, as well as educational institutions like the University of Tennessee,
      Texas A&M, and the University of California at Berkeley, which help manage nuclear
      weapons labs or nuclear production sites.


      Weakening the Social Safety Net — and America


      And while weapons contractors will gorge on a huge new infusion of cash, military
      personnel, past and present, are clearly going to be neglected. As a start, the
      Veterans Administration is on the block for deep cuts, including possible layoffs
      of up to 80,000 employees — a move that would undoubtedly slow down the processing
      of benefits for those who have served in America’s past wars. Research on ailments
      that disproportionately impact veterans will also be cut, which should be considered
      an outrage.


      Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of veterans from this country’s disastrous wars
      in Afghanistan and Iraq will continue to suffer from physical and psychological
      wounds, including traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Cutting research that might find more effective solutions to such problems
      should be considered a national disgrace. In the meantime, active-duty personnel
      who are getting a tiny fraction of the potential Pentagon add-on of $150 billion
      are similarly in need.


      Worse yet, turn away from the Pentagon for a moment, and the cuts in the rest
      of that “big beautiful bill” will likely have an impact on a majority of Americans
      — Democrats, independents, and MAGA Republicans alike. Their full effects may
      not be felt for months until the spending reductions contained in it start hitting
      home. However, enacting policies that take food off people’s tables and deny them
      medical care will not only cause unnecessary suffering but cost lives.


      As President (and former general) Dwight D. Eisenhower, a very different kind
      of Republican, said more than 70 years ago, the ultimate security of a nation
      lies not in how many weapons it can pile up, but in the health, education, and
      resilience of its people. The big beautiful bill and the divisive politics surrounding
      it threaten those foundations of our national strength.


      Clash of the Contractors?


      As budget cuts threaten to make the population weaker, distorted spending priorities
      are making arms producers stronger. The Big Five — Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing,
      General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman — produce most of the current big-ticket
      weapon systems, from submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles to tanks,
      combat aircraft, and missile-defense systems. Meanwhile, emerging tech firms like
      Palantir, Anduril, and Space X are cashing in on contracts for unpiloted vehicles,
      advanced communications systems, new-age goggles for the Army, anti-drone systems,
      and so much more.


      But even as weapons spending hits near-record or record levels, there may still
      be a fight between the Big Five and the emerging tech firms over who gets the
      biggest share of that budget. One front in the coming battle between the Big Five
      and the Silicon Valley militarists could be the Army Transformation Initiative
      (ATI). According to Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, one of the goals of ATI
      is to “eliminate obsolete systems.”


      Driscoll is a harsh critic of the way members of Congress put money in the budget
      — a process known as “pork barrel politics” — for items the military services
      haven’t even asked for (and they ask for plenty), simply because those systems
      might bring more jobs and revenue to their states or districts. He has, in fact,
      committed himself to an approach that’s incompatible with the current, parochial
      process of putting together the Pentagon budget. “Lobbyists and bureaucrats have
      overtaken the army’s ability to prioritize soldiers and war fighting,” he insisted.


      Driscoll is talking a tough game when it comes to taking on the existing big contractors.
      He’s evidently ready to push for “reform,” even if it means that some of them
      go out of business. In fact, he seems to welcome it: “I will measure it as success
      if, in the next two years, one of the primes is no longer in business.” (“Primes”
      are the big contractors like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that take the
      lead on major programs and get the bulk of the funding, a significant portion
      of which they dole out to subcontractors all over the country and the world.)


      Ending pork-barrel politics in favor of an approach in which the Pentagon only
      buys systems that align with the country’s actual defense strategy, as Driscoll
      is suggesting, might seem like a significant step forward. But be careful what
      you wish for. Any funds freed up by stopping congressional representatives from
      treating the Pentagon budget as a piggy bank to buy loyalty from their constituents
      will almost certainly go to emerging tech firms ready to build next-generation
      systems like swarms of drones, weapons that can take out a hypersonic missile,
      or pilotless land vehicles, aircraft, and ships. Driscoll is a major tech enthusiast,
      as is his friend and Yale law school classmate J.D. Vance, who was first employed
      by Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, who then backed his successful run for the
      Senate from Ohio.


      Since the tech firms don’t have the equivalent of the Big Five’s extensive production
      networks in key congressional districts, they need to find other ways to persuade
      Congress to fund their weapons programs. Fortunately, the Silicon Valley militarists
      have a significant number of former employees or financial backers in the Trump
      administration who can plead their case.


      In addition, military-tech-focused venture capital firms have hired at least 50
      former Pentagon and military officials, all of whom can help them exert influence
      over both the Trump administration and Congress. The biggest “catch” was Palantir’s
      hiring of former Wisconsin Congressman Mike Gallagher, who had run the hawkish
      Congressional special committee on Communist China.


      Some journalists and policy analysts have wondered whether the feud between Donald
      Trump and Elon Musk will hurt the military tech sector. Well, stop fretting. Even
      if Trump were to follow through on his threat to cut the government funding of
      Musk’s firms, the tasks they’re carrying out — from launching military satellites
      to developing more secure Internet access for deployed military personnel — would
      still proceed, just under the auspices of different companies. There would be
      some friction involved, simply because it’s hard to shift suppliers on a dime
      without slowing down production. And the transition, should it occur, would also
      add cost to already exceedingly expensive programs.


      But Trump’s threat to cancel Space X’s contracts may just be more grist for his
      verbal combat with Musk rather than anything his administration plans to follow
      through on. Even if Musk and his president never reconcile, the DOGE cuts to international
      diplomacy and domestic social services that Musk spearheaded will still do serious
      damage for years to come.


      Money Can’t Buy Security


      A shift toward emerging military tech firms and away from the Big Five will be
      about more than money and technology. Key figures among the growing cohort of
      Silicon Valley militarists like Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, see building weapons
      as more than just a necessary pillar of national defense. They see it as a measure
      of national character.


      Karp’s new book, The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the
      Future of the West, mixes the Cold War ideology of the 1950s with the emerging
      technology of the twenty-first century. He decries the lack of unifying concepts
      like “the West” and sees too many Americans as slackers with no sense of national
      pride or patriotism. His solution, a supposedly unifying national mission, is
      — wait for it! — a modern Manhattan project for the development of the military
      applications of artificial intelligence. To say that this is an impoverished version
      of what this country’s mission should be is putting it mildly. Many other possibilities
      come to mind, from addressing climate change to preventing pandemics to upgrading
      our educational system to building a society where everyone’s basic needs are
      met, leaving room for creative pursuits of all kinds.


      The techno-optimists are also obsessed with preparing for a war with China, which
      Palmer Luckey, the 32-year-old founder of the military tech firm Anduril, believes
      will happen by 2027. And many in his circle, including Marc Andreessen of the
      venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, are convinced that any potential risks
      from the development of AI pale in comparison to the need to “beat China,” not
      just in getting to sophisticated military applications first, but in winning a
      future war with Beijing, if it comes to that. Talk of diplomacy to head off a
      war over Taiwan or cooperation on global issues like climate change, outbreaks
      of disease, and building a more inclusive, less unequal global economy rarely
      come up in discussions among the hardcore militarist faction in Silicon Valley.
      Instead, that group is spending inordinate amounts of time and money seeking to
      influence the future of U.S. foreign and military policy, a dangerous development
      indeed.


      Whether the emerging tech firms can build cheaper weapons with superior capabilities
      will be irrelevant if such developments are tied to an aggressive strategy that
      makes a devastating conflict with China more likely. While the fight between the
      Big Five and the tech leaders may prove interesting to observe, it is also ominous
      in terms of this country’s future economic and foreign policies, not to speak
      of the shape and size of our national budget.


      The rest of us, who aren’t billionaires and don’t draw $20 million in annual compensation
      packages like the CEOs of the big weapons firms (directly or indirectly funded
      by our tax dollars), should play a leading role in rethinking and revising this
      country’s global role and our policies at home. If we don’t rise to that challenge,
      this country could end up swapping one form of militarism, led by the Big Five,
      for another, spearheaded by hawkish, self-important tech leaders who care more
      about making money and spawning devastating new technologies than they do about
      democracy or the quality of life of the average American.

    paragraph_summary: The article by William D. Hartung discusses the Senate's impending
      passage of a controversial bill that cuts $1.7 trillion in domestic spending while
      providing $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and adding $150
      billion to an already inflated Pentagon budget. This legislation prioritizes military
      spending over social welfare, with significant allocations for ineffective missile
      defense projects like the Golden Dome, while neglecting the needs of active-duty
      military personnel and veterans. The bill is criticized for benefiting defense
      contractors and perpetuating a cycle of pork-barrel politics, which diverts funds
      from essential services such as healthcare and education. The author warns that
      this trend not only undermines the social safety net but also fosters a dangerous
      militarization of U.S. policy, as emerging tech firms vie for military contracts,
      potentially escalating tensions with adversaries like China. Ultimately, the article
      calls for a reevaluation of national priorities that focus on the well-being of
      citizens rather than excessive military expenditures.

      By Patrick Lawrence / Original to ScheerPost


      On one hand, you have the White House, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Dan
      Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, insisting and insisting again — insisting too
      much, methinks — that those B–2 bombers that flew over Iran two Sundays back,
      June 22, obliterated the nation’s nuclear program just as President Trump hastily
      claimed as soon as the operation was completed.


      Hegseth at a news conference with Caine four days later: “U.S. attacks have effectively
      destroyed Iran’s centrifuge enrichment program …. You want to call it destroyed,
      you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated, choose your word.
      This was an historically successful attack, and we should celebrate it as Americans.”


      Trump, at a news conference the next day: “The place was bombed to hell …. The
      last thing they’re thinking about now is nuclear weapons.”


      And in the background you have the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central
      Intelligence Agency performing Difficulty 5 back flips as they repudiate initial
      assessments of limited damage to the Iranian nuclear program so as to conform
      to the Trump regime’s “obliterated, destroyed, defeated” narrative.


      On the other hand, you have reports that the Iranians, warned in advance the “bunker
      busters” would fall on the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites, removed their
      400–kilograms of enriched uranium, not quite 900 pounds, to secret locations.
      Immediately after the bombs fell, Amwaj.media, a British-based digital publication
      that covers West Asia in English, Arabic and Farsi, reported this, citing “a high-ranking
      Iranian political source [who] also confirmed that the targeted sites were evacuated,
      with ‘most’ of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium kept in secure locations.”


      “How can you tell,” Reuters asked in a June 29 report, “if enriched uranium stocks,
      some of them near weapons grade, were buried beneath the rubble or secretly hidden
      away?”


      You cannot, it seems to me. Neither can President Trump or any of his adjutants.


      Then you have the granular analysis of reputable technologists such as Ted Postol,
      the gentlemanly scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has
      over many years exploded more false flags, propaganda ops, and other such ruses
      than you’ve had hot dinners.


      There is satellite imagery showing 16 tractor trailers lined up at Fordow in the
      days before the B–2s flew. Trump insists they were pouring concrete, a peculiar
      use of a truck of that sort, I have to say. It is magnitudes more plausible they
      were there to load the steel drums in which enriched uranium is commonly stored
      and shipped.


      Postol gave the heavy-on-the-science interview to Daniel Davis, an Army veteran
      who now podcasts as a respected military analyst, after the Hegseth–Caine press
      conference. In the course of it, the joint chiefs chairman went full monty with
      slides, diagrams, satellite images, and graphics to show (or is snow my word?)
      the assembled reporters just how true the obliterated-destroyed-defeated story
      is.


      “What it clearly shows is that the bottom of the shaft [formed by the bombs] is
      still sealed,” Postol said of Caine’s presentation. “Caine is probably a good
      soldier, but he doesn’t know much science. You cannot succeed with this kind of
      attack. It was destined to fail.”


      Postol also proves astute as to the political dynamics of the administration’s
      shape-shifting accounts of the Iranian mission: “This is a circus, a political
      circus to try to minimize the embarrassment to President Trump for having spoken
      without any knowledge.”


      Where are we, then? As Postol points out during his exchange with Davis, “You
      can’t trust the media and you can’t trust the intelligence community.” What happened
      and what is going to happen next? These are the questions we are left to consider
      more or less on our own.


      Strange as it may seem, I find it easier to anticipate the future than to conclude
      with certainty what it is that those B–2s and their 30,000–pound bombs actually
      got done.


      It may be that we are doomed never to know the extent of the damage the Air Force’s
      aerial operation caused. But, staying short of convictions as we must, I put my
      stock in those reports that the Iranians had advance notice that the B–2s were
      coming. I have heard no official denial on this point. And so much of contemporary
      warfare is weirdly choreographed, after all. In this case, telling Tehran the
      battle plan would serve to reduce the danger — danger the International Atomic
      Energy Agency warned of prior to the operation — of a catastrophic release of
      radioactive material into the atmosphere.


      And there is the science, such as unscientific minds, mine among them, can understand
      it. I have found Ted Postol a careful, persuasive witness ever since he discredited
      those false-flag chemical weapons incidents in Syria at the height of the Western-run
      operation to bring down the Assad regime. Take a look at the video of his talk
      with Daniel Davis. He did the same thing this time: Here are the physics, here
      the thermodynamics, this is what would have to have happened if the obliteration
      story was true, and here is how we know it did not happen.


      As to what is likely to come next, we can usefully read events as mirrors of intentions.


      I think it is true that Hegseth, Caine and others among Trump’s sycophantic appointees
      are protecting the president from ignominy — or more ignominy, better to say —
      as they flood the zone with pseudoscience and, in Hegseth’s case, shrill exhortations
      to print and broadcast media to stop with the reporting and get with the patriotic
      propaganda. (Read the transcript linked above for the full taste of these crude
      harangues.)


      But there is more to President Trump than his obvious concern for appearances.
      In my view he is very eager to avoid any circumstance that would require another
      American air campaign in Iranian airspace. He wants neither the risk nor the responsibility.
      This is how, paradoxically, I read his warning the other day that he will bomb
      again if Iran resumes its enrichment processes. When Trump drops threats like
      granite boulders we can read in them what he actually wants. In this case it is
      another way of saying, “Please stay with the ceasefire and short of the nuclear
      stuff.”


      With Trump, it is as it was with Joe Biden and numerous of their predecessors.
      One can never tell the extent to which Trump , is willing to restrain the Israelis
      as they advance their aggressions — which any American regime could do in very
      short order — and the extent to which he pretends to be willing to restrain the
      Israelis but has no intention of doing so because of the Israel lobbies.


      The New York Times ran a report Monday, June 29, under the headline, “Israel’s
      Military Appears Poised to Expand Into Gaza City Amid Cease-Fire Calls.” While
      Trump and his national-security people press for a ceasefire in Gaza — with what
      degree of vigor we do not know — the Zionist state just ordered Palestinians to
      evacuate the Strip’s main city after not operating here for many months. So they
      seem to be going in yet again. “There has been no advancement in the ceasefire
      talks,” The Times, quoting two Israeli officials and another unnamed source, reported.


      This development has nothing and everything to do with Israel’s current posture
      toward Iran, as I interpret it. Israel has as little intention of ceasing its
      operations against Iran, now that they are finally underway, as it does to end
      its genocidal ethnic-cleansing of the Palestinians of Gaza. These aggressions
      are both fronts in what the Israelis call their “seven-front war” across West
      Asia, and we must not lose sight of this. We witness a thematically unified campaign
      of terror. There is no place in it for ceasefires, peaceful coexistence or anything
      else short of total victory.


      As in Gaza, so in the West Bank, and as in Gaza and the West Bank, so in Lebanon,
      and as in these three, so in Iran. I see no chance whatsoever that the Israelis
      consider themselves done with the Islamic Republic. Destroying the nation’s nuclear
      program, wrecking the economy and essential infrastructure, creating a state of
      political chaos, assassinating or otherwise decapitating the leadership: All this
      appears to be under discussion among Israel’s war planners.


      It is merely a matter of time before the Zionist state resumes its aggressions.
      Then there will be more questions, chief among them what the United States and
      the rest of the West will do as more barbarities unfold before the world’s eyes.

      By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News


      By actively partnering with the U.S. government to smuggle communications hardware
      into Iran, Elon Musk is once again aiding Washington’s attempts at regime change.
      This fits into a long pattern of both American efforts to dislodge the government
      in Tehran and Musk’s close collaboration with the U.S. national security state,
      helping it to achieve its objectives around the world.


      For decades, Washington has sought to overthrow the government in Tehran. Today,
      its most important ally in that effort may not be in the CIA or Pentagon, but
      in Silicon Valley.


      Elon Musk, through his Starlink satellite system, is now helping to smuggle thousands
      of communication terminals into Iran, enabling opposition networks to evade government
      restrictions and coordinate in secret. His partnership with the U.S. national
      security state has made him a central figure in one of the most ambitious regime
      change campaigns in modern times.


      Targeting Tehran


      It is no secret that Iran is in Washington’s crosshairs. And Elon Musk is aiding
      the attempt to depose the government in Tehran. In response to a post by a member
      of President Trump’s Homeland Security Advisory Council, Mark Levin, asking him
      to “put the final nail in the coffin of the Iranian regime by providing Starlink
      internet to the Iranian people,” the billionaire tech mogul recently announced
      that “the beams are on.”


      After the Israeli bombardment began, Iran’s Communication Ministry placed heavy
      restrictions on online communication. This had the effect of hampering the ability
      of American and Israeli assets inside the country from communicating.


      Starlink is an internet service allowing those with terminals to directly connect
      to thousands of SpaceX satellites in low Earth orbit. Terminals are, in effect,
      small, portable satellite dishes that can be set up anywhere and used by those
      in the near vicinity to skirt government restrictions on communication.


      This is not the first time that Musk has used Starlink to sow chaos in Iran. In
      2023, at the height of a U.S.-backed protest movement, the South African-born
      plutocrat responded to a statement to Secretary of State Antony Blinken announcing
      that the United States was taking action “to advance internet freedom and the
      free flow of information for the Iranian people…to counter the Iranian government’s
      censorship.”


      “Activating Starlink,” Musk said. A few weeks after this pronouncement, Musk revealed
      that he was helping to smuggle hundreds of Starlinks into the country. “Approaching
      100 Starlinks active in Iran,” he later noted.


      The scale of the operation has been substantial, as only 18 months later, an estimated
      20,000 clandestine Starlink devices are operating inside the country, helping
      a vast network of activists, spies, and other anti-government forces coordinate
      and communicate.


      Keeping Ukraine Fighting


      This is far from the only country where Starlink has been used to promote Washington’s
      interests.


      After Russia hit its communications grid, the U.S. government rushed thousands
      of Starlinks into Ukraine, where they provide the backbone of the country’s communications
      system. Most of the high-tech weaponry sent by NATO countries to Ukraine is useless
      without online targeting systems, and Starlink keeps the Ukrainian military in
      the field, allowing it to target Russian positions. Indeed, one official told
      The Times of London that he “must” use Starlink to target enemy forces via thermal
      imaging.


      There are an estimated 42,000 Starlinks in Ukraine, keeping their government ministries,
      hospitals, and military online. “Starlink is what changed the war in Ukraine’s
      favor. Russia went out of its way to blow up all our comms. Now they can’t. Starlink
      operates under Katyusha fire and artillery fire. It even works in Mariupol,” one
      Ukrainian soldier told journalist David Patrikarakos, referencing the deep underground
      mines where Ukrainian forces were dug in.


      The Pentagon’s Man


      As can be seen, then, Musk and his companies enjoy a very close relationship with
      the U.S. national security state. SpaceX – the manufacturer of Starlink – has
      signed a myriad of lucrative contracts with various American intelligence agencies.


      In 2021, the firm won a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance
      Office to build a network of hundreds of spy satellites. It was also chosen to
      blast a $500 million Lockheed Martin spy system into orbit, and to deliver an
      Air Force command satellite into space.


      The spying agency that has worked most intimately with Musk and SpaceX, however,
      is the Central Intelligence Agency. Midwifing the birth of SpaceX was Mike Griffin,
      then the head of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capitalist wing. In-Q-Tel identifies
      and funds cutting-edge tech firms whose technologies and products will give the
      CIA an advantage over its rivals.


      Griffin was with Musk from day one, even accompanying him to Moscow in 2002, where
      the pair attempted to kickstart SpaceX by purchasing cut-price Russian intercontinental
      ballistic missiles. Musk believed that by sourcing missiles at a lower cost from
      around the world, he could significantly undercut competitors like Lockheed Martin
      and secure defense contracts.


      The attempt failed, but the trip cemented a lifelong partnership that remains
      to this day. Griffin became Musk’s primary backer within the intelligence community,
      labelling him the “Henry Ford” of the rocket industry, and constantly promoting
      his name within the halls of power.


      Griffin would later become the head of NASA, hold a senior position at the Pentagon,
      and save SpaceX on multiple occasions from bankruptcy by handing the company gigantic
      contracts.


      Perhaps no other figure has impacted Musk’s life more than Griffin, who now serves
      as a senior advisor to Castelion, a SpaceX spin-off organization dealing with
      missile defense systems. Musk called his oldest child Griffin, and went on to
      name his subsequent child X Æ A-12, after a CIA bomber jet.


      Rocketman


      Castelion was formed in 2022 to help the Pentagon win a nuclear war. For decades,
      war planners in Washington have been determined to find a way to block foreign
      nuclear missiles from reaching the United States. To that end, they recruited
      Musk in an effort to build an enormous “American Iron Dome” of modified SpaceX
      satellites that could shoot down incoming rockets, making the United States impervious
      to attack.


      While this technology might appear defensive on the surface, it would, in effect,
      give the United States free rein to attack any nation at any time, safe in the
      knowledge that there would be no possible retaliation. The Mutually Assured Destruction
      doctrine that has held together a fragile peace since the late 1940s would be
      shattered, and the United States—the only country to use nuclear weapons against
      another nation—would be invincible.


      Internal documents have shown for decades that it is precisely and only this threat
      of consequences from Russian, Chinese, or North Korean intercontinental ballistic
      missiles that has stayed the hand of Washington.


      Musk has repeatedly downplayed the consequences of a nuclear winter, and even
      suggested firing more than 10,000 nuclear warheads at Mars, in a quixotic attempt
      to trigger a rapid greenhouse effect, warming the planet sufficiently for human
      habitation.


      Few scientists believe that the plan could work, and many have strongly denounced
      the idea. Dmitry Rogozin, then-head of the Russian state space agency Roscosmos,
      for instance, warned that Musk’s gambit was nothing more than a cover to fill
      space with thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at Russia, China, and any other
      nation drawing the U.S.’s ire.


      Overthrowing Governments Around the World


      While Iran is currently in the crosshairs, it is far from the only country Musk
      has interfered in. The tech magnate also led an attempt to overturn last year’s
      presidential elections in Venezuela, claiming that far-right opposition candidate
      Edmundo Gonzalez had won.


      Musk shared fake videos purporting to show massive election fraud, suspended the
      Twitter account of President Nicolas Maduro, and even threatened to drag the Venezuelan
      leader to the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison. Given Musk’s past statements, these
      are not taken lightly in Latin America.


      The billionaire admitted to working with the U.S. government to overthrow Bolivian
      President Evo Morales in 2019. Bolivia is home to the world’s largest easily extractable
      lithium reserves, an element crucial in the production of electric-vehicle batteries.
      Morales had refused to open the country up to foreign corporations eager to exploit
      Bolivia for profit. Instead, he proposed developing sovereign technology to keep
      both the jobs and profits inside the country.


      A U.S.-backed far-right insurrection overthrew him in November 2019. The new government
      quickly invited Musk for talks. When directly accused of his complicity, the tycoon
      stated bluntly, “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.” Inside Bolivia,
      the affair is often described as “the Lithium Coup.”


      More recently, Musk has interfered in German politics, strongly backing the far-right
      AfD Party, telling voters that they should not be ashamed of their past (i.e.,
      fascism). In Britain, Musk funds and promotes far-right racist agitator Tommy
      Robinson. And in Canada, he attempted to swing this year’s election towards the
      right-wing conservative candidate, Pierre Poilievre.


      The attempted backfired spectacularly, however, as his perceived arrogance (he
      repeatedly called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “governor”, implying Canada was
      not a sovereign nation, but the 51st state of the U.S.) rallied Canadians around
      Liberal candidate Mark Carney. It was a similar story in Wisconsin this April,
      where Musk spent tens of millions of dollars attempting (and failing) to buy an
      election.


      Nevertheless, despite his recent failures, it is doubtful that Musk has given
      up on national and international politics. Nor is it likely that this will be
      the last time that Washington openly plans for regime change in Tehran.


      Ever since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that deposed a U.S.-backed dictator,
      Iran has been a top concern for members of the American national security state.
      Thankfully for them, they can rely on help from tech CEOs such as Elon Musk, who
      appear only too happy to ally themselves with those in power to serve the agenda
      of the U.S. empire.

  - title: Will Zohran Mamdani Empower or Betray the Working Class? (w/ Kshama Sawant)

      This interview is also available on podcast platforms and Rumble.


      Zohran Mamdani’s emphatic victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary
      has shaken the core of American politics. A self-described democratic socialist,
      Mamdani ran a campaign centered around affordability as well as relentless denunciation
      of the genocide in Gaza. Mamdani drew the ire of Zionists, right-wingers and the
      billionaire class not only in New York City but across the country, including
      calls for his deportation by Congressman Andy Ogles and subsequent slander by
      President Donald Trump.


      Former Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, who is now running for Washington
      state’s 9th congressional district, weighs in on her fellow democratic socialist’s
      journey on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report.


      Sawant has been a standout figure for working class representation, winning a
      $15 an hour minimum wage in Seattle during her city council tenure as well as
      the Amazon Tax, which helped fund affordable housing. She says Mamdani’s victory
      should be celebrated, especially because it shows the Zionist lobby can be defeated
      not just in the U.S. but in a state home to the largest Jewish population outside
      of Israel.


      Despite this encouraging repudiation of the billionaire class in the wealthiest
      city in America, Sawant emphasizes the need to continue the fight and make sure
      Mamdani sticks to his original promises.


      “If you don’t understand that careerism is one of the death knells of winning
      anything substantial for the working class, then you will sell out even with those
      good intentions because you will make it about yourself and you will immediately
      get the memo that in order to fight for working people, you will need to be in
      battle mode every single day when you enter City Hall,” she says.


      Mamdani’s alignment with the Democratic Party is concerning, according to Sawant,
      pointing to a pattern in which groundbreaking campaigns, like those of Alexandria
      Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, have fallen short of delivering promises for
      working class people once in office.


      “At the end of the day, the Democratic Party is a party of capitalism itself,”
      Sawant asserts. “The working class loses out more and more and is subjected to
      more and more misery with every passing decade that you’re not going to stand
      up for working people.”


      So far, Mamdani’s campaign has made strides to inspire the American working class.
      “It’s a real boost of confidence for working class people nationally to see that
      yes, working people will fight alongside you if you put forward demands that make
      a huge difference in their lives and which reflect their anger, their just anger
      at the Wall Street billionaires,” Sawant says.

      Transcript


      Chris Hedges


      Hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman, enraged by Zohran Mamdani’s securing an overwhelming
      majority to become the Democratic Party’s nominee to run for mayor of New York
      City, said he and his wealthy associates will pour “hundreds of millions of dollars”
      into the candidacy of anyone willing to run against Mamdani in the general election.
      Ackman, who supports Donald Trump, added that he has an unnamed candidate he is
      ready to bankroll.


      Major Democratic donors — who poured tens of millions of dollars into a Super
      PAC to support former governor Andrew Cuomo in his run for mayor — are also meeting
      to decide if they will fund an independent run by Cuomo in November, or back the
      unpopular incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent.


      Mamdani’s grassroots campaign – Cuomo’s campaign outspent him 20 to 1 – centered
      around raising the minimum wage, tax hikes on businesses and the rich, creating
      city-owned grocery stores, making city bus service free and imposing a rent freeze
      for stabilized tenants.


      The victory by the self-described Democratic socialist, who was mercilessly smeared
      for his denunciation of the genocide in Gaza and promise to honor the arrest warrant
      issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he appeared in New York
      City, has sent shock waves through the ruling billionaire class and the Democratic
      Party establishment that supported Cuomo. While Mamdani was endorsed by Alexandria
      Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez who serve in the state’s congressional delegation,
      as well as Bernie Sanders, they were the singular exceptions. The hierarchy of
      the party has either remained silent since Mamdani’s victory or been openly antagonistic.


      New York Senator Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leaders of
      the Senate and the House, refuse to back Mamdani’s candidacy. New York Rep. Laura
      Gillen, speaking for many in the party, called Mamdani the “absolute wrong choice
      for New York.”


      Democrats, along with their major donors, can be counted on to attempt to sabotage
      Mamdani’s campaign, just as it did the campaign of Bernie Sanders when he sought
      the presidential nomination. It remains, it seems, impervious to reform.


      What does this election portend? What does it mean for the future of the Democratic
      Party? Is Mamdani’s victory a sign that there are growing cracks in the edifice
      of the party? Or will it drive the party further to the right and see it destroy
      the candidacies of those who seek to address the domination of our political system
      by the billionaire class and the punishing social inequality?


      Joining me to discuss Mamdani’s victory and what it portends, as well as her own
      campaign to be elected as a democratic socialist to Congress in Washington state,
      is Kshama Sawant. Kshama is a leader for Workers Strike Back and Revolutionary
      Workers. And as a city council member, she battled against the established Democratic
      Party leadership and the city’s oligarchs who poured millions into campaigns to
      defeat her including an unsuccessful effort to oust her in a recall vote. Amazon
      alone spent over $3 million to defeat her run for office in 2019.


      Sawant helped lead the fight in 2014 that made Seattle the first major American
      city to mandate a $15 dollar an hour minimum wage. Following a three-year struggle
      against one of the richest men in the world – Jeff Bezos – and his political establishment,
      she and her allies pushed through a tax on big business that increased city revenues
      by an estimated $210 to $240 million a year.


      She was part of the movement that led to Seattle’s successful ban on school-year
      evictions of schoolchildren, their families and school employees. She was one
      of sponsors of a bill that protects tenants from being evicted at the end of their
      “term leases,” requiring landlords to provide tenants with the right to renew
      their leases and prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants for non-payment of
      rent if the rent was due during the COVID civil emergency and the renter could
      not pay due to financial hardship. You can find her at KshamaSawant.org.


      Okay, so let’s begin with Mamdani’s victory, what you think it means, and the
      Democratic Party’s response. And I just want to add, you yourself, when you were
      on the city council, spent most of your time battling the Democratic Party establishment,
      or much of the time.


      Kshama Sawant


      All the time, actually. The Democrats on the city council here in Seattle opposed
      every single progressive measure that my office fought for. But yeah, Mamdani’s
      primary election victory in the Democratic Party in New York City for the mayoral
      election is first and foremost a stinging rebuke of the Zionist lobby.


      It shows that it is possible to defeat the Zionist lobby and it is possible to
      win. In fact, you mentioned in your introduction that I’m running for Congress
      right now against, and I’m running against this genocidal warmongering Democrat,
      Adam Smith, who has voted for the genocide repeatedly to send tens of billions
      of dollars to the Israeli state for the genocide. He also voted for the war in
      Iraq back in 2002, and he also voted to create ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].


      And he was bankrolled by the Zionist lobby. In last year’s election, AIPAC was
      his top contributor. He’s also backed by dystopian corporations like Palantir,
      which profit from war and mass slaughter. And so this primary victory of Mamdani
      actually has injected huge confidence in the thousands of people who are supporting
      our campaign here.


      So many people have messaged me personally saying, I’m so excited about this victory
      because it shows that you can defeat the Zionist lobby. So I think, first and
      foremost, we have to recognize what a huge victory that is. It’s also, given how
      relentlessly Mamdani has campaigned using his working class demands, it’s also
      a real boost of confidence for working class people nationally to see that yes,
      working people will fight alongside you if you put forward demands that make a
      huge difference in their lives and which reflect their anger, their just anger
      at the Wall Street billionaires.


      I mean, Mamdani’s campaign has called for a $30 an hour minimum wage, for a rent
      freeze, for free transit, for fully funded childcare. And so these are things
      that working people need. And so if a campaign can succeed on that basis, it shows
      that working people are willing to push forward on those demands.


      And it’s also, I have to say, a resounding rebuke to the union leaders, not the
      rank and file, but the union leaders who endorsed Cuomo in the primary. I mean,
      can you imagine what kind of union leader do you have to be to endorse somebody
      who’s so discredited that he’s even too much of a hot potato for most of the Democrats
      to maintain their own credibility? They don’t want to touch him because he has
      15,000 COVID deaths on his hands.


      He has all kinds of other corruption charges. He also has been accused by at least
      a dozen, probably 13 women of sexual harassment. And so it’s just mind boggling,
      although not surprising. It’s just incredible that the leaders of UFCW [United
      Food and Commercial Workers], of RWDSU [Retail, Wholesale and Department Store
      Union], of the Teamsters, of SEIU [Service Employees International Union], all
      these major unions, the Carpenters, all of them supporting Cuomo.


      So I think they have really been put to shame. And it is important to see that,
      for example, SEIU leaders have already now said they’re endorsing Mamdani. But
      it really exposes the unholy ties of the labor leadership with the Democratic
      establishment. And so I think the question is not, is this a real confirmation
      of the kind of political demands we need to put forward and that the opposition
      to the genocide and the demand to end the genocide, should that be front and center
      of election campaigns in the coming year?


      No, that’s not the question. This has shown that it actually, that’s exactly what
      we should be doing. The outstanding question here is what will it take to win
      any of these demands? And that’s where I think we have to conduct a lot of examination.
      I mean, I think the experience that we had on the Seattle City Council, we, my
      fellow socialists and we, I had the city council office for a decade in Seattle.


      And what it took for us to win the historic victories, many of which you enumerated,
      it took what I would call a fighting strategy. And what does a fighting strategy
      mean? A fighting strategy, first and foremost, means that you understand that
      capitalism is a zero-sum game and that you cannot hope to win any substantial
      victories. I’m not talking about crumbs, but substantial reforms in the interest
      of the working class by thinking that you are going to sweet talk the billionaires
      into agreement with you.


      It also requires understanding that the Democrats and Republicans, despite their
      differences, they both represent the interests of the billionaires of capitalism.
      And so you’re not going to sweet talk them either. And you don’t go into the halls
      of office by thinking that they are your colleagues and that you’re going to have
      good conversations with them and reach some sort of agreement with them. No, you
      have to understand that this is posed as an adversarial task by definition. Working
      people didn’t make it adversarial, capitalism is adversarial towards the working
      class. The only question is, are we gonna fight back or are we going to roll over
      and die?


      And so, again and again and again, what we saw in Seattle was a Democratic Party
      carrying water for the big business entities, for big corporations like Amazon
      and Starbucks, for the Chamber of Commerce, for corporate landlords. And for us
      to win any of these victories that we won, I, first and foremost, had to be clear,
      and all working people alongside me had to be clear that this is class war and
      that the way we win is by using my office to build mass movements and mass movements
      not just to come to city hall and beg the Democrats to do the right thing, but
      mass movements that are defiant in character, that demand that unless you do this,
      we are going to vote you out of office. We’re going to throw you out of office.


      So that adversarial character is fundamental to winning something big. Like, for
      example, the victory that we won on minimum wage, that is the highest wage in
      the nation because part of the battle we waged when we fought for $15 an hour
      was to win inflation increases. The Democrats fought us viciously on that. We
      were still able to prevail. Why? Because I launched the 15 Now Movement in Seattle
      and it mobilized Seattle’s working class in the thousands and so many of them
      were involved in our action conferences.


      It was a democratically organized movement where the rank and file of the movement
      had the say in strategic decisions. We literally had debates and voting. It took
      that strength of the mass of the working class to win not only the nation’s first
      $15 an hour minimum wage, but also inflation increases. And that’s why today Seattle’s
      minimum wage is the highest in the nation at $20.76. So I would just say that
      for the working class to win in New York City will take this similar approach.


      The question is not can Mamdani win through a strategy of playing nice with the
      billionaires? No, that’s not the question because you can’t win that way. All
      of history shows that. The question is, will he do what we did in Seattle, in
      order to win similar victories in New York City?


      Chris Hedges


      Well, that is a break with you. I mean, there’s one strong similarity between
      the campaigns that you ran and the campaigns that he ran. And that is that you
      appealed to disaffected voters on the right or people who just didn’t vote at
      all on these basic economic issues. I find that a kind of parallel.


      But I think the difference, which you just enunciated, is that you always took
      an adversarial position and he has talked about making New York a wonderful place
      for everybody, including billionaires. And I think you’re saying that’s a big
      mistake.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, because in a deeply divided situation like capitalism is, you cannot lose
      sight of the fact of, as I said earlier, that capitalism is a zero sum game. What
      does that mean? It means that when we won the $15 minimum wage, for example, and
      now that it’s gone even higher because of inflation increases being built into
      it, that money is making the lives of the least paid workers, the poorest of the
      working class, much better because even a few dollars extra an hour makes a life
      difference.


      It makes the difference between being able to pay your rent or being evicted and
      then being forced to couch surf again and again, which many families, in fact,
      even families with children are forced to do. But that money comes from the profits
      of the billionaires, the big business entities, the multimillionaires.


      And so it is inevitable that if you fight for something substantial, like a major
      increase in minimum wage, that will create a political clash with big businesses.
      And that’s it’s no surprise that, what’s his name, Bill Ackman, the Trump supporting
      billionaire who is apoplectic about Mamdani’s primary victory, that’s no surprise.
      That is him representing the interests of the billionaire class.


      And so the working class cannot afford to blur the class lines. When I was asked
      repeatedly by reporters, you speak so combatively, but as an elected official,
      aren’t you running to represent all your constituents? They’d asked me that repeatedly.
      You would never catch me saying that I am representing everyone.


      In fact, I reminded them, you know, one of the constituents of my Seattle city
      council district when I was on the city council for 10 years was, and it still
      is, I assume, the billionaire former CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, extremely
      anti-worker, absolutely viciously anti-union, union-busting CEO billionaire. And
      I said, Howard Schultz lives in my district. I don’t represent him and he doesn’t
      agree with me.


      I mean, these are class lines and blurring the lines does not help the working
      class. It actually helps the ruling class. I mean, it sort of signals to the ruling,
      if you say that you’re going to represent everyone, it signals to the ruling class
      that you’re open for conversation. You’re open to discussion with them. And that
      discussion means only one thing, which is that they will push you, put pressure
      on you, and they will use the carrot and the stick to put pressure on you to sell
      out.


      And I’ve experienced all of that. When I first entered City Hall, I’ve experienced
      both the carrot and the stick. There were city council members and also others
      in the Democratic Party who tried to flatter me, make this about me. They said
      things like, well, you are such a superstar, but you need to dissociate yourself
      from this socialist ideology because that’s not going to be good for your political
      career.


      Therein lies the problem, is that no matter how well intentioned you are, and
      let’s assume that new people are well intentioned, no matter how well intentioned
      you are, if you don’t understand that careerism is one of the death knells of
      winning anything substantial for the working class, then you will sell out even
      with those good intentions because you will make it about yourself and you will
      immediately get the memo that in order to fight for working people, you will need
      to be in battle mode every single day when you enter City Hall or the halls of
      Congress because the only other option is for you to sell out because there’s
      no option that you will convince them into agreeing with you.


      Why? Because at the end of the day, the Democratic Party is a party of capitalism
      itself. And yes, there are differences with the Republican Party, but it’s like
      Chomsky said, that there’s a smart way to keep people passive and obedient, and
      that is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively
      debate within that spectrum.


      And so what that means is that in the case of the Democratic and Republican parties
      is that, there are differences between them, but if you don’t understand that
      they both represent the billionaire class and they’re there and their differences
      are there so that the working class can perennially be dangled this, you know,
      you either support Democrats or Republicans. But at end of the day the working
      class loses out more and more and is subjected to more and more misery with every
      passing decade that you’re not going to stand up for working people.


      Chris Hedges


      I think also the mistake is that you complicate this, the billionaire class, which
      Mamdani seems, at least rhetorically, to be saying he can do.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, and in fact, he’s saying that in many concrete ways. For example, in his
      recent MSNBC interview, I think it was just today or yesterday, they played a
      clip of, you know he’s been calling for taxes on the rich, which of course, I
      strongly support. I strongly support all the demands that he’s running on in terms
      of the minimum wage increase, rent freeze, and taxes on the rich, and child care
      funding, and all of that.


      They played a clip of Governor Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, very clearly
      saying she’s not going to be for taxing the rich. She’s very clearly declaring
      that that is absolutely not something that she wants to do. But his response to
      that was again, along those lines of I’m excited to work with her on this. What
      does that mean? I don’t understand what that means.


      I mean, you have to use your interview appearances to speak not to that MSNBC
      journalist who is representing the ruling class line or Governor Kathy Hochul,
      who is an arch-corporate Democrat. She represents a billionaire class. Your interview
      appearances, if you’re a socialist and fighting for working people, has to be
      to speak to the working class audience that’s not in front of you, but millions
      who are watching out there. And your message needs to be, first of all, truthful.


      And being truthful means you cannot send an illusion to the working class that
      somehow Kathy Hochul can be talked into taxing the rich, somehow Bill Ackman can
      be convinced that rent freezes are also in his interest. It will improve his quality
      of life as well. It’s something that Mamdani has said as well, that, if we do
      these progressive things, it will improve the quality of life not only of working
      people, but also of the billionaires.


      That’s simply not true in the sense that the billionaires don’t want to part with
      the billions of dollars that they have. I mean, the $15 minimum wage that we won,
      that meant $3 billion of profits from big business taken away to fund workers.
      And you have to declare that proudly in the sense that you don’t represent the
      billionaire class. As much wealth you can take from them, that’s a good thing.
      That’s a moral thing. That is a just thing. And that is an honorable thing to
      fight for.


      And it is actually disarming working class movements to send them, as I said,
      an illusion that somehow the class lines can be blurred, that somehow you can
      make agreement with the ruling class. And I think that if we want, if Mamdani
      wants to, I don’t know that he doesn’t, I’ll talk about his previous record, but
      if he does want to build movements, and you know, I absolutely want him to do
      it. I absolutely want him to build the movements, and if he’s going to build the
      movements after he’s elected, if he’s elected, I will personally be there wanting
      to rally with him.


      I will personally help the movement to win a $30 minimum wage in New York City
      because if they win, that would be an Earth shattering victory. It would be an
      enormous call to action nationally and it would put a lot of pressure on the Democratic
      Party to push for a $25 an hour minimum wage federally. All of that would be a
      fantastic thing. And like I said, I am pledging here and now that I will be right
      there in New York City pounding the pavement to win any of these victories.


      The question is, will he do what is needed in order to actually win this? And
      in terms of his previous record, the reason I’m expressing skepticism is not that
      I don’t want him to do it. As I said, I really hope that he does it. But it’s
      also my responsibility, I am also representing working people. And it is my obligation,
      my political and moral obligation, to use my platform to speak the truth. Again,
      not to send out illusions, but speak the truth.


      And even if not everybody agrees with me at this moment. But if you look at the
      record that Mamdani has, Mamdani is not new to politics. He won his first state
      assembly, New York state assembly election in 2020. And he has been on the New
      York state legislature for four years and in fact since that time the New York
      DSA which he’s part of, the Democratic Socialist of America, they’ve had eight
      elected officials in the New York state legislature and they have certainly won
      some things but to be honest whatever they have won is far far from commensurate
      to having eight elected positions.


      I mean can you imagine what we would do with eight elected positions? To imagine
      that, look at what we did with one elected position. You know, we, like I said,
      we experienced both the carrot and the stick. So I experienced a lot of flattery,
      but I also experienced a stick. And the stick never goes away. Once the ruling
      class and their parties, the Democrats and Republicans, are clear that you are
      not going to be bought, that you are not going to sell out, then come all the
      vicious attacks, which never relent.


      And so for working people to succeed, we need leadership. And it’s not just about
      elected representatives. It’s also in city hall or Congress. It’s also elected
      leaders in the labor movement, unelected leaders in social movements. We need
      leadership in all of these avenues that are clear that that is what it takes,
      that in order to win for working people, it takes you as the leader to take those
      body blows.


      Because if you don’t, then you’re selling out working class people. That’s what
      you owe. It’s your duty and you should consider it your honor. It’s an honor to
      be able to play this role. But as far as what the New York DSA did in the several
      years that they have had positions, they have not won any victories commensurate
      with having eight elected positions.


      And in fact, it’s really telling that Mamdani himself, he had his two re-elections.
      He was first elected in 2020, then he had his re-elections in 2022, and then last
      year, 2024. And he ran unopposed both years, which means neither the Democrats
      contested him in the primaries, nor did the Republicans run any candidate against
      him in the general election.


      Such a thing does not happen if you are fighting for working class people. Because
      if you are fighting for working class people, you are going to become enemy number
      one to the Democrats and Republicans. There is absolutely no universe where you
      will not have a fight on your hands and let alone run unopposed.


      I mean, in our case, I won all of my four elections on the city council, but every
      subsequent election, the ruling class, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, corporate landlords,
      the Democratic Party, they fought more viciously than they did against me in the
      previous election. In 2019, the most prominent progressive, quote unquote, progressive
      Democrats, they, Latina women, progressive Democrats, they ran, openly ran a candidate
      against me saying, Oh, we agree with her, but she’s just not nice. We need a nice
      guy or whatever. And we defeated them. We defeated Amazon that year.


      And then again, in 2021, my last election, that was not even a scheduled election.
      It was a recall attempt against me by corporate landlords, by Trumpian billionaires,
      and the Democratic Party, and we defeated them also. So it doesn’t reveal everything,
      but it is a rule of thumb. It’s a barometer.


      If your every subsequent election is not a bigger fight than before, then you
      haven’t become a threat to the ruling class. And if you haven’t become a threat
      to the ruling class, then you’re not winning for the working class. You may be
      winning your own elections, but not for the working class.


      Chris Hedges


      Well, they’re clearly going to go after him. I mean, look what they did to you
      as a city council member. He’s running for the mayor of New York [City]. And I
      want to talk about maybe the three entities that will try and take him down. Let’s
      begin first with the Zionists. They aren’t going to take this lightly. He has
      been very courageous about standing with the Palestinians.


      Then let’s talk about the Democratic Party and then let’s talk about the billionaire
      class. These are formidable opponents and the money that will pour into any campaign
      to bring him down will be staggering. It already was, I mean, I think Como got
      $22 million or $25 million. I think Mamdani raised about a million. But those
      numbers will, in terms of funding opposition, will jump exponentially.


      Let’s first start with the Zionists because I did see his victory as essentially
      puncturing that monolithic, especially in New York City, that monolithic power
      that the Zionists have.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, absolutely. I mean, this is a devastating blow actually to the Zionist lobby.
      And the specific thing, I like the choice of words that you said, you said puncturing.
      I think that is an important thing to note because for a long time, it has seemed
      to everyone that it is impossible to defeat the Zionist lobby. We saw what happened
      with Jamaal Bowman, where it was in the Democratic primary that the Zionist lobby
      and AIPAC specifically, poured just unprecedented millions and millions of dollars
      to defeat him.


      And there’s been this idea, they’ve sort of fueled this idea that the Zionist
      lobby and AIPAC and other organizations like that, that they are impervious to
      any opposition from the anti-war movement and that you just have to accept it.
      You just have to accept it. And especially in the Democratic and Republican parties,
      I mean, obviously the Republican party is openly anti-worker, pro-war, they don’t
      even make any bones about it.


      The main challenge as far as working class consciousness is concerned is exposing
      what the Democratic party actually stands for. And the Democratic party is much
      more exposed now than it was before. I mean, the approval ratings are in the toilet.
      The genocide started under Biden. You know, this was a genocidal president with
      a genocidal vice president. So both the candidates in the Democratic primary last
      year were, or from the Democratic party were genocidal candidates running against
      Trump, who’s also warmongering and genocidal.


      So that was the choice, false choice between genocidal and genocidal. That’s the
      kind of realm that we have been operating in. We also saw AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]
      go to the DNC floor and lie through her teeth saying that Kamala Harris was working
      tirelessly for a ceasefire, which we know is complete fabrication.


      Chris Hedges


      I just want to interrupt you when you talked about the disease of careerism. She’s
      kind of the poster child.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, AOC is a poster child for careerism that’s absolutely accurate and that is
      why it is important for us to talk about, you know, have a serious conversation
      about what will it take to win any of these victories in New York City, let alone
      ending the genocide, which is a far harder thing to do.


      Ending the genocide will take ending all US military funding to the Israeli state,
      which if you think about that demand, this is the demand that we are calling for
      in our congressional campaign, that demand pits you directly, directly against
      all of US and Western imperialism. I mean, these are powerful, powerful dystopian
      forces.


      It pits you against multi-billionaires like [Palantir CEO] Alexander Karp, who,
      if you’ve heard him speak, they delight, they positively delight in the mass slaughter
      of Palestinians. I mean, this is happening at another level. In fact, what’s happening
      right now in the Israeli state is at another level.


      So there is a feeling that, for ordinary people, I’m against a genocide, but I
      don’t know what to do because these are just too powerful of an entities, group
      of entities to go up against. So I think that puncturing that idea has been crucial.
      And then I think in order to actually push forward on these demands, then it is
      going to be really that’s where the rubber hits the road, so to say.


      Because from now until the general election of the mayoral election, it’s a question,
      which way will Mamdani move? And I would say that, you know, one thing he has
      going for him is that the Republican opponent is really weak from what I understand.
      Curtis Sliwa, I mean, he’s not like, he’s some credible opponent.


      Chris Hedges


      No, he’s not a credible opponent. They’ll fund Adams, they’ll fund Cuomo, or Ackman
      says he has an unnamed candidate he wants to fund, although, I wonder if an Ackman
      puppet is going to do particularly well. I don’t know.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yeah, I mean, of course, in war and elections, it is foolish to say the last word
      on predictions, as you and I both know. However, I think it is important to note
      that one thing that Mamdani has going for him is that both these Democratic Party
      [candidates] are now, they’re going to run as not Democrats, as whatever, something
      else.


      But regardless, Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, both figures of the Democratic Party
      are so deeply discredited that the chances for Mamdani to actually win are pretty
      strong. The question will be what he does between now and the general election.
      If he not only does not relent on his demands, which he doesn’t seem to be doing,
      I mean, even now he’s relentlessly going for his demands, which is actually a
      very positive thing that I really appreciate that he is making, he’s not shying
      away from the demands for even a second. And he is relentless about them.


      So he needs to keep doing that but in addition to that, I think he needs to, which
      I don’t expect that he will, but I’m just saying what he needs to do in order
      to win, not so much to win the election. That’s my point. I’m trying to disentangle
      the question between winning the election for himself and winning the demands
      that he’s running on.


      Those are two separate questions to some degree because there’s just a favorable
      electoral calculus right now that he’s facing where he could possibly win even
      if he started sliding on his demands, maybe, I don’t know. But it’s certainly
      not the kind of difficult situation that we were facing. But as far as setting
      the stage, as far as using his election campaign for setting the stage to win
      any of these demands, that’s the most paramount question.


      And for that, I’m strongly convinced that he needs to move away from this talking
      point of Oh, billionaires will also love a city with a rent freeze and I’m looking
      forward to working with Kathy Hochul. Moving away from that to saying, look, the
      Democratic Party establishment itself, the Democratic Party itself is opposed
      to the things that I’m calling for. And that’s why I need working people to join
      me, rather than continually bringing up this idea that it’s all about discussions
      and meetings with the powers that be, and I’ll talk to the governor, and I’ll
      talk to the billionaire.


      All this emphasis on the halls of power, instead his talking point should be,
      and we’re calling for a rally on such and such date. I want working people to
      show up. I want Black, white, Latino, Asian, all of you to show up because working
      class people need to fight together. Let’s call for a march for $30 an hour. Let’s
      march around city hall, know, that type of thing, or march outside Bill Ackman’s
      house, I mean, presumably he lives somewhere in Manhattan, something like that.
      March outside Trump Tower. Let’s call big rallies again in Trump Tower.


      And it’s not only that, it’s also for him to say openly, you know, Governor Kathy
      Hochul, she’s selling out workers. She said she does not want any taxes on the
      rich. Do you agree? You know, telling working people, don’t put any faith in Kathy
      Hochul. Don’t put any faith in any of these Democrats.


      Chuck Schumer, he has blood on his hands. Chuck Schumer has blood on his hands.
      Hakeem Jeffries has blood on his hands. Ritchie Torres has blood on his hands.
      That’s the kind of language, I mean, we don’t use this language as Marxists incidentally
      just because, Oh emotions are running high. It’s not like that. It’s about clarifying
      to the working class what is the character of capitalism and its warmongering
      representatives, warmongering anti-worker, anti-union representatives and how
      do you fight against them.


      Those are two very key tasks for revolutionaries. And I think that’s a difference
      between how most what I would call reformist candidates or reformist leaders act
      and how a revolutionary socialist like myself acts where we start by clarifying
      the nature of capitalism itself that is part of revolutionary politics. But ironically,
      Chris, revolutionary politics also makes you the best fighter to win the biggest
      possible reforms because once you understand the class nature of capitalism and
      you understand how working people need to be mobilized, that is what empowers
      your side to go up against all of these forces.


      And that’s what will be needed. For example, like you said, we started with the
      Zionists. You correctly said the Zionists are not going to rest on this. They’re
      not going to say, we give up, he won the primary. No, they’re going to do everything
      in their power to try and defeat him. It’s important that he doesn’t waffle on
      the things that he has already said, Mamdani, and also he needs to go much farther
      along the lines of whatever’s saying.


      Chris Hedges


      Well, he needs to take a lesson from Jeremy Corbyn. These are not people who,
      number one, can be placated or, number two, will not, no matter what you say,
      viciously attempt to bring you down. I want you to talk about what he can expect.
      You experienced constant campaigns to deceit you from the city council.


      He’s running for a much more powerful position. What can he expect from the Zionists?
      What can he expect from the Democratic Party hierarchy and what can you expect
      from the billionaire class? They’ve already announced war, in essence.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, they have declared war against him, and that is why he needs to declare war
      back at them, not try to hug them to death. Part of what we experienced here was
      obviously, if you look at the talking points that big business had against our
      15 Now movement and against the Amazon tax movement, which also you mentioned,
      which raises hundreds of millions of dollars every year for affordable housing,
      including a specific chunk of that money reserved for Black working class and
      poor housing in this historically black neighborhood, which I live in actually,
      which has been denuded of its Black population because of the skyrocketing rents.


      One of the things that they did to discredit all of these demands was to just
      pound the working class on network TV with all kinds of economic falsehoods like,
      like this is just going to be economic apocalypse, you know, $15 an hour will
      shut down all businesses, all of that. So I think the first thing we had to do
      to combat that was relentless political education about how all of this is absolutely
      false.


      What we said was two things. One is we said that all of the studies on minimum
      wage increases have shown and even big minimum wage increases have shown is that
      there’s no business that has actually been shut down because of that. Small businesses
      shut down because of other reasons, the pattern reason being that commercial rent
      is so high that most storefront businesses can’t afford in big cities like Seattle
      and New York City.


      But we also said that if indeed that were true, if indeed they were right, that
      the system is so fragile that by lifting 100,000 workers in Seattle out of poverty,
      just lifting them above, it’s nothing lavish, it’s lifting them above absolute
      dire conditions, is going to collapse the system, then why on Earth are we even
      defending the system in the first place? See, that’s how we posed it. And that
      really helped people understand that, one, that they are completely lying to you,
      but also secondly, even if they weren’t, we still need to fight for better conditions
      because why on Earth are we defending a system that can’t let us have even a modicum
      of dignity in our living standards?


      I mean, that’s part of what they will face. The other thing that will come very
      likely is the kind of red baiting and identity politics that we experienced here.
      So a very, very important example of this is when we were fighting for the Amazon
      tax. We launched the Tax Amazon movement alongside my inauguration after my 2019
      reelection. And it was really important strategic timing because like I said before,
      the 2019 election was a complete pushback against Jeff Bezos and Amazon because
      Amazon specifically and very openly spent millions of dollars trying to defeat
      me and also other progressives, but mainly me because they knew our office was
      the driving force of the whole left wing and working class political agenda.


      And they knew that if I was out, the Democrats wouldn’t do crap for the working
      class. And so in 2020, January, when I was being inaugurated, I turned my inauguration
      into the launch of the Tax Amazon movement. And then you remember that was 2020.
      So a few months later, COVID happened, and then the George Floyd rebellion began.
      At that time, the Democratic Party unleashed this whole group of Black what I
      would call misleaders, Black misleaders, to go around at these protests saying,
      you should not support Kshama Sawant, you should not support the Amazon tax because
      that’s not a Black issue.


      They tried to disrupt many of the rallies that we were holding in solidarity with
      the Black Lives Matter movement saying, you should be talking about Black issues
      and furthermore, you’re not Black so you don’t get to have this platform. And
      we refused to accept that gatekeeping.


      There were many other leaders in who were supporting the tax Amazon movement,
      who immediately barked at that and said, we should not even have our table here
      at this protest because we’re just white allies, we don’t have the right to speak,
      only Black people have the right to speak.


      We absolutely refused to bend to this just corrosiveness of identity politics.
      And we insisted on looking at things from a class lens. And we said that actually,
      these Black misleaders should be utterly ashamed of themselves because by obstructing
      the tax Amazon movement, they are actually hostile to the interests of Black working
      class and poor people because if there’s anybody who needs affordable housing
      the most, it is the Black working class. And the Amazon tax has disproportionately
      benefited the Black working class and poor people.


      So rather than accepting their just destructive gatekeeping, we said, we’re going
      to go directly to Black working people at the protest. And it was phenomenal.
      The support we got for the Amazon tax demand was sky high. The clipboards were
      practically flying out of our hands with people saying, fuck yeah, I want to tax
      Amazon. I’m going to sign that. And it’s hundreds, thousands of people showing
      up to our democratically organized Tax Amazon action conferences. That is what
      put pressure on the Democratic party.


      You know, first they were vicious towards it. And then I suddenly started getting
      friendly phone calls from these progressive Latina Democrats saying you know that
      thing you were talking about you know I’m very interested in that and then we
      won. That is what it takes. I think that in terms of how it plays out in New York
      City, I think it will very much depend on what kind of approach Mamdani takes.
      I mean how much they attack his demands will depend on how much he’s willing to
      fight for it and being willing to fight for it means mobilizing working class
      people. So I think that will be crucial.


      Chris Hedges


      What does this mean in the age of Trump? Trump, of course, immediately went after
      him. I think you and I, for many, many years, have argued that a party or a political
      movement that is focused on social inequality and the betrayal of the working
      class by the Democratic Party could succeed. Is this the rise of a kind of counterweight
      to Trumpian authoritarianism and proto-fascism or not?


      Kshama Sawant


      I think the, and as you said, you alluded to our past discussions, we’ve talked
      about what it will take to defeat Trumpism and right-wing populism, and it’s not
      only Trump, it’s the Trumpism phenomenon. And it will take working class solidarity
      around class-based demands to defeat the ideas of the right-wing, and it will
      take us to recognizing where the origin of any traction, any credence to right-wing
      ideas.


      And that comes from the complete failure of and betrayals by the Democratic Party.
      But it’s not only the Democratic Party. We have to talk about the labor leadership
      as well, which has betrayed the interests of the working class, obviously their
      own members, by being tied at the hip to the Democratic Party, even in the face
      of a genocide. That needs to be mentioned as well.


      The question is if genocide is not a line you’re not willing to cross as a working-class
      leader, then there is no line you’re not willing to cross as a working-class leader.
      I think that point needs to be made. So many of these unions, their leaderships
      have passed ceasefire resolutions, but those ceasefire resolutions mean little
      if then the leaderships turn around and support the parties of genocide themselves.


      I mean, Shawn Fain famously went on the DNC floor, Shawn Fain being the president
      of UAW [United Auto Workers], which is one of the unions that has supported Mamdani
      to its credit and also has passed a ceasefire resolution. But at the end of the
      day, how much does that amount to if you’re then turning around and still supporting
      the candidates and the parties of genocide? And I think that it is also revealing
      who Mamdani holds as his role models. I think you talked about how AOC is the
      poster child for careerism. I think that’s very important to note because, and
      Bernie Sanders was not exactly like her, I think he’s well-intentioned, it’s just
      his political analysis is extremely flawed.


      And he thinks that now completely capitulating to the Democratic Party and to
      the genocide and to attacks on workers like the Democrats blocking and breaking
      the railroad workers strike in 2022, which AOC was part of, that that’s the best
      that the working class can get.


      But regardless of their individual differences, the truth about AOC and Bernie
      Sanders is that both of them have campaigned, I mean, Bernie Sanders much more
      relentlessly, but AOC did initially campaign on Medicare for All, $15 an hour
      minimum wage and a Green New Deal.


      And like I said, I commend Mamdani for being relentless about those demands. But
      Bernie Sanders has also been relentless about those demands. He still is talking
      about, I mean, he’s less relentless than before because he doesn’t want to embarrass
      the Democrats, which is itself rotten. However, the point is that they both have
      campaigned on these demands. And not a thing, not a thing has been won for the
      working class.


      The metric cannot be, are they talking about those demands? The metric has to
      be, what have they won? In the last five, six years, what have they done? And
      what has happened to working class agendas in that interim? Bernie Sanders’ two
      campaigns were completely destroyed by the Democratic Party.


      And last year, the Democratic Party showed that they would much rather allow somebody
      who they call a fascist and an existential threat, allow that person to be elected
      than allow even a shadow of working-class agenda to enter their purview. Like
      they did not even want Kamala Harris to even lie. I mean just fucking lie that
      okay I’m going to do something about the genocide or maybe I’ll talk about 15
      [dollars minimum wage]. If she had done a little bit of murmuring towards the
      working class and she would have tipped the scales very likely. They were not
      even willing to do that. Why?


      Because they don’t want to create expectations among working class people that
      they will do anything at all for them. Because they want to hold the line. They
      are the billionaire class representatives, just like the Republicans are. And
      they don’t want to create any such idea that, Oh, the working class can expect
      anything from them. So what they want to do is they want the working class to
      be permanently attached to them and keep voting them in.


      But they want to do it on the basis of not doing anything for the working class.
      And that contradiction, that conundrum is what has led them to this sorry state
      where they have the lowest approval ratings historically. But at the same time,
      if we don’t provide an alternative to them, then they’re probably going to make
      gains in the midterm elections because people are also angry at Trump. And Trump
      is no alternative either.


      And so for defeating the right wing, we will need a break from the Democratic
      Party. And that might sound like a contradiction in terms of that. That’s precisely
      what we need because it is the Democratic Party that has given you Donald Trump.
      The Democratic Party are the best builders of Trumpism. And in order to destroy
      Trumpism, you need to destroy the Democratic Party. And that comes first with
      breaking your ties with the Democratic Party.


      And here’s what I have to say whom Mamdani has listed as his role models is a
      very telling story to me. Mamdani has said that he is very inspired by, I mean,
      I’m not quoting him. I’m paraphrasing what he said. He’s very inspired by Boston
      governor Michelle Wu. Michelle Wu ran on housing demands. She also brought them
      up relentlessly. She talked about rent control relentlessly. What has she done
      after she got into office? Completely betray working class renters. I mean, just
      completely.


      He has also said that former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was the best in
      his, Mamdani’s, lifetime. You know what? Among other attacks on unions and workers,
      Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo together in 2018 upheld the Taylor Law
      of New York, which has a draconian strike ban on public sector unions. According
      to an article in DSA-aligned publication, Jacobin, this New York strike ban, this
      is a quote, makes red state anti-strike laws look like pieces of fluff.


      And keep in mind, 2018 was the year of the historic public school teacher strikes
      in red states, starting with West Virginia. The Jacobin article also says, the
      next time a new Republican governor works up the nerve to enforce anti-strike
      laws against public workers, they’ll have the satisfaction of piggybacking on
      those Democratic friends of labor — Cuomo and de Blasio.


      So, I mean, so he has stated AOC, Bernie Sanders, Michelle Wu, and de Blasio all
      as his inspirations, and they all have a record of selling out working class people.
      One last thing that he has said, he has also repeatedly cited and effusively praised
      former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a Republican mayor who
      was supported at the time in 1941, during the war, he was running for reelection
      and he was supported by the rotten Stalinists.


      And they supported him against Trotskyist James Cannon. He was a Trotskyist at
      the time, who ran on a pro-worker anti-war platform. And one of the things LaGuardia
      did was brutally go after striking transport workers, basically telling them that
      the country is at war. So municipal workers don’t have the right to go on strike.
      So your viewers can reach their own conclusions about what it means when somebody
      ties themselves so closely to a whole string of people who have a track record
      of having sold out workers.


      Chris Hedges


      Let’s just close by talking about your own campaign. Where are you? What are you
      up against? You mentioned at the beginning of the interview a little bit about
      who you’re running against.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, we’re running for US Congress from Washington state’s ninth congressional
      district, which includes a part of Seattle and also many other neighboring cities
      where there are lots of rich people. There’s lots of billionaires, but there’s
      also lots of working class people, lots of refugees. It’s a majority minority
      district. The district has a lot of people who have personally faced losses, family
      losses in Gaza through the genocide.


      There are many East African and East Asian and South Asian working class people
      who live here, many of whom are struggling to get by. And we are running against
      Adam Smith, who has been in Congress for nearly 30 years. And he, as I said before,
      has repeatedly voted to send tens of billions of dollars of funding to the Israeli
      military throughout the genocide.


      That’s not the first time, he has voted to send money to Israel over and over
      during his nearly 30 year career. But especially notable is that he has repeatedly
      voted to fund the genocide. And he is, not surprisingly, he is a favorite of the
      military contractors. We know that both Democratic and Republican parties are
      warmongering parties. They have been purveyors of endless brutal war throughout
      their history and Adam Smith is one of the generals among the warhawks.


      He is not a foot soldier. He has never met a war that he didn’t like. He has demonized
      anti-genocide activists as totalitarian, as extremists, as left-wing fascists.
      He has called for them to be arrested. He also holds the shameful distinction
      of being one of only five sitting Democratic Congress members who voted for the
      Iraq war, as I said, in 2002.


      He supported the wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and the
      current bloody inter-imperialist proxy war in Ukraine. He has been bankrolled
      for three decades by weapons industry profiteers, such as Lockheed Martin, General
      Dynamics, and Palantir, as I mentioned earlier. And he’s a darling of AIPAC and
      the Zionist lobby.


      As I said, AIPAC was his biggest funder last year. Just to contrast between our
      campaign and him, in the summer of 2014, that was my second year on the city council,
      I used my city council position not only to attend protests against Israel’s indiscriminate
      bombardment of Gaza at the time, but also to draft a public letter calling for
      an end to all US military aid to Israel and the brutal settlements in Palestinian
      territories and the occupation.


      During that same time that I was doing that, Adam Smith was enthusiastically backing
      Israel’s Iron Dome system, which as we know is one of the key components in enabling
      the Israeli state slaughter apparatus against the Palestinian people. And in the
      final days of my decade in City Hall in October and November of 2023, I was fighting
      to win.


      And we did win, despite the opposition of the Democrats, the second at the time
      and the strongest city council resolution calling for a ceasefire and an end to
      all US military aid to Israel. At that same moment, Smith was part of Biden’s
      cabal that was monstrously insisting on over $100 billion of military funding
      for not just Israel, but also for Ukraine, instead of funding the needs of the
      cost of living crisis here, faced by working people here.


      And he’s also just one of the most thoroughly corporate, pro-corporate politicians.
      And in fact, our race against Adam Smith goes to your other question as well,
      is what will it take to defeat the right wing? It will take destroying the Democratic
      Party, and that begins also, as I said, defeating Congress members like Adam Smith
      because during the George W. Bush presidency, when the nation was, of course,
      going rightward because of the rightward push by the Bush presidency, Smith, instead
      of advising that the Democrats should be more pro-working class, less pro-war,
      his advice to Democrats was to reduce the contrast between themselves and the
      Republicans.


      And at that time, he said the Democratic Party should consider privatizing Medicare.
      So it’s no surprise there that notorious corporations like UnitedHealthcare, which
      ferociously oppose Medicare for All, have also donated to Smith’s campaign. He
      also voted in favor of the bailout of big banks in 2008 while ordinary people
      were left to rot. So this is his track record.


      We have our track record from the city council, from the decade on the city council,
      having won historic victories for the working class. This congressional campaign,
      just like all of our election campaigns, is not in service of my personal political
      career. It is a vehicle to build movements and the movements we are specifically
      focusing on through our congressional campaign is to end the genocide, end the
      US military funding, end the occupation.


      And we’re also calling for stop stopping all the deportations and shutting down
      the detention centers. And we are also fighting for free health care for all funded
      by taxing the rich and for rent control nationally. In fact, we are pairing the
      congressional campaign with a Seattle citywide ballot initiative campaign for
      free healthcare for all, funded by increasing the Amazon tax that we’ve already
      won, increasing it to $5 billion.


      So this is a campaign for all working people who want to win big victories for
      ourselves, send a stinging message to the ruling class, to the Zionist lobby.
      So nationally, whoever is listening, whoever is watching this, you need to get
      involved in this campaign. We actually, you know something exciting is that we
      had a target of raising 100,000 working class donations within the first month
      of our campaign.


      We smashed that target in the first three weeks. And within the first month of
      our campaign, we have more than a thousand separate donors. That is more donors
      than Adam Smith had last year in his entire election. He needs fewer donors because
      he has all this warmongering and pro-billionaire PACs that are funding his campaigns.


      We are a working-class campaign and as I’ve done every single year of my city
      council office, if I’m elected to Congress, I will take home only the average
      workers wage and donate the rest after taxes to building strike actions for the
      union movement and for building the anti-war movement.

    paragraph_summary: Zohran Mamdani's recent victory in the New York City Democratic
      mayoral primary has sent shockwaves through American politics, particularly due
      to his self-identification as a democratic socialist and his strong stance against
      the genocide in Gaza. His campaign, which focused on affordability and working-class
      demands, has drawn significant backlash from the billionaire class and political
      elites, including calls for his deportation from some prominent figures. Kshama
      Sawant, a former Seattle city councilmember and current congressional candidate,
      commended Mamdani's win as a sign that the Zionist lobby can be challenged and
      that working-class movements can thrive. However, she cautioned that Mamdani must
      remain committed to his promises and adopt a combative stance against the entrenched
      interests of the Democratic Party, which she argues ultimately serves capitalist
      interests. Sawant emphasized the importance of maintaining an adversarial approach
      to achieve substantial reforms for the working class, drawing on her own experiences
      in Seattle, where she successfully fought for significant labor rights and social
      policies.

      The damage assessment in Israel from Iran’s counterattack against Tel Aviv’s unprovoked
      aggression against Iran last month is coming in.


      Despite strenuous efforts by Israeli authorities to suppress news from bomb sites,
      the extent of the destruction suffered by Israel is now being revealed.


      The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Monday that the vaunted Israeli air defense
      system, headlined by the so-called Iron Dome, failed to prevent a significant
      inundation of Iranian ordnance.


      Some single ballistic missiles landing on Israeli streets damaged a wide area
      of surrounding buildings purely from the vibrations of the impact, the newspaper
      reported.


      “Throughout Israel, between the shock waves and the direct impact of the heavy
      Iranian missiles, the destruction spread out over hundreds of meters,” Haaretz
      said. “Thousands of houses and buildings have been damaged, some severely, with
      exterior and interior walls collapsing.”


      “The common denominator is the person uprooted from his or her home, who will
      feel the shock for years,” the paper said. It further reported:


      “In Tel Aviv, 480 buildings have been damaged, many of them badly, at five separate
      sites. In Ramat Gan, it’s 237 buildings at three sites, about 10 badly. In another
      Tel Aviv suburb, Bat Yam, 78 buildings were damaged by one hit; 22 will have to
      be razed. The Israel Tax Authority has received applications for financial assistance
      for nearly 33,000 damaged structures. Another 4,450 files have been opened for
      the loss of belongings and equipment, and another 4,119 for damaged vehicles”.


      The Iranian attacks killed 29 Israeli civilians and, according to a Haaretz map,
      96 buildings were severely damaged.


      By contrast, in the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 42 Scud missiles at Tel Aviv and
      Haifa, killing two Israelis and damaging 4,100 buildings, destroying 28.


      The Haaretz report deals only with civilian buildings. Iran also hit a number
      of Israeli military bases, including Kirya and Camp Moshe Dayan in Tel Aviv; as
      well as the BAZAN oil refinery in Haifa, causing significant damage; and the Weizmann
      Institute of Science in Rehovot, destroying two buildings.

      As the dust settles on the “12 Day War”, it is ever-clearer that the conflict
      was a crushing defeat for Israel and the US. In retrospect, the Zionist entity’s
      sole success was a wave of assassinations in the conflict’s first hours. A fawning
      June 19th Financial Times report hinted cutting-edge technology drawing together
      diverse data and intelligence sources was responsible. This raises the obvious
      question of whether Tel Aviv was assisted in its murderous spree by notorious
      private spying giant Palantir.


      An avowedly pro-Israel tech giant founded by Donald Trump confidante and ardent
      Zionist Peter Thiel, which reportedly provides artificial intelligence tech supporting
      Tel Aviv’s genocide in Gaza, Palantir’s tendrils extend typically unseen into
      almost every conceivable sphere of public and private life across the West. Moreover,
      the firm – launched with seed funding from CIA venture capital wing In-Q-Tel –
      has long-played a pivotal but barely acknowledged role in the International Atomic
      Energy Agency’s monitoring of Tehran’s nuclear research.


      The interpretation Palantir was one way or another involved in Israel’s illegal
      “preemptive” war of aggression against Tehran is amply reinforced by the release
      of sensitive Israeli documents by Iran’s intelligence ministry. These files indicate
      the IAEA previously provided Israeli intelligence with the names of several Iranian
      nuclear scientists, who were subsequently assassinated. Additionally, current
      Association chief Rafael Grossi enjoys a close, long-running, clandestine relationship
      with Israeli officials. Subsequent disclosures could expose the IAEA’s dark alliance
      with Palantir.


      ‘Fishing Expedition’


      In July 2015, the Obama administration inked the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
      with Tehran. Under its auspices, in return for sanctions relief, the IAEA was
      granted unimpeded access to Iran’s nuclear facilities, to ensure the Islamic Republic
      was not developing nuclear weapons. Vast amounts of information on and within
      the sites, including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents
      were collected along the way. The Association consistently found Iran was stringently
      adhering to the JCPOA’s terms.


      Following Trump’s first inauguration however, the JCPOA began to come apart at
      the seams. In October 2017, he refused to certify Iran’s compliance with its obligations
      on bogus grounds, and began threatening to tear up the agreement outright and
      reimpose sanctions. The next March, then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano sounded
      alarm over this prospect, claiming the JCPOA had produced “the world’s most robust
      [nuclear] verification regime” in Iran, and its cessation would represent a “great
      loss”. He went on to boast of how Association inspectors:


      “Now spend 3,000 calendar days per year on the ground in Iran. We have installed
      some 2,000 tamper-proof seals on nuclear material and equipment. We have carried
      out more than 60 complementary accesses [unannounced inspections] and visited
      more than 190 buildings…We collect and analyse hundreds of thousands of images
      captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras…about half of the total
      number of such images that we collect throughout the world. We collect over one
      million pieces of open source information each month.”


      Amano added IAEA activities in Tehran were “supported by state-of-the-art technology,
      including data collecting and processing systems.” Unmentioned was that these
      innovative resources were provided by Palantir. The company’s central role in
      scrutinizing Iran’s nuclear compliance and intimate handshake with the IAEA was
      revealed two months later by Bloomberg, mere days before the Trump administration
      shredded the Agreement and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.
      Former US energy secretary Ernest Moniz effusively praised Palantir’s contribution:


      “We have a completely unique and unparalleled intrusive verification regime that
      was not there before the agreement.”


      A tool dubbed Mosaic served as “the analytical core” and “platform of choice”
      for the IAEA’s verification mission in Iran. The software helped the Association
      “plan and justify unscheduled probes”, collating and processing data from around
      400 million “digital objects” globally, “including social media feeds and satellite
      photographs.” Mosaic was also charged with examining en-masse documents not only
      collected by the IAEA, but tens of thousands of sensitive files stolen by Mossad
      from Tehran.


      Bloomberg quoted Ali Vaez, International Crisis Group’s Iran Project director,
      as expressing concern about Mosaic analysing “dirty” data obtained by Mossad,
      “which prides itself on deception.” After all, “even a small amount of false information
      could trigger a flurry of unnecessary snap inspections and derail an agreement
      that took years to reach.” The broader the terms of Palantir’s work with the IAEA,
      the more the mission “appears as a fishing expedition,” Vaez fretted, suggesting
      Iran could become less willing “to open its doors to inspectors.”


      Vaez’s comments were eerily prophetic. Recent disclosures of intensive collusion
      between the IAEA and Zionist entity authorities, and the resultant prospect Association
      inspections assisted Israeli and US attacks on Tehran, prompted Iranian lawmakers
      to unanimously pass legislation indefinitely suspending cooperation with the Association
      on June 25th. It is unlikely IAEA inspectors will ever be permitted to tread on
      the Islamic Republic’s territory again. But Bloomberg highlighted a number of
      other anxieties that have only gained in gravity in light of recent events.


      ‘False Assumption’


      For one, the outlet recorded how Palantir’s IAEA role granted the company “access
      to information that governments don’t,” while questioning whether “an international
      agency known for its independence” could truly remain neutral and objective given
      “Thiel’s close personal ties to Trump.” Furthermore, Bloomberg noted the Association’s
      Palantir-provided “enhanced investigative abilities” had “raised concern that
      the IAEA may overstep the boundary between nuclear monitoring and intelligence-gathering,”
      transforming its inspectors into unwitting “potential cyber sleuths.”


      Such fears were only exacerbated by Mosaic being based upon Palantir’s highly
      controversial “predictive-policing software”. For the IAEA, this capability turned
      “databases of classified information into maps” helping “inspectors visualize
      ties between the people, places and material involved in nuclear activities” in
      Tehran. The risk of innocent Iranian civilians being made targets for surveillance,
      harassment, or even assassination created by erroneous data being fed into and/or
      pumped out by Mosaic is gargantuan.


      Bloomberg quoted a representative of a British company “that advises governments
      on verification issues” as saying “predictive-analysis” systems were extremely
      vulnerable to such corruption, “either by accident or design.” He noted, “you
      will generate a false return if you add a false assumption into the system…[and]
      end up convincing yourself that shadows are real.” Of course, a dangerous “false
      assumption” lay at the very core of the IAEA’s inspection mission in Iran – namely,
      that Tehran was developing nukes in the first place.


      The Islamic Republic has for decades consistently denied any suggestion it harbours
      ambitions to possess nuclear weapons. Her denials were corroborated by a November
      2007 US National Intelligence Estimate expressing “high confidence that in fall
      2003, Tehran halted” any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment
      remained unchanged for several years, and was reportedly shared by Mossad. As
      Bloomberg recorded, come May 2018 the IAEA had “certified Iran’s work 10 times.”


      In March 2025, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified to Congress
      that Iran had not restarted the nuclear weapons program it halted in 2003. On
      June 17th, with the 12 Day War well-underway, IAEA chief Grossi declared “we did
      not have any proof of a systematic effort” by Tehran “to move into a nuclear weapon.”
      Yet, Israel justified its attacks based on an intelligence dossier that concluded
      the Islamic Republic had in fact reached the “point of no return” in acquiring
      nukes.


      That dodgy dossier depended in no small part on the findings of a May IAEA report.
      The document provided no new information – its dubious charges related “to activities
      dating back decades” at three sites where purportedly, until the early 2000s,
      “undeclared nuclear material” was handled. If this report was analysed by Palantir’s
      “predictive-analysis” systems, it is all but inevitable false results and connections
      would’ve been created, in turn influencing the Zionist entity’s targets and strategy.


      One of the “predictive policing” tools innovated by Palantir guiding Mosaic’s
      operations is Gotham, which is used by an uncertain number of Western law enforcement
      agencies. Leaked documents on the resource show it collects an extraordinary volume
      of data on entire populations – whether they are law-abiding, suspected of having
      committed a crime, or simply connected to individuals accused of wrongdoing. This
      includes sex, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots,
      surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, and identifying
      features such as tattoos.


      Slide from leaked Gotham training presentation


      In October 2024, a major Norwegian asset manager divested from Palantir due to
      the company offering “AI-based predictive policing systems”, aiding the Zionist
      entity’s mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. These systems
      are designed “to identify individuals who are likely to launch ‘lone wolf terrorist’
      attacks, facilitating their arrests preemptively before the strikes that it is
      projected they would carry out.” Their deployment results in countless Palestinians
      languishing in Israeli dungeons without charge or trial.


      If Mosaic informed the Zionist entity’s strategy during the 12 Day War, that may
      account for why individuals with no connection whatsoever to Iran’s civilian nuclear
      program were directly targeted for assassination. This includes Majid Tajan Jari,
      a prominent professor in the field of AI locally, slain in an Israeli strike on
      a residential building in Tehran on June 16th. Yet, reliance on faulty or false
      information collated by Mosaic would simultaneously explain the conflict ending
      in embarrassing defeat for Israel, and victory for Tehran.

    paragraph_summary: The article by Kit Klarenberg discusses the implications of the
      recent "12 Day War," portraying it as a significant defeat for Israel and the
      U.S., with a focus on the role of Palantir, a tech company founded by Peter Thiel.
      It suggests that Palantir's advanced data analytics technology may have facilitated
      Israeli operations during the conflict, including targeted assassinations. The
      piece highlights concerns about the company's involvement with the International
      Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in monitoring Iran's nuclear activities, suggesting
      that this relationship may have compromised the IAEA's neutrality and led to intelligence-gathering
      that could support Israeli military actions. The article raises alarms about the
      potential misuse of data and predictive policing technologies, arguing that reliance
      on flawed information could have dire consequences, including wrongful targeting
      and increased tensions between Iran and Israel. Overall, it critiques the intertwining
      of technology, intelligence, and military strategy in contemporary conflicts,
      emphasizing the need for independent journalism to uncover these complex dynamics.

      By Chuck Collins / Inequality.org


      The private jet lobby is pushing hard for a massive tax break for billionaires
      and centi-millionaires that use the most polluting form of transportation on the
      planet.


      Legislation rapidly moving through Congress, the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”
      — really a Big Ugly Grift (BUG) — includes a massive tax subsidy for private jet
      buyers. Instead of corporations deducting the purchase of their jets over several
      years of their useful life, the BUG includes 100 percent “bonus depreciation”
      in the year of purchase.


      For example, a corporation purchasing a $50 million private jet could potentially
      deduct the entire $50 million from their taxes in the year of the purchase, rather
      than spreading the deduction over many years. This amounts to a massive taxpayer
      subsidy, as ordinary taxpayers pick up the tab for the private jet industry and
      billionaire high flyers.


      From our IPS research on private jets, we know that regular taxpayers and commercial
      air travelers subsidize the high-flying excess of private jet owners. In the U.S.
      private jets use seven percent of the airspace but only contribute 0.6 percent
      of the cost of using it.


      As wealth has concentrated into the vaults of the ultra-wealthy, the demand for
      private jets is surging. Every billionaire appears to need one or two. As a result,
      private jets are one of the largest and fastest growing sources of air and climate
      pollution. In 2023, private jets emitted 19.5 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG)
      emissions, a 25 percent increase over 2013 levels.


      A new study, from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), analyzed
      global private jet pollution and emissions for 2023. They found that private jets,
      which account for about four percent of all global aviation, together emitted
      more GHG than all flights departing from Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport
      in Europe.


      ICCT, the researchers best known for uncovering the Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal,
      have developed the first global mapping of private jet air and climate pollution,
      spatially locating more than 90 percent of private jet activity and emissions
      to airports and countries.


      The study found that private jet activity and emissions are overwhelmingly concentrated
      in the U.S. In 2023, private jets departing U.S. airports accounted for 65 percent
      of flights and 55 percent of all private jet GHG emissions globally. Eighteen
      of the twenty most polluting airports are based in the U.S. That includes Hanscom
      Field outside of Boston, the locus of a huge campaign to block private jet hangar
      expansion.


      Private jet travel originating in Florida and Texas generated more private jet
      operations and emissions than the entire European Union combined, according to
      the ICCT study. A private jet emits about 810 tons of GHGs in a typical year,
      equivalent to 177 passenger cars or nine Class 8 heavy-duty trucks.


      Many private jet flights are short hops, less than 560 miles and two hours, and
      the majority are for recreational purposes, not for business meetings. In France,
      there are proposals to ban short hop flights, especially when other transportation
      options exist.


      Instead of subsidizing private jets through the tax code, we should tax private
      jet fuels to ensure they reflect their real environmental costs. “As wealth inequality
      explodes globally, policymakers have begun to ask why private jet taxes are so
      low,” said Dan Rutherford, co-author of the ICCT report. “Given the slow pace
      of technological progress, it’s reasonable to charge ultrawealthy travelers more
      for their pollution.”


      A tax on jet fuel could generate substantial revenue for high-speed rail and other
      decarbonization priorities. A global private jet fuel tax, modeled after Senator
      Ed Markey’s U.S. private jet fuel tax, could generate $3 trillion a year to offset
      the harms of private jet excess.


      Subsidizing more private jets on a warming planet is reckless and indefensible.
      As Rutherford observes, “Private jets are like the canary in the coal mine here
      for a hyper unequal warming world.” Including tax breaks in the new tax bill reveals
      the pro-billionaire bias of Congress.

      By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost


      War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese,
      Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations
      and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet
      Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc.,
      Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with
      banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities,
      which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation
      and the genocide of Palestinians.


      The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate
      with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be
      held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption”
      as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant
      supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors
      and private and public institutions profit freely.”


      The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation
      Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility
      of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This
      new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice
      place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and
      unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement
      with Palestinians enables their self-determination.”


      “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable
      for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities,
      including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses
      and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited
      Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and
      even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of
      genocide.”


      In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to
      test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now
      are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.”


      You can see my interview with Albanese here.


      The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery
      required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship,
      livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.”


      The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of
      Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and
      water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by
      “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural
      resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods
      and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.”


      “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at
      least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes.


      Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance
      into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities —
      centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology
      underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked
      or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have
      obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.”


      Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate
      targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously
      used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in
      the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza,
      preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.”


      The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for
      cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools
      powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United
      States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’”


      Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its
      two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel
      Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships
      with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United
      States-based Lockheed Martin.”


      “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet,
      which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and
      domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets
      have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to
      drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure
      more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.”


      “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines
      in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied
      by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter
      jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past
      two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions
      such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired
      automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.”


      Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery
      for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.”


      “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components,
      parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied
      military equipment post-October 2023.”


      There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024
      – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated
      a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially
      producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.”


      At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing
      dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while
      profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the
      occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services,
      from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced
      tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing,
      artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.”


      “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the
      report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus
      spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian
      activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights
      defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance
      technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.”


      IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of
      punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics,
      train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner
      in this current genocide.


      It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military
      and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine
      operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with
      counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance.


      “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the
      Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental
      use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit
      regime of Israel,” the report notes.


      Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police,
      universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating
      its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring
      Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.”


      “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing
      volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report
      reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a
      $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense
      expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.”


      Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access
      to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing,
      decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.”


      The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence
      systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate
      lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature
      of artificial intelligence.”


      There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology
      Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive
      policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction
      and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform,
      which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.”


      Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians
      in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.”


      “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial
      occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment
      from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land,
      demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure.
      Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying
      70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.”


      Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment
      used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive
      wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie.


      “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded
      core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity
      since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing
      Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire
      dollar contract with Israel.”


      “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the
      Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been
      linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through
      exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads.


      “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in
      the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what
      replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading
      materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies
      as if to a regular holiday destination.”


      “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded
      with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population
      in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes.


      These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators
      and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials
      AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from
      the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.”
      The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport
      infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting
      them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.”


      Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli
      and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty
      LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee
      KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller
      Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly
      sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments
      in colonies.”


      Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel
      rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food
      conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank.


      In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy
      (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas
      from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million
      in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per
      cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership
      of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime
      territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.”


      BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude
      oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the
      Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil
      fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil
      between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian
      oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel.
      Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.”


      “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing
      to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation
      and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report
      reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has
      serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration
      of Gaza. ”


      International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through
      the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds.


      “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have
      played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads.
      “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3
      per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel
      funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion
      in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic
      new shekel market.”


      The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas
      and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international
      and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium,
      despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68
      million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO
      ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased
      them.”


      Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects,
      including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions
      abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads.


      “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion
      and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms
      such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries
      for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends
      of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent
      over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including
      some that train extremist settlers.”


      The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and
      institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research
      funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm
      control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023
      — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.”


      You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between
      the university Israeli military here.


      Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel
      could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem.
      These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians
      and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units
      decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held
      accountable.

    paragraph_summary: In a revealing report by Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur
      on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, it is highlighted that numerous corporations
      and institutions, including major tech and defense companies, are profiting from
      the ongoing occupation and genocide of Palestinians, in violation of international
      law. The report identifies 48 corporations, including Palantir Technologies, Lockheed
      Martin, and Amazon, that have financial ties to Israel, facilitating the military's
      operations and contributing to the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and
      lives. It argues that the Israeli occupation serves as a lucrative testing ground
      for military technologies, with corporations exploiting Palestinian resources
      and labor while generating significant profits. The report calls for these entities
      to sever their ties with Israel or face accountability for their complicity in
      war crimes, emphasizing that the genocide in Gaza is sustained by a vast network
      of financial and institutional support, making these companies and organizations
      equally culpable in the violence against Palestinians.

      Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani made clear on Tuesday
      that he would not be intimidated by Republican U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat
      to arrest him.


      A journalist who falsely described Mamdani—a democratic socialist—as a “communist”
      asked Trump about the candidate’s pledge not to cooperate with U.S. Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents are working to carry out the president’s
      promised mass deportations.


      “Well then, we’ll have to arrest him,” said Trump, a former New Yorker who has
      taken aim at Mamdani since his victory in last Tuesday’s Democratic primary. “Look,
      we don’t need a communist in this country.”


      Q: You message to communist Zohran Mamdani?




      TRUMP: Well then, we''ll have to arrest him pic.twitter.com/3YbylPK2MS — Aaron
      Rupar (@atrupar) July 1, 2025


      Mamdani, who currently serves in the New York State Assembly, was born in Uganda
      to Indian parents and moved to NYC as a child. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen
      in 2018. Throughout his campaign, the 33-year-old has faced numerous Islamophobic
      attacks, and after his primary win, Congressman Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) urged the
      Trump administration to target him with “denaturalization proceedings,” in line
      with a broader effort at the Department of Justice (DOJ).


      Trump said Tuesday that his administration would be watching Mamdani “very carefully.”
      The president, a well-documented liar, added that “a lot of people are saying
      he’s here illegally—you know, we’re gonna look at everything… and ideally he’s
      gonna turn out to be much less than a communist, but right now he’s a communist,
      that’s not a socialist.”


      Trump also blasted Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a supporter
      of Mamdani, and praised the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams, who is seeking another
      term as an Independent. After Trump returned to office in January, the DOJ instructed
      prosecutors to drop federal corruption charges against Adams, triggering widespread
      outrage over the attempted “illegal quid pro quo,” as some critics called it.


      Trump falsely suggests @ZohranKMamdani is in the country "illegally" calls him
      a communist (he''s a Dem socialist) and then then goes on to call @ericadamsfornyc
      a "very good person" who he "helped out a little bit." pic.twitter.com/7tOoULgPek
      — Gloria Pazmino (@GloriaPazmino) July 1, 2025


      Responding to Trump’s remarks in a lengthy statement, Mamdani said Tuesday that
      “the president of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped
      of my citizenship, put in a detention camp, and deported. Not because I have broken
      any law, but because I will refuse to let ICE terrorize our city.”


      “His statements don’t just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt
      to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: If you
      speak up, they will come for you,” Mamdani continued. “We will not accept this
      intimidation.”


      “That Trump included praise for Eric Adams in his authoritarian threats is unsurprising,
      but highlights the urgency of bringing an end to this mayor’s time in City Hall,”
      he asserted, directing attention to the GOP budget bill advanced by the U.S. Senate
      on Tuesday.


      Mamdani said that “at this very moment, when MAGA Republicans are attempting to
      destroy the social safety net, kick millions of New Yorkers off of healthcare,
      and enrich their billionaire donors at the expense of working families, it is
      a scandal that Eric Adams echoes this president’s division, distraction, and hatred.
      Voters will resoundingly reject it in November.”


      In addition to Mamdani and Adams, the general election candidates are Republican
      Curtis Sliwa, Independent Jim Walden, and disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew
      Cuomo, who is now running as an Independent after losing the Democratic primary.
      According to results released Tuesday, Mamdani got 56% of the vote compared to
      Cuomo’s 44%.

      vowed to resist intimidation after Donald Trump threatened to arrest him for his
      refusal to cooperate with ICE, framing the threat as an attack on democracy and
      a message to those who speak out against oppression.
    paragraph_summary: Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has
      responded defiantly to threats from former President Donald Trump, who suggested
      Mamdani could be arrested for his refusal to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and
      Customs Enforcement (ICE) and falsely labeled him a "communist." Mamdani, a democratic
      socialist and current New York State Assembly member, condemned Trump's remarks
      as an attack on democracy and a message of intimidation aimed at those who oppose
      the administration's policies. He emphasized the need to stand against such threats,
      particularly in light of ongoing efforts by MAGA Republicans to undermine social
      safety nets and healthcare for working families. Mamdani recently won the Democratic
      primary with 56% of the vote, positioning him against a field that includes former
      Governor Andrew Cuomo and current Mayor Eric Adams, who has been criticized for
      his ties to Trump.

      The Trump administration has approved a new arms deal for Israel that will provide
      the country with $510 million worth of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMS),
      kits that turn bombs into precision-guided weapons, as the US continues to provide
      military aid to support the genocidal war in Gaza.


      According to the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the State
      Department notified Congress of the sale of 3,845 JDAMS for 2,000-pound BLU-109
      bombs and 3,280 JDAMS for 500-pound MK 82 bombs. The deal also includes US “government
      and contractor engineering, logistics, and technical support services; and other
      related elements of logistics and program support.”


      The DSCA said Boeing is the principal contractor for the deal. The notification
      of the potential deal begins a time period when US lawmakers could potentially
      block the sale, but there’s little opposition to US military support for Israel
      within Congress, despite the many war crimes the US is implicated in by providing
      Israel with weapons.


      Fragments of bombs with US-provided JDAM kits have been found at the scene of
      Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that have massacred many civilians. In 2023, Human
      Rights Watch said it identified JDAM fragments that were found in two airstrikes
      on homes in central Gaza that killed 43 civilians, including 19 children, and
      14 women.


      It’s unclear at this point how the deal will be financed, but many arms sales
      to Israel are funded by US military aid, and US assistance to Israel has significantly
      increased since October 7, 2023. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in
      that time, US funding has covered an estimated 70% of Israel’s war-related military
      spending.

      has surged since the escalation of conflict on October 7, 2023. Despite the evident
      implications of U.S. weaponry in civilian casualties during Israeli airstrikes—such
      as those reported by Human Rights Watch—there is minimal opposition in Congress
      to the arms sale, reflecting a strong bipartisan support for military assistance
      to Israel.

      By Norman Solomon / Z Network


      The Supreme Court’s first chief justice, John Jay, would have empathized with
      the billionaires who’ve been freaking out ever since Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic
      primary for mayor of New York last Tuesday. “Those who own the country ought to
      govern it,” Jay insisted. But now, oligarchs accustomed to such governance are
      furious that the nation’s capital of capitalism is in danger of serving people
      instead of megaprofits.


      Meanwhile, among progressives, euphoria is especially fitting because the Mamdani
      campaign’s win was truly a people-powered victory, thanks to active efforts of
      40,000 volunteers. In a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans
      six-to-one, the Democratic nomination would ordinarily be a virtual guarantee
      of winning the general election. But the forces of oligarchy now mobilizing could
      disprove a claim that “Mamdani’s widespread appeal represents the total collapse
      of a Democratic Party establishment.”


      Such a collapse is very far from certain.


      On the surface, Andrew Cuomo’s decision to stay on the fall ballot as an “independent,”
      while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams does likewise, seems to foreshadow splitting
      the anti-Mamdani vote. But Cuomo still has a substantial electoral following.
      And the corrupt Adams – who cut a deal with President Trump to viciously betray
      immigrants and got his criminal indictment thrown out by Trump’s Justice Department
      – has no better ethics than the disgraced former governor Cuomo. Bankrolled by
      wealthy donors, the pair might make some kind of pact, with one of them telling
      his followers to unify behind the other before voting begins this fall.


      In any case, a key context of the upcoming election battle is that hell hath no
      fury like corporate power scorned.


      A social-media screed by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman (net worth: upward of
      $9 billion) was damn near apoplectic that activists and voters had so terribly
      transgressed. Ackman described himself as “a supporter of President Trump” while
      expressing a fervent desire “to save the Democratic Party from itself.” Mamdani’s
      policies, Ackman wrote late Wednesday night, “would be disastrous for NYC. Socialism
      has no place in the economic capital of our country.”


      But Ackman held out hope that those owning the city of New York could continue
      to govern it: “Importantly, there are hundreds of million of dollars of capital
      available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight …
      so that a great alternative candidate won’t spend any time raising funds. So,
      if the right candidate would raise his or her hand tomorrow, the funds will pour
      in. I am sure that Mike Bloomberg will share his how-to-win-the-mayoralty IP [intellectual
      property] and deliver his entire election apparatus and system to the aspiring
      candidate so that the candidate can focus all of his or her energy on the campaign.”


      Another aggrieved hedge-fund multibillionaire, Daniel Loeb, opted to be concise:
      “It’s officially hot commie summer.” Many other moguls have also sounded alarms.
      But beneath all the froth and bombast, extremely wealthy individuals are busy
      gauging how to prevail against the threat of democracy and social justice.


      In the Empire State, there are many ways for the empire to strike back. The constellation
      of forces now regrouping with a vengeance includes titans of Wall Street, enormous
      real estate interests, pro-Israel groups, corporate media, the anti-progressive
      rich and assorted smear artists.


      In recent weeks, the completely false charge of antisemitism has escalated against
      Mamdani. He has taken a principled and consistent stand on behalf of human rights
      for all – in the process, denouncing Israel’s war on Palestinian civilians in
      Gaza – while at the same time opposing rapacious corporate power. So, it’s no
      surprise that New York’s most powerful Democrat, Senate minority leader Chuck
      Schumer, has been dodging the question of whether he’ll endorse Mamdani in the
      general election.


      For decades, Schumer’s campaign coffers have bulged while he has been hugely compensated
      by Wall Street. He has also remained a staunch supporter of Israel, despite its
      systematic ethnic cleaning and genocide against Palestinian people. A few months
      ago, Schumer declared: “My job is to keep the left pro-Israel.”


      What happened in the state’s second-largest city in 2021 is important to understand.
      Democratic socialist India Walton was the candidate of a grassroots campaign that
      stunned the party establishment in the Democratic primary when she defeated Buffalo’s
      corporate mayor, four-term incumbent Byron Brown. As the Democratic nominee, she
      seemed set to win the general election in the blue city. But a coalition of furious
      Democratic power brokers and deep-pocketed Republicans, including racists and
      vehement haters of the left, aided by much of the city’s mass media, teamed up
      to smear her and ending up getting Brown elected as a write-in candidate.


      Last weekend, I asked India (now a colleague at RootsAction, where she is senior
      strategist) how she saw the Mamdani campaign. “Watching the New York City mayoral
      primary from Buffalo last Tuesday gave me a familiar feeling,” she said. “As I
      watched the results come in, I felt a flutter in my gut and a sense of pensiveness.
      A feeling of overwhelming joy and a fear that it would be snatched away despite
      my attempts to cling to it. I imagine that as Zohran watched, he also felt a sense
      of familiarity. In 2021, Zohran Mamdani supported my run for Buffalo mayor; I
      was a first-time unknown candidate challenging a 16-year incumbent, and conventional
      wisdom said it was an impossible race to win. Now, in 2025, Zohran has once again
      toppled the establishment. I’m starting to think that populist policies that focus
      on working people are a winning strategy.”


      That strategy is now striking fear into the hard hearts of insatiably greedy billionaires.

      By Kit Klarenberg / MintPress News


      On June 13, 2025, Tel Aviv launched what many international observers and Iranian
      officials have described as an unprovoked military strike on Iran. Israeli jets
      bombed military and nuclear sites, while Mossad-run sleeper cells carried out
      sabotage missions against air and missile defense systems from within Iran, and
      drones smuggled into Tehran were launched against local missile launch bases.


      Dozens—perhaps more—of nuclear scientists and top military commanders were murdered
      with surgical precision, often in the presence of innocent family members, who
      were themselves frequently killed. A climate of chaos and uncertainty seemed to
      engulf everything.


      These early results so exhilarated Israeli officials that they talked a big game
      on where their operation would lead, making several incendiary claims along the
      way. They boasted of operating in Iranian airspace without hindrance, invited
      the U.S. to get formally involved with the “elimination” of Tehran’s nuclear weapons
      program, and anonymously briefed the media that “a multi-faceted misinformation
      campaign”—in which Donald Trump was an “active participant”—had been conducted
      “to convince Iran that a strike on its nuclear facilities was not imminent.”


      Internationally-wanted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu forecast on June 15 that
      Israel’s war on Iran “could certainly” produce regime change, as the government
      was “very weak,” and that “80% of the people would throw these theological thugs
      out.”


      A hard-hitting response to Netanyahu’s premonitions and Tel Aviv’s military strike
      quickly arrived from Tehran in the form of a wave of missile attacks. Wreaking
      unprecedented damage on Tel Aviv and Haifa. The impact on Israeli military installations
      is difficult to assess due to its strict policy of internal censorship.


      Visibly, though, Iran’s bombardments sent Israelis scurrying for shelter, while
      many others fled the country outright. Such was the exodus, from a country that
      has already suffered mass depopulation since October 7, 2023—the Israeli government
      has since scrambled to implement legally questionable bans on its citizens leaving.


      By June 19, officials in Tel Aviv had dropped the braggadocio, and Western media
      were publishing explainer guides to explain why Israel’s much-vaunted Iron Dome
      air defense system had failed to repel Iranian strikes.


      Iran’s unmolested battering of Israel continued apace until June 22, when the
      U.S. officially entered the war. Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan, and
      Natanz were targeted, allegedly using heavy-duty B-2 bombers that dropped earth-shattering
      bunker busters.


      Trump boasted that Iran’s nuclear program was “obliterated,” and Tehran struck
      an unmanned U.S. base in Qatar in response. Iran and Israel then traded missile
      barrages, which inflicted significantly greater damage on the latter, for two
      more days, before begrudgingly agreeing to a ceasefire.


      So far, the ceasefire holds. In the meantime, U.S. claims of having damaged, let
      alone destroyed, Iran’s nuclear facilities have quickly unraveled, as have Israeli
      allegations that the June 13 strike was an urgent necessity conducted as Iran
      was on the imminent verge of acquiring nukes.


      As the dust settles, it is becoming increasingly clear that the so-called “12
      Day War” was long in the making, and an unmitigated disaster for Tel Aviv and
      Washington, with wide-ranging ramifications for the region and beyond.


      “Netanyahu wanted to incite regime change in Tehran, while drawing the U.S. into
      a wider war. He failed on both counts, and now Iran is stronger, its citizens
      more united with one another, and behind their government,” Ali Abunimah, Electronic
      Intifada cofounder, tells MintPress News.


      This has enormous implications for West Asia and the world. Israel proved itself
      more vulnerable than ever. Tehran, while still facing enormous dangers from determined
      enemies, proved itself far more resilient than its adversaries expected.”


      ‘Burning Through’


      “Meanwhile, as many Iranian commentators note,” Abunimah says, another deleterious
      upshot of the fiasco is “Western-oriented segments of Iranian society have been
      left disillusioned—even discredited—by Washington’s brazen deceit.”


      Bragging about how Trump’s nuclear negotiations were a ruse “means not only Iran
      but many other countries globally will never again trust U.S. diplomacy.” Still,
      he believes Washington and Tel Aviv’s “efforts to destroy” Iran shouldn’t cease,
      and could intensify.


      For the time being, Tehran has made clear it will observe the ceasefire and only
      strike back if it is attacked again. As Abunimah puts it, “Some have criticized
      Iran for not linking a ceasefire to Israel ending the Gaza genocide.” However,
      he believes “such a demand could’ve triggered serious U.S. aggression, rather
      than the meaningless strikes that happened, and civilians could’ve ended up in
      the firing line.”


      Tehran has never envisaged direct defeat via a single blow, but wearing Israel
      down. The Resistance, including Iran, is the weaker side in an asymmetrical war,
      facing the full might of the U.S.-led Western empire. Ironically, although Israel
      started this war, it advanced the Resistance’s objective. Israel appears weak,
      unstable, and unsafe, while totally reliant on foreign support in a world where
      it is more hated than ever after nearly two years of its livestreamed genocide
      in Gaza.”


      Tyler Weaver, a U.S. military veteran who runs a popular X account publishing
      military analysis and commentary, echoes Abunimah’s analysis. “Iran demonstrated
      a consistent capability to pierce Israeli missile defenses and damage or destroy
      Israeli infrastructure and combat systems – several IDF air defense missile batteries
      were struck and destroyed,” he observes.


      And while Iran may not have secured an outright victory against its attackers,
      “Israel sure lost” the 12-Day War. “This was their ‘big show’ against Iran, and
      its results did not meet the effort expended. The most effective weapon the Israelis
      had wasn’t their vaunted Air Force, but instead an elaborately constructed attack
      network inside Iran courtesy of Mossad, which is now gone, and likely cannot be
      reconstructed.”


      “Infrastructure can be repaired, weaponry can be replaced, but they’re not going
      to be able to rebuild anything like that network again,” Weaver warns.


      Furthermore, Israel’s high-risk bid to overpower Iran consumed enormous amounts
      of munitions and came at great financial expense. A former financial adviser to
      the IDF chief of staff estimates that just the first 48 hours of Tel Aviv’s botched
      campaign cost $1.45 billion, with almost $1 billion spent on defensive measures
      alone. Meanwhile, government economists estimated the daily cost of military operations
      at $725 million.


      Tel Aviv was reportedly running perilously low on missile interceptors within
      five days, despite the U.S. having been aware of “capacity problems” for months
      prior, and spending intervening months “augmenting Israel’s defenses with systems
      on the ground, at sea and in the air.” This, in turn, has created “concern about
      the U.S. burning through its own interceptors” within the Pentagon. As a July
      2024 report by the Department of Defense-funded RAND concluded, Washington cannot
      replenish its stockpile of those munitions at any pace or scale.


      Haaretz estimates that the civilian and economic toll of the 12-Day War on Israel
      could reach into the billions of dollars. Thousands of residents have been displaced,
      with reconstruction costs projected in the hundreds of millions. Most industries
      were brought to a halt during the conflict, deepening the strain on Tel Aviv’s
      already fragile economy.


      Taken together, Israel’s ability to sustain a longer or more intense confrontation
      with Iran—militarily or financially—and the U.S. capacity to provide continued
      support appear increasingly uncertain.


      ‘Idiotic Decision’


      Reports suggest Trump was motivated by fears of a drawn-out war and saw military
      strikes on Iran as the most direct path to a ceasefire. This interpretation is
      greatly reinforced by a high-ranking Iranian official claiming the White House
      gave Tehran advance notice of the bombings, insisting they were intended as a
      “one-off,” opening the door for a “symbolic” Iranian counterattack, and cessation
      of hostilities.


      Media reports suggest that the strikes were part of a broader effort by the President
      to de-escalate the conflict by offering a negotiated off-ramp for all parties
      involved. Despite these disclosures, Trump has repeatedly avowed in his typically
      brash style that the June 22 attack on Iran was decisive, and “one of the most
      successful military strikes in history.”


      The New York Times later cited a senior U.S. official who said Iran’s nuclear
      sites were not destroyed but targeted in a way that temporarily took them “off
      the table,” contradicting the president’s more emphatic characterization.


      Even that more modest assessment was further challenged on June 25, when CNN reported
      on the findings of a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency analysis. The report concluded
      that U.S. strikes on Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz had not destroyed the core components
      of Iran’s nuclear program and had likely only delayed it by months. These conclusions
      were echoed by multiple informed sources, who noted that Iran’s stockpile of enriched
      uranium had been relocated prior to the attack, and that the facilities’ centrifuges
      remained largely intact.


      Weaver, who has studied photo and video evidence of the 12-Day War extensively,
      concurs “there’s little indication” the Iranian nuclear sites were “meaningfully
      damaged.” What can be detected from satellite imagery on the ground “is simply
      inconsistent with the use of earthquake bombs as claimed by Trump and the Pentagon.”


      Weaver points to several inconsistencies in mainstream reporting and White House
      statements regarding both the execution and outcomes of the attack. He notes that
      the strike “passed entirely under the radar of the usual nightly exchange of fire
      between Iran and Israel,” and was not acknowledged by either side until Trump
      announced it.


      For the official account to hold, he argues, B-2 bombers—aircraft the U.S. had
      previously avoided using in Yemen—would have had to penetrate deep into Iranian
      territory, strike heavily fortified sites with gravity bombs, and return across
      hundreds of miles of monitored airspace without being detected, all while Iran’s
      air defense systems remained operational.


      I think Trump tried to rescue Netanyahu from the consequences of his idiotic decision
      to start a war with Iran he manifestly wasn’t capable of finishing, and do so
      in a manner the Iranians weren’t going to be provoked into responding to in a
      major way. As an American taxpayer and former DoD employee, I would hope this
      wasn’t the most impressive attack the U.S. military could put together on a week’s
      notice, and it reflects deliberate restraint rather than a lack of capability.”


      Despite extensive planning reportedly dating back to the Biden administration,
      including war-game scenarios focused on Iran’s nuclear program, analysts have
      questioned the limited impact of Israel’s strike. Furthermore, it has been revealed
      that senior Israeli officials had been preparing for the June 13 attack since
      March, and sought to strike before Iran “rebuilt its air defenses by the latter
      half of the year.”


      ‘Polite Fiction’


      CNN’s report on the leaked DIA assessment was quickly met with coordinated responses
      from across the U.S. government disputing its conclusions.


      First, a dedicated article was published on the White House website, “Iran’s Nuclear
      Facilities Have Been Obliterated — and Suggestions Otherwise are Fake News.” The
      article collated quotes from numerous high-ranking administration officials, including
      the President, and Israeli government and military apparatchiks, testifying to
      the attack’s triumph. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fulminated, “Anyone who says
      the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the
      successful mission.”


      Simultaneously, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence
      Tulsi Gabbard separately issued statements declaring “new intelligence” indicated
      Iran’s nuclear facilities had in fact been “destroyed” by U.S. airstrikes. Neither
      provided any evidence to support this bold conclusion. Later that day, Politico
      revealed that the aggressive flurry of disavowal was a determined “blitz” by the
      administration, “to counter media reports…the strikes had not significantly set
      back Iran’s nuclear program.”


      The DIA leak reportedly provoked an angry response from Trump, leading to federal
      investigations into the breach. Like many administrations, the White House and
      U.S. agencies have typically resisted admitting to failures in military operations.
      Nonetheless, the determination of so many officials to push back against any suggestions
      that the strike wasn’t a historically ruinous cataclysm could point to a different
      motive than covering for Trump, or being forced to admit that Washington’s once-vaunted
      military machine isn’t what it once was.


      The assertion that Iran’s nuclear program has been eliminated offers a convenient
      rationale for ending discussions that, even before the conflict, had reached an
      impasse and now appear permanently derailed. In the wake of Tel Aviv’s strike,
      Iran canceled nuclear talks with the U.S. that had been scheduled for June 21
      in Oman, citing what it called Israel’s “barbarous” actions, backed by Washington,
      as rendering the summit “meaningless.”


      If, as some analysts have suggested, the negotiations were never intended to succeed
      and successive U.S. administrations were aware of Israel’s plans in advance, then
      Tehran has little reason to resume talks. In addition, Iranian officials have
      stated that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors will no longer
      be permitted entry to nuclear sites on Iranian soil.


      On June 12, Press TV published documents exposing how the Association previously
      provided Israeli intelligence with the names of several Iranian nuclear scientists
      who were subsequently assassinated, and its chief, Rafael Grossi, enjoys a close,
      clandestine relationship with Israeli officials.


      Documents released by Iran show that IAEA chief Grossi has been completely coordinated
      with Israel and has been carrying out Israel''s orders.




      Iran recently managed to obtain a wealth of secret documents from the Israeli
      regime. pic.twitter.com/iVz2V0oNh5 — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) June 12, 2025


      Under the terms of Tehran’s July 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)
      deal with the Obama administration, the IAEA was granted unimpeded access to Iran’s
      nuclear complexes to ensure the country was not using the facilities to develop
      weapons. Its inspectors collected a wealth of information on and in the sites,
      including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents.


      It is an open question whether this intelligence bonanza was shared with the U.S.
      and Israel, and played any role in the 12-Day War. Iranian lawmakers aren’t waiting
      for proof, and on June 25, they unanimously passed legislation to suspend cooperation
      with the Association indefinitely.


      Exiting the Non-Proliferation Treaty is being openly debated in the Islamic Republic
      as well. Maintaining the narrative that Iran’s nuclear program has been eliminated
      may serve a strategic purpose for Washington, allowing it to argue against further
      diplomatic engagement. “The polite fiction that Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were
      destroyed is helpful to keep the peace,” says Tyler Weaver.


      ‘Beyond Themselves’


      The question of what happens next is likewise an open one. Alex McKay, of the
      Marx Engels Lenin Institute and Decline & Fall, notes that while “this latest
      regime change attempt is over, plots against Iran by the Anglo-American empire,
      and its Israeli proxy, will continue,” as “the imperialist powers cannot countenance
      Iran being a sovereign, independent nation.”


      However, he believes the “total failure” of the recent operation against the Islamic
      Republic cannot be understated, and left U.S.-Israeli weakness and vulnerability
      writ unambiguously large.


      “Once it became clear the hoped-for palace coup or color revolution wouldn’t materialize,
      the U.S. was left without many options, and a number of unpalatable choices, McKay
      tells MintPress News.


      To actually destroy the Islamic Republic would take a long-term military campaign,
      possibly including a ground invasion. The U.S. has avoided wars as dangerous as
      this would be ever since their defeat in Vietnam. Imperialist powers of the world
      prefer to wage their wars via air power, terrorist acts, proxy armies, espionage
      and cultural subversion.”


      A large-scale air war against Iran “also carried enormous risks,” such as the
      Iranians closing the Strait of Hormuz or targeting oil infrastructure across the
      Gulf states hosting U.S. bases. Either approach would “lead to a spike in oil
      prices, and plunge the economies of imperialist nations into a deep recession,”
      McKay observes. As it was, the 12-Day War led to a brief surge in oil prices,
      which reversed once the ceasefire commenced. Meanwhile, vessels traversing Hormuz
      are subject to “intense levels of GPS jamming.”


      Such moves suggest that while Tehran’s missile onslaught may be over, it is under
      no illusions that it effectively remains at war with Israel and Tel Aviv’s Western
      puppetmasters, and must remain ever-vigilant as a result.


      It is evident that this perspective is widely shared among Iranian citizens. Far
      from destabilizing and fracturing the country and triggering the revolutionary
      government’s collapse, the population is more united than ever against Western
      powers. As one patriotic Iranian celebrated on ‘X’:


      We are now aware of our shortcomings more than ever and in dire need of some changes.
      Iran’s biggest achievement or gift wasn’t on the battlefield but at home amongst
      the people, becoming as one. Younger generations who had not experienced…the Revolution
      or the [war with Iraq] now tasted something beyond themselves. It gave them the
      identity they were longing for.”


      Should Israel again attempt to foment all-out war with Iran, it will be up against
      an adversary far more prepared than this time round, with nigh-universal domestic
      support for total victory, which may mean Tel Aviv’s final destruction, and the
      vanquishing of U.S. bases across West Asia. Tehran is also likely to emerge better
      armed, given that on June 26, China convened an emergency meeting with Iran and
      Russia’s defense ministers. It is now up to Netanyahu to make the next move, which
      may be his very last.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the aftermath of a military strike by
      Israel on Iran in June 2025, which resulted in significant casualties and damage
      for both nations, ultimately leading to a ceasefire that revealed Israel's vulnerabilities
      and failed objectives, while strengthening Iran's resolve and unity.
    paragraph_summary: On June 13, 2025, Israel launched an unprovoked military strike
      against Iran, targeting military and nuclear sites, which resulted in significant
      casualties, including the deaths of numerous Iranian nuclear scientists and military
      leaders. This aggressive action led to a swift and devastating retaliation from
      Iran, which launched missile attacks on Israeli cities, causing widespread panic
      and damage. As the conflict escalated, the U.S. intervened, conducting airstrikes
      on Iranian nuclear facilities, but these strikes ultimately failed to achieve
      their intended goals, leading to a ceasefire by June 22. Analysts suggest that
      the conflict, termed the "12 Day War," exposed Israel's vulnerabilities and strengthened
      Iran's resolve and unity against foreign aggression. The aftermath has left both
      Israel and the U.S. questioning their military capabilities and strategies, while
      Iran has signaled its intent to remain vigilant and prepared for future confrontations.
      The war has also led to a significant shift in public sentiment within Iran, fostering
      a sense of national identity and resilience against Western powers.

      By Jonathan Cook


      U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed predictable outrage at the weekend
      that the BBC had inadvertently broadcast punk band Bob Vylan leading crowds at
      Glastonbury in a chant of “Death to the IDF” – the “Israel Defence Forces” that
      have been responsible for slaughtering many tens of thousands of Palestinians
      in Gaza over the past 21 months.


      He called the chant “appalling hate speech” — apparently unaware that there are
      far worse crimes than hating soldiers carrying out the mass slaughter of children.
      Those worse things, of course, include slaughtering children en masse.


      The BBC apologised, calling the band’s comments “deeply offensive” – more offensive,
      apparently, than Israel bombing and starving the children of Gaza.

      Glastonbury’s organisers condemned the chant, saying there was no space for “hate
      speech or antisemitism” — apparently assuming, wrongly, that all Jews identify
      not just with the state of Israel but with an Israeli military widely accused
      by genocide experts of committing genocidal violence in Gaza.


      I’m a British Jew in England




      I didn’t interpret #DeathToTheIDF as a call for people to kill me because




      1. I’m not in the IDF




      2. It doesn’t call for the death of individuals – the clue is in “The IDF”

      Police are investigating Bob Vylan, a musical duo, to see whether they have committed
      a criminal offence, or possibly a terrorist one. As far as we know, the same police
      are doing nothing to investigate some 10 British citizens known to have travelled
      abroad to join the Israeli military, the IDF, committing the Gaza genocide.


      [On Monday, the U.S. State Department cancelled the group’s visas ahead of a U.S.
      tour scheduled to begin in the fall and United Talent Agency dropped the duo,
      according to The Hollywood Reporter.]


      On Sunday, the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire grilled Starmer’s health secretary, Wes
      Streeting, on remarks from the Israeli embassy in London condemning what it termed
      “the normalisation of extremist language” and the “glorification of violence”
      at Glastonbury.


      Unexpectedly, Streeting avoided jumping whole-heartedly on the media outrage band-wagon,
      led by the Mail on Sunday, whose front page demanded the arrest of the two band
      members for what the paper wrongly described as a chant demanding “Death to Israelis”.


      The Mail, apparently, believes that all Israelis, presumably including the country’s
      children, are currently serving in the Israeli military.


      "I''d say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order"




      Health Secretary Wes Streeting responds to Israel''s claims on Glastonbury''s
      "glorification of violence", saying "Israeli settler terrorists" carried out "unwanton
      acts of violence"#BBCLauraK https://t.co/v2HwddQuYE pic.twitter.com/DRoqBMrVM6
      — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) June 29, 2025


      There are four important points to make about the interview between Derbyshire
      and Streeting:


      1. The Israeli embassy in London, like the Israeli government it represents, has
      precisely no concerns about the “glorification of violence” when Israel is doing
      either the glorifying or the violence.


      Israel is currently celebrating its “success” in slaughtering and maiming hundreds
      of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, including huge numbers of children; attacks
      by its soldiers and state-backed Jewish settler militias on Palestinian civilians
      in the West Bank; its eradication of whole communities in Lebanon; and its bombing
      of residential tower blocks across Tehran, killing many hundreds.


      Violence has been Israel’s signature policy for the past 21 months — and long
      before that. Israel has revelled in the carnage it has inflicted on populations
      across the region.


      In a post on social media, the Israeli embassy additionally argued of Bob Vylan’s
      chant:


      “When speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing,
      it must be called out — especially when amplified by public figures on prominent
      platforms.”


      And yet public figures from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Starmer
      have incited against the Palestinians, with Netanyahu comparing them to “Amalek”,
      a people the Israelites were commanded by God to exterminate, and Starmer terming
      the wholesale starvation of the people of Gaza an act by Israel of “self-defence”.


      Israeli officials from Netanyahu down have advocated the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.
      And, even more seriously, Israel has not just threatened but repeatedly carried
      out the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under its belligerent rule.


      2. It is beyond ridiculous for the BBC to echo the Israeli government in prioritising
      a harsh crackdown on words at Glastonbury “glorifying violence” towards Israeli
      soldiers ahead of the actual violence of genocide being committed by those Israel
      soldiers.


      The BBC has avoided criticising the Israeli government for its actual violence
      — its bombing and active starvation of Palestinian civilians — and the Starmer
      government for colluding in that violence, or what the International Court of
      Justice termed more than a year ago a “plausible” genocide by Israel.


      As a recent report by the Centre for Media Monitoring confirmed, the BBC has dramatically
      skewed its language to present Israel, the aggressor, in a more favourable light
      than the victim, the Palestinians of Gaza. The BBC’s own whistleblowing journalists
      have warned that the state broadcaster has all but banned the use of the word
      “genocide”, even by experts on the matter.


      [See: Jonathan Cook: The BBC’s Complicity in Genocide]


      By arming Israel, by organising spy flights over Gaza from RAF base Akrotiri on
      Cyprus, and by providing diplomatic cover, Starmer has effectively glorified Israel’s
      slaughter of Palestinian children in the enclave.


      Bob Vylan’s chants of “Death to the IDF” have a far more dangerous counterpart
      in Starmer’s recital of Israel’s “right to defend itself” when that “defence”
      involves Israel mercilessly starving Gaza’s population of food, water and power.


      Bob Vylan are a punk band; Starmer is the British prime minister, the man who
      directs Britain’s foreign policy and directs its army.


      No one, least of all the BBC, has held Israeli or British officials accountable
      not just for glorifying violence but for actually carrying it out on an industrial
      scale for nearly two years.


      But the BBC is suddenly interested in holding to account two punk musicians for
      leading a chant — one that made a symbolic, hypothetical threat of violence —
      against an Israeli military carrying out the ultimate form of violence, an actual
      genocide.


      In a serious media, Israel’s supposed “concerns” about the glorification of violence
      and extremist language would be laughed off the stage rather than respectfully
      aired.


      3. Streeting is being congratulated and condemned in equal measure on social media
      for refusing to be drawn into the Mail and BBC’s confected outrage. “I’d say to
      the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order,” he responded to Derbyshire.
      But hang on a minute. Streeting’s resistance to Derbyshire’s line of questioning
      was perhaps unexpected. But it also, let us not forget, serves the interests of
      both the Starmer and Israeli governments.


      Streeting’s insistence that Israel “get its house in order” had, as he made clear,
      nothing to do with its 21-month slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. Starmer is
      still defining the Gaza genocide as Israel’s supposed “right to defend itself.”


      In responding to Derbyshire, Streeting expressed concern only at what he called
      violent “settler attacks” in the West Bank. He said the Israeli embassy needed
      to “get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and
      the settlers in the West Bank.”


      This was intended purely as deflection, designed to serve Starmer and Israel,
      the West’s key client state in the oil-rich Middle East. It benefits the U.K.
      government to make an issue of West Bank settler attacks — and present them as
      disorganised, random violence by individual extremists that the Israeli government
      is not responsible for but needs to get a firmer grip on.


      By highlighting problems in the West Bank, the Starmer government can avoid addressing
      the genocide in Gaza and the Israeli state’s clear responsibility for that genocide.
      Which is precisely why in recent weeks Britain has made so much noise about imposing
      feeble penalties on a handful of extremist settlers and two fascist ministers
      in Netanyahu’s government that represent those settlers.


      Starmer and Streeting’s prioritising of Israel’s West Bank violence over Israel’s
      Gaza violence is a switch and bait twice over.


      Most of the violence in the West Bank is not coming from settler extremists, even
      though they are the ones being punished by the U.K. It is coming from the Israeli
      military, which has bulldozed thousands of homes there over the past year, driving
      40,000 Palestinians off their lands.


      Further, settler violence is not random. It is coordinated with Israeli field
      commanders, many of them settlers themselves, to uproot Palestinians so that Israel
      can move in Jewish settlers to colonise the land — or, in the words of successive
      Israeli governments, “Judaise” it.


      None of this is new either. Israel has engineered and imposed a violent, apartheid
      system on Palestinians for decades to make life unbearable and encourage them
      to leave their homeland.


      Second, Glastonbury’s anger-fuelled chant against the IDF was not primarily motivated
      by Israel’s violent actions in the West Bank. It was against the Israeli military
      for committing a genocide in Gaza, which the British government has been supporting.


      Streeting’s aim was to drag the debate on to safer territory for him and Starmer:
      that Britain needs to deal not with a genocide in Gaza but with a handful of violent
      loons in the West Bank.


      Even in criticising the Israeli government for not doing enough to tackle settler
      violence, Streeting is still operating within the confines of a public discourse
      dictated by Israel, which prefers any criticism to be directed at individuals
      not at the Israeli state behind those individuals.


      4. The BBC, the Starmer government and the Israel lobby are all delighted to play
      their part in this game of deflection and deception because these kinds of moral
      panics obscure the real issue: that all these parties are actively colluding in
      Israel’s genocide in Gaza.


      While the media and government can now have a long backwards and forwards about
      whether criticism of Israel’s genocidal army needs to be defined in law as a criminal
      offence or “terrorism”, Israel will get a free pass to continue with the real
      terrorism: a genocide in Gaza.


      Famously, the black civil rights fighter Malcolm X observed of the role of the
      media:


      “They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent,
      and that’s power. … If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating
      the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”


      Sixty years on, nothing has changed.

    one_sentence_summary: U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned punk band Bob Vylan
      for leading a chant of "Death to the IDF" at Glastonbury, labeling it hate speech,
      while the BBC and media outlets faced criticism for prioritizing outrage over
      the chant rather than addressing the ongoing violence and alleged genocide against
      Palestinians in Gaza.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the backlash against British punk-rap band
      Bob Vylan for leading a chant of "Death to the IDF" during their performance at
      Glastonbury, which U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned as "appalling hate
      speech." The BBC apologized for airing the chant, while Glastonbury's organizers
      condemned it, reflecting a broader media and political outrage. However, the author,
      Jonathan Cook, argues that this outrage distracts from the actual violence perpetrated
      by the Israeli military in Gaza, where many civilians, including children, have
      been killed. Cook criticizes the media and government for prioritizing condemnation
      of the band's symbolic protest over addressing the ongoing genocide in Gaza, suggesting
      that the focus on Bob Vylan serves to deflect attention from the real issues at
      hand. He highlights the hypocrisy of condemning words while ignoring the violence
      of state actions, asserting that the media's framing of the situation obscures
      the complicity of the British government and the BBC in the violence against Palestinians.

      By Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares / Other News


      The attack by Israel and the US on Iran had two significant effects. First, it
      once again exposed the root cause of turmoil in the region: Israel’s project to
      “reshape the Middle East” through regime-change, aimed at maintaining its dominance
      and blocking a Palestinian state. Second, it highlighted the futility and recklessness
      of this strategy. The only path to peace is a comprehensive agreement that addresses
      Palestine’s statehood, Israel’s security, Iran’s peaceful nuclear program, and
      the economic recovery of the region.


      Israel wants to topple the Iranian government because Iran has supported proxies
      and non-state actors aligned with the Palestinians. Israel has also consistently
      undermined US-Iran diplomacy regarding Iran’s nuclear program.


      Instead of endless wars, Israel’s security can be ensured by two key diplomatic
      steps –ending militancy by establishing a Palestinian state with UN Security Council
      guarantees, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful and verifiable
      nuclear program.


      The far-right Israeli government’s refusal to accept a Palestinian state is the
      root of the problem.


      When the British empire promised a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine in 1917,
      the Palestinian Arabs constituted 90% of the population and Jews less than 10%
      of the population. In 1947, with US intense lobbying, the UN General Assembly
      voted to grant 56% of Palestine to a new Zionist state, while the Jews were only
      33% of the population. Palestinians rejected this as a violation of their right
      to self-determination. After the 1948 war, Israel expanded to 78% of Palestine,
      and in 1967, occupied the remaining 22%—Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and
      the Golan Heights.


      Instead of returning occupied lands in exchange for peace, Israeli right-wing
      politicians insisted on permanent control of 100% of the land, with the Likud
      founding charter declaring in 1977 that there would be only Israeli sovereignty
      “between the Sea and Jordan”.


      Netanyahu represents this policy of domination – and has served as Prime Minister
      for a total of 17 years since 1996. When he came to power, he and his US neocon
      allies authored the “Clean Break” strategy to block the creation of a Palestinian
      state. Instead of pursuing land for peace, Israel aimed to reshape the Middle
      East by overthrowing governments that supported the Palestinian cause. The US
      would be the implementing partner of this strategy.


      This is exactly what happened after 9/11, as the US led or sponsored wars against
      Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon (U.S. funding and arming Israeli aggressions),
      Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (CIA operation during 2010’s), Sudan (supporting
      rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011), and Somalia (backing Ethiopia’s invasion
      in 2006).


      Contrary to the glib promises by Netanyahu to the US Congress in 2002 — that regime
      change in Iraq would bring a new day to the Middle East — the 2003 Iraq War augured
      the events that were to come across the region. Iraq descended into turmoil, and
      since then, each new war has brought death, destruction, and economic disarray.


      This month, Israel attacked Iran even as negotiations between Iran and the US
      were underway to ensure the peaceful use of Iran’s nuclear program – repeating
      the same WMD propaganda that Netanyahu used to justify the Iraq War.


      Israel has been claiming for more than 30 years that Iran is on the verge of acquiring
      nuclear weapons. However, on June 18, 2025, the IAEA Director General stated that
      there is “no proof of a systematic effort” by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.
      More to the point, Iran and the US were actively engaged in negotiations according
      to which the IAEA would monitor and verify the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear
      program.


      The attack on Iran proves yet again the futility and nihilism of Netanyahu’s approach.
      The Israeli and US attacks accomplished nothing positive. According to most analysts,
      Iran’s enriched uranium remains intact, but is now in a secret location rather
      than under IAEA monitoring. In the meantime, with Israel’s ongoing genocide in
      Gaza – neither peace nor security have been achieved.


      Israel has driven the region to a 4,000-km swash of violence from Libya to Iran
      through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately aimed
      at preventing a State of Palestine by “remaking” the Middle East.


      The solution is clear: it is time for the United States to recognize that its
      own strategic interests require a decisive break from partnering in Israel’s destructive
      strategy.


      Prioritizing genuine peace in the Middle East is not only a moral imperative,
      but a fundamental U.S. interest—one that can only be achieved through a comprehensive
      peace deal. The key pillar of this deal is for the US to lift its veto on a Palestinian
      State on the borders of 4 June 1967, and to do so at the start, not in some vague
      distant future that never actually arrives.


      For more than 20 years, Arab nations have backed a practical peace plan. So too
      has the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), with its 57 member countries,
      and the League of Arab States (LAS), with its 22 members. So too have almost all
      the nations in the UN General Assembly. So too has the International Court of
      Justice in its 2024 ruling that Israel’s occupation is illegal. Only Israel, with
      support from the US veto, has stood in the way.


      Here is a seven-point peace plan in which all parties would benefit. Israel would
      gain peace and security. Palestine would achieve statehood. Iran would win an
      end to economic sanctions. The US would win an end to costly and illegal wars
      fought on Israel’s behalf, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation if the
      current violence continues. The Middle East would win economic development, security
      and justice.


      – First,an immediate ceasefire would apply across the entire region – and the
      ceasefire would include an immediate release of all hostages and prisoners.


      – Second, the UN Security Council would vote upfront to welcome Palestine as the
      194th UN Member State on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
      Israel and Palestine could subsequently agree on mutually desired border adjustments.


      – Third,Israel would withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967. UN-mandated
      international forces would ensure a peaceful, orderly transition, a transfer of
      Palestinian territories to Palestinian authorities, and mutual security for both
      Israel and Palestine.


      – Fourth, the territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed for Lebanon,
      Syria, and all states in the region. All non-state armed groups would be demilitarized,
      and foreign troops would be withdrawn.


      – Fifth, the UN Security Council would adopt an updated nuclear agreement with
      Iran, including binding verification, and with all economic sanctions on Iran
      lifted alongside Iran’s verified compliance with the peaceful uses of its nuclear
      program.


      – Sixth, Israel and all Arab and Islamic states would establish full diplomatic
      relations following the admission of the State of Palestine as UN member state.


      – Seventh, the Middle East nations would establish an international fund for rebuilding
      the war-torn parts of Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, with contributions coming
      from within the region and from external sources.

      By Brett Wilkins / Common Dreams


      Israeli forces ramped up their genocidal assault on the Gaza Strip Monday, killing
      at least 95 Palestinians in attacks including massacres at a seaside café and
      a humanitarian aid distribution center and bombings of five school shelters housing
      displaced families and a hospital where refugees were sheltering in tents.


      An Israeli strike targeted the al-Baqa Café in western Gaza City, one of the few
      operating businesses remaining after 633 days of Israel’s obliteration of the
      coastal strip and a popular gathering place for journalists, university students,
      artists, and others seeking reliable internet service and a respite from nearly
      21 months of near-relentless attacks.


      Medical sources said at least 33 civilians were killed and nearly 50 others wounded
      in the massacre, including footballer Mustafa Abu Amira, photojournalist Ismail
      Abu Hatab—who survived an earlier Israeli airstrike and is reportedly the 227th
      journalists killed by Israel since October 2023—and prominent artist Frans Al-Salmi,
      whose final painting depicting a young Palestinian woman killed by Israeli forces
      resembles photographs of its slain creator posted on social media after her killing.

      Survivor Ali Abu Ateila toldThe Associated Press that the café was crowded with
      women and children at the time of the attack.


      “Without a warning, all of a sudden, a warplane hit the place, shaking it like
      an earthquake,” he said.


      Another survivor of the massacre told Britain’s Sky News: “All I see is blood…
      Unbelievable. People come here to take a break from what they see inside Gaza.
      They come westward to breathe.”


      Eyewitness Ahmed Al-Nayrab toldAgence France-Presse that a “huge explosion shook
      the area.”


      “I saw body parts flying everywhere, and bodies cut and burned,” he said. “It
      was a scene that made your skin crawl.”


      Witnesses and officials said Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) troops opened fire on
      Palestinians seeking food and other humanitarian aid from a U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation distribution point in southern Gaza, killing 15 people amid near-daily
      massacres of aid-seekers.


      “We were targeted by artillery,” survivor Monzer Hisham Ismail told The Associated
      Press. Another survivor, Yousef Mahmoud Mokheimar, told the AP that Israeli troops
      “fired at us indiscriminately.” Mokheimar was shot in the leg, another man who
      tried to rescue him was also shot.


      IDF troops have killed nearly 600 Palestinian aid-seekers and wounded more than
      4,000 others over the past month, with Israeli military officers and soldiers
      saying they were ordered to deliberately fire on civilians in search of food and
      other necessities amid Israel’s weaponized starvation of Gaza.


      Another 13 people were reportedly killed Monday when IDF warplanes bombed an aid
      warehouse in the Zeitoun quarter of southern Gaza City, according to al-Ahli Baptist
      Hospital officials cited by The Palestine Chronicle. IDF warplanes also reportedly
      bombed five schools housing displaced families, three of them in Zeitoun. Israeli
      forces also bombed the courtyard of al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central
      Gaza, where thousands of forcibly displaced Palestinian families are sheltering
      in tents. It was reportedly the 12th time the hospital has been bombed since the
      start of the war.


      The World Health Organization has documented more than 700 attacks on Gaza healthcare
      facilities since October 2023. Most of Gaza’s hospitals are out of service due
      to Israeli attacks, some of which have been called genocidal by United Nations
      experts.

      aftermath, he said Israel had given them no warning. pic.twitter.com/vlJnyxNxty
      — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) June 30, 2025


      Israel’s overall behavior in the war is the subject of an ongoing International
      Court of Justice genocide case, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and crimes
      against humanity in Gaza, including murder and using starvation as a weapon of
      war.


      Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed or wounded more than 204,000 Palestinians
      in Gaza, including over 14,000 people who are missing and presumed dead and buried
      under rubble, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, whose casualty figures have
      been found to be generally accurate and even a likely undercount by peer-reviewed
      studies.


      The intensified IDF attacks follow Israel’s issuance of new forced evacuation
      orders amid the ongoing Operation Gideon’s Chariots, an ongoing offensive which
      aims to conquer and indefinitely occupy all of Gaza and ethnically cleanse much
      of its population, possibly to make way for Jewish recolonization as advocated
      by many right-wing Israelis.
