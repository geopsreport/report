  - title: "Spying on Iran: How MI6 Infiltrated the IAEA"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/03/spying-on-iran-how-mi6-infiltrated-the-iaea/
    date: 2025-07-03 09:30
    summary: "Leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone reveal that Nicholas Langman, a British MI6 agent, infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to advance UK interests, particularly in relation to Iran's nuclear program. Langman, a veteran operative credited with orchestrating sanctions against Iran, has a controversial history, including accusations of involvement in the torture of Pakistani migrants in Greece and attempts to deflect blame from British intelligence regarding Princess Diana's death. His role in the IAEA has fueled Iranian allegations of collusion between the agency and Western intelligence, particularly after the IAEA's politicized reports on Iran's nuclear activities coincided with Israeli military actions against Iranian scientists. The documents suggest that Langman's influence contributed to a broader campaign of economic and military pressure on Iran, culminating in the controversial Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and subsequent tensions between Iran and the IAEA."

    date: 2025-07-03 09:20
    summary: "Zohran Mamdani's recent victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City primary for mayor has been attributed to his grassroots campaign, clear progressive messaging focused on affordability, and effective use of social media and volunteer mobilization. Despite skepticism from political commentators regarding the feasibility of his policies, such as free child care and rent freezes, Mamdani's campaign resonated with voters through direct engagement and conversations about their economic concerns. His approach, which emphasizes collaboration with grassroots organizations and a commitment to empowering everyday people, starkly contrasts with traditional political strategies that often prioritize wealthy donors and media campaigns. Mamdani's success reflects a growing desire for a more inclusive and participatory form of governance, challenging established political norms and highlighting the importance of grassroots activism in shaping policy and community engagement."

    date: 2025-07-03 09:15
    summary: "The article by William D. Hartung discusses the Senate's impending passage of a controversial bill that cuts $1.7 trillion in domestic spending while providing $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and adding $150 billion to an already inflated Pentagon budget. This legislation prioritizes military spending over social welfare, with significant allocations for ineffective missile defense projects like the Golden Dome, while neglecting the needs of active-duty military personnel and veterans. The bill is criticized for benefiting defense contractors and perpetuating a cycle of pork-barrel politics, which diverts funds from essential services such as healthcare and education. The author warns that this trend not only undermines the social safety net but also fosters a dangerous militarization of U.S. policy, as emerging tech firms vie for military contracts, potentially escalating tensions with adversaries like China. Ultimately, the article calls for a reevaluation of national priorities that focus on the well-being of citizens rather than excessive military expenditures."
  - title: "Patrick Lawrence: Now What?"

    date: 2025-07-03 09:10
    summary: "In a critical analysis of the recent U.S. military operation against Iran's nuclear program, Patrick Lawrence highlights the conflicting narratives surrounding the effectiveness of the B-2 bomber strikes. While U.S. officials, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, claim the attacks successfully obliterated Iran's nuclear capabilities, reports suggest that Iran was forewarned and managed to relocate its enriched uranium before the bombings. Expert analysis, particularly from MIT scientist Ted Postol, challenges the official narrative, arguing that the operation likely failed to achieve its stated objectives. Lawrence also discusses the broader geopolitical implications, noting that Israel's ongoing military actions against Iran and its operations in Gaza reflect a unified strategy of aggression, raising concerns about future conflicts and the U.S.'s role in them. The article underscores the difficulty of discerning the truth amid competing claims from government officials and intelligence agencies, leaving readers questioning the actual impact of the military operation and the potential for further escalations in the region."
  - title: "Starlink’s Secret War: How Musk Is Powering a Covert Campaign Against Iran"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/03/starlinks-secret-war-how-musk-is-powering-a-covert-campaign-against-iran/
    date: 2025-07-03 09:05
    summary: "The article by Alan MacLeod discusses Elon Musk's collaboration with the U.S. government in efforts to undermine the Iranian regime through his Starlink satellite system, which has been used to smuggle communication devices into Iran, enabling opposition groups to bypass government restrictions. This partnership reflects a broader trend of Musk's involvement with U.S. national security interests, including his support for Ukraine during its conflict with Russia and past interventions in countries like Venezuela and Bolivia, where he has been accused of attempting to influence political outcomes for American interests. The article portrays Musk as a key player in U.S. regime change efforts, highlighting his close ties with intelligence agencies and the implications of his actions on global politics."
  - title: "Will Zohran Mamdani Empower or Betray the Working Class? (w/ Kshama Sawant) | The Chris Hedges Report"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/02/will-zohran-mamdani-empower-or-betray-the-working-class-w-kshama-sawant-the-chris-hedges-report/
    date: 2025-07-02 23:38
    summary: "Zohran Mamdani's recent victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary has sent shockwaves through American politics, particularly due to his self-identification as a democratic socialist and his strong stance against the genocide in Gaza. His campaign, which focused on affordability and working-class demands, has drawn significant backlash from the billionaire class and political elites, including calls for his deportation from some prominent figures. Kshama Sawant, a former Seattle city councilmember and current congressional candidate, commended Mamdani's win as a sign that the Zionist lobby can be challenged and that working-class movements can thrive. However, she cautioned that Mamdani must remain committed to his promises and adopt a combative stance against the entrenched interests of the Democratic Party, which she argues ultimately serves capitalist interests. Sawant emphasized the importance of maintaining an adversarial approach to achieve substantial reforms for the working class, drawing on her own experiences in Seattle, where she successfully fought for significant labor rights and social policies."
  - title: "Iran Damaged 33,000 Structures in Israel"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/02/iran-damaged-33000-structures-in-israel/
    date: 2025-07-02 12:13
    summary: "The article discusses the aftermath of an Iranian missile strike on Israel, highlighting the significant destruction and casualties resulting from the attacks. Reports indicate that Israel's Iron Dome defense system failed to intercept many missiles, leading to widespread damage across multiple cities, including Tel Aviv and Bat Yam. Thousands of buildings were affected, with 29 Israeli civilians killed and extensive structural damage reported. The Israeli Tax Authority has received numerous applications for financial assistance due to the destruction. The article contrasts this event with the 1991 Gulf War, emphasizing the severity of the current situation. The piece also calls for support for independent journalism amid a landscape dominated by corporate interests."
  - title: "Palantir’s Shadow War On Iran"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/02/palantirs-shadow-war-on-iran/
    date: 2025-07-02 12:10
    summary: "The article by Kit Klarenberg discusses the implications of the recent "12 Day War," portraying it as a significant defeat for Israel and the U.S., with a focus on the role of Palantir, a tech company founded by Peter Thiel. It suggests that Palantir's advanced data analytics technology may have facilitated Israeli operations during the conflict, including targeted assassinations. The piece highlights concerns about the company's involvement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in monitoring Iran's nuclear activities, suggesting that this relationship may have compromised the IAEA's neutrality and led to intelligence-gathering that could support Israeli military actions. The article raises alarms about the potential misuse of data and predictive policing technologies, arguing that reliance on flawed information could have dire consequences, including wrongful targeting and increased tensions between Iran and Israel. Overall, it critiques the intertwining of technology, intelligence, and military strategy in contemporary conflicts, emphasizing the need for independent journalism to uncover these complex dynamics."
  - title: "The ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Would Subsidize the Billionaire Private Jet Class"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/02/the-big-beautiful-bill-would-subsidize-the-billionaire-private-jet-class/
    date: 2025-07-02 12:03
    summary: "The article by Chuck Collins highlights the ongoing push by the private jet lobby for significant tax breaks that would primarily benefit billionaires and centi-millionaires, allowing them to deduct the full purchase price of private jets in the year of acquisition through a provision in the proposed "Big Beautiful Bill." This legislation represents a substantial taxpayer subsidy for the private jet industry, which contributes disproportionately to greenhouse gas emissions, with private jets accounting for a significant share of air pollution despite their limited use of airspace. A recent study by the International Council on Clean Transportation reveals that private jets emitted 19.5 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2023, with the majority of emissions concentrated in the U.S. The article argues for a tax on private jet fuels to reflect their environmental costs and generate revenue for sustainable transportation initiatives, criticizing the current tax breaks as reckless in the context of climate change and growing wealth inequality."
  - title: "Chris Hedges: Profiting From Genocide"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/02/chris-hedges-profiting-from-genocide/
    date: 2025-07-02 11:59
    summary: "In a revealing report by Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, it is highlighted that numerous corporations and institutions, including major tech and defense companies, are profiting from the ongoing occupation and genocide of Palestinians, in violation of international law. The report identifies 48 corporations, including Palantir Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and Amazon, that have financial ties to Israel, facilitating the military's operations and contributing to the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and lives. It argues that the Israeli occupation serves as a lucrative testing ground for military technologies, with corporations exploiting Palestinian resources and labor while generating significant profits. The report calls for these entities to sever their ties with Israel or face accountability for their complicity in war crimes, emphasizing that the genocide in Gaza is sustained by a vast network of financial and institutional support, making these companies and organizations equally culpable in the violence against Palestinians."
  - title: "‘We Will Not Accept This Intimidation,’ Mamdani Says of Trump Threat to Arrest Him"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/02/we-will-not-accept-this-intimidation-mamdani-says-of-trump-threat-to-arrest-him/
    date: 2025-07-02 11:53
    summary: "Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has responded defiantly to threats from former President Donald Trump, who suggested Mamdani could be arrested for his refusal to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and falsely labeled him a "communist." Mamdani, a democratic socialist and current New York State Assembly member, condemned Trump's remarks as an attack on democracy and a message of intimidation aimed at those who oppose the administration's policies. He emphasized the need to stand against such threats, particularly in light of ongoing efforts by MAGA Republicans to undermine social safety nets and healthcare for working families. Mamdani recently won the Democratic primary with 56% of the vote, positioning him against a field that includes former Governor Andrew Cuomo and current Mayor Eric Adams, who has been criticized for his ties to Trump."
  - title: "US Approves $510 Million Arms Deal for Israel"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/02/us-approves-510-million-arms-deal-for-israel/
    date: 2025-07-02 11:49
    summary: "The Trump administration has approved a $510 million arms deal to supply Israel with Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs), which are kits that convert conventional bombs into precision-guided munitions, amidst ongoing military support for Israel's actions in Gaza. The deal, which includes thousands of JDAMs for both 2,000-pound and 500-pound bombs, is backed by Boeing as the principal contractor and is part of a broader context where U.S. military aid to Israel has surged since the escalation of conflict on October 7, 2023. Despite the evident implications of U.S. weaponry in civilian casualties during Israeli airstrikes—such as those reported by Human Rights Watch—there is minimal opposition in Congress to the arms sale, reflecting a strong bipartisan support for military assistance to Israel."

    date: 2025-07-01 12:04
    summary: "The article discusses the implications of Zohran Mamdani's recent victory in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, which has alarmed wealthy elites and corporate interests accustomed to controlling the political landscape. Mamdani's grassroots campaign, supported by 40,000 volunteers, represents a shift towards prioritizing the needs of the populace over megaprofits, prompting backlash from billionaires like Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb, who fear the rise of socialism in the city. The article highlights the potential for a coalition of powerful interests to undermine Mamdani's candidacy, drawing parallels to past electoral battles faced by progressive candidates like India Walton. As the upcoming election approaches, the struggle between populist policies and entrenched corporate power intensifies, with significant implications for the future of democracy and social justice in New York."
  - title: "Beyond the Bombs: Who Really Won the 12-Day War Between Israel and Iran?"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/01/beyond-the-bombs-who-really-won-the-12-day-war-between-israel-and-iran/
    date: 2025-07-01 12:01
    summary: "On June 13, 2025, Israel launched an unprovoked military strike against Iran, targeting military and nuclear sites, which resulted in significant casualties, including the deaths of numerous Iranian nuclear scientists and military leaders. This aggressive action led to a swift and devastating retaliation from Iran, which launched missile attacks on Israeli cities, causing widespread panic and damage. As the conflict escalated, the U.S. intervened, conducting airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, but these strikes ultimately failed to achieve their intended goals, leading to a ceasefire by June 22. Analysts suggest that the conflict, termed the "12 Day War," exposed Israel's vulnerabilities and strengthened Iran's resolve and unity against foreign aggression. The aftermath has left both Israel and the U.S. questioning their military capabilities and strategies, while Iran has signaled its intent to remain vigilant and prepared for future confrontations. The war has also led to a significant shift in public sentiment within Iran, fostering a sense of national identity and resilience against Western powers."
  - title: "Jonathan Cook: Attacking a Chant, Aiding a Genocide"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/01/jonathan-cook-attacking-a-chant-aiding-a-genocide/
    date: 2025-07-01 11:56
    summary: "The article discusses the backlash against British punk-rap band Bob Vylan for leading a chant of "Death to the IDF" during their performance at Glastonbury, which U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned as "appalling hate speech." The BBC apologized for airing the chant, while Glastonbury's organizers condemned it, reflecting a broader media and political outrage. However, the author, Jonathan Cook, argues that this outrage distracts from the actual violence perpetrated by the Israeli military in Gaza, where many civilians, including children, have been killed. Cook criticizes the media and government for prioritizing condemnation of the band's symbolic protest over addressing the ongoing genocide in Gaza, suggesting that the focus on Bob Vylan serves to deflect attention from the real issues at hand. He highlights the hypocrisy of condemning words while ignoring the violence of state actions, asserting that the media's framing of the situation obscures the complicity of the British government and the BBC in the violence against Palestinians."
  - title: "Jeffrey Sachs: The Time Has Arrived for a Comprehensive Middle East Peace"
    url: https://scheerpost.com/2025/07/01/jeffrey-sachs-the-time-has-arrived-for-a-comprehensive-middle-east-peace/
    date: 2025-07-01 11:51
    summary: "The recent attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran has underscored the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, primarily driven by Israel's strategy to maintain dominance and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. This approach has proven futile, as it perpetuates violence and instability rather than achieving security for Israel or peace in the region. The authors argue that a comprehensive peace agreement addressing Palestinian statehood, Israel's security, Iran's nuclear program, and regional economic recovery is essential. They propose a seven-point peace plan that includes a ceasefire, recognition of Palestine as a UN member state, withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied territories, and lifting sanctions on Iran, emphasizing that genuine peace is not only a moral obligation but also a vital U.S. interest. The article calls for a shift away from destructive policies and a commitment to a diplomatic resolution that benefits all parties involved."

    date: 2025-07-01 11:46
    summary: "Israeli forces have intensified their military assault on the Gaza Strip, resulting in the deaths of at least 95 Palestinians in a single day, including attacks on a café, a humanitarian aid distribution center, and schools sheltering displaced families. Eyewitness accounts describe horrific scenes of destruction and loss, with survivors recounting indiscriminate gunfire from Israeli troops targeting civilians seeking aid. The ongoing violence has led to nearly 600 deaths among aid-seekers and over 204,000 total casualties since October 2023, amid accusations of genocide and war crimes against Israeli leadership. The situation continues to deteriorate as forced evacuations and military operations aim to further control and occupy Gaza, raising international concerns about human rights violations and humanitarian crises in the region."
