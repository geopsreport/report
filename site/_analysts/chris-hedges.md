      More than 1 million people in the European Union died from avoidable causes in
      2022, according to new data from a Eurostats report. Of these, over 386,000 deaths
      were attributed to diseases treatable with quality healthcare, while at least
      725,000 could have been prevented through effective public health interventions.


      The conditions cited include heart disease, COVID-19, and several cancers – such
      as colon, breast, and lung cancer – that experts have long said could be more
      effectively addressed with proper investment in screening and treatment. Despite
      these warnings, European authorities continue to slash funding for health and
      care services while committing record sums to military spending.


      Eurostat’s report indicates that Eastern European countries are disproportionately
      affected. Latvia had the highest rate, with 543 preventable deaths per 100,000
      people, followed by Romania, Hungary, and Lithuania: countries where public health
      systems have been severely weakened by fiscal constraints and transition to profit-oriented
      services. In comparison, Sweden and Luxembourg recorded 169 and 180 preventable
      deaths per 100,000, respectively.


      “It is shocking and unacceptable that more than a million people are losing their
      lives every year in the EU to avoidable conditions because our healthcare services
      are not properly funded,” said Esther Lynch, General Secretary of the European
      Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). “It also shows there is absolutely no room to
      reallocate resources from social spending to defense.”


      In response, trade unions have renewed their call to end austerity and ensure
      that the wealthiest contribute fairly to the functioning of public services. “The
      resources exist: even a modest 1% tax on extreme wealth would be sufficient to
      cover staff shortages in health,” stated Jan Willem Goudriaan of the European
      Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU). “Our public services need more investment
      and the wealthiest should pay their fair share in the wake of record corporate
      profits and dividend payouts,” added Lynch.


      A key trade union demand is increased funding for the training and hiring of healthcare
      workers. OECD data shows a current shortage of at least 1.2 million healthcare
      workers in Europe: this figure is likely underestimated, as it is based on minimum
      Universal Health Coverage (UHC) thresholds rather than the actual requirements
      for universal care.


      The staffing crisis is taking a serious toll on both workers and patients, with
      widespread reports of burnout and unsafe conditions, including overcrowded corridors
      and inadequate staffing ratios. “Commercialization and privatization do not solve
      these issues,” Goudriaan said. “We urgently need more public funding to address
      this. ‘Austerity kills’ is not just a slogan – it’s the reality faced daily by
      patients and health professionals.”

      By Kit Klarenberg / The Cradle


      Ever since Israel launched its illegal war of aggression against Iran on 13 June,
      speculation has swirled around the role played by MOSAIC – a tool created by shadowy
      spy-tech firm Palantir.


      This software has been deeply embedded within the International Atomic Energy
      Agency’s (IAEA) operations, particularly its “safeguarding” mission: inspections
      and monitoring state compliance with non-proliferation agreements.


      MOSAIC has been central to this work for a decade and was quietly integrated by
      former US president Barack Obama’s administration into the July 2015 Joint Comprehensive
      Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear deal with Iran.


      Espionage disguised as oversight


      The deal granted IAEA inspectors unfettered access to Iran’s nuclear facilities
      to confirm the absence of a nuclear weapons program. In the process, the agency
      accumulated an immense trove of data: surveillance imagery, sensor measurements,
      facility documents – all of which were fed into MOSAIC’s predictive system.


      Yet the software’s pivotal role in the deal remained concealed until a Bloomberg
      exposé in May 2018, just days before US President Donald Trump, during his first
      term, unilaterally tore up the agreement and launched Washington’s so-called “maximum
      pressure” campaign against Tehran.


      Despite Trump tearing up the deal, inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities continued,
      as did MOSAIC’s monitoring of Tehran’s nuclear program. As Bloomberg noted, Palantir’s
      technology helped the IAEA scrutinize vast swaths of information from disparate
      sources, including 400 million “digital objects” globally, such as “social media
      feeds and satellite photographs inside Iran” – a capability that “raised concern
      the IAEA may overstep the boundary between nuclear monitoring and intelligence-gathering.”


      The Bloomberg piece also provided fodder for an oft-stated Iranian concern that
      Mosaic was helping Israelis track Iranian scientists for assassination:


      “The tool is at the analytical core of the agency’s new $50 million MOSAIC platform,
      turning databases of classified information into maps that help inspectors visualize
      ties between the people, places and material involved in nuclear activities, IAEA
      documents show.”


      Bloomberg quoted the head of a British company that “advises governments on verification
      issues” on the hazards of false data being fed into MOSAIC, “either by accident
      or design”:


      “You will generate a false return if you add a false assumption into the system
      without making the appropriate qualifier …You’ll end up convincing yourself that
      shadows are real.”


      The underlying and ongoing concern for Tehran is that MOSAIC is heavily influenced
      by Palantir’s “predictive-policing software.” Employed by many law enforcement
      agencies across the western world at enormous expense, this technology is highly
      controversial and has been found to exhibit dangerous, misleading biases, leading
      to erroneous “pre-crime” interventions.


      Indeed, MIT Technology Review has flat-out called for the dismantlement of predictive
      tech in a report that looks at how dangerous the technology has been in analyzing
      even domestic criminal data:


      “Lack of transparency and biased training data mean these tools are not fit for
      purpose. If we can’t fix them, we should ditch them.”


      Given the inclusion of dubious intelligence – such as the Mossad-stolen Iranian
      nuclear archive, openly celebrated by the Israeli agency for its deception – it
      is highly probable that such corrupted data triggered unjustified inspections.
      Bloomberg quoted a negotiator who helped craft the 2015 deal, expressing concern
      over how “dirty or unstructured data” could lead to “a flurry of unnecessary snap
      inspections.”


      Palantir’s software specifically helped the IAEA “plan and justify unscheduled
      probes” – at least 60 of these conducted until US-Israeli strikes put an end to
      inspections.


      Data as a weapon


      On 31 May, the IAEA released a report suggesting Iran may still be developing
      nuclear weapons. Although it presented no new evidence, its dubious charges related
      “to activities dating back decades” at three sites where, purportedly, until the
      early 2000s, “undeclared nuclear material” was handled.


      Its findings prompted the UN nuclear watchdog’s Board of Governors to charge Iran
      as “in breach of its non-proliferation obligations” on 12 June, providing Tel
      Aviv with a propaganda pretext for its illegal attack the next day.


      On 17 June, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi conceded that the agency had “no proof of
      a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon” by Tehran. Still, the damage
      was done. Iranian lawmakers, citing the IAEA’s secret sharing of sensitive data
      with Tel Aviv and Grossi’s covert collusion with Israeli officials, suspended
      all cooperation with the agency.


      This may be the wisest course for other states under IAEA scrutiny. MOSAIC is
      now so entwined with the agency’s daily function that any country targeted for
      regime change could find itself accused of nuclear ambitions based on manufactured
      evidence.


      A 2017 IAEA document reveals MOSAIC is comprised of “over 20 different software
      development projects.” Launched in May 2015, it was hoped to revolutionize “safeguarding”
      the world over.


      The report described MOSAIC as providing inspectors with “a suite of tools with
      which to face the challenges of tomorrow.” For instance, the Electronic Verification
      Package (EVP) enables field data – including planning, reporting, and review –
      to be automatically collected and processed. When inspectors visit a facility,
      they record vast amounts of information – instantly analyzed at headquarters via
      EVP.


      Elsewhere, the Collaborative Analysis Platform (CAP) enables deep cross-referencing
      of internal and open-source data, including overhead imagery. It supports the
      IAEA’s core safeguarding processes: “planning, information collection and analysis,
      verification, and evaluation.”


      CAP gives the IAEA “the capability to search, collect, and integrate multiple
      data and information sources to enable comprehensive analysis.” An IAEA official
      quoted in the document declared the platform represented “a major leap forward
      in analytics” and “a game changer”, allowing the IAEA to collect “a much greater
      amount of information, and also analyze that information in greater depth than
      before.”


      Such analytical capacity grants inspectors “the ability to establish relationships
      between information from multiple sources, across time,” and “make sense out of
      huge amounts of data.”


      CAP also assists in the collection and evaluation of open-source information.
      The document noted the platform could “process much more open-source information
      than the Department currently has capacity for,” and lets staff “search information
      across the entire repository; carefully cross-check different types of information;
      and utilize information in visual formats,” such as “overhead imagery.”


      ‘Extra-budgetary contributions’ from the US government


      All of this intelligence is highly sensitive and would be a treasure trove for
      states intent on military action against nations in the IAEA’s crosshairs. According
      to the 2017 report, inspectors spent 13,248 days in the field in 2015 and inspected
      709 nuclear facilities. Those figures have since grown. All the while, MOSAIC
      – a little-known tool for the “early detection of the misuse of nuclear material
      or technology” – has remained operational.


      The report noted that MOSAIC was financed through the IAEA’s regular budget, the
      Major Capital Investment Fund, and “extra-budgetary contributions.” Its cost at
      the time was around €41 million (approximately $44.15 million) – almost 10 percent
      of the agency’s total annual budget. The source and size of those extra-budgetary
      contributions remain vague, perhaps deliberately, but a Congressional Research
      Service briefing note indicates Washington formally funds the IAEA to the tune
      of over $100 million annually.


      Moreover, the US consistently provides in excess of $90 million in extra-budgetary
      contributions every year. In other words, almost half of the IAEA’s budget flows
      from Stateside, suggesting MOSAIC was created wholly on Washington’s dime.


      The timing of its rollout – two months prior to the Obama administration’s nuclear
      deal being agreed – could further indicate it was explicitly funded with Iran
      in mind. As then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano revealed in March 2018, the
      association’s penetration of Tehran was unprecedented.


      At a press conference, Amano referred to the IAEA’s nuclear “verification regime”
      in Iran as “the world’s most robust.” The organization’s inspectors spent “3,000
      calendar days per year on the ground” in the country, capturing “hundreds of thousands
      of images captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras,” which was
      “about half of the total number of such images that we collect throughout the
      world.”


      In all, “over one million pieces of open source information” were collected by
      the IAEA monthly.


      The IAEA’s fixation on Iran, coupled with suspicions that it provided the names
      of nuclear scientists – later assassinated by Israel – raises the question: Was
      the 2015 deal always an industrial-scale espionage operation designed to prepare
      for war?


      A wave of assassinations of nuclear scientists and IRGC commanders in the early
      stages of Tel Aviv’s failed war on Iran appears to support that conclusion.


      Iranian officials not only suspended cooperation with the IAEA and ordered the
      dismantlement of inspection cameras, but also rejected Grossi’s request to visit
      bombed nuclear sites. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi branded the IAEA chief’s
      insistence on visiting under the pretext of safeguards “meaningless and possibly
      even malign in intent.”


      What is clear is that any state still cooperating with the IAEA must now reckon
      with the possibility that it is not being monitored – it is being mapped for war.

      By Vijay Prashad / Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research


      A decade ago, I was a fly on the wall during a trade negotiation between the United
      States and a small country in Southeast Asia. What interested me was not the substance
      of the negotiation, the deliberations around an issue of minor concern to world
      affairs but of great concern to this one country, but the disproportionality between
      the personnel at the negotiating table.


      The delegation from the United States that arrived at this nondescript office
      in Geneva, Switzerland, was considerable in two respects: first, it had an overabundance
      of lawyers and associates, and second, they came armed with a large number of
      binders that had all the paperwork for their case, replete with labelled page-holders
      so that they could dive directly into the points they needed to make in the discussion.
      The contingent from the Asian country, on the other hand, was sparse: it was made
      up of a lone representative from its United Nations office in Geneva who was neither
      a trade specialist nor a lawyer and who came armed only with a manila folder holding
      a few sheets of paper. The negotiations reflected this unevenness, with the US
      trade representatives running circles around the junior Asian bureaucrat. I went
      to have a coffee with this bureaucrat afterwards. He was rattled. He felt robbed.


      A few years ago, a mid-level official from an East African country told me that
      he had signed a loan agreement with an Asian bank without having the skills to
      understand the loan document or the time to read it from start to finish. Around
      the same time, an official from a ministry in Latin America told me that they
      outsource their analysis of trade documents to a foundation linked to a non-profit
      organisation from the United States. In other words, their negotiations are based
      on the briefs provided by this foundation and not their own analysis and assessment.
      These examples could easily be multiplied, the stories recounted vaguely so as
      not to embarrass colleagues and countries that have been put in very difficult
      circumstances by neocolonial structures.


      It is hard to quantify the impact of such institutional imbalances, largely because
      there is no international agency that collects data on government officials in
      general or on negotiators in particular. Among the sparse data that exists in
      this arena is the World Bank’s Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators Dashboard, which
      shows that roughly 18.6% of the total working population in the Global North is
      employed by the government, while in the Global South that number is closer to
      10%. An International Labour Organisation study on Africa shows us that the numbers
      are much lower in many countries, below 3% in African countries such as Chad,
      Côte d’Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, and Tanzania. While there is no granular data
      on the number of trade negotiators or trade lawyers in the government, for instance,
      the above is a reasonable picture of the general disparity between the state capacity
      in the North and South.


      The scale of this disparity is incredible (the exceptions are socialist state
      projects, such as China and Vietnam, where government officials remain well trained
      and in larger numbers – making up about a fifth of the workforce in China). Many
      of the reasons for this inequality are obvious, but they are worth listing at
      any rate:


      Most public administration schools in the Global South have seen enormous budget
      cuts induced by the International Monetary Fund’s debt-austerity policies, impacting,
      for instance, the ability to train teachers and create syllabi that are both up
      to date and relevant to the specific national conditions in which these future
      public servants will have to operate. Alongside the austerity measures imposed
      on public administration schools, there has also been a steady closure or contraction
      of state planning commissions and research departments. These are the institutions
      that would normally provide government cadres with an intellectual orientation
      toward their country’s position in the international economy and the immediate
      tasks for a national development programme. The lack of such institutions leaves
      cadres without a clear mandate or direction. There has been an attrition of general
      patriotic and anti-colonial sentiment among government employees who are underpaid
      and undertrained. This psychological warfare brought about by neoliberalism and
      cultural imperialism means that newer generations of public servants are both
      unable to argue the case for the well-being of their people and are prone to inducements
      of different kinds (including corruption). An increased sense of individualism
      among the population has also led to careerism and the accumulation of personal
      wealth and privileges at the expense of national interest. As state-run institutions
      have been closed or shrunk, Western-funded non-governmental organisations have
      emerged to provide ‘technical assistance’. These programmes are often staffed
      by people who are trained in foreign universities, have a class background that
      is not necessarily aligned with the vast majority of the population, and have
      a limited understanding of the historical and sociological developments in their
      country. Moreover, the agendas of these institutions are designed by their foreign
      benefactors who are often driven by their own self-interest.


      The attrition of public administration schools, combined with the lack of political
      will within governments to assert the sovereignty of their societies, has allowed
      the ambitions of multinational corporations and international financial institutions
      to set the direction of these countries. This lack of capacity and political clarity
      has meant that states in the Global South routinely surrender to the well-developed
      agendas of foreign institutions that are often much clearer about what they want.
      The need to build administrative capacities in the Global South goes hand in hand
      with the broader need for a new development theory for the South so that we may
      be able to define our own agenda, against that of the neocolonial interlopers.


      Sitting in that meeting in Geneva some years ago, watching the US officials and
      their lawyers walk circles around the junior Southeast Asian official, I thought
      of Nizar Qabbani’s 1967 poem ‘Footnotes to the Book of the Setback’, written shortly
      after the Palestinians’ defeat in the Six-Day War. The poem, published in Damascus,
      Syria, was subsequently banned and smuggled into countries across the Arab world.
      Two lines from the poem ricocheted around my mind:


      Our enemies did not cross our borders.


      They crept through our weaknesses like ants.


      We must strengthen our weaknesses.

      which often do not align with local needs. Prashad argues that the erosion of

      to build administrative capacities and develop a new framework for self-determined
      progress against neocolonial influences.

      On Tuesday, July 1, 2025, African Stream published its final video, a defiant
      farewell message. With that, the once-thriving pan-African media outlet confirmed
      it was shutting down for good. Not because it broke the law. Not because it spread
      disinformation or incited violence. But because it told the wrong story, one that
      challenged U.S. power in Africa and resonated too deeply with Black audiences
      around the world. When Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused it of being a
      Kremlin front, Big Tech didn’t hesitate, and within hours, the platform was erased
      from nearly every major social media site.


      In September, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made the call and announced
      an all-out war against the organization, claiming, without evidence, that it was
      a Russian front group. “Russian state-funded media outlet RT secretly runs the
      online platform, African Stream, across a wide range of social media platforms,”
      he said, adding:


      According to the outlet’s website, ‘African Stream is’ – and I quote ‘a pan-African
      digital media organization based exclusively on social media platforms, focused
      on giving a voice to all Africans, both at home and abroad.’ In reality, the only
      voice it gives is to Kremlin propagandists.”


      Within hours, big social media platforms jumped into action. Google, YouTube,
      Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok all deleted African Stream’s accounts, while Twitter
      demonetized the organization.


      AFRICAN STREAM IS CLOSING DOWN




      This is, sadly, a farewell to you, our loyal followers and supporters. Under relentless
      attack, we’ve made the painful decision to shut down African Stream—a platform
      that many of you’ve come to trust and love. This decision was not made lightly.…
      pic.twitter.com/LNRbT00Lkv — African Stream (@african_stream) June 22, 2025


      African Stream attempted to continue, but it finally ceased operations this week.
      MintPress News spoke with the company’s founder and CEO, Ahmed Kaballo, who told
      us that, with just one statement, Washington was able to destroy their entire
      operation, stating:


      We are shutting down because the business has become untenable. After we got attacked
      by Antony Blinken, we really tried to continue, but without a platform on YouTube,
      Instagram, TikTok, and being demonetized on X, it just meant the ability to generate
      income became damn near impossible.”


      The news has disappointed the Nairobi, Kenya-based outlet’s large and rapidly
      growing follower base. At the time of the coordinated operation against it, the
      account boasted almost one million followers on TikTok, almost 880,000 on Instagram,
      and almost half a million on YouTube, reaching 30-40 million people per month.
      Growing from nothing in 2022, it expanded rapidly, offering a pan-African perspective
      on global events, and worked to expose the role of imperialism on the continent.


      African Stream cultivated a large and committed audience among African Americans,
      with celebrities, rappers, and NBA basketball stars regularly sharing their content.
      It was this combination of anti-imperialist messaging and influence with Black
      America that Kaballo believes triggered the State Department smears, explaining
      that:


      We criticized the Republicans and the Democrats. We followed the pan-African tradition
      of Malcolm X, who said that there is no difference between the fox and the wolf,
      you get bitten either way. And because we had so much influence on the Black community
      in the U.S., we were seen to be a threat to the Democratic Party. That’s why we
      feel like it was a partisan attack.”


      Blinken’s attack was not the first African Stream had received. Last June, NBC
      News claimed (without providing examples) that African Stream sought to undermine
      the 2024 elections by spreading disinformation. Then, in August, U.S. government-funded
      media outlet Voice of America wrote that Kaballo’s organization “distorts the
      U.S. military’s mission in Somalia,” insisting that the U.S. is bombing one of
      the continent’s poorest countries to “protect civilians.” Leaked documents also
      show that the British Foreign Office plotted to run a smear campaign against them.


      Kaballo told MintPress that he expected the attacks. “It’s no real surprise,”
      he said. “The surprise was that big tech, with no evidence whatsoever, decided
      to take us down.”


      However, given the extremely close ties between Silicon Valley and the U.S. national
      security state – something that MintPress has consistently reported on – Kaballo
      should perhaps have been more prepared for this outcome.


      Google’s Director of Security and Public Trust, Ben Randa, for example, was formerly
      NATO’s Strategic Planning and Information Officer. Meanwhile, Facebook’s Senior
      Misinformation Policy Manager, Aaron Berman, the individual most responsible for
      determining the platform’s political direction, is a former high-ranking CIA agent.
      Like other platforms, TikTok has also hired dozens of former officials from the
      FBI, CIA, and State Department to oversee its most sensitive internal affairs.


      If Blinken genuinely wanted to unearth a government-sponsored influence operation,
      he would not have to look far. Earlier this year, a funding freeze at the U.S.
      government agency USAID exposed a global network of supposedly “independent” media
      outlets that Washington secretly bankrolled. The scale of this operation was vast:
      more than 6,200 journalists at nearly 1,000 organizations across five continents
      had their salaries secretly paid in whole or in part by the U.S. government.


      While the outlooks of these media groups differed, they all shared one similarity:
      an unwavering commitment to promoting Washington’s interests.


      The pause in funding was keenly felt in Ukraine. Oksana Romanyuk, the director
      of the country’s Institute for Mass Information, lamented that almost 90% of local
      media outlets were funded by USAID, including many with no other source of income.


      In neighboring Belarus, a survey of 20 leading outlets found that 60% of their
      budgets came directly from Washington.


      Following the freeze, anti-government Cuban media were plunged into an existential
      crisis. Miami-based CubaNet, for instance, published an editorial soliciting donations
      from its readers. “We are facing an unexpected challenge: the suspension of key
      funding that sustained part of our work,” they wrote; “If you value our work and
      believe in keeping the truth alive, we ask for your support.”


      In 2024, CubaNet received around half a million dollars from USAID alone. U.S.-backed
      Iranian media, meanwhile, resorted to mass layoffs of their staff.


      The African Stream story highlights the sorry state of global communications,
      where the United States has the power to choke, and even simply delete, media
      outlets that stand for an alternative vision of the world. Washington both funds
      thousands of journalists around the planet to produce pro-U.S. propaganda, and,
      through its close connections to Silicon Valley, has the power to destroy those
      that do not toe the line.


      African Stream is far from the first independent, anti-imperialist news organization
      to have been targeted by Washington. MintPress itself has been repeatedly attacked
      and smeared as a secret Iranian, Chinese, Russian, Syrian, or even Venezuelan
      operation. Our reach on social media has been throttled, and we have been debanked
      by PayPal. Other leading alternative media outlets tell a similar story.


      It is a similar story in Europe, where the region’s support for Israeli actions
      in Palestine has sparked a crackdown on independent journalism. British journalists
      Richard Medhurst and Asa Winstanley have had their homes raided by police, while
      the European Union has sanctioned Hüseyin Dogru for his coverage of pro-Palestine
      protests.


      In what may prove to be their final post, on Tuesday, July 1, African Stream released
      a video of their staff dancing, accompanied by the words:


      It’s tough to accept that we had to shut down over baseless accusations by the
      U.S. government. But instead of bowing out in silence, the team chose to resist,
      just as our ancestors often did, through dance. You can deplatform us. You can
      smear us. But you can’t stop us dancing.”


      On the surface, the overt censorship of a Kenyan media outlet by the U.S. government
      may be a depressing story. Yet Kaballo remained upbeat about the situation, noting
      that the state of radical African media has drastically improved since 2022, with
      many channels taking up a pan-African, anti-imperialist message. “In the next
      few years, hopefully there will be 20 or 30 different versions of African Stream,
      hitting people with high-quality content,” he said.

      By Ben Norton / Geopolitical Economy Report


      The Global South-led organization BRICS continues to expand.


      While the United States and Israel were busy waging war on Iran in June, BRICS
      quietly announced that Vietnam had accepted the group’s invitation to join as
      a partner country.


      With the addition of Vietnam, the extended BRICS+ has 20 members and partners,
      as of July 2025.


      The 10 BRICS members are Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia,
      Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.


      The 10 BRICS partners are Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria,
      Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.


      Together, the BRICS 20 make up 43.93% of the global economy, when their combined
      GDP is measured at purchasing power parity (PPP), according to IMF data.


      The BRICS 20 have a combined population of 4.45 billion, out of a global population
      of 8.01 billion in 2025, based on IMF data.


      This means that BRICS+ represents 55.61% of the world population.


      BRICS was initially founded as BRIC – by Brazil, Russia, India, and China – in
      2009. South Africa joined in 2010, and it became BRICS.


      The Global South-led organization first expanded at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg,
      South Africa in 2023, adding new members.


      At its 2024 summit in Kazan, Russia, BRICS invited a dozen more countries to join
      as “partner states”.


      Since it has expanded, the group has frequently been referred to as BRICS+, although
      there is not a fixed definition of this term, and both names are used.


      Vietnam had been invited to become a BRICS partner at the summit in October 2024,
      but it waited to accept the invitation until June 2025.


      USA fails to divide China and Vietnam: Hanoi maintains non-alignment


      Vietnam’s decision to join BRICS is deeply symbolic, because it reaffirms the
      country’s independent foreign policy and strategic non-alignment.


      BRICS itself shares many commonalities with the Non-Aligned Movement, which was
      founded by anti-colonial Global South leaders who refused to participate in the
      First Cold War.


      In the 21st century, the United States has sought to divide Vietnam from China,
      as part of the Second Cold War that Washington is waging against Beijing.


      The US government plans to reroute supply chains through Vietnam to exclude China,
      in an example of what has been dubbed “friendshoring”.


      Washington has pressured US companies to technologically “decouple” from China,
      to pull their investments out of the country, and to instead relocate to Vietnam.


      This divide-and-conquer policy has been pursued by both the Donald Trump and Joe
      Biden administrations.


      US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager from Wall
      Street, sought to recruit Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, and India to isolate China
      in what Bloomberg described as a “grand encirclement” strategy.


      Vietnam, however, has adamantly resisted US efforts to sabotage its relations
      with China.


      In fact, relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in recent years, following
      the tumultuous decades of the First Cold War and the Sino-Soviet split, when Vietnam
      had leaned much closer to the USSR.


      China is Vietnam’s largest trading partner. The US is the second-biggest.


      Donald Trump’s threat to impose high tariffs on Vietnam, whose economy depends
      a lot on exports to the US market, has only encouraged Hanoi and Beijing to move
      closer together.


      Today, Vietnam promotes non-alignment, based on the policy of the “Four Nos”,
      which the Vietnamese government has defined as follows:


      no partaking in military alliances,


      no siding with one country to act against another,


      no foreign military bases in the Vietnamese territory or using Viet Nam as leverage
      to counteract other countries, and


      no using force or threatening to use force in international relations.


      Despite their geopolitical differences after the Sino-Soviet split, the People’s
      Republic of China and Socialist Republic of Vietnam have very similar political
      and economic systems, especially after both carried out a market reform process.


      China describes its system as a socialist market economy. Vietnam calls its system
      a socialist-oriented market economy.


      The market-socialist models in China and Vietnam have been remarkably successful
      in economically developing, reducing poverty, raising incomes of the working class,
      and moving up the global value chain of industrial manufacturing.

      By DemocracyNow!


      In our July Fourth special broadcast, we revisit our interview with longtime technology
      reporter Karen Hao, author of the new book Empire of AI, which unveils the accruing
      political and economic power of AI companies — especially Sam Altman’s OpenAI.
      Her reporting uncovered the exploitation of workers in Kenya, attempts to take
      massive amounts of freshwater from communities in Chile, along with numerous accounts
      of the technology’s detrimental impact on the environment. “This is an extraordinary
      type of AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental
      harms,” says Hao, in an extended interview.


      Transcript


      This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.


      AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.
      I’m Amy Goodman.


      We turn now to the Empire of AI. That’s the name of a new book by the journalist
      Karen Hao, who’s closely reported on the rise of the artificial intelligence industry
      with a focus on Sam Altman’s OpenAI. That’s the company behind ChatGPT. Karen
      Hao compares the actions of the AI industry to those of colonial powers in the
      past. She writes, quote, “The empires of AI are not engaged in the same overt
      violence and brutality that marked this history. But they, too, seize and extract
      precious resources to feed their vision of artificial intelligence: the work of
      artists and writers; the data of countless individuals posting about their experiences
      and observations online; the land, energy, and water required to house and run
      massive data centers and supercomputers,” she writes.


      Karen Hao is a former reporter at The Wall Street Journal and MIT Technology Review,
      where she became the first journalist to profile OpenAI. Democracy Now!’s Juan
      González and I spoke to her in May. I began by asking her to explain what artificial
      intelligence is.


      KAREN HAO: So, AI is a collection of many different technologies, but most people
      were introduced to it through ChatGPT. And what I argue in the book, and what
      the title refers to, Empire of AI, it’s actually a critique of the specific trajectory
      of AI development that led us to ChatGPT and has continued since ChatGPT. And
      that is specifically Silicon Valley’s scale-at-all-costs approach to AI development.


      AI models in modern day, they are trained on data. They need computers to train
      them on that data. But what Silicon Valley did, and what OpenAI did in the last
      few years, is they started blowing up the amount of data and the size of the computers
      that need to do this training. So, we are talking about the full English-language
      internet being fed into these models — books, scientific articles, all of the
      intellectual property that has been created — and also massive supercomputers
      that run tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of computer chips that
      are the size of dozens, maybe hundreds, of football fields and use practically
      the entire energy demands of cities now. So, this is an extraordinary type of
      AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental harms.
      And that is ultimately why I evoke this analogy to empire.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Karen, could you talk some more about not only the energy
      requirements, but the water requirements of these huge data centers that are,
      in essence, the backbone of this widening industry?


      KAREN HAO: Absolutely. I’ll give you two stats on both the energy and the water.
      When talking about the energy demand, McKinsey recently came out with a report
      that said in the next five years, based on the current pace of AI computational
      infrastructure expansion, we would need to put as much energy on the global grid
      as what is consumed by two to six times the energy consumed annually by the state
      of California, and that will mostly be serviced by fossil fuels. We’re already
      seeing reporting of coal plants with their lives being extended. They were supposed
      to retire, but now they cannot, to support this data center development. We are
      seeing methane gas turbines, unlicensed ones, being popped up to service these
      data centers, as well.


      From a freshwater perspective, these data centers need to be trained on freshwater.
      They cannot be trained on any other type of water, because it can corrode the
      equipment, it can lead to bacterial growth. And most of the time, it actually
      taps directly into a public drinking water supply, because that is the infrastructure
      that has been laid to deliver this clean freshwater to different businesses, to
      different homes. And Bloomberg recently had an analysis where they looked at the
      expansion of these data centers around the world, and two-thirds of them are being
      placed in water-scarce areas. So they’re being placed in communities that do not
      have access to freshwater. So, it’s not just the total amount of freshwater that
      we need to be concerned about, but actually the distribution of this infrastructure
      around the world.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And most people are familiar with ChatGPT, the consumer aspect
      of AI, but what about the military aspect of AI, where, in essence, we’re finding
      Silicon Valley companies becoming the next generation of defense contractors?


      KAREN HAO: One of the reasons why OpenAI and many other companies are turning
      to the defense industry is because they have spent an extraordinary amount of
      money in developing these technologies. They’re spending hundreds of billions
      to train these models. And they need to recoup those costs. And there are only
      so many industries and so many places that have that size of a paycheck to pay.
      And so, that’s why we’re seeing a cozying up to the defense industry. We’re also
      seeing Silicon Valley use the U.S. government in their empire-building ambitions.
      You could argue that the U.S. government is also trying to use Silicon Valley,
      vice versa, in their empire-building ambitions.


      But certainly, these technologies are not — they are not designed to be used in
      a sensitive military context. And so, the aggressive push of these companies to
      try and get those defense contracts and integrate their technologies more and
      more into the infrastructure of the military is really alarming.


      AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to the countries you went to, or the stories you covered,
      because, I mean, this is amazing, the depth of your reporting, from Kenya to Uruguay
      to Chile. You were talking about the use of water. And I also want to ask you
      about nuclear power.


      KAREN HAO: Yeah.


      AMY GOODMAN: But in Chile, what is happening there around these data centers and
      the water they would use and the resistance to that?


      KAREN HAO: Yeah. So, Chile has an interesting history in that it’s been under
      — it was under a dictatorship for a very long time. And so, during that time,
      most public resources were privatized, including water. But because of an anomaly,
      there’s one community in the greater Santiago metropolitan region that actually
      still has access to a public freshwater resource that services both that community,
      as well as the rest of the country in emergency situations. That is the exact
      community that Google chose to try to put a data center in. And they proposed
      for their data center to use a thousand times more freshwater than that community
      used annually.


      AMY GOODMAN: And it would be free.


      KAREN HAO: And it — you know, I have no idea. That is a great question. But what
      the community told me was they weren’t even paying taxes for this, because they
      believed, based on reading the documentation, that the taxes that Google was paying
      was, in fact, to where they had registered their offices, their administrative
      offices, not where they were putting down the data center. So they were not seeing
      any benefit from this data center directly to that community, and they were seeing
      no checks placed on the freshwater that this data center would have been allowed
      to extract.


      And so, these activists said, “Wait a minute. Absolutely not. We’re not going
      to allow this data center to come in, unless they give us a legitimate reason
      for why it benefits us.” And so, they started doing boots-on-the-ground activism,
      pushing back, knocking on every single one of their neighbors’ doors, handing
      out flyers to the community, telling them, “This company is taking our freshwater
      resources without giving us anything in return.”


      And so, they escalated so dramatically that it escalated to Google Chile. It escalated
      to Google Mountain View, which, by the way, then sent representatives to Chile
      that only spoke English. But then, it eventually escalated to the Chilean government.
      And the Chilean government now has roundtables where they ask these community
      residents and the company representatives and representatives from the government
      to come together to actually discuss how to make data center development more
      beneficial to the community.


      The activists say the fight is not over. Just because they’ve been invited to
      the table doesn’t mean that everything is suddenly better. They need to stay vigilant.
      They need to continue scrutinizing these projects. But thus far, they’ve been
      able to block this project for four to five years and have gained that seat at
      the table.


      JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how is it that these Western companies, in essence, are exploiting
      labor in the Global South? You go into something called data annotation firms.
      What are those?


      KAREN HAO: Yeah, so, because AI, modern-day AI systems are trained on massive
      amounts of data, and they’re scraped — that’s scraped from the internet, you can’t
      actually pump that data directly into your AI model, because there are a lot of
      things within that data. It’s heavily polluted. It needs to be cleaned. It needs
      to be annotated. So, this is where data annotation firms come in. These are middle-man
      firms that hire contract labor to provide to these AI companies to do that kind
      of data preparation.


      And OpenAI, when it was starting to think about commercializing its products and
      thinking about, “Let’s put text-generation machines that can spew any kind of
      text into the hands of millions of users,” they realized they needed to have some
      kind of content moderation. They needed to develop a filter that would wrap around
      these models and prevent these models from actually spewing racist, hateful and
      harmful speech to users. That would not make a very good, commercially viable
      product.


      And so, they contracted these middle-man firms in Kenya, where the Kenyan workers
      had to read through reams of the worst text on the internet, as well as AI-generated
      text, where OpenAI was prompting its own AI models to imagine the worst text on
      the internet and then telling these Kenyan workers to detail — to categorize them
      in detailed taxonomies of “Is this sexual content? Is this violent content? How
      graphic is that violent content?” in order to teach its filter all the different
      categories of content it had to block.


      And this is an incredibly uncommon form of labor. There are lots of other different
      types of contract labor that they use. But these workers, they’re paid a few bucks
      an hour, if at all. And just like the era of social media, these content moderators
      are left very deeply psychologically traumatized. And ultimately, there is no
      real philosophy behind why these workers are paid a couple bucks an hour and have
      their lives destroyed, and why AI researchers who also contribute to these models
      are paid million-dollar compensation packages simply because they sit in Silicon
      Valley, in OpenAI’s offices. That is the logic of empire, and that harkens back
      to my title, Empire of AI.


      AMY GOODMAN: So, let’s go back to your title, Empire of AI, the subtitle, Dreams
      and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI. So, tell us the story of Sam Altman and
      what OpenAI is all about, right through to the deal he just made in the Gulf,
      when President Trump, Sam Altman and Elon Musk were there.


      KAREN HAO: Altman is very much a product of Silicon Valley. His career was first
      as a founder of a startup, and then as the president of Y Combinator, which is
      one of the most famous startup accelerators in Silicon Valley, and then the CEO
      of OpenAI. And there’s no coincidence that OpenAI ended up introducing the world
      to the scale-at-all-costs approach to AI development, because that is the way
      that Silicon Valley has operated in the entire time that Altman came up in it.


      And so, he is a very strategic person. He is incredibly good at telling stories
      about the future and painting these sweeping visions that investors and employees
      want to be a part of. And so, early on at YC, he identified that AI would be one
      of the trends that could take off. And he was trying to build a portfolio of different
      investments and different initiatives to place himself in the center of various
      different trends, depending on which one took off. He was investing in quantum
      computing, he was investing in nuclear fusion, he was investing in self-driving
      cars, and he was developing a fundamental AI research lab. Ultimately, the AI
      research lab was the ones that started accelerating really quickly, so he makes
      himself the CEO of that company.


      And originally, he started it as a nonprofit to try and position it as a counter
      to for-profit-driven incentives in Silicon Valley. But within one-and-a-half years,
      OpenAI’s executives identified that if they wanted to be the lead in this space,
      they “had to” go for this scale-at-all-costs approach — and “had to” should be
      in quotes. They thought that they had to do this. There are actually many other
      ways to develop AI and to have progress in AI that does not take this approach.


      But once they decided that, they realized the bottleneck was capital. It just
      so happened Sam Altman is a once-in-a-generation fundraising talent. He created
      this new structure, nesting a for-profit arm within the nonprofit, to become this
      fundraising vehicle for the tens of billions, and ultimately hundreds of billions,
      that they needed to pursue the approach that they decided on. And that is how
      we ultimately get to present-day OpenAI, which is one of the most capitalistic
      companies in the history of Silicon Valley, continuing to raise hundreds of billions,
      and, Altman has joked, even trillions, to produce a technology that ultimately
      has a middling economic impact thus far.


      AMY GOODMAN: We’ll return to our conversation in a minute with Karen Hao, author
      of the new book, Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI. Stay
      with us.

      By Ana Vračar / Peoples Dispatch


      With a majority of 385 to 26, British parliamentarians voted on Wednesday to proscribe
      the direct action group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation, moving
      one step closer to criminalizing public support for its campaigns. The move, announced
      by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper after activists threw red paint on two Royal Air
      Force (RAF) planes, has drawn widespread condemnation as an assault on free speech
      and dissent, and has already sparked protests.


      “The British government deciding that Palestine Action should be proscribed as
      a terrorist organization is insanity, but not quite as insane at the continued
      support of Israel, an apartheid and genocidal state,” a Palestine Action activist
      told Peoples Dispatch. But the goal of this decision goes much further than a
      single group. “This is about silencing support of Palestine and silencing support
      of the resistance. Whilst mainstream media and everyone’s focus is on this, Israel
      is still murdering Palestinians daily.”


      Ahead of the vote, a group of UN experts urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration
      to reconsider, warning that the terrorism charges cited by Cooper are misleading
      and risk setting a dangerous precedent. Rather than addressing genuine acts of
      terror, the experts argued, the move will impact individuals exercising their
      rights to free opinion, peaceful assembly, and political participation. “This
      would have a chilling effect on political protest and advocacy generally in relation
      to defending human rights in Palestine,” the experts wrote.


      Attacks on the Palestine solidarity movement intensify


      Solidarity with Palestine has come under intense repression across Europe, especially
      as public opposition to government complicity in the Gaza genocide continues to
      grow louder. Artists who have expressed support on stage, as well as campaigners,
      face legal action. In the UK alone, activists Chris Nineham of Stop the War Coalition
      and Ben Jamal from Palestine Solidarity Campaign are both scheduled to stand trial
      just days after a final decision on the proscription of Palestine Action is expected.
      Activists who took direct action against enterprises complicit in genocide, including
      weapon manufacturers like Rafael, remain imprisoned. At the same time, bands like
      Kneecap and Bob Vylan face frenzied mainstream media backlash for expressing support
      for Palestinian liberation at concerts.


      “The attempt to proscribe Palestine Action as a ‘terrorist’ organization is yet
      another British colonial crime against the Palestinian people and a clear indication
      of British imperialism’s commitment to full complicity and participation in the
      ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and throughout occupied Palestine,”
      the prisoner solidarity network Samidoun said in a statement ahead of Wednesday’s
      vote.


      As the government moves to ban Palestine Action, critics highlight its own continued
      and active role in enabling Israeli war crimes. British authorities have allowed
      Israeli aircraft, including some linked to bombing campaigns in Gaza, to use RAF
      bases, including the site activists targeted with paint. “As the government criminalizes
      those engaged in protesting a genocide, it continues to shamefully facilitate
      the real violence these protestors oppose,” independent MP Jeremy Corbyn told
      Drop Site.


      Corbyn and other independent and former Labour MPs have proposed a formal inquiry
      into Britain’s complicity in the genocide, seeking to review all military, political,
      and economic cooperation with Israel since October 2023. However, few are holding
      their breath for a meaningful change in government policy, especially given ongoing
      industrial and tech ties, such as Elbit Systems’ operations in the UK and Palantir’s
      planned role in the National Health Service.


      “In coming to this decision [proscribing Palestine Action], the government has
      decided that an Israeli arms manufacturer has more rights than a British citizen
      who cannot abide killing and maiming,” the Palestinian Youth Movement wrote. Similarly,
      MP Zarah Sultana stated that Palestine Action’s true crime was shutting down Elbit
      Systems sites that provide supplies to the Israeli military. “Its true offence
      is being audacious enough to expose the blood soaked ties between this government
      and the genocidal Israeli apartheid state and its war machine,” Sultana said.


      Action against genocide as moral duty


      If Palestine Action is officially listed as a terrorist organization, activists
      could face severe prison sentences simply for displaying the group’s merchandise
      or expressing support. Journalists could also be targeted, as staff at Novara
      Media have warned, highlighting the potential for raids on homes and the seizure
      of devices just for reporting factually on the matter.


      The way the vote was orchestrated has also attracted serious criticism. Cooper
      bundled the proscription of Palestine Action with votes on far-right groups, including
      one called “Maniacs Murder Cult.” The move was widely understood as a tactic to
      block MPs from dissenting. In response, Palestine Action warned that MPs should
      be able to see through manipulations like these and oppose them. “All those who
      vote to take away everyone’s freedom of speech today must be held accountable,”
      the group wrote on Wednesday. “Putting us alongside the Maniacs Murder Cult is
      no excuse to vote for proscription.”


      If the motion passes through parliamentary procedure this week as planned, the
      ban could come into effect as early as Saturday. Despite the risk, public support
      for the group remains intact. Protesters have continued to rally in its defense,
      insisting on the legitimacy of direct action in the face of genocide. “Supporting
      a genocide is terrorism, direct action to stop a genocide is the duty of humanity,”
      wrote the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).

      By Sasha Abramsky / Truthout


      At last week’s NATO summit, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that
      his country would be buying a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S., each one
      capable of carrying a payload of tactical nuclear weapons. It marks the first
      time since shortly after the end of the Cold War that U.S. nuclear weapons capable
      of being dropped from aircraft are to be stationed in the U.K.


      At the NATO summit, a triumphant Trump — who has made skepticism about NATO and,
      at best, ambivalence about its collective defense provisions centerpieces of his
      emergent political ideology over the decades – engaged in one of the most brazen
      displays of shakedown politics in modern history. In exchange for maintaining
      U.S. security commitments, the U.S. president demanded, in the weeks leading up
      to the summit, that NATO members move toward spending an astounding 5 percent
      of their GDP on defense and security, more than doubling what most NATO members,
      with the exception of Poland and the Baltic States, currently spend.


      Leaders of the NATO member countries competed with each other over who could fawn
      the most in efforts to gain Trump’s favor, and ultimately almost all of them fell
      into line, agreeing to huge defense spending hikes over the coming decade. Their
      goal is that by 2035 they will be spending at least 3.5 percent of their respective
      GDPs on core military spending, and another 1.5 percent on security and miscellaneous
      other expenditures designed to harden economies and infrastructure against cyberattacks,
      people trafficking, and additional risks and perceived risks to NATO economies.


      The one exception was Spain, the socialist government of which balked at the increased
      spending commitment and received an opt-out, to the chagrin of Trump, who launched
      a blitz of social media posts against the Spanish government and declared that,
      in consequence, Spain would have to pay twice as much in tariffs in any future
      trade deal with the U.S. (This seemingly ignores the fact that Spain is a part
      of the EU and can’t be treated differently from other bloc members in any negotiated
      agreement.)


      NATO leader Mark Rutte, ex-head of the Dutch government, lauded Trump as “Daddy,”
      and praised to the rafters his decision to pre-emptively attack Iran’s nuclear
      facilities. Photos showed him laughing and smiling at every Trump aside, like
      a courtier at the Sun King’s court, a display of quite astounding sycophancy.
      Other NATO leaders followed suit. Cumulatively, The Guardian wrote, it was an
      “orchestrated grovel,” the likes of which hadn’t previously been seen in U.S.
      relations with its allies. This wasn’t a conference of equals; rather it was a
      spectacle in which the U.S.’s strongman demanded — and received — the sort of
      accolades and over-the-top tributes that Soviet general secretaries used to demand
      from satellite state leaders in Eastern Europe, or that emperors of old required
      of conquered vassals.


      Trump’s agenda was pretty straightforward: if Europe and Canada wanted the security
      guarantees that the U.S. has provided since World War II, then they would have
      to pay through the nose for the privilege. This would be manifested through massively
      increasing military spending, reducing domestic safety net spending, and channeling
      hundreds of billions of dollars toward U.S. arms manufacturers.


      The F-35A fighter jets alone will cost the British government over 1 billion pounds,
      and, once refueling planes, which the jets will need to operate far from U.K.
      shores, and other supportive infrastructure are factored in, that cost will rise
      still further. That’s money going straight to Lockheed Martin.


      This same week, the U.K. government has been pushing for massive reductions to
      social safety-net payments for hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities
      — and has, in consequence, faced a huge rebellion from within its own Labour Party
      ranks. And that follows on from an ill-fated effort last year to curtail an energy
      assistance program intended to ensure that Brits, especially pensioners, could
      keep their heating on during the cold winter months.


      Similar trade-offs will, in coming years, be felt throughout NATO. Unlike the
      U.S., which for years has been able to tap international lenders’ willingness
      to fund an American debt spree, most other NATO members simply do not have the
      market clout — or under the rules that bind the EU together, the legal right —
      to borrow on such a massive scale. As a result, much of the increase in military
      spending will come out of existing social programs, foreign aid commitments, and
      even pension and health care systems. Germany, for example, is planning to nearly
      double its military spending over the next five years, leaving a hole of tens
      of billions of euros in its budget. Denmark has created an “acceleration fund”
      that will channel an additional $7 billion into military spending over the coming
      two years, representing roughly 1.5 percent of its GDP. France, which has long
      battled with its own budget woes, will likely have to introduce a combination
      of tax hikes and social spending cuts to fund its military build-up. Poland has
      asked the European Commission to shift nearly $7 billion in green projects expenditures
      allotted to Poland into military spending instead. The continental commitments
      to increased military spending likely will result in a further erosion of the
      decades-old European social compact.


      Caught between Putin’s expansionist and imperialistic impulses — as demonstrated
      so brutally in Ukraine and with the increasingly militarist rhetoric coming out
      of the Kremlin — and Trump’s transactional, America First foreign policy, Europe’s
      leaders have decided to embrace the sort of massive ramp-up in military spending
      that so often serves as the prelude to war. No one wants to be caught wrongfooted
      should Putin order his military to breach NATO borders on the East, or NATO airspace
      elsewhere in Europe. No one wants to be the country that Trump steps back from
      defending — as he has, in the past explicitly said he would do, announcing he
      would encourage Putin’s forces to “do whatever the hell they want” — because they
      aren’t meeting the military spending goals that he has laid out. And thus, NATO’s
      member states have ratcheted up military expenditures to a degree that, even a
      couple of months ago, would have seemed to be both implausible and dangerously
      destructive toward Europe and Canada’s social compacts.


      Not all of that money now earmarked for military spending will flow to U.S. defense
      contractors; but given the U.S.’s pre-eminence in the field of high-tech weaponry,
      it’s a sure bet that, at least in the short term, while Europe grapples with how
      to diversify away from an unpredictable and even predatory U.S., an awful lot
      of it will.


      All of this stands to benefit the military-industrial complex mightily. The losers,
      of course, will be those who rely on the social safety net programs that get pushed
      aside in the rush to find funds to boost military spending. But it won’t happen
      without resistance: Stamer’s announcement immediately triggered opposition from
      anti-nuclear groups. During the last years of the Cold War, groups such as the
      Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament engaged in civil disobedience campaigns to pressure
      the government to remove nuclear weapons from the Greenham Common air base. Now,
      the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups have once again begun
      mobilizing for rallies, as early as this weekend, at the Royal Air Force bases
      slated to host the planes and weapons.


      It is, of course, early days. But there are signs that European populaces won’t
      uncritically rally around Trump’s demand for wholesale, breakneck rearmament.
      Of course, Europe and Canada do need to work out ways to protect their interests
      in the face of U.S. retrenchment. But what Trump is demanding is something entirely
      different; he is insisting on a form of tribute imposed via mandated weapons purchases
      — and while Europe’s leaders fawn, it’s not at all clear that their populaces
      will back them up.

    one_sentence_summary: At the 2025 NATO Summit, President Trump pressured member
      countries to significantly increase their military spending in exchange for U.S.
      security commitments, leading to a historic arms deal with the UK and raising
      concerns about the impact on social programs across Europe.
    paragraph_summary: At the NATO Summit 2025 in The Hague, British Prime Minister
      Keir Starmer announced the purchase of a dozen F-35A fighter jets from the U.S.,
      marking the reintroduction of U.S. nuclear-capable aircraft in the U.K. since
      the Cold War. President Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical of NATO, leveraged
      this summit to demand that member countries significantly increase their military
      spending, aiming for 5% of GDP, which led to widespread agreement among leaders,
      except for Spain, which faced Trump's ire for resisting the increase. The summit
      showcased a stark power dynamic, with NATO leaders displaying extreme deference
      to Trump, reminiscent of historical vassal states, as they committed to massive
      military expenditure increases that could undermine social safety nets across
      Europe. This military buildup, driven by fears of Russian aggression and Trump's
      transactional foreign policy, raises concerns about the erosion of social programs
      and the potential for increased public dissent against such defense spending priorities.

      By Gregory Shupak / Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR)


      Aggression is widely understood as the most serious form of the illegal use of
      force under international law. At the post–World War II Nuremberg Trials, British
      Judge Norman Birkett said:


      To initiate a war of aggression…is not only an international crime; it is the
      supreme international crime, differing only from other war crimes in that it contains
      within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.


      UN General Assembly Resolution 3314 lists seven acts that constitute aggression,
      including:


      The invasion or attack by the armed forces of a state of the territory of another
      State….


      Bombardment by the armed forces of a state against the territory of another state,
      or the use of any weapons by a state against the territory of another state.


      In a clear instance of such aggression, 125 US military aircraft (along with a
      submarine) unleashed 75 weapons against Iran on June 21, including 14 GBU-57 Massive
      Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), each of which weighs 30,000 pounds (BBC, 6/23/25).
      The MOPs are the most powerful non-nuclear weapons in the US arsenal (Democracy
      Now!, 6/23/25).


      ‘Brilliant military operation’


      Rather than condemning this blatant violation of international law, US corporate
      media commentators gushed over what the Boston Globe (6/24/25) called a “brilliant
      military operation.” The Wall Street Journal (6/22/25) gave President Donald Trump
      “credit…for meeting the moment.”


      To the New York Times’ Bret Stephens (6/22/25), Trump made “a courageous and correct
      decision that deserves respect.” “The president acted before it was too late,”
      he wrote. “It is the essence of statesmanship.”


      For the Washington Post’s Max Boot (6/25/25), it’s “good news…that both Israel
      and the United States showed they can bombard Iranian nuclear facilities and other
      targets at will.”


      Rather than toasting aggression, these observers could have used their platforms
      to try to help foster a political climate that prioritizes peace and the international
      legal principles that could help create a less violent world.


      Meanwhile, some opinion mongers thought the US was at risk of insufficiently violating
      international law. The Post’s editorial board (6/22/25) said Trump


      should ensure that Iran’s nuclear program is demolished, as he appeared to claim
      it was on Saturday. This would mean the destruction of the targeted sites plus
      any residual weapons-building capacity.


      In other words, the authors are glad that the US bombed Iran in violation of international
      law, and think it might be best to do more of the same.


      A Journal editorial (6/23/25) put forth a similar view, warning that Trump will
      “squander” any “gains” that the US and Israel may have made against Iran if he
      “lets Iran take a breather, retain any enriched uranium it has secretly stored,
      and then rearm. But the last fortnight creates a rare opportunity for a more peaceful
      Middle East.” I’m not a big Orwell fan, but there’s something to his vision of
      the propaganda slogan “war is peace.”


      Upside-down world


      These celebrations of bomb-dropping occur in an upside-down world, where Iran
      is an aggressor against the United States. One form of this lie is accusing Iran
      of wantonly killing Americans or seeking to do so. The Journal (6/22/25) cited
      “1,000 Americans killed by Iran-supplied roadside bombs and other means”—referring
      to the dubious claim that Iran is responsible for US soldiers killed during the
      illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq (Progressive, 1/7/20). Thus, to the editors,
      “Mr. Trump had to act to stop the threat in front of him to protect America.”


      For Boot (6/22/25), Iran is a “predator” that the United States and Israel “will
      still have to deal with…for years to come.”


      It would be nice to be able to assess the evidence for these allegations, but
      the authors don’t so much as hint at any. What is well documented, though, is
      that the US has been the aggressor in its longrunning war with Iran.


      The US ruling class initiated the conflict by overthrowing Iran’s democratically
      elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 (NPR, 2/7/19), propping up the
      Shah’s torture regime for 26 years (BBC, 6/3/16; AP, 2/6/19), sponsoring the Iraqi
      invasion of Iran and helping Iraq use chemical weapons against Iran (Foreign Policy,
      8/26/13), supporting Israel’s years-long campaign of murdering Iranian scientists
      (Responsible Statecraft, 12/21/20), and asphyxiating Iran’s civilian population
      through economic sanctions (Human Rights Watch, 10/29/19).


      In other words, the US has been prosecuting a war against the Iranian people for
      more than 70 years, and Iran hasn’t done anything remotely comparable to the US,
      but the corporate media pretends that the inverse is true.


      The consent manufacturers went even further, characterizing Iran as a threat to
      the world more generally. The Journal (6/22/25) said “Iran has been waging regional
      and terrorist war for decades,” and that “the world is safer” because the US bombed
      the country. Stephens proclaimed the Iranian government “the world’s leading state
      sponsor of terrorism,” a claim Boot (6/25/25) echoed, writing that the nation
      has a “decades-long track record as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism.” Sickeningly,
      Antony Blinken (New York Times, 6/24/25), a leading architect of the genocide
      of Gaza’s civilian population, called Iran “a leading state sponsor of terrorism;
      a destructive and destabilizing force via its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Gaza,
      Yemen and Iraq.”


      As usual, none of these writers bothered to say which acts of “terrorism” Iran
      has backed, never mind provide proof. Of course, if one wanted to make a serious
      argument that Iran has won the planet’s “state sponsor of terrorism” gold medal,
      then it would be necessary to show how they trumped, say, US support for Al Qaeda
      in Syria. For such a case to be convincing, it would furthermore be necessary
      to assess where bankrolling a genocide ranks in the terror-sponsoring Olympics.


      ‘A grave nuclear threat’


      In the fantasy world where Iran is a grave danger to the US and indeed the world,
      then wrongly implying that it has or is about to have nuclear weapons packs a
      heavier punch. The Journal (6/22/25) said, “President Trump’s decision to strike
      Iran’s three most significant nuclear sites on Saturday helped rid the world of
      a grave nuclear threat.” The editorial would later add, “Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
      wanted a bomb more than peace.”


      Boot (6/25/25) wrote that “preliminary Israeli intelligence assessments [of the
      US bombing of Iran] conclude that the damage to the Iranian nuclear weapons program
      was more extensive—enough to set back the program by several years.” Stephens
      began his piece:


      For decades, a succession of American presidents pledged that they were willing
      to use force to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But it was President
      Trump who, by bombing three of Iran’s key nuclear sites on Sunday morning, was
      willing to demonstrate that those pledges were not hollow and that Tehran could
      not simply tunnel its way to a bomb because no country other than Israel dared
      confront it.


      As FAIR contributor Bryce Greene (6/23/25) recently demonstrated, there is no
      proof that Iran has nuclear weapons or is close to having any. Yet the op-ed pages
      are peppered with insinuations that Iran’s imaginary nukes legitimize the US’s
      aggression against the country.


      A Boston Globe editorial (6/24/25) read:


      After years of insisting it would not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,
      Israel followed through by launching a wide-ranging attack earlier this month,
      assassinating nuclear scientists and military leaders and destroying many sites
      associated with Iran’s decades-long nuclear program. Trump initially stayed on
      the sidelines, until Saturday when US bombers delivered the coup de grâce, destroying—or
      at least heavily damaging—a key underground site that only American bunker-buster
      bombs could reach…. Stopping Iran, whose unofficial national motto is “Death to
      America,’’ from gaining a nuclear weapon has rightly been a US priority for decades.
      Iran’s nuclear program is now damaged but not destroyed.


      What’s missing from this chatter is that, even if we lived in an alternate reality
      where Iran had nuclear weapons or was hours away from having them, attacking them
      on these grounds would not be legitimate. After all, international law does not
      grant states a right to attack each other on a preventive (Conversation, 6/18/25)
      or pre-emptive basis (Conversation, 6/23/25). This crucial point was entirely
      absent in the coverage I’ve discussed.


      Also overlooked are the 90 nuclear warheads that Israel is believed to have, as
      well as the more than 5,200 that the US reportedly possesses, none of which apparently
      constitute “a grave nuclear threat,” even as it’s not Iran but the US and Israel
      that routinely carry out full-scale invasions and occupations of nations in West
      Asia.


      Whether it’s Iran’s supposed support for terrorism or Iran’s nonexistent and non-imminent
      nuclear weapons, the propaganda follows the same formula: make an unsubstantiated
      claim about Iranian malfeasance, and use that as a premise on which to defend
      Washington openly carrying out acts of aggression, perhaps the gravest violation
      of international law.


      If you want the US and Israel to stop killing and immiserating people in Iran,
      remember this pattern and get used to debunking it. Because, last week’s ceasefire
      notwithstanding, the US/Israeli war on Iran isn’t over.

    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques U.S. media and political responses to
      a recent military strike against Iran, arguing that they celebrate aggression
      and violate international law while misrepresenting Iran as the aggressor, despite
      the U.S.'s long history of hostility towards Iran.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the recent U.S. military aggression against
      Iran, highlighting a significant bombing campaign involving 125 aircraft and advanced
      weaponry, which is framed as a blatant violation of international law. It critiques
      the corporate media's portrayal of this action as a "brilliant military operation,"
      praising President Trump's decision while ignoring the historical context of U.S.-Iran
      relations, where the U.S. has been the aggressor for decades. The author argues
      that claims of Iran being a grave threat, particularly regarding nuclear weapons
      and terrorism, lack substantiation and serve to justify U.S. military actions.
      The piece calls for a reevaluation of the narrative surrounding U.S. foreign policy
      and urges readers to challenge the propaganda that supports ongoing aggression
      against Iran.

      A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act that may define a Tyrant,
      is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Thomas Jefferson, The Declaration of
      Independence, July 4, 1776


      In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about that has been a
      beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt,
      incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in
      democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your
      voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring. Bruce Springsteen, Land
      of Hope and Dreams Tour


      Manchester, England, May 14, 2025


      In his farewell letter to the American people, President George Washington warned
      about “the impostures of pretended patriotism.” Born on my country’s birthday
      in 1946, I was proud to be an American and blessed to have been born on such a
      special day. You could say that from the very beginning I was truly, as the song
      implies, a Yankee Doodle Dandy and a real live nephew of my Uncle Sam.


      I wasn’t pretending to be a patriot. I was one from the very start. I was the
      real thing, the authentic American: red, white and blue all over. As a young boy,
      I was a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout. I read Boys Life magazine and played second
      base in the Massapequa Little League and dreamed of playing for the New York Yankees
      someday.


      But I also read the Marine Corp guidebook when I was seven, a gift from my Uncle
      Jimmy who had served as a Marine during the Korean War, and I would practice for
      hours standing at attention and saluting in front of the mirror in my room.


      l was inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s, “Ask not what your country can
      do for you, but what you can do for your country” speech in 1961 and couldn’t
      wait to serve my country as the young president had asked us to do. As soon as
      I turned 18, I joined the United States Marine Corps, volunteering for my first
      tour of duty in Vietnam. After a 13-month tour, I decided to set my own example
      of patriotism by returning to Vietnam a second time, willing to risk my life on
      behalf of my country.


      On Jan. 20, 1968, during my second tour of duty I was shot and paralyzed from
      my mid chest down and have been confined to a wheelchair ever since. I received
      several medals during my time in the Marine Corp, including the Purple Heart,
      Bronze Star with Combat V (for valor) and Navy Commendation Medal with Combat
      V.


      After my wounding and a year recuperating with other severely wounded veterans
      at a Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital paraplegic ward in the Bronx, NY, I continued
      to serve my country. Profoundly affected by what I saw in the hospital and my
      own wounding, I joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War organization and became
      deeply committed to peace and nonviolence.


      Inspired by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Mahatma Gandhi,
      I often opposed my country’s foreign policy decisions. I knew there had to be
      a better way and was arrested numerous times over the years for protesting, remaining
      firmly committed to peaceful, nonviolent change.


      President Washington was speaking to all of us, to the citizens of his time and
      those of us yet to come, he clearly understood how fragile and vulnerable our
      bold new democracy was and how easily it could be taken from us.


      Now, as we approach the 250th anniversary of our nation’s birth and my 80th birthday
      on July 4th, 2026, George Washington’s prophetic farewell letter has come back
      to awaken us all: A cruel and arrogant dictator has arisen in our midst. A convicted
      criminal has arrived in the night, and our democracy is now on life support.


      Fear and intimidation now rule the land. Suddenly and without warning, a brutal
      tyranny has arrived, and the crackdown has begun. Frightening shades of Germany,
      1939: heavily armed guardsmen and Marines now occupy my city.


      Universities and freedom of speech are under attack. Foreign students are being
      dragged from their classrooms. A U.S. senator was brutally manhandled, thrown
      to the floor and handcuffed. Masked agents infiltrate our neighborhoods hunting
      immigrants, grabbing them in front of supermarkets, schools and workplaces, even
      at churches, and their children’s graduation ceremonies.


      Many are afraid to leave their homes, wary that the masked ICE agents will be
      waiting to abduct them and send them to detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz
      located in an alligator and snake infested Florida swamp, among other frightening
      detention centers. No phone call, no due process, no trial. Disappeared, lost,
      forever and forgotten.


      This is America in the spring of 2025, brutal and cruel. I cannot help but sense
      this nightmare is just beginning. Many now hide, frightened of being caught. Migrant
      farmworkers hunted down like frightened animals in the fields of Salinas, ripped
      from their families and disappeared to some awful prison in El Salvador never
      to be seen or heard from again.


      I cannot help but think of Anne Frank and her family hiding in the annex, afraid
      of being rounded up by the Gestapo. I think of what that must have felt like and
      what these poor souls in our country must be going through right now because they
      are afraid of leaving their homes with ICE agents not just arresting “hardened”
      criminals, but grabbing everyone, poor, innocent, human beings.


      The Statue of Liberty weeps tonight. (“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled
      masses yearning to be free!”) The cruel masked government men must make their
      sickening quotas. “My country ‘tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I cry,
      of thee I weep, of thee I rage.”


      Never have the citizens of this country been so threatened, never before has life
      and liberty been in such peril. Not in the 250 years since our revolution have
      we as a people and a nation been at such a crucial turning point. These are dangerous
      times; a century of arrogance, brutality and aggression have come back to haunt
      us all.


      The mask has been ripped away, the lie has been exposed, and this criminal president
      and administration now stand naked before the world. These are provocative words
      and the truth may be deeply unsettling but when will we speak the truth? When
      will we end this silence? How much longer will we wait until we are ready to finally
      admit that the tyrant now lives in our house? That this government of the people,
      by the people and for the people that we entrusted long ago with the sacred task
      of protecting life and liberty, now, by its every unjust, immoral and illegal
      action now threatens the freedom of us all?


      Have we become so complacent, so cowered and intimidated by this administration
      and president that we have forgotten our own revolutionary birthright of rebellion
      and dissent? Have we become so paralyzed with fear that we would give up our liberty
      and freedom for the promise of a security that does not exist by a government
      and president that now threatens our very freedom?


      What will it take before we realize the true reality of this crisis? How many
      more human beings must suffer before we finally begin to break the silence of
      this shameful night? Let us open up our hearts and speak in a way we have never
      spoken before, knowing that lives now depend on it and the very survival of our
      democracy is now at stake. Let not our silence in this crucial moment betray us
      from our destiny.


      Some additional notes on our American Democracy at the crossroads


      The nation is stunned. The sound of military marching music and beating of drums
      fills the air, whipping the crowd into a frenzy as they obediently pay homage
      to their dear leader — the strongman, the billionaire, the genius, as a million
      frightened voices begin to sing.


      The song is a bit off key, but it doesn’t seem to matter as the Commander in Chief
      in a clown suit beats a happy tyrannical tune, “keep in step, everyone, keep in
      step!” the big boss shouts with glee. “Democracy is dead!” a woman shouts from
      the crowd and is quickly taken away.


      It is almost midnight, and I notice our rights beginning to slip away. The flag
      is now at half-mast as an ancient bugle plays a sad and mournful tune, a dirge
      to a dying nation. “A dream deferred, or does it explode?” someone whispers from
      the crowd holding up a faded photograph of the poet Langston Hughes until they
      are also taken away.


      As the band keeps playing the ghost of Jackson Pollock proudly claims he has been
      commissioned to do a painting for the 250th anniversary of America, 2026. The
      theme of the painting will be, “American democracy at the crossroads.” It is a
      gigantic canvas and the deadline to complete this great work of art is Friday,
      July 4th, 2026.


      Pollock has been working on the painting for nearly a year, but he has a problem.
      After weeks and months of effort, the canvas continues to remain blank. As the
      big day approaches and Pollock’s deadline looms, he throws his hands up in disgust
      and begins throwing paint on to canvas determined to complete his celebration
      of American democracy on time.


      He uses his legendary drip technique. It is an extremely complex piece, layer
      upon layer of paint, wild swirls of reds, whites and blues followed by an almost
      frantic black paint flung violently across the canvas in desperation as if to
      say this is it. This is the best that I can do. The following morning, exhausted
      and near collapse, Pollack finally completes his painting and immediately falls
      asleep on the floor of his South Hampton studio.


      Several hours later, as the bright afternoon sun enters the room, he slowly opens
      his eyes and, to his surprise, the canvas is again completely blank. Pollack is
      heartbroken and feels as if he has failed. Regardless, the 250th Anniversary committee
      accepts the painting where it is prominently displayed on the national mall.


      The critics hail it as a masterpiece while many, including the President and his
      minions, call it a wonderful depiction of our democracy. “Betrayal?” whispers
      a homeless veteran from the crowd as he is quickly whisked away. Never have the
      people of our country been so threatened. Never has our democracy\


      been in such grave danger. A dark shroud covers the land. The flag is drenched
      in blood and sorrow. The founders weep. Fear, confusion, shock, disbelief, a tyrant
      and unholy cabal, dark clouds, 1939, Yorktown, “The world turned upside down.”


      “My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, land of the pilgrim’s pride, land
      where our fathers lied of thee, I sing, let freedom ring, let freedom ring!”


      ——


      A disabled veteran in a wheelchair slowly wheels onto the stage and faces the
      audience. He clears his throat and almost in a whisper that grows in intensity,
      he begins to speak:


      “Two centuries and five decades ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent
      a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men
      are created equal. Now, we are engaged in a great struggle testing whether that
      nation, or any other nation, so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. It
      is all together fitting and proper that we should do this. It is for us, the living
      on this Independence Day 2025, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which
      those who long ago have thus far so nobly advanced and that we here highly resolve
      that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that this government
      of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the Earth.”


      Have hope, my fellow citizens, have confidence and faith. We are on the right
      side of history. A powerful resistance has already begun. We will reclaim our
      country and not abandon it. Millions have already gone to the streets and millions
      more will soon follow. In the spirit of nonviolence, in the spirit of Reverend
      Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, let us go forth
      and march together in growing confidence.


      Let us always seek the moral high ground with dignity and with malice toward none;
      with charity for all, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up
      the nation’s wounds, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting
      peace. Be patient and be not afraid. We are not alone. Remember the democracy
      movement and the courageous Chinese students at Tiananmen Square. Remember the
      brave young man who stood before the tank and refused to move.




      A new nation is awaiting to be born. Have no doubt about it, these are extraordinary
      times. Mandela in South Africa. Václav Havel in the Prague Spring. Rosa Parks
      in Montgomery. King and James Bevel at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. These
      are people and movements who all participated in successful struggles against
      the darkest nights.


      As the late Congressman Allard Lowenstein once said, it is better to reclaim the
      country than abandon it. This is our moment in history. This is our opportunity
      to make history and not shirk from it.


      For my country and its people, happy birthday.

      An analysis released Thursday estimates that the Republican legislation on the
      brink of final passage in Congress would deliver over $1 trillion in combined
      tax breaks to the richest 1% of Americans over the next decade—an amount roughly
      equal to the bill’s unprecedented cuts to Medicaid.


      The new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), which
      utilizes data from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and other sources,
      finds that the “tiny sliver of affluent families” in the top 1% of the U.S. income
      distribution will “receive tax cuts totaling $1.02 trillion over the next decade.”

      paid for by increasing the national debt and cutting public services. pic.twitter.com/ISr2XuIdJQ
      — ITEP (@iteptweets) July 3, 2025


      ITEP has previously shown that the Republican bill’s tax cuts—largely extensions
      of expiring provisions of the 2017 Trump-GOP tax law—would be highly skewed to
      the wealthy, with the small percentage of households at the very top receiving
      significantly more in total tax breaks than middle- and lower-income Americans.


      “Sixty-nine percent of the net tax cuts would go to the richest fifth of Americans
      in 2026, only 11% would go to the middle fifth of Americans, and less than 1%
      would go to the poorest fifth,” the group found. “The $107 billion in net tax
      cuts going to the richest 1% next year would exceed the amount going to the entire
      bottom 60% of taxpayers.”


      ITEP’s new analysis was released as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.)
      wrapped up a record-breaking, eight-hour-plus speech against the GOP legislation,
      which delayed a final vote on the measure. Republicans are expected to pass the
      unpopular bill on Thursday.

      By Kit Klarenberg / The Grayzone


      A notorious British MI6 agent infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency
      (IAEA) on London’s behalf, according to leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone.
      The agent, Nicholas Langman, is a veteran intelligence operative who claims credit
      for helping engineer the West’s economic war on Iran.


      Langman’s identity first surfaced in journalistic accounts of his role in deflecting
      accusations that British intelligence played a role in the death of Princess Diana.
      He was later accused by Greek authorities of overseeing the abduction and torture
      of Pakistani migrants in Athens.


      In both cases, UK authorities issued censorship orders forbidding the press from
      publishing his name. But Greek media, which was under no such obligation, confirmed
      that Langman was one of the MI6 assets withdrawn from Britain’s embassy in Athens.


      The Grayzone discovered the résumé of the journeyman British operative in a trove
      of leaked papers detailing the activities of Torchlight, a prolific British intelligence
      cutout. The bio of the longtime MI6 officer reveals he “led large, inter-agency
      teams to identify and defeat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
      technology, including by innovative technical means and sanctions.”


      In particular, the MI6 agent says he “worked to prevent WMD proliferation through…
      support for the [IAEA] and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
      [OPCW] and through high level international partnerships.”


      Langman’s CV credits him with playing a major role in organizing the sanctions
      regime on Iran by “[building] highly effective and mutually supportive relations
      across government and with senior US, European, Middle and Far Eastern colleagues
      for strategy” between 2010 and 2012. He boasts in his bio that this achievement
      “enabled [the] major diplomatic success of [the] Iranian nuclear and sanctions
      agreement.”


      The influence Langman claimed to have exerted on the IAEA adds weight to Iranian
      allegations that the international nuclear regulation body colluded with the West
      and Israel to undermine its sovereignty. The Iranian government has alleged that
      the IAEA supplied the identities of its top nuclear scientists to Israeli intelligence,
      enabling their assassinations, and provided critical intelligence to the US and
      Israel on the nuclear facilities they bombed during their military assault this
      June.


      This June 12, under the direction of its Secretary General Rafael Grossi, the
      IAEA issued a clearly politicized report recycling questionable past allegations
      to accuse Iran of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The next day, Israel
      attacked the country, assassinating nine nuclear scientists as well as numerous
      top military officials and hundreds of civilians.


      Iranian former Vice President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif has since called
      for the IAEA’s Grossi to be sacked, accusing him of having “abetted the slaughter
      of innocents in the country.” This June 28, the Iranian government broke ties
      with the IAEA, refusing to allow its inspectors into the country.


      While Iranian officials may have had no idea about the involvement of a shadowy
      figure like Langman in IAEA business, it would likely come as little surprise
      to Tehran that the supposedly multilateral agency had been compromised by a Western
      intelligence agency.


      Langman’s name placed under official UK censorship order


      In 2016, Langman was named a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George,
      the same title bestowed on fictional British spy James Bond. By that point, the
      supposed secret agent held the dubious distinction of being publicly ‘burned’
      as an MI6 operative on two separate occasions.


      First, in 2001, journalist Stephen Dorril revealed that Langman had arrived in
      Paris weeks prior to Princess Diana’s fatal car crash in the city on August 31
      1997, and was subsequently charged with conducting “information operations” to
      deflect widespread public speculation British intelligence was responsible for
      her death.


      Then, in 2005, he was formally accused by Greek authorities of complicity in the
      abduction and torture of 28 Pakistanis in Athens. The Pakistanis, all migrant
      workers, were suspected of having had contact with individuals accused of perpetrating
      the 7/7 bombings in London, July 2005.


      Brutally beaten and threatened with guns in their mouths, the victims “were convinced
      their interrogators were British.” When Greek media named Langman as the MI6 operative
      who oversaw the migrants’ torture, British news outlets universally complied with
      a government D-notice – an official censorship order – and kept his identity under
      wraps when reporting on the scandal.


      London vehemently denied any British involvement in torturing the migrants, with
      then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw dismissing the charge as “utter nonsense.” In
      January 2006 though, London admitted MI6 officers were indeed present during the
      Pakistanis’ torture, although officials insisted the operatives played no active
      part in their arrests, questioning or abuse.


      Following his withdrawal from Athens, Langman returned to London to head the UK
      Foreign Office’s Iran Department, a shift which highlights his importance to MI6
      and suggests the British government had no qualms about his allegedly brutal evidence
      gathering methods.


      Britain’s Foreign Office collaborates closely with MI6, whose agents use it as
      cover just as the CIA does with State Department diplomatic postings.


      MI6’s man on Iran takes credit for “maximum pressure” strategy


      While leading the Foreign Office’s Iran Department from 2006 – 2008, Langman oversaw
      a team seeking to “develop understanding” of the Iranian government’s “nuclear
      program.”


      It’s unclear exactly what that “understanding” entailed. But the document makes
      clear that Langman then “generated confidence” in that assessment among “European,
      US and Middle Eastern agencies” in order to “delay programme [sic] and pressurise
      Iran to negotiate.” The reference to “Middle Eastern agencies” strongly implied
      MI6 cooperation with Israel’s Mossad intelligence service.


      In April 2006, Tehran announced it had successfully enriched uranium for the first
      time, although officials denied any intention to do so for military purposes.
      This development may have triggered Langman’s intervention.


      The Islamic Republic has rejected any suggestion it harbors ambitions to possess
      nuclear weapons. Its denials were corroborated by a November 2007 US National
      Intelligence Estimate expressing “high confidence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted”
      any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment remained unchanged
      for several years, and was reportedly shared by the Mossad, despite Benjamin Netanyhau’s
      constant declarations that Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon.


      Langman’s IAEA support work overlaps with Iran sanctions blitz


      International governmental attitudes towards Iran changed abruptly between 2010
      and ‘12. During this period, Western states and intergovernmental institutions
      initiated an array of harshly punitive measures against the country, while Israel
      ramped up its deadly covert operations against Iran’s nuclear scientists.


      This period precisely overlapped with Langman’s tenure at the Counter-Proliferation
      Centre of the UK Foreign Office. His bio implies he used this position to influence
      the IAEA and other UN-affiliated organizations to foment a campaign of global
      hostility towards Iran.


      In June 2010, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1929, which froze the
      Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ assets, and banned overseas financial institutions
      from opening offices in Tehran. A month later, the Obama administration adopted
      the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. This set
      off a global chain of copycat sanctions by Washington’s vassals, who often imposed
      even more stringent measures than those levied by the UN and US.


      In March 2012, the EU voted unanimously to cut Iranian banks out of the SWIFT
      international banking network. That October, the bloc imposed the harshest sanctions
      to date, restricting trade, financial services, energy and technology, along with
      bans on the provision of insurance to Iranian companies by European firms.


      BBC reporting on the sanctions acknowledged European officials merely suspected
      Tehran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but lacked concrete proof. And behind
      the scenes, the MI6 operative Langman was claiming credit for helping legitimize
      the allegations against Iran.


      Nuclear agreement lays foundations for war


      Following the Western-led campaign isolation of Iran from 2010 – 2012, over its
      purported nuclear weapon program, the Obama administration negotiated a July 2015
      agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the JCPOA’s
      terms, the Islamic Republic agreed to limit its nuclear research activities in
      return for sanctions relief. In the years that followed, the IAEA was granted
      virtually unlimited access to Tehran’s nuclear complexes, ostensibly to ensure
      the facilities were not used to develop nuclear weapons.


      Along the way, IAEA inspectors collected vast amounts of information on the sites,
      including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents. The Iranian
      government has since accused the Agency of furnishing the top secret profiles
      of its nuclear scientists to Israel. These include the godfather of Iran’s nuclear
      program, Mohsen Fakrizadeh, who was first publicly named in a menacing 2019 powerpoint
      presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The following year,
      the Mossad assassinated Fakrizadeh in broad daylight with a remote-controlled
      machine gun.


      Internal IAEA documents leaked this June indicated that IAEA Secretary General
      Rafael Grossi has enjoyed a much closer relationship with Israeli officials than
      was previously known, and suggested he leveraged his cozy ties with Tel Aviv to
      secure his current position.


      During a June 24 interview with Fox News’ war-crazed anchor Martha MacCallum,
      Grossi did not deny making the inflammatory claim that “900 pounds of potentially
      enriched uranium was taken to an ancient site near Isfahan.” Instead the IAEA
      director asserted, “We do not have any information on the whereabouts of this
      material.”


      Well before Grossi rose to the top of the IAEA with Western and Israeli backing,
      the agency appears to have been penetrated by a British intelligence agent who
      took responsibility in his bio for engineering the West’s economic attack on Iran.


      The IAEA has not responded to an email from The Grayzone seeking clarification
      on its relationship with Langman and the MI6.

      By Susan Kang / Truthout


      By now, much ink has been spilled and many takes have been shared on the resounding
      12-point victory of Zohran Mamdani over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last Tuesday
      in the New York City primary to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for
      mayor. There are many reasons for this win, including Mamdani’s talents; his clear
      progressive message focusing on affordability in one of the most expensive cities
      in the country; and his excellent use of social media, earned media, and traditional
      ads.


      Mamdani’s plans were almost immediately denounced as “unrealistic” and pie in
      the sky by political commentators. The Atlantic suggested that his accessible,
      unified message of affordability — with key policies, such as free child care,
      free bus service, and rent freezes for New York City’s 2 million rent-stabilized
      tenants — was a form of “magical realism.” Pundits and political elites repeatedly
      claimed that such universal affordability type policies did not speak to voters
      of color, but rather only appealed to highly educated white younger voters. Underlying
      the tired trope of the socialist “Bernie Bro” was the implicit idea that Mamdani’s
      voter base would be limited only to college-educated transplants, out of touch
      with the experience of working-class communities of color.


      Despite nearly universal opinions and polling data predicting a Cuomo victory,
      the underdog’s victory last week revealed many of his advantages. Commentators
      have pointed to a plethora of explanations — Cuomo’s toxicity and scandals, as
      well as Mamdani’s charisma, political talent, clear messaging, and excellent social
      media strategy and ground game. The City called his tens of thousands of volunteers
      Mamdani’s “army,” and according to the campaign, canvassers knocked on over 1
      million doors.


      All of these factors undoubtedly contributed to Mamdani’s win, but these were
      obvious factors prior to his upset victory. One factor of Mamdani’s campaign that
      gets less attention is its grassroots nature, which goes beyond merely running
      an impressive ground game door-knocking operation; Mamdani’s campaign is grassroots
      in its origins, its associations, its practice, and its theory of governance.
      The media does not quite understand this orientation, because most candidates
      and politicians are so divorced from the grassroots. The clarity of Mamdani’s
      message and his unique talent may serve as an inspiration for other insurgents,
      as might his grassroots commitments.


      While Mamdani’s affordability agenda was mocked as unrealistic, and even out of
      touch with the working-class communities he needed to win the primary, this narrative
      ignores his “man on the street” style of campaigning that he began following Donald
      Trump’s general election victory in November 2024. Specifically, Latino voters
      in the Bronx and Asian voters in Queens noticeably broke for Trump, compared to
      their voting behavior in 2020. Shortly after the 2024 election, Mamdani spoke
      with voters in the Bronx and Queens about why they chose to vote for Trump (or
      chose not to vote) and recorded their answers. The voters gave different responses:
      affordability, problems with the system, rent and food costs, general disappointment
      in the Democrats, and Israel’s U.S.-backed genocide in Gaza. Absent were mentions
      of disliking immigrants (as these neighborhoods are diverse and immigrant heavy)
      or other so-called “woke” issues. Rather, this video captured a bottom-up desire
      for Democratic politicians to respond to people’s immediate economic needs.


      Mamdani’s messaging came from countless conversations like the ones in the video.
      His unified message of affordability, universal programs, and solidarity wasn’t
      just popular — it was also digestible and easy to understand. In response, Cuomo
      came prepared with a well-funded media campaign backed by super PACs, blanketing
      the airwaves with anti-Mamdani commercials and filling mailboxes with mailers,
      spending a record-breaking $25 million. But all this propaganda, which characterized
      Mamdani as dangerous and inexperienced, did not work. And part of this is because
      of the strength of the grassroots efforts, which went beyond canvassing.


      Aaron Fernando is a member of New York City’s chapter of Democratic Socialists
      of America (DSA), a law student, and a volunteer for Mamdani’s campaign. Fernando
      told Truthout, “With an electorate as large as New York City’s, paid media like
      TV advertisements and mailers can get a campaign pretty far. And after [Kamala]
      Harris lost every swing state [in 2024] despite a gigantic field operation, many
      people declared that canvassing had become obsolete. But that’s the wrong message
      to take away.”


      The truth, Fernando says, is that while canvassing alone can’t win large-scale
      elections, it can reinforce the messaging a campaign puts out and allow voters
      to “make the connection between the information about the candidate they’ve been
      hearing [about] and the smiling canvasser at their front door.” Canvassing can
      also reach unique populations, Fernando says, “like the Muslim and South Asian
      uncles and aunties that powered Zohran’s victory.”


      “Make no mistake,” Fernando concluded. “Zohran’s operation of 50,000 volunteers
      and 1.5 million doors knocked — the end result of almost a decade of NYC-DSA’s
      trial-and-error on our campaigns — was the difference in this election.”


      In addition to the canvassing operation, Zohran Mamdani’s campaign maintained
      strong connections to left and progressive political organizations, such as the
      Working Families Party, the New York City chapter of DSA, and youth climate organizations,
      such as TREEage and the Sunrise Movement. Many of these organizations endorsed
      early and provided the volunteer muscle to share the campaigns’ message among
      diverse networks. The Mamdani campaign came out with its three key policies —
      free child care, buses, and rent freezes — but developed other policy platforms
      through collaboration with policy experts and grassroots organizations, many of
      which are grassroots Black and immigrant community-based.


      Mamdani’s dedication to openness, collaboration, and shared goals permeated his
      campaign. “A profound democratic sensibility extended through every aspect of
      the Zohran campaign — from the platform that focused on the issues that keep millions
      of working New Yorkers up at night; to the role played by millions of canvassing
      conversations with strangers about how to change our city; to the way that everyday
      people who had never been involved in politics before could get involved, build
      their skills, develop the campaign’s strategy together, and become leaders,” Mamdani
      campaign volunteer Jeremy Cohan told Truthout.


      “It’s no wonder the establishment completely dismissed it, because it is totally
      foreign to how they operate, which is fundamentally based on treating working
      people as passive consumers to whom experts try to sell a political product dreamed
      up in a boardroom with millionaire and billionaire donors,” Cohan said. “Rather
      than catering to big donors, corporate consultants, and bloviating pundits, [the
      campaign] starts from the basic belief that most people in our society are made
      to feel powerless, that this is the basis of tremendous suffering — not to mention
      of fascist reaction — and that democracy must enfranchise and involve ordinary
      people on a deep level in taking control of their lives, their society, and their
      future.”


      This message of hope and empowering everyday people, whether in their interactions
      with the mayoral candidate or through conversations with volunteers, created a
      stark contrast with the politics of fear and distrust that characterized the Cuomo
      campaign.


      But perhaps the characteristic of the Mamdani campaign that is least understood
      by both professional pundits and Democratic leadership alike is the radical model
      of governance that informed Mamdani’s tenure as an assemblymember, which has also
      been present in his campaign thus far. As part of the Socialist in Office co-governance
      committee, Mamdani, together with other socialist state legislators and city council
      members, has taken a social movement approach to governing, building power through
      mobilizing and empowering regular people to push for solutions at all levels of
      government. A 2022 article from The Nation noted how Mamdani helped constituents
      organize to solve municipal-level problems like requesting a traffic light at
      a busy intersection, even though he is a state-level legislator, because he treated
      constituent services as a way to build power and democratize local government.
      Even though the theory of change behind this co-governance model was clearly laid
      out in the article, somehow this grassroots-oriented model of political power
      remains incomprehensible to most political observers.


      Mamdani was constantly dinged on only passing “three bills” during his time in
      the legislature and he never defended this record. Instead, he continued to stress
      his social movement, grassroots orientation to prove his effectiveness as an elected
      official, pointing out his organizing with indebted taxi drivers and their advocacy
      group, in which he engaged in a 15-day hunger strike to negotiate for city debt
      relief for taxi drivers. While not carrying any bills on eviction protections,
      working with housing activists, he was arrested for protesting the end of the
      COVID-era eviction moratorium in 2021. This broader movement helped pass historic
      “Good Cause” eviction protection in New York State in 2024. In collaboration with
      the Public Power campaign and DSA Ecosocialists, Mamdani and other DSA electeds
      rallied, marched, and organized to fight for New York’s Build Public Renewables
      Act in 2023, touted as the country’s biggest climate law. The legislation allowed
      for the building of publicly owned renewable energy infrastructure, although Mamdani
      was not listed as the bill’s main sponsor. This is a non-comprehensive list that
      only scratches the surface of the grassroots governance that characterized Mamdani’s
      time in the New York State Assembly. Rather than see himself as a politician at
      the top, this theory of governance sees electeds as playing an inside-outside
      strategy, clearly embedded in grassroots and social movements.


      Mamdani’s fellow socialist in office, New York State Assembly member and housing
      activist Marcela Mitaynes, told Truthout that the goal of the campaigns and socialists
      in office is to build movements and organizers, not just one-time voters and constituents.
      “[Current New York City Mayor Eric Adams] said, ‘Oh you can’t have free buses,
      you can’t tax the rich. That’s on the state level.’ But he doesn’t understand
      how [our project] works. We are building the political community. …We are teaching
      people to do more and go beyond the typical political script,” Mitaynes said.


      “In this next stage of the campaign, we’ll be able to build that and that talk
      about governance and how it works, and then we’ll be able to pass this legislation.
      This grassroots organizing means we can push people — city council members, state
      legislators — to pass the laws we want,” Mitaynes said. “To [most politicians],
      everything is transactional. You either have the political capital to do it or
      you don’t. But we’re building it, by building up this movement. No politician
      can do this by themselves. We need to join forces with the people. We can never
      beat the money thrown at us. That’s why [we] focus on grassroots, bringing [in]
      people affected the most.”

    paragraph_summary: Zohran Mamdani's recent victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo
      in the New York City primary for mayor has been attributed to his grassroots campaign,
      clear progressive messaging focused on affordability, and effective use of social
      media and volunteer mobilization. Despite skepticism from political commentators
      regarding the feasibility of his policies, such as free child care and rent freezes,
      Mamdani's campaign resonated with voters through direct engagement and conversations
      about their economic concerns. His approach, which emphasizes collaboration with

      By William D. Hartung / TomDispatch


      The Senate is on the verge of passing the distinctly misnamed “big beautiful bill.”
      It is, in fact, one of the ugliest pieces of legislation to come out of Congress
      in living memory. The version that passed the House recently would cut $1.7 trillion,
      mostly in domestic spending, while providing the top 5% of taxpayers with roughly
      $1.5 trillion in tax breaks.


      Over the next few years, the same bill will add another $150 billion to a Pentagon
      budget already soaring towards a record $1 trillion. In short, as of now, in the
      battle between welfare and warfare, the militarists are carrying the day.


      Pentagon Pork and the People It Harms


      The bill, passed by the House of Representatives and at present under consideration
      in the Senate, would allocate tens of billions of dollars to pursue President
      Trump’s cherished but hopeless Golden Dome project, which Laura Grego of the Union
      of Concerned Scientists has described as “a fantasy.” She explained exactly why
      the Golden Dome, which would supposedly protect the United States against nuclear
      attack, is a pipe dream:


      “Over the last 60 years, the United States has spent more than $350 billion on
      efforts to develop a defense against nuclear-armed ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic
      missiles]. This effort has been plagued by false starts and failures, and none
      have yet been demonstrated to be effective against a real-world threat… Missile
      defenses are not a useful or long-term strategy for keeping the U.S. safe from
      nuclear weapons.”


      The bill also includes billions more for shipbuilding, heavy new investments in
      artillery and ammunition, and funding for next-generation combat aircraft like
      the F-47.


      Oh, and after all of those weapons programs get their staggering cut of that future
      Pentagon budget, somewhere way down at the bottom of that list is a line item
      for improving the quality of life for active-duty military personnel. But the
      share aimed at the well-being of soldiers, sailors, and airmen (and women) is
      less than 6% of the $150 billion that Congress is now poised to add to that department’s
      already humongous budget. And that’s true despite the way Pentagon budget hawks
      invariably claim that the enormous sums they routinely plan on shoveling into
      it — and the overflowing coffers of the contractors it funds — are “for the troops.”


      Much of the funding in the bill will flow into the districts of key members of
      Congress (to their considerable political benefit). For example, the Golden Dome
      project will send billions of dollars to companies based in Huntsville, Alabama,
      which calls itself “Rocket City” because of the dense network of outfits there
      working on both offensive missiles and missile defense systems. And that, of course,
      is music to the ears of Representative Mike Rogers (R-AL), the current chair of
      the House Armed Services Committee, who just happens to come from Alabama.


      The shipbuilding funds will help prop up arms makers like HII Corporation (formerly
      Huntington Ingalls), which runs a shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the home
      state of Senate Armed Services Committee chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss). The funds
      will also find their way to shipyards in Maine, Connecticut, and Virginia.


      Those funds will benefit the co-chairs of the House Shipbuilding Caucus, Representative
      Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Representative Rob Wittman (R-VA). Connecticut hosts General
      Dynamics’ Electric Boat plant, which makes submarines that carry ballistic missiles,
      while Virginia is home to HII Corporation’s Newport News Shipbuilding facility,
      which makes both aircraft carriers and attack submarines.


      The Golden Dome missile defense project, on which President Trump has promised
      to spend $175 billion over the next three years, will benefit contractors big
      and small. Those include companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon
      (now RTX) that build current generation missile defense systems, as well as emerging
      military tech firms like Elon Musk’s Space X and Palmer Luckey’s Anduril, both
      of which are rumored to have a shot at playing a leading role in the development
      of the new anti-missile system.


      And just in case you thought this country was only planning to invest in defense
      against a nuclear strike, a sharp upsurge in spending on new nuclear warheads
      under the auspices of the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Agency
      (NNSA) has been proposed for fiscal year 2026. Thirty billion dollars, to be exact,
      which would represent a 58% hike from the prior year’s budget. Meanwhile, within
      that agency, nonproliferation, cleanup, and renewable energy programs are set
      to face significant cuts, leaving 80% of NNSA’s proposed funding to be spent on
      — yes! — nuclear weapons alone. Those funds will flow to companies like Honeywell,
      Bechtel, Jacobs Engineering, and Fluor that help run nuclear labs and nuclear
      production sites, as well as educational institutions like the University of Tennessee,
      Texas A&M, and the University of California at Berkeley, which help manage nuclear
      weapons labs or nuclear production sites.


      Weakening the Social Safety Net — and America


      And while weapons contractors will gorge on a huge new infusion of cash, military
      personnel, past and present, are clearly going to be neglected. As a start, the
      Veterans Administration is on the block for deep cuts, including possible layoffs
      of up to 80,000 employees — a move that would undoubtedly slow down the processing
      of benefits for those who have served in America’s past wars. Research on ailments
      that disproportionately impact veterans will also be cut, which should be considered
      an outrage.


      Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of veterans from this country’s disastrous wars
      in Afghanistan and Iraq will continue to suffer from physical and psychological
      wounds, including traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Cutting research that might find more effective solutions to such problems
      should be considered a national disgrace. In the meantime, active-duty personnel
      who are getting a tiny fraction of the potential Pentagon add-on of $150 billion
      are similarly in need.


      Worse yet, turn away from the Pentagon for a moment, and the cuts in the rest
      of that “big beautiful bill” will likely have an impact on a majority of Americans
      — Democrats, independents, and MAGA Republicans alike. Their full effects may
      not be felt for months until the spending reductions contained in it start hitting
      home. However, enacting policies that take food off people’s tables and deny them
      medical care will not only cause unnecessary suffering but cost lives.


      As President (and former general) Dwight D. Eisenhower, a very different kind
      of Republican, said more than 70 years ago, the ultimate security of a nation
      lies not in how many weapons it can pile up, but in the health, education, and
      resilience of its people. The big beautiful bill and the divisive politics surrounding
      it threaten those foundations of our national strength.


      Clash of the Contractors?


      As budget cuts threaten to make the population weaker, distorted spending priorities
      are making arms producers stronger. The Big Five — Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing,
      General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman — produce most of the current big-ticket
      weapon systems, from submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles to tanks,
      combat aircraft, and missile-defense systems. Meanwhile, emerging tech firms like
      Palantir, Anduril, and Space X are cashing in on contracts for unpiloted vehicles,
      advanced communications systems, new-age goggles for the Army, anti-drone systems,
      and so much more.


      But even as weapons spending hits near-record or record levels, there may still
      be a fight between the Big Five and the emerging tech firms over who gets the
      biggest share of that budget. One front in the coming battle between the Big Five
      and the Silicon Valley militarists could be the Army Transformation Initiative
      (ATI). According to Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, one of the goals of ATI
      is to “eliminate obsolete systems.”


      Driscoll is a harsh critic of the way members of Congress put money in the budget
      — a process known as “pork barrel politics” — for items the military services
      haven’t even asked for (and they ask for plenty), simply because those systems
      might bring more jobs and revenue to their states or districts. He has, in fact,
      committed himself to an approach that’s incompatible with the current, parochial
      process of putting together the Pentagon budget. “Lobbyists and bureaucrats have
      overtaken the army’s ability to prioritize soldiers and war fighting,” he insisted.


      Driscoll is talking a tough game when it comes to taking on the existing big contractors.
      He’s evidently ready to push for “reform,” even if it means that some of them
      go out of business. In fact, he seems to welcome it: “I will measure it as success
      if, in the next two years, one of the primes is no longer in business.” (“Primes”
      are the big contractors like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that take the
      lead on major programs and get the bulk of the funding, a significant portion
      of which they dole out to subcontractors all over the country and the world.)


      Ending pork-barrel politics in favor of an approach in which the Pentagon only
      buys systems that align with the country’s actual defense strategy, as Driscoll
      is suggesting, might seem like a significant step forward. But be careful what
      you wish for. Any funds freed up by stopping congressional representatives from
      treating the Pentagon budget as a piggy bank to buy loyalty from their constituents
      will almost certainly go to emerging tech firms ready to build next-generation
      systems like swarms of drones, weapons that can take out a hypersonic missile,
      or pilotless land vehicles, aircraft, and ships. Driscoll is a major tech enthusiast,
      as is his friend and Yale law school classmate J.D. Vance, who was first employed
      by Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, who then backed his successful run for the
      Senate from Ohio.


      Since the tech firms don’t have the equivalent of the Big Five’s extensive production
      networks in key congressional districts, they need to find other ways to persuade
      Congress to fund their weapons programs. Fortunately, the Silicon Valley militarists
      have a significant number of former employees or financial backers in the Trump
      administration who can plead their case.


      In addition, military-tech-focused venture capital firms have hired at least 50
      former Pentagon and military officials, all of whom can help them exert influence
      over both the Trump administration and Congress. The biggest “catch” was Palantir’s
      hiring of former Wisconsin Congressman Mike Gallagher, who had run the hawkish
      Congressional special committee on Communist China.


      Some journalists and policy analysts have wondered whether the feud between Donald
      Trump and Elon Musk will hurt the military tech sector. Well, stop fretting. Even
      if Trump were to follow through on his threat to cut the government funding of
      Musk’s firms, the tasks they’re carrying out — from launching military satellites
      to developing more secure Internet access for deployed military personnel — would
      still proceed, just under the auspices of different companies. There would be
      some friction involved, simply because it’s hard to shift suppliers on a dime
      without slowing down production. And the transition, should it occur, would also
      add cost to already exceedingly expensive programs.


      But Trump’s threat to cancel Space X’s contracts may just be more grist for his
      verbal combat with Musk rather than anything his administration plans to follow
      through on. Even if Musk and his president never reconcile, the DOGE cuts to international
      diplomacy and domestic social services that Musk spearheaded will still do serious
      damage for years to come.


      Money Can’t Buy Security


      A shift toward emerging military tech firms and away from the Big Five will be
      about more than money and technology. Key figures among the growing cohort of
      Silicon Valley militarists like Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, see building weapons
      as more than just a necessary pillar of national defense. They see it as a measure
      of national character.


      Karp’s new book, The Technological Republic: Hard Power, Soft Belief, and the
      Future of the West, mixes the Cold War ideology of the 1950s with the emerging
      technology of the twenty-first century. He decries the lack of unifying concepts
      like “the West” and sees too many Americans as slackers with no sense of national
      pride or patriotism. His solution, a supposedly unifying national mission, is
      — wait for it! — a modern Manhattan project for the development of the military
      applications of artificial intelligence. To say that this is an impoverished version
      of what this country’s mission should be is putting it mildly. Many other possibilities
      come to mind, from addressing climate change to preventing pandemics to upgrading
      our educational system to building a society where everyone’s basic needs are
      met, leaving room for creative pursuits of all kinds.


      The techno-optimists are also obsessed with preparing for a war with China, which
      Palmer Luckey, the 32-year-old founder of the military tech firm Anduril, believes
      will happen by 2027. And many in his circle, including Marc Andreessen of the
      venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, are convinced that any potential risks
      from the development of AI pale in comparison to the need to “beat China,” not
      just in getting to sophisticated military applications first, but in winning a
      future war with Beijing, if it comes to that. Talk of diplomacy to head off a
      war over Taiwan or cooperation on global issues like climate change, outbreaks
      of disease, and building a more inclusive, less unequal global economy rarely
      come up in discussions among the hardcore militarist faction in Silicon Valley.
      Instead, that group is spending inordinate amounts of time and money seeking to
      influence the future of U.S. foreign and military policy, a dangerous development
      indeed.


      Whether the emerging tech firms can build cheaper weapons with superior capabilities
      will be irrelevant if such developments are tied to an aggressive strategy that
      makes a devastating conflict with China more likely. While the fight between the
      Big Five and the tech leaders may prove interesting to observe, it is also ominous
      in terms of this country’s future economic and foreign policies, not to speak
      of the shape and size of our national budget.


      The rest of us, who aren’t billionaires and don’t draw $20 million in annual compensation
      packages like the CEOs of the big weapons firms (directly or indirectly funded
      by our tax dollars), should play a leading role in rethinking and revising this
      country’s global role and our policies at home. If we don’t rise to that challenge,
      this country could end up swapping one form of militarism, led by the Big Five,
      for another, spearheaded by hawkish, self-important tech leaders who care more
      about making money and spawning devastating new technologies than they do about
      democracy or the quality of life of the average American.

    paragraph_summary: The article by William D. Hartung discusses the Senate's impending
      passage of a controversial bill that cuts $1.7 trillion in domestic spending while
      providing $1.5 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and adding $150
      billion to an already inflated Pentagon budget. This legislation prioritizes military
      spending over social welfare, with significant allocations for ineffective missile

      from essential services such as healthcare and education. The author warns that
      this trend not only undermines the social safety net but also fosters a dangerous
      militarization of U.S. policy, as emerging tech firms vie for military contracts,
      potentially escalating tensions with adversaries like China. Ultimately, the article

      On one hand, you have the White House, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Dan
      Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, insisting and insisting again — insisting too
      much, methinks — that those B–2 bombers that flew over Iran two Sundays back,
      June 22, obliterated the nation’s nuclear program just as President Trump hastily
      claimed as soon as the operation was completed.


      Hegseth at a news conference with Caine four days later: “U.S. attacks have effectively
      destroyed Iran’s centrifuge enrichment program …. You want to call it destroyed,
      you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated, choose your word.
      This was an historically successful attack, and we should celebrate it as Americans.”


      Trump, at a news conference the next day: “The place was bombed to hell …. The
      last thing they’re thinking about now is nuclear weapons.”


      And in the background you have the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central
      Intelligence Agency performing Difficulty 5 back flips as they repudiate initial
      assessments of limited damage to the Iranian nuclear program so as to conform
      to the Trump regime’s “obliterated, destroyed, defeated” narrative.


      On the other hand, you have reports that the Iranians, warned in advance the “bunker
      busters” would fall on the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites, removed their
      400–kilograms of enriched uranium, not quite 900 pounds, to secret locations.
      Immediately after the bombs fell, Amwaj.media, a British-based digital publication
      that covers West Asia in English, Arabic and Farsi, reported this, citing “a high-ranking
      Iranian political source [who] also confirmed that the targeted sites were evacuated,
      with ‘most’ of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium kept in secure locations.”


      “How can you tell,” Reuters asked in a June 29 report, “if enriched uranium stocks,
      some of them near weapons grade, were buried beneath the rubble or secretly hidden
      away?”


      You cannot, it seems to me. Neither can President Trump or any of his adjutants.


      Then you have the granular analysis of reputable technologists such as Ted Postol,
      the gentlemanly scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has
      over many years exploded more false flags, propaganda ops, and other such ruses
      than you’ve had hot dinners.


      There is satellite imagery showing 16 tractor trailers lined up at Fordow in the
      days before the B–2s flew. Trump insists they were pouring concrete, a peculiar
      use of a truck of that sort, I have to say. It is magnitudes more plausible they
      were there to load the steel drums in which enriched uranium is commonly stored
      and shipped.


      Postol gave the heavy-on-the-science interview to Daniel Davis, an Army veteran
      who now podcasts as a respected military analyst, after the Hegseth–Caine press
      conference. In the course of it, the joint chiefs chairman went full monty with
      slides, diagrams, satellite images, and graphics to show (or is snow my word?)
      the assembled reporters just how true the obliterated-destroyed-defeated story
      is.


      “What it clearly shows is that the bottom of the shaft [formed by the bombs] is
      still sealed,” Postol said of Caine’s presentation. “Caine is probably a good
      soldier, but he doesn’t know much science. You cannot succeed with this kind of
      attack. It was destined to fail.”


      Postol also proves astute as to the political dynamics of the administration’s
      shape-shifting accounts of the Iranian mission: “This is a circus, a political
      circus to try to minimize the embarrassment to President Trump for having spoken
      without any knowledge.”


      Where are we, then? As Postol points out during his exchange with Davis, “You
      can’t trust the media and you can’t trust the intelligence community.” What happened
      and what is going to happen next? These are the questions we are left to consider
      more or less on our own.


      Strange as it may seem, I find it easier to anticipate the future than to conclude
      with certainty what it is that those B–2s and their 30,000–pound bombs actually
      got done.


      It may be that we are doomed never to know the extent of the damage the Air Force’s
      aerial operation caused. But, staying short of convictions as we must, I put my
      stock in those reports that the Iranians had advance notice that the B–2s were
      coming. I have heard no official denial on this point. And so much of contemporary
      warfare is weirdly choreographed, after all. In this case, telling Tehran the
      battle plan would serve to reduce the danger — danger the International Atomic
      Energy Agency warned of prior to the operation — of a catastrophic release of
      radioactive material into the atmosphere.


      And there is the science, such as unscientific minds, mine among them, can understand
      it. I have found Ted Postol a careful, persuasive witness ever since he discredited
      those false-flag chemical weapons incidents in Syria at the height of the Western-run
      operation to bring down the Assad regime. Take a look at the video of his talk
      with Daniel Davis. He did the same thing this time: Here are the physics, here
      the thermodynamics, this is what would have to have happened if the obliteration
      story was true, and here is how we know it did not happen.


      As to what is likely to come next, we can usefully read events as mirrors of intentions.


      I think it is true that Hegseth, Caine and others among Trump’s sycophantic appointees
      are protecting the president from ignominy — or more ignominy, better to say —
      as they flood the zone with pseudoscience and, in Hegseth’s case, shrill exhortations
      to print and broadcast media to stop with the reporting and get with the patriotic
      propaganda. (Read the transcript linked above for the full taste of these crude
      harangues.)


      But there is more to President Trump than his obvious concern for appearances.
      In my view he is very eager to avoid any circumstance that would require another
      American air campaign in Iranian airspace. He wants neither the risk nor the responsibility.
      This is how, paradoxically, I read his warning the other day that he will bomb
      again if Iran resumes its enrichment processes. When Trump drops threats like
      granite boulders we can read in them what he actually wants. In this case it is
      another way of saying, “Please stay with the ceasefire and short of the nuclear
      stuff.”


      With Trump, it is as it was with Joe Biden and numerous of their predecessors.
      One can never tell the extent to which Trump , is willing to restrain the Israelis
      as they advance their aggressions — which any American regime could do in very
      short order — and the extent to which he pretends to be willing to restrain the
      Israelis but has no intention of doing so because of the Israel lobbies.


      The New York Times ran a report Monday, June 29, under the headline, “Israel’s
      Military Appears Poised to Expand Into Gaza City Amid Cease-Fire Calls.” While
      Trump and his national-security people press for a ceasefire in Gaza — with what
      degree of vigor we do not know — the Zionist state just ordered Palestinians to
      evacuate the Strip’s main city after not operating here for many months. So they
      seem to be going in yet again. “There has been no advancement in the ceasefire
      talks,” The Times, quoting two Israeli officials and another unnamed source, reported.


      This development has nothing and everything to do with Israel’s current posture
      toward Iran, as I interpret it. Israel has as little intention of ceasing its
      operations against Iran, now that they are finally underway, as it does to end
      its genocidal ethnic-cleansing of the Palestinians of Gaza. These aggressions
      are both fronts in what the Israelis call their “seven-front war” across West
      Asia, and we must not lose sight of this. We witness a thematically unified campaign
      of terror. There is no place in it for ceasefires, peaceful coexistence or anything
      else short of total victory.


      As in Gaza, so in the West Bank, and as in Gaza and the West Bank, so in Lebanon,
      and as in these three, so in Iran. I see no chance whatsoever that the Israelis
      consider themselves done with the Islamic Republic. Destroying the nation’s nuclear
      program, wrecking the economy and essential infrastructure, creating a state of
      political chaos, assassinating or otherwise decapitating the leadership: All this
      appears to be under discussion among Israel’s war planners.


      It is merely a matter of time before the Zionist state resumes its aggressions.
      Then there will be more questions, chief among them what the United States and
      the rest of the West will do as more barbarities unfold before the world’s eyes.

      By Alan MacLeod / MintPress News


      By actively partnering with the U.S. government to smuggle communications hardware
      into Iran, Elon Musk is once again aiding Washington’s attempts at regime change.
      This fits into a long pattern of both American efforts to dislodge the government
      in Tehran and Musk’s close collaboration with the U.S. national security state,
      helping it to achieve its objectives around the world.


      For decades, Washington has sought to overthrow the government in Tehran. Today,
      its most important ally in that effort may not be in the CIA or Pentagon, but
      in Silicon Valley.


      Elon Musk, through his Starlink satellite system, is now helping to smuggle thousands
      of communication terminals into Iran, enabling opposition networks to evade government
      restrictions and coordinate in secret. His partnership with the U.S. national
      security state has made him a central figure in one of the most ambitious regime
      change campaigns in modern times.


      Targeting Tehran


      It is no secret that Iran is in Washington’s crosshairs. And Elon Musk is aiding
      the attempt to depose the government in Tehran. In response to a post by a member
      of President Trump’s Homeland Security Advisory Council, Mark Levin, asking him
      to “put the final nail in the coffin of the Iranian regime by providing Starlink
      internet to the Iranian people,” the billionaire tech mogul recently announced
      that “the beams are on.”


      After the Israeli bombardment began, Iran’s Communication Ministry placed heavy
      restrictions on online communication. This had the effect of hampering the ability
      of American and Israeli assets inside the country from communicating.


      Starlink is an internet service allowing those with terminals to directly connect
      to thousands of SpaceX satellites in low Earth orbit. Terminals are, in effect,
      small, portable satellite dishes that can be set up anywhere and used by those
      in the near vicinity to skirt government restrictions on communication.


      This is not the first time that Musk has used Starlink to sow chaos in Iran. In
      2023, at the height of a U.S.-backed protest movement, the South African-born
      plutocrat responded to a statement to Secretary of State Antony Blinken announcing
      that the United States was taking action “to advance internet freedom and the
      free flow of information for the Iranian people…to counter the Iranian government’s
      censorship.”


      “Activating Starlink,” Musk said. A few weeks after this pronouncement, Musk revealed
      that he was helping to smuggle hundreds of Starlinks into the country. “Approaching
      100 Starlinks active in Iran,” he later noted.


      The scale of the operation has been substantial, as only 18 months later, an estimated
      20,000 clandestine Starlink devices are operating inside the country, helping
      a vast network of activists, spies, and other anti-government forces coordinate
      and communicate.


      Keeping Ukraine Fighting


      This is far from the only country where Starlink has been used to promote Washington’s
      interests.


      After Russia hit its communications grid, the U.S. government rushed thousands
      of Starlinks into Ukraine, where they provide the backbone of the country’s communications
      system. Most of the high-tech weaponry sent by NATO countries to Ukraine is useless
      without online targeting systems, and Starlink keeps the Ukrainian military in
      the field, allowing it to target Russian positions. Indeed, one official told
      The Times of London that he “must” use Starlink to target enemy forces via thermal
      imaging.


      There are an estimated 42,000 Starlinks in Ukraine, keeping their government ministries,
      hospitals, and military online. “Starlink is what changed the war in Ukraine’s
      favor. Russia went out of its way to blow up all our comms. Now they can’t. Starlink
      operates under Katyusha fire and artillery fire. It even works in Mariupol,” one
      Ukrainian soldier told journalist David Patrikarakos, referencing the deep underground
      mines where Ukrainian forces were dug in.


      The Pentagon’s Man


      As can be seen, then, Musk and his companies enjoy a very close relationship with
      the U.S. national security state. SpaceX – the manufacturer of Starlink – has
      signed a myriad of lucrative contracts with various American intelligence agencies.


      In 2021, the firm won a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance
      Office to build a network of hundreds of spy satellites. It was also chosen to
      blast a $500 million Lockheed Martin spy system into orbit, and to deliver an
      Air Force command satellite into space.


      The spying agency that has worked most intimately with Musk and SpaceX, however,
      is the Central Intelligence Agency. Midwifing the birth of SpaceX was Mike Griffin,
      then the head of In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capitalist wing. In-Q-Tel identifies
      and funds cutting-edge tech firms whose technologies and products will give the
      CIA an advantage over its rivals.


      Griffin was with Musk from day one, even accompanying him to Moscow in 2002, where
      the pair attempted to kickstart SpaceX by purchasing cut-price Russian intercontinental
      ballistic missiles. Musk believed that by sourcing missiles at a lower cost from
      around the world, he could significantly undercut competitors like Lockheed Martin
      and secure defense contracts.


      The attempt failed, but the trip cemented a lifelong partnership that remains
      to this day. Griffin became Musk’s primary backer within the intelligence community,
      labelling him the “Henry Ford” of the rocket industry, and constantly promoting
      his name within the halls of power.


      Griffin would later become the head of NASA, hold a senior position at the Pentagon,
      and save SpaceX on multiple occasions from bankruptcy by handing the company gigantic
      contracts.


      Perhaps no other figure has impacted Musk’s life more than Griffin, who now serves
      as a senior advisor to Castelion, a SpaceX spin-off organization dealing with
      missile defense systems. Musk called his oldest child Griffin, and went on to
      name his subsequent child X Æ A-12, after a CIA bomber jet.


      Rocketman


      Castelion was formed in 2022 to help the Pentagon win a nuclear war. For decades,
      war planners in Washington have been determined to find a way to block foreign
      nuclear missiles from reaching the United States. To that end, they recruited
      Musk in an effort to build an enormous “American Iron Dome” of modified SpaceX
      satellites that could shoot down incoming rockets, making the United States impervious
      to attack.


      While this technology might appear defensive on the surface, it would, in effect,
      give the United States free rein to attack any nation at any time, safe in the
      knowledge that there would be no possible retaliation. The Mutually Assured Destruction
      doctrine that has held together a fragile peace since the late 1940s would be
      shattered, and the United States—the only country to use nuclear weapons against
      another nation—would be invincible.


      Internal documents have shown for decades that it is precisely and only this threat
      of consequences from Russian, Chinese, or North Korean intercontinental ballistic
      missiles that has stayed the hand of Washington.


      Musk has repeatedly downplayed the consequences of a nuclear winter, and even
      suggested firing more than 10,000 nuclear warheads at Mars, in a quixotic attempt
      to trigger a rapid greenhouse effect, warming the planet sufficiently for human
      habitation.


      Few scientists believe that the plan could work, and many have strongly denounced
      the idea. Dmitry Rogozin, then-head of the Russian state space agency Roscosmos,
      for instance, warned that Musk’s gambit was nothing more than a cover to fill
      space with thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at Russia, China, and any other
      nation drawing the U.S.’s ire.


      Overthrowing Governments Around the World


      While Iran is currently in the crosshairs, it is far from the only country Musk
      has interfered in. The tech magnate also led an attempt to overturn last year’s
      presidential elections in Venezuela, claiming that far-right opposition candidate
      Edmundo Gonzalez had won.


      Musk shared fake videos purporting to show massive election fraud, suspended the
      Twitter account of President Nicolas Maduro, and even threatened to drag the Venezuelan
      leader to the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison. Given Musk’s past statements, these
      are not taken lightly in Latin America.


      The billionaire admitted to working with the U.S. government to overthrow Bolivian
      President Evo Morales in 2019. Bolivia is home to the world’s largest easily extractable
      lithium reserves, an element crucial in the production of electric-vehicle batteries.
      Morales had refused to open the country up to foreign corporations eager to exploit
      Bolivia for profit. Instead, he proposed developing sovereign technology to keep
      both the jobs and profits inside the country.


      A U.S.-backed far-right insurrection overthrew him in November 2019. The new government
      quickly invited Musk for talks. When directly accused of his complicity, the tycoon
      stated bluntly, “We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.” Inside Bolivia,
      the affair is often described as “the Lithium Coup.”


      More recently, Musk has interfered in German politics, strongly backing the far-right
      AfD Party, telling voters that they should not be ashamed of their past (i.e.,
      fascism). In Britain, Musk funds and promotes far-right racist agitator Tommy
      Robinson. And in Canada, he attempted to swing this year’s election towards the
      right-wing conservative candidate, Pierre Poilievre.


      The attempted backfired spectacularly, however, as his perceived arrogance (he
      repeatedly called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “governor”, implying Canada was
      not a sovereign nation, but the 51st state of the U.S.) rallied Canadians around
      Liberal candidate Mark Carney. It was a similar story in Wisconsin this April,
      where Musk spent tens of millions of dollars attempting (and failing) to buy an
      election.


      Nevertheless, despite his recent failures, it is doubtful that Musk has given
      up on national and international politics. Nor is it likely that this will be
      the last time that Washington openly plans for regime change in Tehran.


      Ever since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that deposed a U.S.-backed dictator,
      Iran has been a top concern for members of the American national security state.
      Thankfully for them, they can rely on help from tech CEOs such as Elon Musk, who
      appear only too happy to ally themselves with those in power to serve the agenda
      of the U.S. empire.

  - title: Will Zohran Mamdani Empower or Betray the Working Class? (w/ Kshama Sawant)
      | The Chris Hedges Report

    text: 'By Chris Hedges / The Chris Hedges Report


      This interview is also available on podcast platforms and Rumble.


      Zohran Mamdani’s emphatic victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary
      has shaken the core of American politics. A self-described democratic socialist,
      Mamdani ran a campaign centered around affordability as well as relentless denunciation
      of the genocide in Gaza. Mamdani drew the ire of Zionists, right-wingers and the
      billionaire class not only in New York City but across the country, including
      calls for his deportation by Congressman Andy Ogles and subsequent slander by
      President Donald Trump.


      Former Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, who is now running for Washington
      state’s 9th congressional district, weighs in on her fellow democratic socialist’s
      journey on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report.


      Sawant has been a standout figure for working class representation, winning a
      $15 an hour minimum wage in Seattle during her city council tenure as well as
      the Amazon Tax, which helped fund affordable housing. She says Mamdani’s victory
      should be celebrated, especially because it shows the Zionist lobby can be defeated
      not just in the U.S. but in a state home to the largest Jewish population outside
      of Israel.


      Despite this encouraging repudiation of the billionaire class in the wealthiest
      city in America, Sawant emphasizes the need to continue the fight and make sure
      Mamdani sticks to his original promises.


      “If you don’t understand that careerism is one of the death knells of winning
      anything substantial for the working class, then you will sell out even with those
      good intentions because you will make it about yourself and you will immediately
      get the memo that in order to fight for working people, you will need to be in
      battle mode every single day when you enter City Hall,” she says.


      Mamdani’s alignment with the Democratic Party is concerning, according to Sawant,
      pointing to a pattern in which groundbreaking campaigns, like those of Alexandria
      Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, have fallen short of delivering promises for
      working class people once in office.


      “At the end of the day, the Democratic Party is a party of capitalism itself,”
      Sawant asserts. “The working class loses out more and more and is subjected to
      more and more misery with every passing decade that you’re not going to stand
      up for working people.”


      So far, Mamdani’s campaign has made strides to inspire the American working class.
      “It’s a real boost of confidence for working class people nationally to see that
      yes, working people will fight alongside you if you put forward demands that make
      a huge difference in their lives and which reflect their anger, their just anger
      at the Wall Street billionaires,” Sawant says.

      Hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman, enraged by Zohran Mamdani’s securing an overwhelming
      majority to become the Democratic Party’s nominee to run for mayor of New York
      City, said he and his wealthy associates will pour “hundreds of millions of dollars”
      into the candidacy of anyone willing to run against Mamdani in the general election.
      Ackman, who supports Donald Trump, added that he has an unnamed candidate he is
      ready to bankroll.


      Major Democratic donors — who poured tens of millions of dollars into a Super
      PAC to support former governor Andrew Cuomo in his run for mayor — are also meeting
      to decide if they will fund an independent run by Cuomo in November, or back the
      unpopular incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent.


      Mamdani’s grassroots campaign – Cuomo’s campaign outspent him 20 to 1 – centered
      around raising the minimum wage, tax hikes on businesses and the rich, creating
      city-owned grocery stores, making city bus service free and imposing a rent freeze
      for stabilized tenants.


      The victory by the self-described Democratic socialist, who was mercilessly smeared
      for his denunciation of the genocide in Gaza and promise to honor the arrest warrant
      issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he appeared in New York
      City, has sent shock waves through the ruling billionaire class and the Democratic
      Party establishment that supported Cuomo. While Mamdani was endorsed by Alexandria
      Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez who serve in the state’s congressional delegation,
      as well as Bernie Sanders, they were the singular exceptions. The hierarchy of
      the party has either remained silent since Mamdani’s victory or been openly antagonistic.


      New York Senator Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leaders of
      the Senate and the House, refuse to back Mamdani’s candidacy. New York Rep. Laura
      Gillen, speaking for many in the party, called Mamdani the “absolute wrong choice
      for New York.”


      Democrats, along with their major donors, can be counted on to attempt to sabotage
      Mamdani’s campaign, just as it did the campaign of Bernie Sanders when he sought
      the presidential nomination. It remains, it seems, impervious to reform.


      What does this election portend? What does it mean for the future of the Democratic
      Party? Is Mamdani’s victory a sign that there are growing cracks in the edifice
      of the party? Or will it drive the party further to the right and see it destroy
      the candidacies of those who seek to address the domination of our political system
      by the billionaire class and the punishing social inequality?


      Joining me to discuss Mamdani’s victory and what it portends, as well as her own
      campaign to be elected as a democratic socialist to Congress in Washington state,
      is Kshama Sawant. Kshama is a leader for Workers Strike Back and Revolutionary
      Workers. And as a city council member, she battled against the established Democratic
      Party leadership and the city’s oligarchs who poured millions into campaigns to
      defeat her including an unsuccessful effort to oust her in a recall vote. Amazon
      alone spent over $3 million to defeat her run for office in 2019.


      Sawant helped lead the fight in 2014 that made Seattle the first major American
      city to mandate a $15 dollar an hour minimum wage. Following a three-year struggle
      against one of the richest men in the world – Jeff Bezos – and his political establishment,
      she and her allies pushed through a tax on big business that increased city revenues
      by an estimated $210 to $240 million a year.


      She was part of the movement that led to Seattle’s successful ban on school-year
      evictions of schoolchildren, their families and school employees. She was one
      of sponsors of a bill that protects tenants from being evicted at the end of their
      “term leases,” requiring landlords to provide tenants with the right to renew
      their leases and prohibiting landlords from evicting tenants for non-payment of
      rent if the rent was due during the COVID civil emergency and the renter could
      not pay due to financial hardship. You can find her at KshamaSawant.org.


      Okay, so let’s begin with Mamdani’s victory, what you think it means, and the
      Democratic Party’s response. And I just want to add, you yourself, when you were
      on the city council, spent most of your time battling the Democratic Party establishment,
      or much of the time.


      Kshama Sawant


      All the time, actually. The Democrats on the city council here in Seattle opposed
      every single progressive measure that my office fought for. But yeah, Mamdani’s
      primary election victory in the Democratic Party in New York City for the mayoral
      election is first and foremost a stinging rebuke of the Zionist lobby.


      It shows that it is possible to defeat the Zionist lobby and it is possible to
      win. In fact, you mentioned in your introduction that I’m running for Congress
      right now against, and I’m running against this genocidal warmongering Democrat,
      Adam Smith, who has voted for the genocide repeatedly to send tens of billions
      of dollars to the Israeli state for the genocide. He also voted for the war in
      Iraq back in 2002, and he also voted to create ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].


      And he was bankrolled by the Zionist lobby. In last year’s election, AIPAC was
      his top contributor. He’s also backed by dystopian corporations like Palantir,
      which profit from war and mass slaughter. And so this primary victory of Mamdani
      actually has injected huge confidence in the thousands of people who are supporting
      our campaign here.


      So many people have messaged me personally saying, I’m so excited about this victory
      because it shows that you can defeat the Zionist lobby. So I think, first and
      foremost, we have to recognize what a huge victory that is. It’s also, given how
      relentlessly Mamdani has campaigned using his working class demands, it’s also
      a real boost of confidence for working class people nationally to see that yes,
      working people will fight alongside you if you put forward demands that make a
      huge difference in their lives and which reflect their anger, their just anger
      at the Wall Street billionaires.


      I mean, Mamdani’s campaign has called for a $30 an hour minimum wage, for a rent
      freeze, for free transit, for fully funded childcare. And so these are things
      that working people need. And so if a campaign can succeed on that basis, it shows
      that working people are willing to push forward on those demands.


      And it’s also, I have to say, a resounding rebuke to the union leaders, not the
      rank and file, but the union leaders who endorsed Cuomo in the primary. I mean,
      can you imagine what kind of union leader do you have to be to endorse somebody
      who’s so discredited that he’s even too much of a hot potato for most of the Democrats
      to maintain their own credibility? They don’t want to touch him because he has
      15,000 COVID deaths on his hands.


      He has all kinds of other corruption charges. He also has been accused by at least
      a dozen, probably 13 women of sexual harassment. And so it’s just mind boggling,
      although not surprising. It’s just incredible that the leaders of UFCW [United
      Food and Commercial Workers], of RWDSU [Retail, Wholesale and Department Store
      Union], of the Teamsters, of SEIU [Service Employees International Union], all
      these major unions, the Carpenters, all of them supporting Cuomo.


      So I think they have really been put to shame. And it is important to see that,
      for example, SEIU leaders have already now said they’re endorsing Mamdani. But
      it really exposes the unholy ties of the labor leadership with the Democratic
      establishment. And so I think the question is not, is this a real confirmation
      of the kind of political demands we need to put forward and that the opposition
      to the genocide and the demand to end the genocide, should that be front and center
      of election campaigns in the coming year?


      No, that’s not the question. This has shown that it actually, that’s exactly what
      we should be doing. The outstanding question here is what will it take to win
      any of these demands? And that’s where I think we have to conduct a lot of examination.
      I mean, I think the experience that we had on the Seattle City Council, we, my
      fellow socialists and we, I had the city council office for a decade in Seattle.


      And what it took for us to win the historic victories, many of which you enumerated,
      it took what I would call a fighting strategy. And what does a fighting strategy
      mean? A fighting strategy, first and foremost, means that you understand that
      capitalism is a zero-sum game and that you cannot hope to win any substantial
      victories. I’m not talking about crumbs, but substantial reforms in the interest
      of the working class by thinking that you are going to sweet talk the billionaires
      into agreement with you.


      It also requires understanding that the Democrats and Republicans, despite their
      differences, they both represent the interests of the billionaires of capitalism.
      And so you’re not going to sweet talk them either. And you don’t go into the halls
      of office by thinking that they are your colleagues and that you’re going to have
      good conversations with them and reach some sort of agreement with them. No, you
      have to understand that this is posed as an adversarial task by definition. Working
      people didn’t make it adversarial, capitalism is adversarial towards the working
      class. The only question is, are we gonna fight back or are we going to roll over
      and die?


      And so, again and again and again, what we saw in Seattle was a Democratic Party
      carrying water for the big business entities, for big corporations like Amazon
      and Starbucks, for the Chamber of Commerce, for corporate landlords. And for us
      to win any of these victories that we won, I, first and foremost, had to be clear,
      and all working people alongside me had to be clear that this is class war and
      that the way we win is by using my office to build mass movements and mass movements
      not just to come to city hall and beg the Democrats to do the right thing, but
      mass movements that are defiant in character, that demand that unless you do this,
      we are going to vote you out of office. We’re going to throw you out of office.


      So that adversarial character is fundamental to winning something big. Like, for
      example, the victory that we won on minimum wage, that is the highest wage in
      the nation because part of the battle we waged when we fought for $15 an hour
      was to win inflation increases. The Democrats fought us viciously on that. We
      were still able to prevail. Why? Because I launched the 15 Now Movement in Seattle
      and it mobilized Seattle’s working class in the thousands and so many of them
      were involved in our action conferences.


      It was a democratically organized movement where the rank and file of the movement
      had the say in strategic decisions. We literally had debates and voting. It took
      that strength of the mass of the working class to win not only the nation’s first
      $15 an hour minimum wage, but also inflation increases. And that’s why today Seattle’s
      minimum wage is the highest in the nation at $20.76. So I would just say that
      for the working class to win in New York City will take this similar approach.


      The question is not can Mamdani win through a strategy of playing nice with the
      billionaires? No, that’s not the question because you can’t win that way. All
      of history shows that. The question is, will he do what we did in Seattle, in
      order to win similar victories in New York City?


      Chris Hedges


      Well, that is a break with you. I mean, there’s one strong similarity between
      the campaigns that you ran and the campaigns that he ran. And that is that you
      appealed to disaffected voters on the right or people who just didn’t vote at
      all on these basic economic issues. I find that a kind of parallel.


      But I think the difference, which you just enunciated, is that you always took
      an adversarial position and he has talked about making New York a wonderful place
      for everybody, including billionaires. And I think you’re saying that’s a big
      mistake.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, because in a deeply divided situation like capitalism is, you cannot lose
      sight of the fact of, as I said earlier, that capitalism is a zero sum game. What
      does that mean? It means that when we won the $15 minimum wage, for example, and
      now that it’s gone even higher because of inflation increases being built into
      it, that money is making the lives of the least paid workers, the poorest of the
      working class, much better because even a few dollars extra an hour makes a life
      difference.


      It makes the difference between being able to pay your rent or being evicted and
      then being forced to couch surf again and again, which many families, in fact,
      even families with children are forced to do. But that money comes from the profits
      of the billionaires, the big business entities, the multimillionaires.


      And so it is inevitable that if you fight for something substantial, like a major
      increase in minimum wage, that will create a political clash with big businesses.
      And that’s it’s no surprise that, what’s his name, Bill Ackman, the Trump supporting
      billionaire who is apoplectic about Mamdani’s primary victory, that’s no surprise.
      That is him representing the interests of the billionaire class.


      And so the working class cannot afford to blur the class lines. When I was asked
      repeatedly by reporters, you speak so combatively, but as an elected official,
      aren’t you running to represent all your constituents? They’d asked me that repeatedly.
      You would never catch me saying that I am representing everyone.


      In fact, I reminded them, you know, one of the constituents of my Seattle city
      council district when I was on the city council for 10 years was, and it still
      is, I assume, the billionaire former CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, extremely
      anti-worker, absolutely viciously anti-union, union-busting CEO billionaire. And
      I said, Howard Schultz lives in my district. I don’t represent him and he doesn’t
      agree with me.


      I mean, these are class lines and blurring the lines does not help the working
      class. It actually helps the ruling class. I mean, it sort of signals to the ruling,
      if you say that you’re going to represent everyone, it signals to the ruling class
      that you’re open for conversation. You’re open to discussion with them. And that
      discussion means only one thing, which is that they will push you, put pressure
      on you, and they will use the carrot and the stick to put pressure on you to sell
      out.


      And I’ve experienced all of that. When I first entered City Hall, I’ve experienced
      both the carrot and the stick. There were city council members and also others
      in the Democratic Party who tried to flatter me, make this about me. They said
      things like, well, you are such a superstar, but you need to dissociate yourself
      from this socialist ideology because that’s not going to be good for your political
      career.


      Therein lies the problem, is that no matter how well intentioned you are, and
      let’s assume that new people are well intentioned, no matter how well intentioned
      you are, if you don’t understand that careerism is one of the death knells of
      winning anything substantial for the working class, then you will sell out even
      with those good intentions because you will make it about yourself and you will
      immediately get the memo that in order to fight for working people, you will need
      to be in battle mode every single day when you enter City Hall or the halls of
      Congress because the only other option is for you to sell out because there’s
      no option that you will convince them into agreeing with you.


      Why? Because at the end of the day, the Democratic Party is a party of capitalism
      itself. And yes, there are differences with the Republican Party, but it’s like
      Chomsky said, that there’s a smart way to keep people passive and obedient, and
      that is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively
      debate within that spectrum.


      And so what that means is that in the case of the Democratic and Republican parties
      is that, there are differences between them, but if you don’t understand that
      they both represent the billionaire class and they’re there and their differences
      are there so that the working class can perennially be dangled this, you know,
      you either support Democrats or Republicans. But at end of the day the working
      class loses out more and more and is subjected to more and more misery with every
      passing decade that you’re not going to stand up for working people.


      Chris Hedges


      I think also the mistake is that you complicate this, the billionaire class, which
      Mamdani seems, at least rhetorically, to be saying he can do.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, and in fact, he’s saying that in many concrete ways. For example, in his
      recent MSNBC interview, I think it was just today or yesterday, they played a
      clip of, you know he’s been calling for taxes on the rich, which of course, I
      strongly support. I strongly support all the demands that he’s running on in terms
      of the minimum wage increase, rent freeze, and taxes on the rich, and child care
      funding, and all of that.


      They played a clip of Governor Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, very clearly
      saying she’s not going to be for taxing the rich. She’s very clearly declaring
      that that is absolutely not something that she wants to do. But his response to
      that was again, along those lines of I’m excited to work with her on this. What
      does that mean? I don’t understand what that means.


      I mean, you have to use your interview appearances to speak not to that MSNBC
      journalist who is representing the ruling class line or Governor Kathy Hochul,
      who is an arch-corporate Democrat. She represents a billionaire class. Your interview
      appearances, if you’re a socialist and fighting for working people, has to be
      to speak to the working class audience that’s not in front of you, but millions
      who are watching out there. And your message needs to be, first of all, truthful.


      And being truthful means you cannot send an illusion to the working class that
      somehow Kathy Hochul can be talked into taxing the rich, somehow Bill Ackman can
      be convinced that rent freezes are also in his interest. It will improve his quality
      of life as well. It’s something that Mamdani has said as well, that, if we do
      these progressive things, it will improve the quality of life not only of working
      people, but also of the billionaires.


      That’s simply not true in the sense that the billionaires don’t want to part with
      the billions of dollars that they have. I mean, the $15 minimum wage that we won,
      that meant $3 billion of profits from big business taken away to fund workers.
      And you have to declare that proudly in the sense that you don’t represent the
      billionaire class. As much wealth you can take from them, that’s a good thing.
      That’s a moral thing. That is a just thing. And that is an honorable thing to
      fight for.


      And it is actually disarming working class movements to send them, as I said,
      an illusion that somehow the class lines can be blurred, that somehow you can
      make agreement with the ruling class. And I think that if we want, if Mamdani
      wants to, I don’t know that he doesn’t, I’ll talk about his previous record, but
      if he does want to build movements, and you know, I absolutely want him to do
      it. I absolutely want him to build the movements, and if he’s going to build the
      movements after he’s elected, if he’s elected, I will personally be there wanting
      to rally with him.


      I will personally help the movement to win a $30 minimum wage in New York City
      because if they win, that would be an Earth shattering victory. It would be an
      enormous call to action nationally and it would put a lot of pressure on the Democratic
      Party to push for a $25 an hour minimum wage federally. All of that would be a
      fantastic thing. And like I said, I am pledging here and now that I will be right
      there in New York City pounding the pavement to win any of these victories.


      The question is, will he do what is needed in order to actually win this? And
      in terms of his previous record, the reason I’m expressing skepticism is not that
      I don’t want him to do it. As I said, I really hope that he does it. But it’s
      also my responsibility, I am also representing working people. And it is my obligation,
      my political and moral obligation, to use my platform to speak the truth. Again,
      not to send out illusions, but speak the truth.


      And even if not everybody agrees with me at this moment. But if you look at the
      record that Mamdani has, Mamdani is not new to politics. He won his first state
      assembly, New York state assembly election in 2020. And he has been on the New
      York state legislature for four years and in fact since that time the New York
      DSA which he’s part of, the Democratic Socialist of America, they’ve had eight
      elected officials in the New York state legislature and they have certainly won
      some things but to be honest whatever they have won is far far from commensurate
      to having eight elected positions.


      I mean can you imagine what we would do with eight elected positions? To imagine
      that, look at what we did with one elected position. You know, we, like I said,
      we experienced both the carrot and the stick. So I experienced a lot of flattery,
      but I also experienced a stick. And the stick never goes away. Once the ruling
      class and their parties, the Democrats and Republicans, are clear that you are
      not going to be bought, that you are not going to sell out, then come all the
      vicious attacks, which never relent.


      And so for working people to succeed, we need leadership. And it’s not just about
      elected representatives. It’s also in city hall or Congress. It’s also elected
      leaders in the labor movement, unelected leaders in social movements. We need
      leadership in all of these avenues that are clear that that is what it takes,
      that in order to win for working people, it takes you as the leader to take those
      body blows.


      Because if you don’t, then you’re selling out working class people. That’s what
      you owe. It’s your duty and you should consider it your honor. It’s an honor to
      be able to play this role. But as far as what the New York DSA did in the several
      years that they have had positions, they have not won any victories commensurate
      with having eight elected positions.


      And in fact, it’s really telling that Mamdani himself, he had his two re-elections.
      He was first elected in 2020, then he had his re-elections in 2022, and then last
      year, 2024. And he ran unopposed both years, which means neither the Democrats
      contested him in the primaries, nor did the Republicans run any candidate against
      him in the general election.


      Such a thing does not happen if you are fighting for working class people. Because
      if you are fighting for working class people, you are going to become enemy number
      one to the Democrats and Republicans. There is absolutely no universe where you
      will not have a fight on your hands and let alone run unopposed.


      I mean, in our case, I won all of my four elections on the city council, but every
      subsequent election, the ruling class, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, corporate landlords,
      the Democratic Party, they fought more viciously than they did against me in the
      previous election. In 2019, the most prominent progressive, quote unquote, progressive
      Democrats, they, Latina women, progressive Democrats, they ran, openly ran a candidate
      against me saying, Oh, we agree with her, but she’s just not nice. We need a nice
      guy or whatever. And we defeated them. We defeated Amazon that year.


      And then again, in 2021, my last election, that was not even a scheduled election.
      It was a recall attempt against me by corporate landlords, by Trumpian billionaires,
      and the Democratic Party, and we defeated them also. So it doesn’t reveal everything,
      but it is a rule of thumb. It’s a barometer.


      If your every subsequent election is not a bigger fight than before, then you
      haven’t become a threat to the ruling class. And if you haven’t become a threat
      to the ruling class, then you’re not winning for the working class. You may be
      winning your own elections, but not for the working class.


      Chris Hedges


      Well, they’re clearly going to go after him. I mean, look what they did to you
      as a city council member. He’s running for the mayor of New York [City]. And I
      want to talk about maybe the three entities that will try and take him down. Let’s
      begin first with the Zionists. They aren’t going to take this lightly. He has
      been very courageous about standing with the Palestinians.


      Then let’s talk about the Democratic Party and then let’s talk about the billionaire
      class. These are formidable opponents and the money that will pour into any campaign
      to bring him down will be staggering. It already was, I mean, I think Como got
      $22 million or $25 million. I think Mamdani raised about a million. But those
      numbers will, in terms of funding opposition, will jump exponentially.


      Let’s first start with the Zionists because I did see his victory as essentially
      puncturing that monolithic, especially in New York City, that monolithic power
      that the Zionists have.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, absolutely. I mean, this is a devastating blow actually to the Zionist lobby.
      And the specific thing, I like the choice of words that you said, you said puncturing.
      I think that is an important thing to note because for a long time, it has seemed
      to everyone that it is impossible to defeat the Zionist lobby. We saw what happened
      with Jamaal Bowman, where it was in the Democratic primary that the Zionist lobby
      and AIPAC specifically, poured just unprecedented millions and millions of dollars
      to defeat him.


      And there’s been this idea, they’ve sort of fueled this idea that the Zionist
      lobby and AIPAC and other organizations like that, that they are impervious to
      any opposition from the anti-war movement and that you just have to accept it.
      You just have to accept it. And especially in the Democratic and Republican parties,
      I mean, obviously the Republican party is openly anti-worker, pro-war, they don’t
      even make any bones about it.


      The main challenge as far as working class consciousness is concerned is exposing
      what the Democratic party actually stands for. And the Democratic party is much
      more exposed now than it was before. I mean, the approval ratings are in the toilet.
      The genocide started under Biden. You know, this was a genocidal president with
      a genocidal vice president. So both the candidates in the Democratic primary last
      year were, or from the Democratic party were genocidal candidates running against
      Trump, who’s also warmongering and genocidal.


      So that was the choice, false choice between genocidal and genocidal. That’s the
      kind of realm that we have been operating in. We also saw AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]
      go to the DNC floor and lie through her teeth saying that Kamala Harris was working
      tirelessly for a ceasefire, which we know is complete fabrication.


      Chris Hedges


      I just want to interrupt you when you talked about the disease of careerism. She’s
      kind of the poster child.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, AOC is a poster child for careerism that’s absolutely accurate and that is
      why it is important for us to talk about, you know, have a serious conversation
      about what will it take to win any of these victories in New York City, let alone
      ending the genocide, which is a far harder thing to do.


      Ending the genocide will take ending all US military funding to the Israeli state,
      which if you think about that demand, this is the demand that we are calling for
      in our congressional campaign, that demand pits you directly, directly against
      all of US and Western imperialism. I mean, these are powerful, powerful dystopian
      forces.


      It pits you against multi-billionaires like [Palantir CEO] Alexander Karp, who,
      if you’ve heard him speak, they delight, they positively delight in the mass slaughter
      of Palestinians. I mean, this is happening at another level. In fact, what’s happening
      right now in the Israeli state is at another level.


      So there is a feeling that, for ordinary people, I’m against a genocide, but I
      don’t know what to do because these are just too powerful of an entities, group
      of entities to go up against. So I think that puncturing that idea has been crucial.
      And then I think in order to actually push forward on these demands, then it is
      going to be really that’s where the rubber hits the road, so to say.


      Because from now until the general election of the mayoral election, it’s a question,
      which way will Mamdani move? And I would say that, you know, one thing he has
      going for him is that the Republican opponent is really weak from what I understand.
      Curtis Sliwa, I mean, he’s not like, he’s some credible opponent.


      Chris Hedges


      No, he’s not a credible opponent. They’ll fund Adams, they’ll fund Cuomo, or Ackman
      says he has an unnamed candidate he wants to fund, although, I wonder if an Ackman
      puppet is going to do particularly well. I don’t know.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yeah, I mean, of course, in war and elections, it is foolish to say the last word
      on predictions, as you and I both know. However, I think it is important to note
      that one thing that Mamdani has going for him is that both these Democratic Party
      [candidates] are now, they’re going to run as not Democrats, as whatever, something
      else.


      But regardless, Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo, both figures of the Democratic Party
      are so deeply discredited that the chances for Mamdani to actually win are pretty
      strong. The question will be what he does between now and the general election.
      If he not only does not relent on his demands, which he doesn’t seem to be doing,
      I mean, even now he’s relentlessly going for his demands, which is actually a
      very positive thing that I really appreciate that he is making, he’s not shying
      away from the demands for even a second. And he is relentless about them.


      So he needs to keep doing that but in addition to that, I think he needs to, which
      I don’t expect that he will, but I’m just saying what he needs to do in order
      to win, not so much to win the election. That’s my point. I’m trying to disentangle
      the question between winning the election for himself and winning the demands
      that he’s running on.


      Those are two separate questions to some degree because there’s just a favorable
      electoral calculus right now that he’s facing where he could possibly win even
      if he started sliding on his demands, maybe, I don’t know. But it’s certainly
      not the kind of difficult situation that we were facing. But as far as setting
      the stage, as far as using his election campaign for setting the stage to win
      any of these demands, that’s the most paramount question.


      And for that, I’m strongly convinced that he needs to move away from this talking
      point of Oh, billionaires will also love a city with a rent freeze and I’m looking
      forward to working with Kathy Hochul. Moving away from that to saying, look, the
      Democratic Party establishment itself, the Democratic Party itself is opposed
      to the things that I’m calling for. And that’s why I need working people to join
      me, rather than continually bringing up this idea that it’s all about discussions
      and meetings with the powers that be, and I’ll talk to the governor, and I’ll
      talk to the billionaire.


      All this emphasis on the halls of power, instead his talking point should be,
      and we’re calling for a rally on such and such date. I want working people to
      show up. I want Black, white, Latino, Asian, all of you to show up because working
      class people need to fight together. Let’s call for a march for $30 an hour. Let’s
      march around city hall, know, that type of thing, or march outside Bill Ackman’s
      house, I mean, presumably he lives somewhere in Manhattan, something like that.
      March outside Trump Tower. Let’s call big rallies again in Trump Tower.


      And it’s not only that, it’s also for him to say openly, you know, Governor Kathy
      Hochul, she’s selling out workers. She said she does not want any taxes on the
      rich. Do you agree? You know, telling working people, don’t put any faith in Kathy
      Hochul. Don’t put any faith in any of these Democrats.


      Chuck Schumer, he has blood on his hands. Chuck Schumer has blood on his hands.
      Hakeem Jeffries has blood on his hands. Ritchie Torres has blood on his hands.
      That’s the kind of language, I mean, we don’t use this language as Marxists incidentally
      just because, Oh emotions are running high. It’s not like that. It’s about clarifying
      to the working class what is the character of capitalism and its warmongering
      representatives, warmongering anti-worker, anti-union representatives and how
      do you fight against them.


      Those are two very key tasks for revolutionaries. And I think that’s a difference
      between how most what I would call reformist candidates or reformist leaders act
      and how a revolutionary socialist like myself acts where we start by clarifying
      the nature of capitalism itself that is part of revolutionary politics. But ironically,
      Chris, revolutionary politics also makes you the best fighter to win the biggest
      possible reforms because once you understand the class nature of capitalism and
      you understand how working people need to be mobilized, that is what empowers
      your side to go up against all of these forces.


      And that’s what will be needed. For example, like you said, we started with the
      Zionists. You correctly said the Zionists are not going to rest on this. They’re
      not going to say, we give up, he won the primary. No, they’re going to do everything
      in their power to try and defeat him. It’s important that he doesn’t waffle on
      the things that he has already said, Mamdani, and also he needs to go much farther
      along the lines of whatever’s saying.


      Chris Hedges


      Well, he needs to take a lesson from Jeremy Corbyn. These are not people who,
      number one, can be placated or, number two, will not, no matter what you say,
      viciously attempt to bring you down. I want you to talk about what he can expect.
      You experienced constant campaigns to deceit you from the city council.


      He’s running for a much more powerful position. What can he expect from the Zionists?
      What can he expect from the Democratic Party hierarchy and what can you expect
      from the billionaire class? They’ve already announced war, in essence.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, they have declared war against him, and that is why he needs to declare war
      back at them, not try to hug them to death. Part of what we experienced here was
      obviously, if you look at the talking points that big business had against our
      15 Now movement and against the Amazon tax movement, which also you mentioned,
      which raises hundreds of millions of dollars every year for affordable housing,
      including a specific chunk of that money reserved for Black working class and
      poor housing in this historically black neighborhood, which I live in actually,
      which has been denuded of its Black population because of the skyrocketing rents.


      One of the things that they did to discredit all of these demands was to just
      pound the working class on network TV with all kinds of economic falsehoods like,
      like this is just going to be economic apocalypse, you know, $15 an hour will
      shut down all businesses, all of that. So I think the first thing we had to do
      to combat that was relentless political education about how all of this is absolutely
      false.


      What we said was two things. One is we said that all of the studies on minimum
      wage increases have shown and even big minimum wage increases have shown is that
      there’s no business that has actually been shut down because of that. Small businesses
      shut down because of other reasons, the pattern reason being that commercial rent
      is so high that most storefront businesses can’t afford in big cities like Seattle
      and New York City.


      But we also said that if indeed that were true, if indeed they were right, that
      the system is so fragile that by lifting 100,000 workers in Seattle out of poverty,
      just lifting them above, it’s nothing lavish, it’s lifting them above absolute
      dire conditions, is going to collapse the system, then why on Earth are we even
      defending the system in the first place? See, that’s how we posed it. And that
      really helped people understand that, one, that they are completely lying to you,
      but also secondly, even if they weren’t, we still need to fight for better conditions
      because why on Earth are we defending a system that can’t let us have even a modicum
      of dignity in our living standards?


      I mean, that’s part of what they will face. The other thing that will come very
      likely is the kind of red baiting and identity politics that we experienced here.
      So a very, very important example of this is when we were fighting for the Amazon
      tax. We launched the Tax Amazon movement alongside my inauguration after my 2019
      reelection. And it was really important strategic timing because like I said before,
      the 2019 election was a complete pushback against Jeff Bezos and Amazon because
      Amazon specifically and very openly spent millions of dollars trying to defeat
      me and also other progressives, but mainly me because they knew our office was
      the driving force of the whole left wing and working class political agenda.


      And they knew that if I was out, the Democrats wouldn’t do crap for the working
      class. And so in 2020, January, when I was being inaugurated, I turned my inauguration
      into the launch of the Tax Amazon movement. And then you remember that was 2020.
      So a few months later, COVID happened, and then the George Floyd rebellion began.
      At that time, the Democratic Party unleashed this whole group of Black what I
      would call misleaders, Black misleaders, to go around at these protests saying,
      you should not support Kshama Sawant, you should not support the Amazon tax because
      that’s not a Black issue.


      They tried to disrupt many of the rallies that we were holding in solidarity with
      the Black Lives Matter movement saying, you should be talking about Black issues
      and furthermore, you’re not Black so you don’t get to have this platform. And
      we refused to accept that gatekeeping.


      There were many other leaders in who were supporting the tax Amazon movement,
      who immediately barked at that and said, we should not even have our table here
      at this protest because we’re just white allies, we don’t have the right to speak,
      only Black people have the right to speak.


      We absolutely refused to bend to this just corrosiveness of identity politics.
      And we insisted on looking at things from a class lens. And we said that actually,
      these Black misleaders should be utterly ashamed of themselves because by obstructing
      the tax Amazon movement, they are actually hostile to the interests of Black working
      class and poor people because if there’s anybody who needs affordable housing
      the most, it is the Black working class. And the Amazon tax has disproportionately
      benefited the Black working class and poor people.


      So rather than accepting their just destructive gatekeeping, we said, we’re going
      to go directly to Black working people at the protest. And it was phenomenal.
      The support we got for the Amazon tax demand was sky high. The clipboards were
      practically flying out of our hands with people saying, fuck yeah, I want to tax
      Amazon. I’m going to sign that. And it’s hundreds, thousands of people showing
      up to our democratically organized Tax Amazon action conferences. That is what
      put pressure on the Democratic party.


      You know, first they were vicious towards it. And then I suddenly started getting
      friendly phone calls from these progressive Latina Democrats saying you know that
      thing you were talking about you know I’m very interested in that and then we
      won. That is what it takes. I think that in terms of how it plays out in New York
      City, I think it will very much depend on what kind of approach Mamdani takes.
      I mean how much they attack his demands will depend on how much he’s willing to
      fight for it and being willing to fight for it means mobilizing working class
      people. So I think that will be crucial.


      Chris Hedges


      What does this mean in the age of Trump? Trump, of course, immediately went after
      him. I think you and I, for many, many years, have argued that a party or a political
      movement that is focused on social inequality and the betrayal of the working
      class by the Democratic Party could succeed. Is this the rise of a kind of counterweight
      to Trumpian authoritarianism and proto-fascism or not?


      Kshama Sawant


      I think the, and as you said, you alluded to our past discussions, we’ve talked
      about what it will take to defeat Trumpism and right-wing populism, and it’s not
      only Trump, it’s the Trumpism phenomenon. And it will take working class solidarity
      around class-based demands to defeat the ideas of the right-wing, and it will
      take us to recognizing where the origin of any traction, any credence to right-wing
      ideas.


      And that comes from the complete failure of and betrayals by the Democratic Party.
      But it’s not only the Democratic Party. We have to talk about the labor leadership
      as well, which has betrayed the interests of the working class, obviously their
      own members, by being tied at the hip to the Democratic Party, even in the face
      of a genocide. That needs to be mentioned as well.


      The question is if genocide is not a line you’re not willing to cross as a working-class
      leader, then there is no line you’re not willing to cross as a working-class leader.
      I think that point needs to be made. So many of these unions, their leaderships
      have passed ceasefire resolutions, but those ceasefire resolutions mean little
      if then the leaderships turn around and support the parties of genocide themselves.


      I mean, Shawn Fain famously went on the DNC floor, Shawn Fain being the president
      of UAW [United Auto Workers], which is one of the unions that has supported Mamdani
      to its credit and also has passed a ceasefire resolution. But at the end of the
      day, how much does that amount to if you’re then turning around and still supporting
      the candidates and the parties of genocide? And I think that it is also revealing
      who Mamdani holds as his role models. I think you talked about how AOC is the
      poster child for careerism. I think that’s very important to note because, and
      Bernie Sanders was not exactly like her, I think he’s well-intentioned, it’s just
      his political analysis is extremely flawed.


      And he thinks that now completely capitulating to the Democratic Party and to
      the genocide and to attacks on workers like the Democrats blocking and breaking
      the railroad workers strike in 2022, which AOC was part of, that that’s the best
      that the working class can get.


      But regardless of their individual differences, the truth about AOC and Bernie
      Sanders is that both of them have campaigned, I mean, Bernie Sanders much more
      relentlessly, but AOC did initially campaign on Medicare for All, $15 an hour
      minimum wage and a Green New Deal.


      And like I said, I commend Mamdani for being relentless about those demands. But
      Bernie Sanders has also been relentless about those demands. He still is talking
      about, I mean, he’s less relentless than before because he doesn’t want to embarrass
      the Democrats, which is itself rotten. However, the point is that they both have
      campaigned on these demands. And not a thing, not a thing has been won for the
      working class.


      The metric cannot be, are they talking about those demands? The metric has to
      be, what have they won? In the last five, six years, what have they done? And
      what has happened to working class agendas in that interim? Bernie Sanders’ two
      campaigns were completely destroyed by the Democratic Party.


      And last year, the Democratic Party showed that they would much rather allow somebody
      who they call a fascist and an existential threat, allow that person to be elected
      than allow even a shadow of working-class agenda to enter their purview. Like
      they did not even want Kamala Harris to even lie. I mean just fucking lie that
      okay I’m going to do something about the genocide or maybe I’ll talk about 15
      [dollars minimum wage]. If she had done a little bit of murmuring towards the
      working class and she would have tipped the scales very likely. They were not
      even willing to do that. Why?


      Because they don’t want to create expectations among working class people that
      they will do anything at all for them. Because they want to hold the line. They
      are the billionaire class representatives, just like the Republicans are. And
      they don’t want to create any such idea that, Oh, the working class can expect
      anything from them. So what they want to do is they want the working class to
      be permanently attached to them and keep voting them in.


      But they want to do it on the basis of not doing anything for the working class.
      And that contradiction, that conundrum is what has led them to this sorry state
      where they have the lowest approval ratings historically. But at the same time,
      if we don’t provide an alternative to them, then they’re probably going to make
      gains in the midterm elections because people are also angry at Trump. And Trump
      is no alternative either.


      And so for defeating the right wing, we will need a break from the Democratic
      Party. And that might sound like a contradiction in terms of that. That’s precisely
      what we need because it is the Democratic Party that has given you Donald Trump.
      The Democratic Party are the best builders of Trumpism. And in order to destroy
      Trumpism, you need to destroy the Democratic Party. And that comes first with
      breaking your ties with the Democratic Party.


      And here’s what I have to say whom Mamdani has listed as his role models is a
      very telling story to me. Mamdani has said that he is very inspired by, I mean,
      I’m not quoting him. I’m paraphrasing what he said. He’s very inspired by Boston
      governor Michelle Wu. Michelle Wu ran on housing demands. She also brought them
      up relentlessly. She talked about rent control relentlessly. What has she done
      after she got into office? Completely betray working class renters. I mean, just
      completely.


      He has also said that former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was the best in
      his, Mamdani’s, lifetime. You know what? Among other attacks on unions and workers,
      Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo together in 2018 upheld the Taylor Law
      of New York, which has a draconian strike ban on public sector unions. According
      to an article in DSA-aligned publication, Jacobin, this New York strike ban, this
      is a quote, makes red state anti-strike laws look like pieces of fluff.


      And keep in mind, 2018 was the year of the historic public school teacher strikes
      in red states, starting with West Virginia. The Jacobin article also says, the
      next time a new Republican governor works up the nerve to enforce anti-strike
      laws against public workers, they’ll have the satisfaction of piggybacking on
      those Democratic friends of labor — Cuomo and de Blasio.


      So, I mean, so he has stated AOC, Bernie Sanders, Michelle Wu, and de Blasio all
      as his inspirations, and they all have a record of selling out working class people.
      One last thing that he has said, he has also repeatedly cited and effusively praised
      former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a Republican mayor who
      was supported at the time in 1941, during the war, he was running for reelection
      and he was supported by the rotten Stalinists.


      And they supported him against Trotskyist James Cannon. He was a Trotskyist at
      the time, who ran on a pro-worker anti-war platform. And one of the things LaGuardia
      did was brutally go after striking transport workers, basically telling them that
      the country is at war. So municipal workers don’t have the right to go on strike.
      So your viewers can reach their own conclusions about what it means when somebody
      ties themselves so closely to a whole string of people who have a track record
      of having sold out workers.


      Chris Hedges


      Let’s just close by talking about your own campaign. Where are you? What are you
      up against? You mentioned at the beginning of the interview a little bit about
      who you’re running against.


      Kshama Sawant


      Yes, we’re running for US Congress from Washington state’s ninth congressional
      district, which includes a part of Seattle and also many other neighboring cities
      where there are lots of rich people. There’s lots of billionaires, but there’s
      also lots of working class people, lots of refugees. It’s a majority minority
      district. The district has a lot of people who have personally faced losses, family
      losses in Gaza through the genocide.


      There are many East African and East Asian and South Asian working class people
      who live here, many of whom are struggling to get by. And we are running against
      Adam Smith, who has been in Congress for nearly 30 years. And he, as I said before,
      has repeatedly voted to send tens of billions of dollars of funding to the Israeli
      military throughout the genocide.


      That’s not the first time, he has voted to send money to Israel over and over
      during his nearly 30 year career. But especially notable is that he has repeatedly
      voted to fund the genocide. And he is, not surprisingly, he is a favorite of the
      military contractors. We know that both Democratic and Republican parties are
      warmongering parties. They have been purveyors of endless brutal war throughout
      their history and Adam Smith is one of the generals among the warhawks.


      He is not a foot soldier. He has never met a war that he didn’t like. He has demonized
      anti-genocide activists as totalitarian, as extremists, as left-wing fascists.
      He has called for them to be arrested. He also holds the shameful distinction
      of being one of only five sitting Democratic Congress members who voted for the
      Iraq war, as I said, in 2002.


      He supported the wars in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and the
      current bloody inter-imperialist proxy war in Ukraine. He has been bankrolled
      for three decades by weapons industry profiteers, such as Lockheed Martin, General
      Dynamics, and Palantir, as I mentioned earlier. And he’s a darling of AIPAC and
      the Zionist lobby.


      As I said, AIPAC was his biggest funder last year. Just to contrast between our
      campaign and him, in the summer of 2014, that was my second year on the city council,
      I used my city council position not only to attend protests against Israel’s indiscriminate
      bombardment of Gaza at the time, but also to draft a public letter calling for
      an end to all US military aid to Israel and the brutal settlements in Palestinian
      territories and the occupation.


      During that same time that I was doing that, Adam Smith was enthusiastically backing
      Israel’s Iron Dome system, which as we know is one of the key components in enabling
      the Israeli state slaughter apparatus against the Palestinian people. And in the
      final days of my decade in City Hall in October and November of 2023, I was fighting
      to win.


      And we did win, despite the opposition of the Democrats, the second at the time
      and the strongest city council resolution calling for a ceasefire and an end to
      all US military aid to Israel. At that same moment, Smith was part of Biden’s
      cabal that was monstrously insisting on over $100 billion of military funding
      for not just Israel, but also for Ukraine, instead of funding the needs of the
      cost of living crisis here, faced by working people here.


      And he’s also just one of the most thoroughly corporate, pro-corporate politicians.
      And in fact, our race against Adam Smith goes to your other question as well,
      is what will it take to defeat the right wing? It will take destroying the Democratic
      Party, and that begins also, as I said, defeating Congress members like Adam Smith
      because during the George W. Bush presidency, when the nation was, of course,
      going rightward because of the rightward push by the Bush presidency, Smith, instead
      of advising that the Democrats should be more pro-working class, less pro-war,
      his advice to Democrats was to reduce the contrast between themselves and the
      Republicans.


      And at that time, he said the Democratic Party should consider privatizing Medicare.
      So it’s no surprise there that notorious corporations like UnitedHealthcare, which
      ferociously oppose Medicare for All, have also donated to Smith’s campaign. He
      also voted in favor of the bailout of big banks in 2008 while ordinary people
      were left to rot. So this is his track record.


      We have our track record from the city council, from the decade on the city council,
      having won historic victories for the working class. This congressional campaign,
      just like all of our election campaigns, is not in service of my personal political
      career. It is a vehicle to build movements and the movements we are specifically
      focusing on through our congressional campaign is to end the genocide, end the
      US military funding, end the occupation.


      And we’re also calling for stop stopping all the deportations and shutting down
      the detention centers. And we are also fighting for free health care for all funded
      by taxing the rich and for rent control nationally. In fact, we are pairing the
      congressional campaign with a Seattle citywide ballot initiative campaign for
      free healthcare for all, funded by increasing the Amazon tax that we’ve already
      won, increasing it to $5 billion.


      So this is a campaign for all working people who want to win big victories for
      ourselves, send a stinging message to the ruling class, to the Zionist lobby.
      So nationally, whoever is listening, whoever is watching this, you need to get
      involved in this campaign. We actually, you know something exciting is that we
      had a target of raising 100,000 working class donations within the first month
      of our campaign.


      We smashed that target in the first three weeks. And within the first month of
      our campaign, we have more than a thousand separate donors. That is more donors
      than Adam Smith had last year in his entire election. He needs fewer donors because
      he has all this warmongering and pro-billionaire PACs that are funding his campaigns.


      We are a working-class campaign and as I’ve done every single year of my city
      council office, if I’m elected to Congress, I will take home only the average
      workers wage and donate the rest after taxes to building strike actions for the
      union movement and for building the anti-war movement.

      The damage assessment in Israel from Iran’s counterattack against Tel Aviv’s unprovoked
      aggression against Iran last month is coming in.


      Despite strenuous efforts by Israeli authorities to suppress news from bomb sites,
      the extent of the destruction suffered by Israel is now being revealed.


      The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Monday that the vaunted Israeli air defense
      system, headlined by the so-called Iron Dome, failed to prevent a significant
      inundation of Iranian ordnance.


      Some single ballistic missiles landing on Israeli streets damaged a wide area
      of surrounding buildings purely from the vibrations of the impact, the newspaper
      reported.


      “Throughout Israel, between the shock waves and the direct impact of the heavy
      Iranian missiles, the destruction spread out over hundreds of meters,” Haaretz
      said. “Thousands of houses and buildings have been damaged, some severely, with
      exterior and interior walls collapsing.”


      “The common denominator is the person uprooted from his or her home, who will
      feel the shock for years,” the paper said. It further reported:


      “In Tel Aviv, 480 buildings have been damaged, many of them badly, at five separate
      sites. In Ramat Gan, it’s 237 buildings at three sites, about 10 badly. In another
      Tel Aviv suburb, Bat Yam, 78 buildings were damaged by one hit; 22 will have to
      be razed. The Israel Tax Authority has received applications for financial assistance
      for nearly 33,000 damaged structures. Another 4,450 files have been opened for
      the loss of belongings and equipment, and another 4,119 for damaged vehicles”.


      The Iranian attacks killed 29 Israeli civilians and, according to a Haaretz map,
      96 buildings were severely damaged.


      By contrast, in the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 42 Scud missiles at Tel Aviv and
      Haifa, killing two Israelis and damaging 4,100 buildings, destroying 28.


      The Haaretz report deals only with civilian buildings. Iran also hit a number
      of Israeli military bases, including Kirya and Camp Moshe Dayan in Tel Aviv; as
      well as the BAZAN oil refinery in Haifa, causing significant damage; and the Weizmann
      Institute of Science in Rehovot, destroying two buildings.

      As the dust settles on the “12 Day War”, it is ever-clearer that the conflict
      was a crushing defeat for Israel and the US. In retrospect, the Zionist entity’s
      sole success was a wave of assassinations in the conflict’s first hours. A fawning
      June 19th Financial Times report hinted cutting-edge technology drawing together
      diverse data and intelligence sources was responsible. This raises the obvious
      question of whether Tel Aviv was assisted in its murderous spree by notorious
      private spying giant Palantir.


      An avowedly pro-Israel tech giant founded by Donald Trump confidante and ardent
      Zionist Peter Thiel, which reportedly provides artificial intelligence tech supporting
      Tel Aviv’s genocide in Gaza, Palantir’s tendrils extend typically unseen into
      almost every conceivable sphere of public and private life across the West. Moreover,
      the firm – launched with seed funding from CIA venture capital wing In-Q-Tel –
      has long-played a pivotal but barely acknowledged role in the International Atomic
      Energy Agency’s monitoring of Tehran’s nuclear research.


      The interpretation Palantir was one way or another involved in Israel’s illegal
      “preemptive” war of aggression against Tehran is amply reinforced by the release
      of sensitive Israeli documents by Iran’s intelligence ministry. These files indicate
      the IAEA previously provided Israeli intelligence with the names of several Iranian
      nuclear scientists, who were subsequently assassinated. Additionally, current
      Association chief Rafael Grossi enjoys a close, long-running, clandestine relationship
      with Israeli officials. Subsequent disclosures could expose the IAEA’s dark alliance
      with Palantir.


      ‘Fishing Expedition’


      In July 2015, the Obama administration inked the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
      with Tehran. Under its auspices, in return for sanctions relief, the IAEA was
      granted unimpeded access to Iran’s nuclear facilities, to ensure the Islamic Republic
      was not developing nuclear weapons. Vast amounts of information on and within
      the sites, including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents
      were collected along the way. The Association consistently found Iran was stringently
      adhering to the JCPOA’s terms.


      Following Trump’s first inauguration however, the JCPOA began to come apart at
      the seams. In October 2017, he refused to certify Iran’s compliance with its obligations
      on bogus grounds, and began threatening to tear up the agreement outright and
      reimpose sanctions. The next March, then-IAEA director general Yukiya Amano sounded
      alarm over this prospect, claiming the JCPOA had produced “the world’s most robust
      [nuclear] verification regime” in Iran, and its cessation would represent a “great
      loss”. He went on to boast of how Association inspectors:


      “Now spend 3,000 calendar days per year on the ground in Iran. We have installed
      some 2,000 tamper-proof seals on nuclear material and equipment. We have carried
      out more than 60 complementary accesses [unannounced inspections] and visited
      more than 190 buildings…We collect and analyse hundreds of thousands of images
      captured daily by our sophisticated surveillance cameras…about half of the total
      number of such images that we collect throughout the world. We collect over one
      million pieces of open source information each month.”


      Amano added IAEA activities in Tehran were “supported by state-of-the-art technology,
      including data collecting and processing systems.” Unmentioned was that these
      innovative resources were provided by Palantir. The company’s central role in
      scrutinizing Iran’s nuclear compliance and intimate handshake with the IAEA was
      revealed two months later by Bloomberg, mere days before the Trump administration
      shredded the Agreement and launched a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.
      Former US energy secretary Ernest Moniz effusively praised Palantir’s contribution:


      “We have a completely unique and unparalleled intrusive verification regime that
      was not there before the agreement.”


      A tool dubbed Mosaic served as “the analytical core” and “platform of choice”
      for the IAEA’s verification mission in Iran. The software helped the Association
      “plan and justify unscheduled probes”, collating and processing data from around
      400 million “digital objects” globally, “including social media feeds and satellite
      photographs.” Mosaic was also charged with examining en-masse documents not only
      collected by the IAEA, but tens of thousands of sensitive files stolen by Mossad
      from Tehran.


      Bloomberg quoted Ali Vaez, International Crisis Group’s Iran Project director,
      as expressing concern about Mosaic analysing “dirty” data obtained by Mossad,
      “which prides itself on deception.” After all, “even a small amount of false information
      could trigger a flurry of unnecessary snap inspections and derail an agreement
      that took years to reach.” The broader the terms of Palantir’s work with the IAEA,
      the more the mission “appears as a fishing expedition,” Vaez fretted, suggesting
      Iran could become less willing “to open its doors to inspectors.”


      Vaez’s comments were eerily prophetic. Recent disclosures of intensive collusion
      between the IAEA and Zionist entity authorities, and the resultant prospect Association
      inspections assisted Israeli and US attacks on Tehran, prompted Iranian lawmakers
      to unanimously pass legislation indefinitely suspending cooperation with the Association
      on June 25th. It is unlikely IAEA inspectors will ever be permitted to tread on
      the Islamic Republic’s territory again. But Bloomberg highlighted a number of
      other anxieties that have only gained in gravity in light of recent events.


      ‘False Assumption’


      For one, the outlet recorded how Palantir’s IAEA role granted the company “access
      to information that governments don’t,” while questioning whether “an international
      agency known for its independence” could truly remain neutral and objective given
      “Thiel’s close personal ties to Trump.” Furthermore, Bloomberg noted the Association’s
      Palantir-provided “enhanced investigative abilities” had “raised concern that
      the IAEA may overstep the boundary between nuclear monitoring and intelligence-gathering,”
      transforming its inspectors into unwitting “potential cyber sleuths.”


      Such fears were only exacerbated by Mosaic being based upon Palantir’s highly
      controversial “predictive-policing software”. For the IAEA, this capability turned
      “databases of classified information into maps” helping “inspectors visualize
      ties between the people, places and material involved in nuclear activities” in
      Tehran. The risk of innocent Iranian civilians being made targets for surveillance,
      harassment, or even assassination created by erroneous data being fed into and/or
      pumped out by Mosaic is gargantuan.


      Bloomberg quoted a representative of a British company “that advises governments
      on verification issues” as saying “predictive-analysis” systems were extremely
      vulnerable to such corruption, “either by accident or design.” He noted, “you
      will generate a false return if you add a false assumption into the system…[and]
      end up convincing yourself that shadows are real.” Of course, a dangerous “false
      assumption” lay at the very core of the IAEA’s inspection mission in Iran – namely,
      that Tehran was developing nukes in the first place.


      The Islamic Republic has for decades consistently denied any suggestion it harbours
      ambitions to possess nuclear weapons. Her denials were corroborated by a November
      2007 US National Intelligence Estimate expressing “high confidence that in fall
      2003, Tehran halted” any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment
      remained unchanged for several years, and was reportedly shared by Mossad. As
      Bloomberg recorded, come May 2018 the IAEA had “certified Iran’s work 10 times.”


      In March 2025, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified to Congress
      that Iran had not restarted the nuclear weapons program it halted in 2003. On
      June 17th, with the 12 Day War well-underway, IAEA chief Grossi declared “we did
      not have any proof of a systematic effort” by Tehran “to move into a nuclear weapon.”
      Yet, Israel justified its attacks based on an intelligence dossier that concluded
      the Islamic Republic had in fact reached the “point of no return” in acquiring
      nukes.


      That dodgy dossier depended in no small part on the findings of a May IAEA report.
      The document provided no new information – its dubious charges related “to activities
      dating back decades” at three sites where purportedly, until the early 2000s,
      “undeclared nuclear material” was handled. If this report was analysed by Palantir’s
      “predictive-analysis” systems, it is all but inevitable false results and connections
      would’ve been created, in turn influencing the Zionist entity’s targets and strategy.


      One of the “predictive policing” tools innovated by Palantir guiding Mosaic’s
      operations is Gotham, which is used by an uncertain number of Western law enforcement
      agencies. Leaked documents on the resource show it collects an extraordinary volume
      of data on entire populations – whether they are law-abiding, suspected of having
      committed a crime, or simply connected to individuals accused of wrongdoing. This
      includes sex, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots,
      surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, and identifying
      features such as tattoos.


      Slide from leaked Gotham training presentation


      In October 2024, a major Norwegian asset manager divested from Palantir due to
      the company offering “AI-based predictive policing systems”, aiding the Zionist
      entity’s mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. These systems
      are designed “to identify individuals who are likely to launch ‘lone wolf terrorist’
      attacks, facilitating their arrests preemptively before the strikes that it is
      projected they would carry out.” Their deployment results in countless Palestinians
      languishing in Israeli dungeons without charge or trial.


      If Mosaic informed the Zionist entity’s strategy during the 12 Day War, that may
      account for why individuals with no connection whatsoever to Iran’s civilian nuclear
      program were directly targeted for assassination. This includes Majid Tajan Jari,
      a prominent professor in the field of AI locally, slain in an Israeli strike on
      a residential building in Tehran on June 16th. Yet, reliance on faulty or false
      information collated by Mosaic would simultaneously explain the conflict ending
      in embarrassing defeat for Israel, and victory for Tehran.

    paragraph_summary: The article by Kit Klarenberg discusses the implications of the
      recent "12 Day War," portraying it as a significant defeat for Israel and the
      U.S., with a focus on the role of Palantir, a tech company founded by Peter Thiel.
      It suggests that Palantir's advanced data analytics technology may have facilitated

      piece highlights concerns about the company's involvement with the International
      Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in monitoring Iran's nuclear activities, suggesting
      that this relationship may have compromised the IAEA's neutrality and led to intelligence-gathering
      that could support Israeli military actions. The article raises alarms about the
      potential misuse of data and predictive policing technologies, arguing that reliance
      on flawed information could have dire consequences, including wrongful targeting
      and increased tensions between Iran and Israel. Overall, it critiques the intertwining
      of technology, intelligence, and military strategy in contemporary conflicts,
      emphasizing the need for independent journalism to uncover these complex dynamics.

      The private jet lobby is pushing hard for a massive tax break for billionaires
      and centi-millionaires that use the most polluting form of transportation on the
      planet.


      Legislation rapidly moving through Congress, the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”
      — really a Big Ugly Grift (BUG) — includes a massive tax subsidy for private jet
      buyers. Instead of corporations deducting the purchase of their jets over several
      years of their useful life, the BUG includes 100 percent “bonus depreciation”
      in the year of purchase.


      For example, a corporation purchasing a $50 million private jet could potentially
      deduct the entire $50 million from their taxes in the year of the purchase, rather
      than spreading the deduction over many years. This amounts to a massive taxpayer
      subsidy, as ordinary taxpayers pick up the tab for the private jet industry and
      billionaire high flyers.


      From our IPS research on private jets, we know that regular taxpayers and commercial
      air travelers subsidize the high-flying excess of private jet owners. In the U.S.
      private jets use seven percent of the airspace but only contribute 0.6 percent
      of the cost of using it.


      As wealth has concentrated into the vaults of the ultra-wealthy, the demand for
      private jets is surging. Every billionaire appears to need one or two. As a result,
      private jets are one of the largest and fastest growing sources of air and climate
      pollution. In 2023, private jets emitted 19.5 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG)
      emissions, a 25 percent increase over 2013 levels.


      A new study, from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), analyzed
      global private jet pollution and emissions for 2023. They found that private jets,
      which account for about four percent of all global aviation, together emitted
      more GHG than all flights departing from Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport
      in Europe.


      ICCT, the researchers best known for uncovering the Volkswagen Dieselgate scandal,
      have developed the first global mapping of private jet air and climate pollution,
      spatially locating more than 90 percent of private jet activity and emissions
      to airports and countries.


      The study found that private jet activity and emissions are overwhelmingly concentrated
      in the U.S. In 2023, private jets departing U.S. airports accounted for 65 percent
      of flights and 55 percent of all private jet GHG emissions globally. Eighteen
      of the twenty most polluting airports are based in the U.S. That includes Hanscom
      Field outside of Boston, the locus of a huge campaign to block private jet hangar
      expansion.


      Private jet travel originating in Florida and Texas generated more private jet
      operations and emissions than the entire European Union combined, according to
      the ICCT study. A private jet emits about 810 tons of GHGs in a typical year,
      equivalent to 177 passenger cars or nine Class 8 heavy-duty trucks.


      Many private jet flights are short hops, less than 560 miles and two hours, and
      the majority are for recreational purposes, not for business meetings. In France,
      there are proposals to ban short hop flights, especially when other transportation
      options exist.


      Instead of subsidizing private jets through the tax code, we should tax private
      jet fuels to ensure they reflect their real environmental costs. “As wealth inequality
      explodes globally, policymakers have begun to ask why private jet taxes are so
      low,” said Dan Rutherford, co-author of the ICCT report. “Given the slow pace
      of technological progress, it’s reasonable to charge ultrawealthy travelers more
      for their pollution.”


      A tax on jet fuel could generate substantial revenue for high-speed rail and other
      decarbonization priorities. A global private jet fuel tax, modeled after Senator
      Ed Markey’s U.S. private jet fuel tax, could generate $3 trillion a year to offset
      the harms of private jet excess.


      Subsidizing more private jets on a warming planet is reckless and indefensible.
      As Rutherford observes, “Private jets are like the canary in the coal mine here
      for a hyper unequal warming world.” Including tax breaks in the new tax bill reveals
      the pro-billionaire bias of Congress.

    one_sentence_summary: The article criticizes a proposed tax break in Congress that
      would subsidize private jet purchases, highlighting the environmental impact and
      inequity of such legislation, as it disproportionately benefits the ultra-wealthy
      while burdening ordinary taxpayers and contributing to climate change.
    paragraph_summary: The article by Chuck Collins highlights the ongoing push by the
      private jet lobby for significant tax breaks that would primarily benefit billionaires
      and centi-millionaires, allowing them to deduct the full purchase price of private
      jets in the year of acquisition through a provision in the proposed "Big Beautiful
      Bill." This legislation represents a substantial taxpayer subsidy for the private
      jet industry, which contributes disproportionately to greenhouse gas emissions,
      with private jets accounting for a significant share of air pollution despite
      their limited use of airspace. A recent study by the International Council on
      Clean Transportation reveals that private jets emitted 19.5 million tons of greenhouse
      gases in 2023, with the majority of emissions concentrated in the U.S. The article
      argues for a tax on private jet fuels to reflect their environmental costs and
      generate revenue for sustainable transportation initiatives, criticizing the current
      tax breaks as reckless in the context of climate change and growing wealth inequality.

      By Chris Hedges / Original to ScheerPost


      War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese,
      Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations
      and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet
      Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc.,
      Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with
      banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities,
      which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation
      and the genocide of Palestinians.


      The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate
      with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be
      held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption”
      as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant
      supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors
      and private and public institutions profit freely.”


      The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation
      Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility
      of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This
      new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice
      place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and
      unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement
      with Palestinians enables their self-determination.”


      “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable
      for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities,
      including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses
      and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited
      Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and
      even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of
      genocide.”


      In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to
      test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now
      are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.”


      You can see my interview with Albanese here.


      The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery
      required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship,
      livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.”


      The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of
      Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and
      water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by
      “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural
      resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods
      and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.”


      “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at
      least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes.


      Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance
      into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities —
      centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology
      underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked
      or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have
      obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.”


      Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate
      targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously
      used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in
      the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza,
      preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.”


      The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for
      cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools
      powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United
      States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’”


      Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its
      two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel
      Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships
      with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United
      States-based Lockheed Martin.”


      “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet,
      which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and
      domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets
      have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to
      drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure
      more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.”


      “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines
      in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied
      by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter
      jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past
      two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions
      such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired
      automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.”


      Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery
      for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.”


      “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components,
      parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied
      military equipment post-October 2023.”


      There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024
      – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated
      a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially
      producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.”


      At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing
      dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while
      profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the
      occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services,
      from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced
      tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing,
      artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.”


      “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the
      report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus
      spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian
      activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights
      defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance
      technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.”


      IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of
      punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics,
      train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner
      in this current genocide.


      It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military
      and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine
      operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with
      counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance.


      “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the
      Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental
      use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit
      regime of Israel,” the report notes.


      Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police,
      universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating
      its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring
      Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.”


      “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing
      volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report
      reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a
      $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense
      expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.”


      Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access
      to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing,
      decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.”


      The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence
      systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate
      lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature
      of artificial intelligence.”


      There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology
      Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive
      policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction
      and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform,
      which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.”


      Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians
      in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.”


      “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial
      occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment
      from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land,
      demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure.
      Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying
      70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.”


      Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment
      used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive
      wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie.


      “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded
      core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity
      since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing
      Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire
      dollar contract with Israel.”


      “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the
      Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been
      linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through
      exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads.


      “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in
      the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what
      replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading
      materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies
      as if to a regular holiday destination.”


      “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded
      with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population
      in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes.


      These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators
      and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials
      AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from
      the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.”
      The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport
      infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting
      them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.”


      Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli
      and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty
      LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee
      KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller
      Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly
      sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments
      in colonies.”


      Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel
      rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food
      conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank.


      In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy
      (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas
      from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million
      in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per
      cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership
      of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime
      territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.”


      BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude
      oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the
      Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil
      fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil
      between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian
      oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel.
      Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.”


      “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing
      to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation
      and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report
      reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has
      serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration
      of Gaza. ”


      International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through
      the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds.


      “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have
      played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads.
      “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3
      per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel
      funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion
      in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic
      new shekel market.”


      The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas
      and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international
      and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium,
      despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68
      million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO
      ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased
      them.”


      Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects,
      including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions
      abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads.


      “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion
      and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms
      such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries
      for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends
      of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent
      over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including
      some that train extremist settlers.”


      The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and
      institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research
      funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm
      control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023
      — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.”


      You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between
      the university Israeli military here.


      Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel
      could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem.
      These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians
      and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units
      decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held
      accountable.

      By Jessica Corbett / Common Dreams


      Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani made clear on Tuesday
      that he would not be intimidated by Republican U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat
      to arrest him.


      A journalist who falsely described Mamdani—a democratic socialist—as a “communist”
      asked Trump about the candidate’s pledge not to cooperate with U.S. Immigration
      and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents are working to carry out the president’s
      promised mass deportations.


      “Well then, we’ll have to arrest him,” said Trump, a former New Yorker who has
      taken aim at Mamdani since his victory in last Tuesday’s Democratic primary. “Look,
      we don’t need a communist in this country.”


      Q: You message to communist Zohran Mamdani?




      TRUMP: Well then, we''ll have to arrest him pic.twitter.com/3YbylPK2MS — Aaron
      Rupar (@atrupar) July 1, 2025


      Mamdani, who currently serves in the New York State Assembly, was born in Uganda
      to Indian parents and moved to NYC as a child. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen
      in 2018. Throughout his campaign, the 33-year-old has faced numerous Islamophobic
      attacks, and after his primary win, Congressman Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) urged the
      Trump administration to target him with “denaturalization proceedings,” in line
      with a broader effort at the Department of Justice (DOJ).


      Trump said Tuesday that his administration would be watching Mamdani “very carefully.”
      The president, a well-documented liar, added that “a lot of people are saying
      he’s here illegally—you know, we’re gonna look at everything… and ideally he’s
      gonna turn out to be much less than a communist, but right now he’s a communist,
      that’s not a socialist.”


      Trump also blasted Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a supporter
      of Mamdani, and praised the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams, who is seeking another
      term as an Independent. After Trump returned to office in January, the DOJ instructed
      prosecutors to drop federal corruption charges against Adams, triggering widespread
      outrage over the attempted “illegal quid pro quo,” as some critics called it.


      Trump falsely suggests @ZohranKMamdani is in the country "illegally" calls him
      a communist (he''s a Dem socialist) and then then goes on to call @ericadamsfornyc
      a "very good person" who he "helped out a little bit." pic.twitter.com/7tOoULgPek
      — Gloria Pazmino (@GloriaPazmino) July 1, 2025


      Responding to Trump’s remarks in a lengthy statement, Mamdani said Tuesday that
      “the president of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped
      of my citizenship, put in a detention camp, and deported. Not because I have broken
      any law, but because I will refuse to let ICE terrorize our city.”


      “His statements don’t just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt
      to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: If you
      speak up, they will come for you,” Mamdani continued. “We will not accept this
      intimidation.”


      “That Trump included praise for Eric Adams in his authoritarian threats is unsurprising,
      but highlights the urgency of bringing an end to this mayor’s time in City Hall,”
      he asserted, directing attention to the GOP budget bill advanced by the U.S. Senate
      on Tuesday.


      Mamdani said that “at this very moment, when MAGA Republicans are attempting to
      destroy the social safety net, kick millions of New Yorkers off of healthcare,
      and enrich their billionaire donors at the expense of working families, it is
      a scandal that Eric Adams echoes this president’s division, distraction, and hatred.
      Voters will resoundingly reject it in November.”


      In addition to Mamdani and Adams, the general election candidates are Republican
      Curtis Sliwa, Independent Jim Walden, and disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew
      Cuomo, who is now running as an Independent after losing the Democratic primary.
      According to results released Tuesday, Mamdani got 56% of the vote compared to
      Cuomo’s 44%.

    one_sentence_summary: Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani
      vowed to resist intimidation after Donald Trump threatened to arrest him for his
      refusal to cooperate with ICE, framing the threat as an attack on democracy and
      a message to those who speak out against oppression.
    paragraph_summary: Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has
      responded defiantly to threats from former President Donald Trump, who suggested
      Mamdani could be arrested for his refusal to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and
      Customs Enforcement (ICE) and falsely labeled him a "communist." Mamdani, a democratic
      socialist and current New York State Assembly member, condemned Trump's remarks
      as an attack on democracy and a message of intimidation aimed at those who oppose
      the administration's policies. He emphasized the need to stand against such threats,
      particularly in light of ongoing efforts by MAGA Republicans to undermine social
      safety nets and healthcare for working families. Mamdani recently won the Democratic
      primary with 56% of the vote, positioning him against a field that includes former
      Governor Andrew Cuomo and current Mayor Eric Adams, who has been criticized for
      his ties to Trump.

      The Trump administration has approved a new arms deal for Israel that will provide
      the country with $510 million worth of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMS),
      kits that turn bombs into precision-guided weapons, as the US continues to provide
      military aid to support the genocidal war in Gaza.


      According to the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the State
      Department notified Congress of the sale of 3,845 JDAMS for 2,000-pound BLU-109
      bombs and 3,280 JDAMS for 500-pound MK 82 bombs. The deal also includes US “government
      and contractor engineering, logistics, and technical support services; and other
      related elements of logistics and program support.”


      The DSCA said Boeing is the principal contractor for the deal. The notification
      of the potential deal begins a time period when US lawmakers could potentially
      block the sale, but there’s little opposition to US military support for Israel
      within Congress, despite the many war crimes the US is implicated in by providing
      Israel with weapons.


      Fragments of bombs with US-provided JDAM kits have been found at the scene of
      Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that have massacred many civilians. In 2023, Human
      Rights Watch said it identified JDAM fragments that were found in two airstrikes
      on homes in central Gaza that killed 43 civilians, including 19 children, and
      14 women.


      It’s unclear at this point how the deal will be financed, but many arms sales
      to Israel are funded by US military aid, and US assistance to Israel has significantly
      increased since October 7, 2023. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in
      that time, US funding has covered an estimated 70% of Israel’s war-related military
      spending.

      has surged since the escalation of conflict on October 7, 2023. Despite the evident
      implications of U.S. weaponry in civilian casualties during Israeli airstrikes—such
      as those reported by Human Rights Watch—there is minimal opposition in Congress
      to the arms sale, reflecting a strong bipartisan support for military assistance
      to Israel.

      By Norman Solomon / Z Network


      The Supreme Court’s first chief justice, John Jay, would have empathized with
      the billionaires who’ve been freaking out ever since Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic
      primary for mayor of New York last Tuesday. “Those who own the country ought to
      govern it,” Jay insisted. But now, oligarchs accustomed to such governance are
      furious that the nation’s capital of capitalism is in danger of serving people
      instead of megaprofits.


      Meanwhile, among progressives, euphoria is especially fitting because the Mamdani
      campaign’s win was truly a people-powered victory, thanks to active efforts of
      40,000 volunteers. In a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans
      six-to-one, the Democratic nomination would ordinarily be a virtual guarantee
      of winning the general election. But the forces of oligarchy now mobilizing could
      disprove a claim that “Mamdani’s widespread appeal represents the total collapse
      of a Democratic Party establishment.”


      Such a collapse is very far from certain.


      On the surface, Andrew Cuomo’s decision to stay on the fall ballot as an “independent,”
      while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams does likewise, seems to foreshadow splitting
      the anti-Mamdani vote. But Cuomo still has a substantial electoral following.
      And the corrupt Adams – who cut a deal with President Trump to viciously betray
      immigrants and got his criminal indictment thrown out by Trump’s Justice Department
      – has no better ethics than the disgraced former governor Cuomo. Bankrolled by
      wealthy donors, the pair might make some kind of pact, with one of them telling
      his followers to unify behind the other before voting begins this fall.


      In any case, a key context of the upcoming election battle is that hell hath no
      fury like corporate power scorned.


      A social-media screed by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman (net worth: upward of
      $9 billion) was damn near apoplectic that activists and voters had so terribly
      transgressed. Ackman described himself as “a supporter of President Trump” while
      expressing a fervent desire “to save the Democratic Party from itself.” Mamdani’s
      policies, Ackman wrote late Wednesday night, “would be disastrous for NYC. Socialism
      has no place in the economic capital of our country.”


      But Ackman held out hope that those owning the city of New York could continue
      to govern it: “Importantly, there are hundreds of million of dollars of capital
      available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight …
      so that a great alternative candidate won’t spend any time raising funds. So,
      if the right candidate would raise his or her hand tomorrow, the funds will pour
      in. I am sure that Mike Bloomberg will share his how-to-win-the-mayoralty IP [intellectual
      property] and deliver his entire election apparatus and system to the aspiring
      candidate so that the candidate can focus all of his or her energy on the campaign.”


      Another aggrieved hedge-fund multibillionaire, Daniel Loeb, opted to be concise:
      “It’s officially hot commie summer.” Many other moguls have also sounded alarms.
      But beneath all the froth and bombast, extremely wealthy individuals are busy
      gauging how to prevail against the threat of democracy and social justice.


      In the Empire State, there are many ways for the empire to strike back. The constellation
      of forces now regrouping with a vengeance includes titans of Wall Street, enormous
      real estate interests, pro-Israel groups, corporate media, the anti-progressive
      rich and assorted smear artists.


      In recent weeks, the completely false charge of antisemitism has escalated against
      Mamdani. He has taken a principled and consistent stand on behalf of human rights
      for all – in the process, denouncing Israel’s war on Palestinian civilians in
      Gaza – while at the same time opposing rapacious corporate power. So, it’s no
      surprise that New York’s most powerful Democrat, Senate minority leader Chuck
      Schumer, has been dodging the question of whether he’ll endorse Mamdani in the
      general election.


      For decades, Schumer’s campaign coffers have bulged while he has been hugely compensated
      by Wall Street. He has also remained a staunch supporter of Israel, despite its
      systematic ethnic cleaning and genocide against Palestinian people. A few months
      ago, Schumer declared: “My job is to keep the left pro-Israel.”


      What happened in the state’s second-largest city in 2021 is important to understand.
      Democratic socialist India Walton was the candidate of a grassroots campaign that
      stunned the party establishment in the Democratic primary when she defeated Buffalo’s
      corporate mayor, four-term incumbent Byron Brown. As the Democratic nominee, she
      seemed set to win the general election in the blue city. But a coalition of furious
      Democratic power brokers and deep-pocketed Republicans, including racists and
      vehement haters of the left, aided by much of the city’s mass media, teamed up
      to smear her and ending up getting Brown elected as a write-in candidate.


      Last weekend, I asked India (now a colleague at RootsAction, where she is senior
      strategist) how she saw the Mamdani campaign. “Watching the New York City mayoral
      primary from Buffalo last Tuesday gave me a familiar feeling,” she said. “As I
      watched the results come in, I felt a flutter in my gut and a sense of pensiveness.
      A feeling of overwhelming joy and a fear that it would be snatched away despite
      my attempts to cling to it. I imagine that as Zohran watched, he also felt a sense
      of familiarity. In 2021, Zohran Mamdani supported my run for Buffalo mayor; I
      was a first-time unknown candidate challenging a 16-year incumbent, and conventional
      wisdom said it was an impossible race to win. Now, in 2025, Zohran has once again
      toppled the establishment. I’m starting to think that populist policies that focus
      on working people are a winning strategy.”


      That strategy is now striking fear into the hard hearts of insatiably greedy billionaires.

      By Kit Klarenberg / MintPress News


      On June 13, 2025, Tel Aviv launched what many international observers and Iranian
      officials have described as an unprovoked military strike on Iran. Israeli jets
      bombed military and nuclear sites, while Mossad-run sleeper cells carried out
      sabotage missions against air and missile defense systems from within Iran, and
      drones smuggled into Tehran were launched against local missile launch bases.


      Dozens—perhaps more—of nuclear scientists and top military commanders were murdered
      with surgical precision, often in the presence of innocent family members, who
      were themselves frequently killed. A climate of chaos and uncertainty seemed to
      engulf everything.


      These early results so exhilarated Israeli officials that they talked a big game
      on where their operation would lead, making several incendiary claims along the
      way. They boasted of operating in Iranian airspace without hindrance, invited
      the U.S. to get formally involved with the “elimination” of Tehran’s nuclear weapons
      program, and anonymously briefed the media that “a multi-faceted misinformation
      campaign”—in which Donald Trump was an “active participant”—had been conducted
      “to convince Iran that a strike on its nuclear facilities was not imminent.”


      Internationally-wanted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu forecast on June 15 that
      Israel’s war on Iran “could certainly” produce regime change, as the government
      was “very weak,” and that “80% of the people would throw these theological thugs
      out.”


      A hard-hitting response to Netanyahu’s premonitions and Tel Aviv’s military strike
      quickly arrived from Tehran in the form of a wave of missile attacks. Wreaking
      unprecedented damage on Tel Aviv and Haifa. The impact on Israeli military installations
      is difficult to assess due to its strict policy of internal censorship.


      Visibly, though, Iran’s bombardments sent Israelis scurrying for shelter, while
      many others fled the country outright. Such was the exodus, from a country that
      has already suffered mass depopulation since October 7, 2023—the Israeli government
      has since scrambled to implement legally questionable bans on its citizens leaving.


      By June 19, officials in Tel Aviv had dropped the braggadocio, and Western media
      were publishing explainer guides to explain why Israel’s much-vaunted Iron Dome
      air defense system had failed to repel Iranian strikes.


      Iran’s unmolested battering of Israel continued apace until June 22, when the
      U.S. officially entered the war. Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan, and
      Natanz were targeted, allegedly using heavy-duty B-2 bombers that dropped earth-shattering
      bunker busters.


      Trump boasted that Iran’s nuclear program was “obliterated,” and Tehran struck
      an unmanned U.S. base in Qatar in response. Iran and Israel then traded missile
      barrages, which inflicted significantly greater damage on the latter, for two
      more days, before begrudgingly agreeing to a ceasefire.


      So far, the ceasefire holds. In the meantime, U.S. claims of having damaged, let
      alone destroyed, Iran’s nuclear facilities have quickly unraveled, as have Israeli
      allegations that the June 13 strike was an urgent necessity conducted as Iran
      was on the imminent verge of acquiring nukes.


      As the dust settles, it is becoming increasingly clear that the so-called “12
      Day War” was long in the making, and an unmitigated disaster for Tel Aviv and
      Washington, with wide-ranging ramifications for the region and beyond.


      “Netanyahu wanted to incite regime change in Tehran, while drawing the U.S. into
      a wider war. He failed on both counts, and now Iran is stronger, its citizens
      more united with one another, and behind their government,” Ali Abunimah, Electronic
      Intifada cofounder, tells MintPress News.


      This has enormous implications for West Asia and the world. Israel proved itself
      more vulnerable than ever. Tehran, while still facing enormous dangers from determined
      enemies, proved itself far more resilient than its adversaries expected.”


      ‘Burning Through’


      “Meanwhile, as many Iranian commentators note,” Abunimah says, another deleterious
      upshot of the fiasco is “Western-oriented segments of Iranian society have been
      left disillusioned—even discredited—by Washington’s brazen deceit.”


      Bragging about how Trump’s nuclear negotiations were a ruse “means not only Iran
      but many other countries globally will never again trust U.S. diplomacy.” Still,
      he believes Washington and Tel Aviv’s “efforts to destroy” Iran shouldn’t cease,
      and could intensify.


      For the time being, Tehran has made clear it will observe the ceasefire and only
      strike back if it is attacked again. As Abunimah puts it, “Some have criticized
      Iran for not linking a ceasefire to Israel ending the Gaza genocide.” However,
      he believes “such a demand could’ve triggered serious U.S. aggression, rather
      than the meaningless strikes that happened, and civilians could’ve ended up in
      the firing line.”


      Tehran has never envisaged direct defeat via a single blow, but wearing Israel
      down. The Resistance, including Iran, is the weaker side in an asymmetrical war,
      facing the full might of the U.S.-led Western empire. Ironically, although Israel
      started this war, it advanced the Resistance’s objective. Israel appears weak,
      unstable, and unsafe, while totally reliant on foreign support in a world where
      it is more hated than ever after nearly two years of its livestreamed genocide
      in Gaza.”


      Tyler Weaver, a U.S. military veteran who runs a popular X account publishing
      military analysis and commentary, echoes Abunimah’s analysis. “Iran demonstrated
      a consistent capability to pierce Israeli missile defenses and damage or destroy
      Israeli infrastructure and combat systems – several IDF air defense missile batteries
      were struck and destroyed,” he observes.


      And while Iran may not have secured an outright victory against its attackers,
      “Israel sure lost” the 12-Day War. “This was their ‘big show’ against Iran, and
      its results did not meet the effort expended. The most effective weapon the Israelis
      had wasn’t their vaunted Air Force, but instead an elaborately constructed attack
      network inside Iran courtesy of Mossad, which is now gone, and likely cannot be
      reconstructed.”


      “Infrastructure can be repaired, weaponry can be replaced, but they’re not going
      to be able to rebuild anything like that network again,” Weaver warns.


      Furthermore, Israel’s high-risk bid to overpower Iran consumed enormous amounts
      of munitions and came at great financial expense. A former financial adviser to
      the IDF chief of staff estimates that just the first 48 hours of Tel Aviv’s botched
      campaign cost $1.45 billion, with almost $1 billion spent on defensive measures
      alone. Meanwhile, government economists estimated the daily cost of military operations
      at $725 million.


      Tel Aviv was reportedly running perilously low on missile interceptors within
      five days, despite the U.S. having been aware of “capacity problems” for months
      prior, and spending intervening months “augmenting Israel’s defenses with systems
      on the ground, at sea and in the air.” This, in turn, has created “concern about
      the U.S. burning through its own interceptors” within the Pentagon. As a July
      2024 report by the Department of Defense-funded RAND concluded, Washington cannot
      replenish its stockpile of those munitions at any pace or scale.


      Haaretz estimates that the civilian and economic toll of the 12-Day War on Israel
      could reach into the billions of dollars. Thousands of residents have been displaced,
      with reconstruction costs projected in the hundreds of millions. Most industries
      were brought to a halt during the conflict, deepening the strain on Tel Aviv’s
      already fragile economy.


      Taken together, Israel’s ability to sustain a longer or more intense confrontation
      with Iran—militarily or financially—and the U.S. capacity to provide continued
      support appear increasingly uncertain.


      ‘Idiotic Decision’


      Reports suggest Trump was motivated by fears of a drawn-out war and saw military
      strikes on Iran as the most direct path to a ceasefire. This interpretation is
      greatly reinforced by a high-ranking Iranian official claiming the White House
      gave Tehran advance notice of the bombings, insisting they were intended as a
      “one-off,” opening the door for a “symbolic” Iranian counterattack, and cessation
      of hostilities.


      Media reports suggest that the strikes were part of a broader effort by the President
      to de-escalate the conflict by offering a negotiated off-ramp for all parties
      involved. Despite these disclosures, Trump has repeatedly avowed in his typically
      brash style that the June 22 attack on Iran was decisive, and “one of the most
      successful military strikes in history.”


      The New York Times later cited a senior U.S. official who said Iran’s nuclear
      sites were not destroyed but targeted in a way that temporarily took them “off
      the table,” contradicting the president’s more emphatic characterization.


      Even that more modest assessment was further challenged on June 25, when CNN reported
      on the findings of a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency analysis. The report concluded
      that U.S. strikes on Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz had not destroyed the core components
      of Iran’s nuclear program and had likely only delayed it by months. These conclusions
      were echoed by multiple informed sources, who noted that Iran’s stockpile of enriched
      uranium had been relocated prior to the attack, and that the facilities’ centrifuges
      remained largely intact.


      Weaver, who has studied photo and video evidence of the 12-Day War extensively,
      concurs “there’s little indication” the Iranian nuclear sites were “meaningfully
      damaged.” What can be detected from satellite imagery on the ground “is simply
      inconsistent with the use of earthquake bombs as claimed by Trump and the Pentagon.”


      Weaver points to several inconsistencies in mainstream reporting and White House
      statements regarding both the execution and outcomes of the attack. He notes that
      the strike “passed entirely under the radar of the usual nightly exchange of fire
      between Iran and Israel,” and was not acknowledged by either side until Trump
      announced it.


      For the official account to hold, he argues, B-2 bombers—aircraft the U.S. had
      previously avoided using in Yemen—would have had to penetrate deep into Iranian
      territory, strike heavily fortified sites with gravity bombs, and return across
      hundreds of miles of monitored airspace without being detected, all while Iran’s
      air defense systems remained operational.


      I think Trump tried to rescue Netanyahu from the consequences of his idiotic decision
      to start a war with Iran he manifestly wasn’t capable of finishing, and do so
      in a manner the Iranians weren’t going to be provoked into responding to in a
      major way. As an American taxpayer and former DoD employee, I would hope this
      wasn’t the most impressive attack the U.S. military could put together on a week’s
      notice, and it reflects deliberate restraint rather than a lack of capability.”


      Despite extensive planning reportedly dating back to the Biden administration,
      including war-game scenarios focused on Iran’s nuclear program, analysts have
      questioned the limited impact of Israel’s strike. Furthermore, it has been revealed
      that senior Israeli officials had been preparing for the June 13 attack since
      March, and sought to strike before Iran “rebuilt its air defenses by the latter
      half of the year.”


      ‘Polite Fiction’


      CNN’s report on the leaked DIA assessment was quickly met with coordinated responses
      from across the U.S. government disputing its conclusions.


      First, a dedicated article was published on the White House website, “Iran’s Nuclear
      Facilities Have Been Obliterated — and Suggestions Otherwise are Fake News.” The
      article collated quotes from numerous high-ranking administration officials, including
      the President, and Israeli government and military apparatchiks, testifying to
      the attack’s triumph. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fulminated, “Anyone who says
      the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the
      successful mission.”


      Simultaneously, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence
      Tulsi Gabbard separately issued statements declaring “new intelligence” indicated
      Iran’s nuclear facilities had in fact been “destroyed” by U.S. airstrikes. Neither
      provided any evidence to support this bold conclusion. Later that day, Politico
      revealed that the aggressive flurry of disavowal was a determined “blitz” by the
      administration, “to counter media reports…the strikes had not significantly set
      back Iran’s nuclear program.”


      The DIA leak reportedly provoked an angry response from Trump, leading to federal
      investigations into the breach. Like many administrations, the White House and
      U.S. agencies have typically resisted admitting to failures in military operations.
      Nonetheless, the determination of so many officials to push back against any suggestions
      that the strike wasn’t a historically ruinous cataclysm could point to a different
      motive than covering for Trump, or being forced to admit that Washington’s once-vaunted
      military machine isn’t what it once was.


      The assertion that Iran’s nuclear program has been eliminated offers a convenient
      rationale for ending discussions that, even before the conflict, had reached an
      impasse and now appear permanently derailed. In the wake of Tel Aviv’s strike,
      Iran canceled nuclear talks with the U.S. that had been scheduled for June 21
      in Oman, citing what it called Israel’s “barbarous” actions, backed by Washington,
      as rendering the summit “meaningless.”


      If, as some analysts have suggested, the negotiations were never intended to succeed
      and successive U.S. administrations were aware of Israel’s plans in advance, then
      Tehran has little reason to resume talks. In addition, Iranian officials have
      stated that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors will no longer
      be permitted entry to nuclear sites on Iranian soil.


      On June 12, Press TV published documents exposing how the Association previously
      provided Israeli intelligence with the names of several Iranian nuclear scientists
      who were subsequently assassinated, and its chief, Rafael Grossi, enjoys a close,
      clandestine relationship with Israeli officials.


      Documents released by Iran show that IAEA chief Grossi has been completely coordinated
      with Israel and has been carrying out Israel''s orders.




      Iran recently managed to obtain a wealth of secret documents from the Israeli
      regime. pic.twitter.com/iVz2V0oNh5 — Press TV 🔻 (@PressTV) June 12, 2025


      Under the terms of Tehran’s July 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)
      deal with the Obama administration, the IAEA was granted unimpeded access to Iran’s
      nuclear complexes to ensure the country was not using the facilities to develop
      weapons. Its inspectors collected a wealth of information on and in the sites,
      including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents.


      It is an open question whether this intelligence bonanza was shared with the U.S.
      and Israel, and played any role in the 12-Day War. Iranian lawmakers aren’t waiting
      for proof, and on June 25, they unanimously passed legislation to suspend cooperation
      with the Association indefinitely.


      Exiting the Non-Proliferation Treaty is being openly debated in the Islamic Republic
      as well. Maintaining the narrative that Iran’s nuclear program has been eliminated
      may serve a strategic purpose for Washington, allowing it to argue against further
      diplomatic engagement. “The polite fiction that Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were
      destroyed is helpful to keep the peace,” says Tyler Weaver.


      ‘Beyond Themselves’


      The question of what happens next is likewise an open one. Alex McKay, of the
      Marx Engels Lenin Institute and Decline & Fall, notes that while “this latest
      regime change attempt is over, plots against Iran by the Anglo-American empire,
      and its Israeli proxy, will continue,” as “the imperialist powers cannot countenance
      Iran being a sovereign, independent nation.”


      However, he believes the “total failure” of the recent operation against the Islamic
      Republic cannot be understated, and left U.S.-Israeli weakness and vulnerability
      writ unambiguously large.


      “Once it became clear the hoped-for palace coup or color revolution wouldn’t materialize,
      the U.S. was left without many options, and a number of unpalatable choices, McKay
      tells MintPress News.


      To actually destroy the Islamic Republic would take a long-term military campaign,
      possibly including a ground invasion. The U.S. has avoided wars as dangerous as
      this would be ever since their defeat in Vietnam. Imperialist powers of the world
      prefer to wage their wars via air power, terrorist acts, proxy armies, espionage
      and cultural subversion.”


      A large-scale air war against Iran “also carried enormous risks,” such as the
      Iranians closing the Strait of Hormuz or targeting oil infrastructure across the
      Gulf states hosting U.S. bases. Either approach would “lead to a spike in oil
      prices, and plunge the economies of imperialist nations into a deep recession,”
      McKay observes. As it was, the 12-Day War led to a brief surge in oil prices,
      which reversed once the ceasefire commenced. Meanwhile, vessels traversing Hormuz
      are subject to “intense levels of GPS jamming.”


      Such moves suggest that while Tehran’s missile onslaught may be over, it is under
      no illusions that it effectively remains at war with Israel and Tel Aviv’s Western
      puppetmasters, and must remain ever-vigilant as a result.


      It is evident that this perspective is widely shared among Iranian citizens. Far
      from destabilizing and fracturing the country and triggering the revolutionary
      government’s collapse, the population is more united than ever against Western
      powers. As one patriotic Iranian celebrated on ‘X’:


      We are now aware of our shortcomings more than ever and in dire need of some changes.
      Iran’s biggest achievement or gift wasn’t on the battlefield but at home amongst
      the people, becoming as one. Younger generations who had not experienced…the Revolution
      or the [war with Iraq] now tasted something beyond themselves. It gave them the
      identity they were longing for.”


      Should Israel again attempt to foment all-out war with Iran, it will be up against
      an adversary far more prepared than this time round, with nigh-universal domestic
      support for total victory, which may mean Tel Aviv’s final destruction, and the
      vanquishing of U.S. bases across West Asia. Tehran is also likely to emerge better
      armed, given that on June 26, China convened an emergency meeting with Iran and
      Russia’s defense ministers. It is now up to Netanyahu to make the next move, which
      may be his very last.

      against Iran, targeting military and nuclear sites, which resulted in significant

      Iran, which launched missile attacks on Israeli cities, causing widespread panic
      and damage. As the conflict escalated, the U.S. intervened, conducting airstrikes
      on Iranian nuclear facilities, but these strikes ultimately failed to achieve
      their intended goals, leading to a ceasefire by June 22. Analysts suggest that
      the conflict, termed the "12 Day War," exposed Israel's vulnerabilities and strengthened
      Iran's resolve and unity against foreign aggression. The aftermath has left both
      Israel and the U.S. questioning their military capabilities and strategies, while
      Iran has signaled its intent to remain vigilant and prepared for future confrontations.
      The war has also led to a significant shift in public sentiment within Iran, fostering
      a sense of national identity and resilience against Western powers.

      By Jonathan Cook


      U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed predictable outrage at the weekend
      that the BBC had inadvertently broadcast punk band Bob Vylan leading crowds at
      Glastonbury in a chant of “Death to the IDF” – the “Israel Defence Forces” that
      have been responsible for slaughtering many tens of thousands of Palestinians
      in Gaza over the past 21 months.


      He called the chant “appalling hate speech” — apparently unaware that there are
      far worse crimes than hating soldiers carrying out the mass slaughter of children.
      Those worse things, of course, include slaughtering children en masse.


      The BBC apologised, calling the band’s comments “deeply offensive” – more offensive,
      apparently, than Israel bombing and starving the children of Gaza.

      Glastonbury’s organisers condemned the chant, saying there was no space for “hate
      speech or antisemitism” — apparently assuming, wrongly, that all Jews identify
      not just with the state of Israel but with an Israeli military widely accused
      by genocide experts of committing genocidal violence in Gaza.


      I’m a British Jew in England




      I didn’t interpret #DeathToTheIDF as a call for people to kill me because




      1. I’m not in the IDF




      2. It doesn’t call for the death of individuals – the clue is in “The IDF”

      Police are investigating Bob Vylan, a musical duo, to see whether they have committed
      a criminal offence, or possibly a terrorist one. As far as we know, the same police
      are doing nothing to investigate some 10 British citizens known to have travelled
      abroad to join the Israeli military, the IDF, committing the Gaza genocide.


      [On Monday, the U.S. State Department cancelled the group’s visas ahead of a U.S.
      tour scheduled to begin in the fall and United Talent Agency dropped the duo,
      according to The Hollywood Reporter.]


      On Sunday, the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire grilled Starmer’s health secretary, Wes
      Streeting, on remarks from the Israeli embassy in London condemning what it termed
      “the normalisation of extremist language” and the “glorification of violence”
      at Glastonbury.


      Unexpectedly, Streeting avoided jumping whole-heartedly on the media outrage band-wagon,
      led by the Mail on Sunday, whose front page demanded the arrest of the two band
      members for what the paper wrongly described as a chant demanding “Death to Israelis”.


      The Mail, apparently, believes that all Israelis, presumably including the country’s
      children, are currently serving in the Israeli military.


      "I''d say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order"




      Health Secretary Wes Streeting responds to Israel''s claims on Glastonbury''s
      "glorification of violence", saying "Israeli settler terrorists" carried out "unwanton
      acts of violence"#BBCLauraK https://t.co/v2HwddQuYE pic.twitter.com/DRoqBMrVM6
      — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) June 29, 2025


      There are four important points to make about the interview between Derbyshire
      and Streeting:


      1. The Israeli embassy in London, like the Israeli government it represents, has
      precisely no concerns about the “glorification of violence” when Israel is doing
      either the glorifying or the violence.


      Israel is currently celebrating its “success” in slaughtering and maiming hundreds
      of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, including huge numbers of children; attacks
      by its soldiers and state-backed Jewish settler militias on Palestinian civilians
      in the West Bank; its eradication of whole communities in Lebanon; and its bombing
      of residential tower blocks across Tehran, killing many hundreds.


      Violence has been Israel’s signature policy for the past 21 months — and long
      before that. Israel has revelled in the carnage it has inflicted on populations
      across the region.


      In a post on social media, the Israeli embassy additionally argued of Bob Vylan’s
      chant:


      “When speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing,
      it must be called out — especially when amplified by public figures on prominent
      platforms.”


      And yet public figures from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Starmer
      have incited against the Palestinians, with Netanyahu comparing them to “Amalek”,
      a people the Israelites were commanded by God to exterminate, and Starmer terming
      the wholesale starvation of the people of Gaza an act by Israel of “self-defence”.


      Israeli officials from Netanyahu down have advocated the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.
      And, even more seriously, Israel has not just threatened but repeatedly carried
      out the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under its belligerent rule.


      2. It is beyond ridiculous for the BBC to echo the Israeli government in prioritising
      a harsh crackdown on words at Glastonbury “glorifying violence” towards Israeli
      soldiers ahead of the actual violence of genocide being committed by those Israel
      soldiers.


      The BBC has avoided criticising the Israeli government for its actual violence
      — its bombing and active starvation of Palestinian civilians — and the Starmer
      government for colluding in that violence, or what the International Court of
      Justice termed more than a year ago a “plausible” genocide by Israel.


      As a recent report by the Centre for Media Monitoring confirmed, the BBC has dramatically
      skewed its language to present Israel, the aggressor, in a more favourable light
      than the victim, the Palestinians of Gaza. The BBC’s own whistleblowing journalists
      have warned that the state broadcaster has all but banned the use of the word
      “genocide”, even by experts on the matter.


      [See: Jonathan Cook: The BBC’s Complicity in Genocide]


      By arming Israel, by organising spy flights over Gaza from RAF base Akrotiri on
      Cyprus, and by providing diplomatic cover, Starmer has effectively glorified Israel’s
      slaughter of Palestinian children in the enclave.


      Bob Vylan’s chants of “Death to the IDF” have a far more dangerous counterpart
      in Starmer’s recital of Israel’s “right to defend itself” when that “defence”
      involves Israel mercilessly starving Gaza’s population of food, water and power.


      Bob Vylan are a punk band; Starmer is the British prime minister, the man who
      directs Britain’s foreign policy and directs its army.


      No one, least of all the BBC, has held Israeli or British officials accountable
      not just for glorifying violence but for actually carrying it out on an industrial
      scale for nearly two years.


      But the BBC is suddenly interested in holding to account two punk musicians for
      leading a chant — one that made a symbolic, hypothetical threat of violence —
      against an Israeli military carrying out the ultimate form of violence, an actual
      genocide.


      In a serious media, Israel’s supposed “concerns” about the glorification of violence
      and extremist language would be laughed off the stage rather than respectfully
      aired.


      3. Streeting is being congratulated and condemned in equal measure on social media
      for refusing to be drawn into the Mail and BBC’s confected outrage. “I’d say to
      the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order,” he responded to Derbyshire.
      But hang on a minute. Streeting’s resistance to Derbyshire’s line of questioning
      was perhaps unexpected. But it also, let us not forget, serves the interests of
      both the Starmer and Israeli governments.


      Streeting’s insistence that Israel “get its house in order” had, as he made clear,
      nothing to do with its 21-month slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. Starmer is
      still defining the Gaza genocide as Israel’s supposed “right to defend itself.”


      In responding to Derbyshire, Streeting expressed concern only at what he called
      violent “settler attacks” in the West Bank. He said the Israeli embassy needed
      to “get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and
      the settlers in the West Bank.”


      This was intended purely as deflection, designed to serve Starmer and Israel,
      the West’s key client state in the oil-rich Middle East. It benefits the U.K.
      government to make an issue of West Bank settler attacks — and present them as
      disorganised, random violence by individual extremists that the Israeli government
      is not responsible for but needs to get a firmer grip on.


      By highlighting problems in the West Bank, the Starmer government can avoid addressing
      the genocide in Gaza and the Israeli state’s clear responsibility for that genocide.
      Which is precisely why in recent weeks Britain has made so much noise about imposing
      feeble penalties on a handful of extremist settlers and two fascist ministers
      in Netanyahu’s government that represent those settlers.


      Starmer and Streeting’s prioritising of Israel’s West Bank violence over Israel’s
      Gaza violence is a switch and bait twice over.


      Most of the violence in the West Bank is not coming from settler extremists, even
      though they are the ones being punished by the U.K. It is coming from the Israeli
      military, which has bulldozed thousands of homes there over the past year, driving
      40,000 Palestinians off their lands.


      Further, settler violence is not random. It is coordinated with Israeli field
      commanders, many of them settlers themselves, to uproot Palestinians so that Israel
      can move in Jewish settlers to colonise the land — or, in the words of successive
      Israeli governments, “Judaise” it.


      None of this is new either. Israel has engineered and imposed a violent, apartheid
      system on Palestinians for decades to make life unbearable and encourage them
      to leave their homeland.


      Second, Glastonbury’s anger-fuelled chant against the IDF was not primarily motivated
      by Israel’s violent actions in the West Bank. It was against the Israeli military
      for committing a genocide in Gaza, which the British government has been supporting.


      Streeting’s aim was to drag the debate on to safer territory for him and Starmer:
      that Britain needs to deal not with a genocide in Gaza but with a handful of violent
      loons in the West Bank.


      Even in criticising the Israeli government for not doing enough to tackle settler
      violence, Streeting is still operating within the confines of a public discourse
      dictated by Israel, which prefers any criticism to be directed at individuals
      not at the Israeli state behind those individuals.


      4. The BBC, the Starmer government and the Israel lobby are all delighted to play
      their part in this game of deflection and deception because these kinds of moral
      panics obscure the real issue: that all these parties are actively colluding in
      Israel’s genocide in Gaza.


      While the media and government can now have a long backwards and forwards about
      whether criticism of Israel’s genocidal army needs to be defined in law as a criminal
      offence or “terrorism”, Israel will get a free pass to continue with the real
      terrorism: a genocide in Gaza.


      Famously, the black civil rights fighter Malcolm X observed of the role of the
      media:


      “They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent,
      and that’s power. … If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating
      the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”


      Sixty years on, nothing has changed.

      Bob Vylan for leading a chant of "Death to the IDF" during their performance at
      Glastonbury, which U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned as "appalling hate

      by the Israeli military in Gaza, where many civilians, including children, have
      been killed. Cook criticizes the media and government for prioritizing condemnation
      of the band's symbolic protest over addressing the ongoing genocide in Gaza, suggesting
      that the focus on Bob Vylan serves to deflect attention from the real issues at
      hand. He highlights the hypocrisy of condemning words while ignoring the violence
      of state actions, asserting that the media's framing of the situation obscures
      the complicity of the British government and the BBC in the violence against Palestinians.

      By Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares / Other News


      The attack by Israel and the US on Iran had two significant effects. First, it
      once again exposed the root cause of turmoil in the region: Israel’s project to
      “reshape the Middle East” through regime-change, aimed at maintaining its dominance
      and blocking a Palestinian state. Second, it highlighted the futility and recklessness
      of this strategy. The only path to peace is a comprehensive agreement that addresses
      Palestine’s statehood, Israel’s security, Iran’s peaceful nuclear program, and
      the economic recovery of the region.


      Israel wants to topple the Iranian government because Iran has supported proxies
      and non-state actors aligned with the Palestinians. Israel has also consistently
      undermined US-Iran diplomacy regarding Iran’s nuclear program.


      Instead of endless wars, Israel’s security can be ensured by two key diplomatic
      steps –ending militancy by establishing a Palestinian state with UN Security Council
      guarantees, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful and verifiable
      nuclear program.


      The far-right Israeli government’s refusal to accept a Palestinian state is the
      root of the problem.


      When the British empire promised a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine in 1917,
      the Palestinian Arabs constituted 90% of the population and Jews less than 10%
      of the population. In 1947, with US intense lobbying, the UN General Assembly
      voted to grant 56% of Palestine to a new Zionist state, while the Jews were only
      33% of the population. Palestinians rejected this as a violation of their right
      to self-determination. After the 1948 war, Israel expanded to 78% of Palestine,
      and in 1967, occupied the remaining 22%—Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and
      the Golan Heights.


      Instead of returning occupied lands in exchange for peace, Israeli right-wing
      politicians insisted on permanent control of 100% of the land, with the Likud
      founding charter declaring in 1977 that there would be only Israeli sovereignty
      “between the Sea and Jordan”.


      Netanyahu represents this policy of domination – and has served as Prime Minister
      for a total of 17 years since 1996. When he came to power, he and his US neocon
      allies authored the “Clean Break” strategy to block the creation of a Palestinian
      state. Instead of pursuing land for peace, Israel aimed to reshape the Middle
      East by overthrowing governments that supported the Palestinian cause. The US
      would be the implementing partner of this strategy.


      This is exactly what happened after 9/11, as the US led or sponsored wars against
      Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon (U.S. funding and arming Israeli aggressions),
      Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (CIA operation during 2010’s), Sudan (supporting
      rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011), and Somalia (backing Ethiopia’s invasion
      in 2006).


      Contrary to the glib promises by Netanyahu to the US Congress in 2002 — that regime
      change in Iraq would bring a new day to the Middle East — the 2003 Iraq War augured
      the events that were to come across the region. Iraq descended into turmoil, and
      since then, each new war has brought death, destruction, and economic disarray.


      This month, Israel attacked Iran even as negotiations between Iran and the US
      were underway to ensure the peaceful use of Iran’s nuclear program – repeating
      the same WMD propaganda that Netanyahu used to justify the Iraq War.


      Israel has been claiming for more than 30 years that Iran is on the verge of acquiring
      nuclear weapons. However, on June 18, 2025, the IAEA Director General stated that
      there is “no proof of a systematic effort” by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.
      More to the point, Iran and the US were actively engaged in negotiations according
      to which the IAEA would monitor and verify the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear
      program.


      The attack on Iran proves yet again the futility and nihilism of Netanyahu’s approach.
      The Israeli and US attacks accomplished nothing positive. According to most analysts,
      Iran’s enriched uranium remains intact, but is now in a secret location rather
      than under IAEA monitoring. In the meantime, with Israel’s ongoing genocide in
      Gaza – neither peace nor security have been achieved.


      Israel has driven the region to a 4,000-km swash of violence from Libya to Iran
      through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately aimed
      at preventing a State of Palestine by “remaking” the Middle East.


      The solution is clear: it is time for the United States to recognize that its
      own strategic interests require a decisive break from partnering in Israel’s destructive
      strategy.


      Prioritizing genuine peace in the Middle East is not only a moral imperative,
      but a fundamental U.S. interest—one that can only be achieved through a comprehensive
      peace deal. The key pillar of this deal is for the US to lift its veto on a Palestinian
      State on the borders of 4 June 1967, and to do so at the start, not in some vague
      distant future that never actually arrives.


      For more than 20 years, Arab nations have backed a practical peace plan. So too
      has the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), with its 57 member countries,
      and the League of Arab States (LAS), with its 22 members. So too have almost all
      the nations in the UN General Assembly. So too has the International Court of
      Justice in its 2024 ruling that Israel’s occupation is illegal. Only Israel, with
      support from the US veto, has stood in the way.


      Here is a seven-point peace plan in which all parties would benefit. Israel would
      gain peace and security. Palestine would achieve statehood. Iran would win an
      end to economic sanctions. The US would win an end to costly and illegal wars
      fought on Israel’s behalf, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation if the
      current violence continues. The Middle East would win economic development, security
      and justice.


      – First,an immediate ceasefire would apply across the entire region – and the
      ceasefire would include an immediate release of all hostages and prisoners.


      – Second, the UN Security Council would vote upfront to welcome Palestine as the
      194th UN Member State on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
      Israel and Palestine could subsequently agree on mutually desired border adjustments.


      – Third,Israel would withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967. UN-mandated
      international forces would ensure a peaceful, orderly transition, a transfer of
      Palestinian territories to Palestinian authorities, and mutual security for both
      Israel and Palestine.


      – Fourth, the territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed for Lebanon,
      Syria, and all states in the region. All non-state armed groups would be demilitarized,
      and foreign troops would be withdrawn.


      – Fifth, the UN Security Council would adopt an updated nuclear agreement with
      Iran, including binding verification, and with all economic sanctions on Iran
      lifted alongside Iran’s verified compliance with the peaceful uses of its nuclear
      program.


      – Sixth, Israel and all Arab and Islamic states would establish full diplomatic
      relations following the admission of the State of Palestine as UN member state.


      – Seventh, the Middle East nations would establish an international fund for rebuilding
      the war-torn parts of Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, with contributions coming
      from within the region and from external sources.

      turmoil in the Middle East, driven by Israel's refusal to accept a Palestinian

    paragraph_summary: The recent attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran has underscored
      the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, primarily driven by Israel's strategy
      to maintain dominance and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. This
      approach has proven futile, as it perpetuates violence and instability rather
      than achieving security for Israel or peace in the region. The authors argue that
      a comprehensive peace agreement addressing Palestinian statehood, Israel's security,
      Iran's nuclear program, and regional economic recovery is essential. They propose
      a seven-point peace plan that includes a ceasefire, recognition of Palestine as
      a UN member state, withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied territories, and
      lifting sanctions on Iran, emphasizing that genuine peace is not only a moral
      obligation but also a vital U.S. interest. The article calls for a shift away
      from destructive policies and a commitment to a diplomatic resolution that benefits
      all parties involved.

      Israeli forces ramped up their genocidal assault on the Gaza Strip Monday, killing
      at least 95 Palestinians in attacks including massacres at a seaside café and
      a humanitarian aid distribution center and bombings of five school shelters housing
      displaced families and a hospital where refugees were sheltering in tents.


      An Israeli strike targeted the al-Baqa Café in western Gaza City, one of the few
      operating businesses remaining after 633 days of Israel’s obliteration of the
      coastal strip and a popular gathering place for journalists, university students,
      artists, and others seeking reliable internet service and a respite from nearly
      21 months of near-relentless attacks.


      Medical sources said at least 33 civilians were killed and nearly 50 others wounded
      in the massacre, including footballer Mustafa Abu Amira, photojournalist Ismail
      Abu Hatab—who survived an earlier Israeli airstrike and is reportedly the 227th
      journalists killed by Israel since October 2023—and prominent artist Frans Al-Salmi,
      whose final painting depicting a young Palestinian woman killed by Israeli forces
      resembles photographs of its slain creator posted on social media after her killing.


      Warning: Photos shows image of death

      returned to his work as a journalist.

      Survivor Ali Abu Ateila toldThe Associated Press that the café was crowded with
      women and children at the time of the attack.


      “Without a warning, all of a sudden, a warplane hit the place, shaking it like
      an earthquake,” he said.


      Another survivor of the massacre told Britain’s Sky News: “All I see is blood…
      Unbelievable. People come here to take a break from what they see inside Gaza.
      They come westward to breathe.”


      Eyewitness Ahmed Al-Nayrab toldAgence France-Presse that a “huge explosion shook
      the area.”


      “I saw body parts flying everywhere, and bodies cut and burned,” he said. “It
      was a scene that made your skin crawl.”


      Witnesses and officials said Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) troops opened fire on
      Palestinians seeking food and other humanitarian aid from a U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation distribution point in southern Gaza, killing 15 people amid near-daily
      massacres of aid-seekers.


      “We were targeted by artillery,” survivor Monzer Hisham Ismail told The Associated
      Press. Another survivor, Yousef Mahmoud Mokheimar, told the AP that Israeli troops
      “fired at us indiscriminately.” Mokheimar was shot in the leg, another man who
      tried to rescue him was also shot.


      IDF troops have killed nearly 600 Palestinian aid-seekers and wounded more than
      4,000 others over the past month, with Israeli military officers and soldiers
      saying they were ordered to deliberately fire on civilians in search of food and
      other necessities amid Israel’s weaponized starvation of Gaza.


      Another 13 people were reportedly killed Monday when IDF warplanes bombed an aid
      warehouse in the Zeitoun quarter of southern Gaza City, according to al-Ahli Baptist
      Hospital officials cited by The Palestine Chronicle. IDF warplanes also reportedly
      bombed five schools housing displaced families, three of them in Zeitoun. Israeli
      forces also bombed the courtyard of al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central
      Gaza, where thousands of forcibly displaced Palestinian families are sheltering
      in tents. It was reportedly the 12th time the hospital has been bombed since the
      start of the war.


      The World Health Organization has documented more than 700 attacks on Gaza healthcare
      facilities since October 2023. Most of Gaza’s hospitals are out of service due
      to Israeli attacks, some of which have been called genocidal by United Nations
      experts.

      aftermath, he said Israel had given them no warning. pic.twitter.com/vlJnyxNxty

      Israel’s overall behavior in the war is the subject of an ongoing International
      Court of Justice genocide case, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
      is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and crimes
      against humanity in Gaza, including murder and using starvation as a weapon of
      war.


      Since October 2023, Israeli forces have killed or wounded more than 204,000 Palestinians
      in Gaza, including over 14,000 people who are missing and presumed dead and buried
      under rubble, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, whose casualty figures have
      been found to be generally accurate and even a likely undercount by peer-reviewed
      studies.


      The intensified IDF attacks follow Israel’s issuance of new forced evacuation
      orders amid the ongoing Operation Gideon’s Chariots, an ongoing offensive which
      aims to conquer and indefinitely occupy all of Gaza and ethnically cleanse much
      of its population, possibly to make way for Jewish recolonization as advocated
      by many right-wing Israelis.

      amid accusations of genocide and war crimes against Israeli leadership. The situation
      continues to deteriorate as forced evacuations and military operations aim to
      further control and occupy Gaza, raising international concerns about human rights
      violations and humanitarian crises in the region.
