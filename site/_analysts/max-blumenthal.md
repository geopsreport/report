  - title: "Best-selling apps made by Israeli spies revealed"
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/07/02/best-selling-apps-made-by-israeli-spies-revealed/
    date: 2025-07-02 23:35
    summary: "The article discusses how many popular apps on Apple and Google platforms, developed by former Israeli spies and military personnel, contribute significantly to Israel's economy, which is characterized by its involvement in systemic oppression and violence against Palestinians. These apps, ranging from photo editing tools to mobile games, often operate under opaque ownership structures, making it difficult for users to recognize their origins. Companies like ZipoApps, Supersonic, and Playtika are highlighted for their substantial revenues and connections to the Israeli military, raising concerns about privacy and the ethical implications of supporting products tied to a regime accused of apartheid and genocide. The piece calls for increased awareness and action within the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement to avoid supporting these Israeli products unknowingly."

    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/07/01/spying-iran-mi6-infiltrated-iaea/
    date: 2025-07-01 17:51
    summary: "Leaked documents reveal that Nicholas Langman, a veteran British MI6 agent, infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on behalf of the UK, claiming credit for orchestrating sanctions against Iran. This revelation supports Iran's allegations that the IAEA colluded with Western powers, particularly Israel, to undermine its sovereignty, including accusations that the agency provided intelligence leading to the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. Langman's history includes controversial roles in British intelligence, such as deflecting blame for Princess Diana's death and overseeing the torture of Pakistani migrants in Greece. His involvement with the IAEA coincided with a period of intensified sanctions against Iran from 2010 to 2012, which were justified by unproven suspicions of Iran's nuclear ambitions. The IAEA's recent actions and reports, particularly under Secretary General Rafael Grossi, have further fueled Iranian distrust, leading to a breakdown in relations between Iran and the agency."

    summary: "In a leaked audio recording from a private session of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the organization's CEO highlighted their significant influence over key national security officials in the Trump administration, including Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, as well as former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. The CEO detailed the strategies employed by AIPAC to secure special access and foster relationships with these influential figures, underscoring the group's role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. The full audio and report are available for further insight."

    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/23/israeli-fanatic-ted-cruz-office/
    date: 2025-06-23 16:55
    summary: "Following a recent interview in which Tucker Carlson criticized Senator Ted Cruz's foreign policy stance regarding Israel and Iran, attention has turned to Cruz's Senior Advisor, Omri Ceren, an Israeli-born lobbyist with a history of opposing diplomatic agreements with Iran. Ceren, who previously worked for The Israel Project and lobbied for the Ivorian government, has been instrumental in shaping Cruz's pro-Israel policies. His sister, Merav Ceren, also involved in Israeli lobbying, briefly held a position in the Trump administration's National Security Council before being dismissed amid internal party conflicts. Despite Cruz's public persona of "America First" conservatism, his recent social media activity following U.S. military actions against Iran suggests a strong alignment with Ceren's advocacy for Israeli interests."
  - title: "NSC advisors urged ‘ISIS’-style drone attacks on Russian rail, leaked files show"
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/23/nsc-advisors-isis-drone-attacks/
    date: 2025-06-23 14:04
    summary: "Leaked documents reveal that a group of British and American academics advising the US National Security Council recommended that Ukraine adopt ISIS-style tactics for drone attacks on Russian rail infrastructure, leading to a series of deadly strikes in May and June 2023. The proposal, which included detailed plans for "anti-rail drone operations," aimed to disrupt Russian logistics by using inexpensive drones to target trains and rail bridges, mirroring strategies employed by ISIS. This approach culminated in Ukraine's Operation Spider Web, which involved multiple drone attacks that resulted in casualties and significant damage to Russian rail lines. The academics, part of a secret initiative called Project Alchemy, suggested using modified commercial drones for precision strikes and emphasized the psychological impact of such tactics. As Ukraine increasingly relies on drone warfare amid a challenging military situation, these strategies appear to be shaping its ongoing operations against Russian forces."

    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/21/trump-cia-director-ratcliffe-and-centcoms-kurilla-mossad-stenographers-iran/
    date: 2025-06-21 20:12
    summary: "An official from the Trump administration has alleged that CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Kurilla are acting as conduits for Israel's Mossad, attempting to sway President Trump towards military action against Iran using exaggerated intelligence regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. The official described Ratcliffe as "Mossad’s stenographer," claiming he presents Israeli intelligence without disclosing its foreign origins, while Kurilla is said to focus on advocating for a US attack on Iran. Despite dissenting voices within the administration advocating for diplomacy, such as Director of Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, they have reportedly been sidelined by White House Chief of Staff Suzie Wiles. The article suggests that Israel is pushing for regime change in Iran, including the assassination of its leader, and warns that a US military intervention could lead to significant American casualties and escalate the conflict beyond its initial scope."
  - title: "US Army appoints Palantir, Meta, OpenAI execs as Lt. Colonels"
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/18/palantir-execs-appointed-colonels/
    date: 2025-06-19 03:49
    summary: "Four senior executives from Palantir, Meta, and OpenAI have been appointed as lieutenant colonels in the newly established Detachment 201, or the "Executive Innovation Corps," of the US Army, aimed at integrating advanced tech expertise into military operations. Announced on June 13, this initiative seeks to leverage the skills of wealthy tech leaders to enhance military recruitment and training, particularly in technology-focused roles. The appointments, which coincide with a military parade sponsored by Palantir, reflect a growing collaboration between the tech sector and the military, as executives like Palantir's CTO Shyam Sankar express enthusiasm for this unusual alignment. The move is seen as a response to global geopolitical tensions, emphasizing the need for the military to adapt to technological advancements in warfare."
  - title: "Secret British plans to ‘defeat entire Russian Black Fleet’ revealed in leaks"
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/11/uk-plans-russian-black-fleet/
    date: 2025-06-11 17:28
    summary: "Leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone reveal that British intelligence has been orchestrating covert military operations against Russia in the Black Sea, primarily through a secretive unit called Project Alchemy. These files outline plans to significantly weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet, including strategies for blowing up the Kerch Bridge with fertilizer bombs and employing "honey trap" tactics involving Ukrainian agents to extract information from Russian sailors. The documents indicate that British military and intelligence officials aimed to exploit Ukraine's naval successes, such as the sinking of the Moskva, to intensify maritime operations against Russia. Additionally, they proposed the use of advanced submersibles for covert attacks and training Ukrainian forces for various sabotage missions. While some operations were executed, such as drone and missile strikes on Russian vessels, the overall effectiveness of these strategies remains debated. The UK’s involvement is framed as part of a broader geopolitical strategy to control the Black Sea region, which is deemed crucial for exerting influence over maritime routes to the Indo-Pacific."

    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/05/israel-arming-isis-gang-gaza/
    date: 2025-06-05 20:32
    summary: "Israeli opposition leader Avigdor Lieberman has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of arming a gang in southern Gaza affiliated with ISIS, a claim that has been acknowledged by Israeli officials. Lieberman criticized this action as reckless, suggesting it mirrors Netanyahu's past strategy of supporting Hamas to counter the Palestinian Authority, raising concerns that the weapons could eventually be used against Israel. Netanyahu's office confirmed that Israel is indeed arming "clans" in Gaza to combat Hamas, asserting that this strategy is intended to protect Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers. Reports indicate that the gang, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, has been involved in criminal activities, including looting aid shipments. Opposition figures, including retired IDF general Yair Golan, have condemned Netanyahu's approach, warning that it poses a significant threat to Israel's security by fostering extremist groups in the region."
  - title: "Trump’s embrace of dystopian Palantir spying tool sends stock soaring"
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/04/trumps-palantir-spying-stock/
    date: 2025-06-05 00:07
    summary: "The Trump administration has raised concerns about the surveillance firm Palantir, which has been accused of aggregating personal data from various U.S. government agencies, potentially creating a centralized spying tool without oversight. Co-founder Alex Karp has boasted about the company's financial success, linking it to military operations and suggesting that Palantir's technology is crucial for maintaining control during social unrest. The firm's stock has skyrocketed due to lucrative government contracts, including significant deals with the Pentagon and other federal agencies, while its products are implicated in controversial military actions, particularly in the Gaza Strip. Despite privacy concerns and criticisms regarding the efficacy of its technology, Palantir continues to expand its influence in national security and surveillance, benefiting from close ties to government officials and a growing market for its services."
  - title: "Israeli Mossad named as funder of Gaza Humanitarian Foundation"
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/05/29/israeli-mossad-gaza-humanitarian-foundation-aid/
    date: 2025-05-30 03:02
    summary: "Top Israeli lawmakers have accused their government of laundering significant funds through a clandestine network of U.S. humanitarian and mercenary organizations, particularly the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which aims to facilitate Israel's plan for ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza. The GHF, founded in Switzerland and linked to private mercenary firms, has taken over aid distribution in Gaza, leading to chaos and violence as starving Palestinians attempted to access food supplies. Critics, including Israeli opposition figures, allege that the Israeli government is covertly funding GHF and its associated companies, which operate without legal standing in Gaza. The situation escalated when GHF's leadership resigned amid accusations of failing to uphold humanitarian principles, and the organization announced its relocation to the U.S. for less scrutiny. The GHF's operations, characterized by biometric surveillance and militarized aid distribution, have drawn condemnation from various quarters, including celebrity chef José Andrés, who criticized the foundation for exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza."
  - title: "Docs expose Israeli influence on UK anti-genocide protest prosecutions"
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/05/27/israeli-interference-uk-protests/
    date: 2025-05-27 23:15
    summary: "The Grayzone has uncovered a significant scandal involving British state prosecutors allegedly colluding with Israeli authorities to label anti-genocide protesters as terrorists and imprison them under politically motivated charges. Documents reveal that the UK government has been coordinating with Israeli officials to prosecute activists from Palestine Action for disrupting operations at Elbit Systems, a company manufacturing weapons used in the Gaza conflict. The British Attorney General's Office has reportedly provided guidance to Israeli counterparts on avoiding arrest warrants for war crimes, indicating a long-standing influence campaign by Israel. Activists involved in protests against Elbit have faced severe legal repercussions, including being charged under counter-terrorism laws despite their actions not constituting terrorism. The revelations suggest a troubling breach of legal standards and judicial independence in the UK, driven by foreign interference from Israel, raising serious concerns about the politicization of the legal system in relation to Palestine solidarity activism."
