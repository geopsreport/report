    text: 'Some of the most frequently downloaded Apple and Google apps were developed
      by Israeli spies and war criminals, generating billions in revenue for the apartheid
      economy.


      This article was originally published by ¡Do Not Panic!


      The developers behind hundreds of Android and iPhone apps with billions of downloads
      are former Israeli spies whose apps are generating significant revenues for Israel’s
      genocidal war economy.


      The apps I’ve identified range from innocuous image and video editing apps to
      casual games, and most users won’t be aware they’re installing Israeli products
      on their phones. Many of these app developers operate under the radar, their ownership
      structures are opaque and the identity of their owners isn’t commonly known.


      The identification of these apps should add another frontier to the boycott, divest,
      sanctions movement, as it provides a straightforward way for ordinary people to
      avoid Israeli products that contribute to apartheid, genocide and ethnic cleansing.


      The proliferation of these apps on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store
      also raises questions over privacy and the harvesting of personal data, given
      the reputation of Israeli technology and past scandals involving spyware being
      smuggled onto devices by apps made in Israel.


      One of the most significant Israeli app holding companies and developers is ZipoApps,
      whose model is to buy-out and monetise apps at a large scale. The apps owned by
      Zipo (which also goes by the name Rounds.com) include a suite of photo and video
      editing apps that have received hundreds of millions of total installs. Individual
      apps include Collage Maker Photo Editor and Instasquare Photo Editor: Neon, both
      of which have received more than 50 million downloads from the Google Play Store.
      Other ZipoApps products include baby photo editing and retouching tools. In 2022,
      the founder and CEO of Zipo, Gal Avidor, told an interviewer (in his only interview
      to date), that all the founders of the company are former Unit 8200 Israeli intelligence
      personnel. On Reddit, users have complained about ZipoApps approach to privacy
      and data mining. One popular group of tools known as Simple Gallery went from
      free and open source to a paid product with ads and trackers just one week after
      ZipoApps acquired it.


      Another Israeli-owned photo editing app on the Play Store is the AI-powered Bazaart,
      which was founded by Dror Yaffe and Stas Goferman, two former IDF intelligence
      officers. Goferman far exceeded his mandatory service, spending a decade in the
      IDF up to 2011.


      Facetune, made by the developer Lightricks and available for Android and iPhones,
      is another Israeli photo editing app with over 50 million installs. Users on the
      Apple Store have called Facetune, which demands access to unique identifiers and
      your location, a scam. The co-founder of Lightricks, Yaron Inger, spent five years
      in Unit 8200.


      If you’re into mobile gaming, or if you create mobile games to sell, you will
      have come across Israeli company Supersonic from Unity, probably without knowing
      it. With billions of downloads in recent years, Supersonic is one of the largest
      mobile game publishers in the world with revenues estimated at around $23 million
      per year. Earlier this year the company reported that they owned three of the
      top ten most downloaded casual player mobile games in the world: Build a Queen,
      Going Balls, and Bridge Race. Trash Tycoon is another popular title. The company
      also has a game called ‘Conquer Countries’ which has been downloaded millions
      of times and on its advertising tile features a cartoon version of Donald Trump.
      The founder of Supersonic, Nadav Ashkenazy, spent seven and a half years in the
      IDF where he rose to become the head of operations for the Israeli air force,
      managing almost half the full-time staff. You can see all Supersonic’s games here.


      A better-known Israeli mobile game app maker whose revenues we don’t have to estimate
      is Playtika. Listed on the NASDAQ, Playtika brings in revenues of more than $2.5
      billion, generating significant taxes for Israel’s mass slaughter machine. Playtika,
      which builds gambling apps, is firmly enmeshed in the genocidal Israeli war machine.
      The company was founded by Uri Shahak, son of the former head of the IDF, Amnon
      Lipkin-Shahak, and last year its annual report revealed that 14% of its staff
      had been called up as reservists to participate in the genocide in Gaza. Current
      CEO Robert Antokol says the company has a “responsibility” to Israel and the taxes
      paid by its staff are “wonderful for the Israeli economy.”


      Another Israeli company whose apps have been downloaded billions of times is Crazy
      Labs. With an estimated company value of around $1 billion and sales estimated
      at up to $200 million, Crazy Labs is another app maker integral to the Israeli
      economy. Its best-selling titles are Phone Case DIY, Miraculous Ladybug & Cat
      Noir, and Sculpt People. You can see the full list of the Crazy Lab apps on the
      Google Play Store. The founders of Crazy Labs are all ex-IDF, including Sagi Schliesser,
      who well exceeded his mandatory service by staying in the IDF and helping build
      the digital architecture of apartheid for eight years.


      An app you may have heard of, but not have known is Israeli, is Moovit. The urban
      transport app was founded by a number of ex-IDF soldiers, including Nir Erez,
      who spent years at the IDF’s specialist computing centre known as Mamram, which
      Israeli propaganda says creates ‘cyber warriors.’ As the unit which runs the military’s
      intranet, Mamram is central to Israel’s genocide of Gaza. Moovit, which has close
      to one billion users and delivers significant revenues to Israel, has been an
      official partner of the Olympic Games, the European football championships and
      also partners with Microsoft.


      With hundreds of millions of installs, Call App, which screens phone calls for
      spam, is another product of Israel’s military economy. The founder and CEO of
      Call App, Amit On, spent three years in Unit 8200 in the 2000s. The app has over
      100 million users.


      On the ride-hailing front, Gett, which is focused on corporate passengers and
      is particularly popular in London as a way to hail black cabs, was founded by
      ex-Unit 8200 Roi More and Shahar Waiser. A notable mention for GPS navigation
      app Waze, probably the most famous Israeli app of the last decade, acquired by
      Google in 2013 for $1.3 billion and also founded by ex-Unit 8200 spies.


      Another fast-growing Israeli app which has been featured on Oprah, in the New
      York Times and on CNN is Fooducate, whose founder, Hemi Weingarten, flew bombing
      missions for the Israeli air force.


      This expose, which follows my investigations into former IDF and Unit 8200 working
      in AI for the big tech giants, and those working at Meta and Google, further confirms
      how deeply and insidiously embedded Israel is in our digital lives.


      These investigations also reveal how Israel is foundationally reliant on being
      in a permanent state of dominance over the Palestinians, because the only thing
      of value the country produces are tech companies founded by ex-IDF. Without being
      able to train their citizens as spies and soldiers, and butcher Palestinians at
      will, Israel’s economy would collapse.


      Yet most people who use these apps will have downloaded them in good faith with
      little idea they are contributing to Israel’s occupation-apartheid-genocide economy.
      In addition, these apps will be gathering information and data, including large
      amounts of personal images, and delivering them to devotees of Israel committed
      to maintaining the country as an apartheid state.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article reveals that many popular apps on Apple and Google
      platforms, developed by former Israeli spies and military personnel, generate
      substantial revenue for Israel's economy, which is linked to its ongoing military
      actions and human rights violations against Palestinians, raising concerns about
      user privacy and the ethical implications of supporting such products.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses how many popular apps on Apple and Google
      platforms, developed by former Israeli spies and military personnel, contribute
      significantly to Israel's economy, which is characterized by its involvement in
      systemic oppression and violence against Palestinians. These apps, ranging from
      photo editing tools to mobile games, often operate under opaque ownership structures,
      making it difficult for users to recognize their origins. Companies like ZipoApps,
      Supersonic, and Playtika are highlighted for their substantial revenues and connections
      to the Israeli military, raising concerns about privacy and the ethical implications
      of supporting products tied to a regime accused of apartheid and genocide. The
      piece calls for increased awareness and action within the boycott, divestment,
      and sanctions movement to avoid supporting these Israeli products unknowingly.

  - title: 'Spying on Iran: How MI6 infiltrated the IAEA'
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/07/01/spying-iran-mi6-infiltrated-iaea/
    text: 'Leaked confidential files indicate the International Atomic Energy Agency
      was infiltrated by a veteran British spy who has claimed credit for sanctions
      on Iran. The documents lend weight to the Islamic Republic’s accusation that the
      nuclear watchdog secretly colluded with its enemies.


      A notorious British MI6 agent infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency
      (IAEA) on London’s behalf, according to leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone.
      The agent, Nicholas Langman, is a veteran intelligence operative who claims credit
      for helping engineer the West’s economic war on Iran.


      Langman’s identity first surfaced in journalistic accounts of his role in deflecting
      accusations that British intelligence played a role in the death of Princess Diana.
      He was later accused by Greek authorities of overseeing the abduction and torture
      of Pakistani migrants in Athens.


      In both cases, UK authorities issued censorship orders forbidding the press from
      publishing his name. But Greek media, which was under no such obligation, confirmed
      that Langman was one of the MI6 assets withdrawn from Britain’s embassy in Athens.


      The Grayzone discovered the résumé of the journeyman British operative in a trove
      of leaked papers detailing the activities of Torchlight, a prolific British intelligence
      cutout. The bio of the longtime MI6 officer reveals he “led large, inter-agency
      teams to identify and defeat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
      technology, including by innovative technical means and sanctions.”


      In particular, the MI6 agent says he “worked to prevent WMD proliferation through…
      support for the [IAEA] and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
      [OPCW] and through high level international partnerships.”


      Langman’s CV credits him with playing a major role in organizing the sanctions
      regime on Iran by “[building] highly effective and mutually supportive relations
      across government and with senior US, European, Middle and Far Eastern colleagues
      for strategy” between 2010 and 2012. He boasts in his bio that this achievement
      “enabled [the] major diplomatic success of [the] Iranian nuclear and sanctions
      agreement.”


      The influence Langman claimed to have exerted on the IAEA adds weight to Iranian
      allegations that the international nuclear regulation body colluded with the West
      and Israel to undermine its sovereignty. The Iranian government has alleged that
      the IAEA supplied the identities of its top nuclear scientists to Israeli intelligence,
      enabling their assassinations, and provided critical intelligence to the US and
      Israel on the nuclear facilities they bombed during their military assault this
      June.


      This June 12, under the direction of its Secretary General Rafael Grossi, the
      IAEA issued a clearly politicized report recycling questionable past allegations
      to accuse Iran of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The next day, Israel
      attacked the country, assassinating nine nuclear scientists as well as numerous
      top military officials and hundreds of civilians.


      Iranian former Vice President for Strategic Affairs Javad Zarif has since called
      for the IAEA’s Grossi to be sacked, accusing him of having “abetted the slaughter
      of innocents in the country.” This June 28, the Iranian government broke ties
      with the IAEA, refusing to allow its inspectors into the country.


      While Iranian officials may have had no idea about the involvement of a shadowy
      figure like Langman in IAEA business, it would likely come as little surprise
      to Tehran that the supposedly multilateral agency had been compromised by a Western
      intelligence agency.


      Langman’s name placed under official UK censorship order


      In 2016, Langman was named a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George,
      the same title bestowed on fictional British spy James Bond. By that point, the
      supposed secret agent held the dubious distinction of being publicly ‘burned’
      as an MI6 operative on two separate occasions.


      First, in 2001, journalist Stephen Dorril revealed that Langman had arrived in
      Paris weeks prior to Princess Diana’s fatal car crash in the city on August 31
      1997, and was subsequently charged with conducting “information operations” to
      deflect widespread public speculation British intelligence was responsible for
      her death.


      Then, in 2005, he was formally accused by Greek authorities of complicity in the
      abduction and torture of 28 Pakistanis in Athens. The Pakistanis, all migrant
      workers, were suspected of having had contact with individuals accused of perpetrating
      the 7/7 bombings in London, July 2005.


      Brutally beaten and threatened with guns in their mouths, the victims “were convinced
      their interrogators were British.” When Greek media named Langman as the MI6 operative
      who oversaw the migrants’ torture, British news outlets universally complied with
      a government D-notice – an official censorship order – and kept his identity under
      wraps when reporting on the scandal.


      London vehemently denied any British involvement in torturing the migrants, with
      then-Foreign Secretary Jack Straw dismissing the charge as “utter nonsense.” In
      January 2006 though, London admitted MI6 officers were indeed present during the
      Pakistanis’ torture, although officials insisted the operatives played no active
      part in their arrests, questioning or abuse.


      Following his withdrawal from Athens, Langman returned to London to head the UK
      Foreign Office’s Iran Department, a shift which highlights his importance to MI6
      and suggests the British government had no qualms about his allegedly brutal evidence
      gathering methods.


      Britain’s Foreign Office collaborates closely with MI6, whose agents use it as
      cover just as the CIA does with State Department diplomatic postings.


      MI6’s man on Iran takes credit for “maximum pressure” strategy


      While leading the Foreign Office’s Iran Department from 2006 – 2008, Langman oversaw
      a team seeking to “develop understanding” of the Iranian government’s “nuclear
      program.”


      It’s unclear exactly what that “understanding” entailed. But the document makes
      clear that Langman then “generated confidence” in that assessment among “European,
      US and Middle Eastern agencies” in order to “delay programme [sic] and pressurise
      Iran to negotiate.” The reference to “Middle Eastern agencies” strongly implied
      MI6 cooperation with Israel’s Mossad intelligence service.


      In April 2006, Tehran announced it had successfully enriched uranium for the first
      time, although officials denied any intention to do so for military purposes.
      This development may have triggered Langman’s intervention.


      The Islamic Republic has rejected any suggestion it harbors ambitions to possess
      nuclear weapons. Its denials were corroborated by a November 2007 US National
      Intelligence Estimate expressing “high confidence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted”
      any and all research into nuclear weapons. This assessment remained unchanged
      for several years, and was reportedly shared by the Mossad, despite Benjamin Netanyhau’s
      constant declarations that Iran was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon.


      Langman’s IAEA support work overlaps with Iran sanctions blitz


      International governmental attitudes towards Iran changed abruptly between 2010
      and ‘12. During this period, Western states and intergovernmental institutions
      initiated an array of harshly punitive measures against the country, while Israel
      ramped up its deadly covert operations against Iran’s nuclear scientists.


      This period precisely overlapped with Langman’s tenure at the Counter-Proliferation
      Centre of the UK Foreign Office. His bio implies he used this position to influence
      the IAEA and other UN-affiliated organizations to foment a campaign of global
      hostility towards Iran.


      In June 2010, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1929, which froze the
      Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ assets, and banned overseas financial institutions
      from opening offices in Tehran. A month later, the Obama administration adopted
      the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. This set
      off a global chain of copycat sanctions by Washington’s vassals, who often imposed
      even more stringent measures than those levied by the UN and US.


      In March 2012, the EU voted unanimously to cut Iranian banks out of the SWIFT
      international banking network. That October, the bloc imposed the harshest sanctions
      to date, restricting trade, financial services, energy and technology, along with
      bans on the provision of insurance to Iranian companies by European firms.


      BBC reporting on the sanctions acknowledged European officials merely suspected
      Tehran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but lacked concrete proof. And behind
      the scenes, the MI6 operative Langman was claiming credit for helping legitimize
      the allegations against Iran.


      Nuclear agreement lays foundations for war


      Following the Western-led campaign isolation of Iran from 2010 – 2012, over its
      purported nuclear weapon program, the Obama administration negotiated a July 2015
      agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Under the JCPOA’s
      terms, the Islamic Republic agreed to limit its nuclear research activities in
      return for sanctions relief. In the years that followed, the IAEA was granted
      virtually unlimited access to Tehran’s nuclear complexes, ostensibly to ensure
      the facilities were not used to develop nuclear weapons.


      Along the way, IAEA inspectors collected vast amounts of information on the sites,
      including surveillance camera photos, measurement data, and documents. The Iranian
      government has since accused the Agency of furnishing the top secret profiles
      of its nuclear scientists to Israel. These include the godfather of Iran’s nuclear
      program, Mohsen Fakrizadeh, who was first publicly named in a menacing 2019 powerpoint
      presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The following year,
      the Mossad assassinated Fakrizadeh in broad daylight with a remote-controlled
      machine gun.


      Internal IAEA documents leaked this June indicated that IAEA Secretary General
      Rafael Grossi has enjoyed a much closer relationship with Israeli officials than
      was previously known, and suggested he leveraged his cozy ties with Tel Aviv to
      secure his current position.


      During a June 24 interview with Fox News’ war-crazed anchor Martha MacCallum,
      Grossi did not deny making the inflammatory claim that “900 pounds of potentially
      enriched uranium was taken to an ancient site near Isfahan.” Instead the IAEA
      director asserted, “We do not have any information on the whereabouts of this
      material.”


      Well before Grossi rose to the top of the IAEA with Western and Israeli backing,
      the agency appears to have been penetrated by a British intelligence agent who
      took responsibility in his bio for engineering the West’s economic attack on Iran.


      The IAEA has not responded to an email from The Grayzone seeking clarification
      on its relationship with Langman and the MI6.'
    one_sentence_summary: Leaked documents reveal that British MI6 agent Nicholas Langman
      infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and played a significant
      role in orchestrating sanctions against Iran, supporting Iranian claims of collusion
      between the IAEA and Western powers, particularly Israel, to undermine its nuclear
      program.
    paragraph_summary: Leaked documents reveal that Nicholas Langman, a veteran British
      MI6 agent, infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on behalf
      of the UK, claiming credit for orchestrating sanctions against Iran. This revelation
      supports Iran's allegations that the IAEA colluded with Western powers, particularly
      Israel, to undermine its sovereignty, including accusations that the agency provided
      intelligence leading to the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. Langman's
      history includes controversial roles in British intelligence, such as deflecting
      blame for Princess Diana's death and overseeing the torture of Pakistani migrants
      in Greece. His involvement with the IAEA coincided with a period of intensified
      sanctions against Iran from 2010 to 2012, which were justified by unproven suspicions
      of Iran's nuclear ambitions. The IAEA's recent actions and reports, particularly
      under Secretary General Rafael Grossi, have further fueled Iranian distrust, leading
      to a breakdown in relations between Iran and the agency.

  - title: Meet the Israeli fanatic running Ted Cruz’s office
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/23/israeli-fanatic-ted-cruz-office/
    text: 'After Ted Cruz’s humiliation by Tucker Carlson, attention has focused on
      a top staffer of the self-proclaimed “leading defender of Israel in the United
      States Senate.”


      On June 18, former Fox host Tucker Carlson published a video which, though marketed
      as an interview, was more of a snuff film. Over the course of two hours, Carlson
      can be seen rhetorically disemboweling his debate opponent, US Senator Ted Cruz,
      on the politician’s determination to see the US attack Iran on Israel’s behalf.


      While Cruz presents himself as a Christian Zionist moved by his own zealotry to
      support Israel, the politician’s Tel Aviv-driven policy line can also be traced
      back to his Senior Advisor for Policy and Communications, an Israeli-born Zionist
      lobbyist named Omri Ceren.


      Before overseeing Cruz’s public relations, Ceren managed his foreign policy docket
      as his national security advisor. Prior to joining the Senator’s staff, Ceren
      served as the press director for The Israel Project, a Zionist pressure group
      which was forced to close down after being exposed as a de facto Israeli government
      front by Al Jazeera’s groundbreaking undercover investigation, The Lobby. Before
      that, Ceren cut his teeth lobbying for Ivory Coast dictator Laurent Gbagbo, who
      relied on Ceren as a registered foreign agent lending his marketing expertise
      to the embattled regime.


      In discussing Tucker Carlson’s demolition of Ted Cruz, I pointed out that Cruz’s
      foreign policy handler is Omri Ceren, a longtime Israel lobbyist and Israeli citizen
      aligned with Netanyahu Ceren’s sister, Merav, is an ex-Israeli Defense Min staffer
      who served in Mike Waltz’s NSC pic.twitter.com/BqAnYxXlw0 — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal)
      June 20, 2025


      Ceren has consistently opposed a nuclear deal with Iran since at least 2015, when
      he declared that any agreement would simply ensure Tehran was “able to cheat with
      impunity.” At a talk hosted by the neocon Hudson Institute think tank in 2018,
      he suggested Washington should continue preaching about “freedom” and encouraging
      Iranian protesters to pursue regime change while simultaneously maintaining Trump’s
      ban on Iranians entering the US.


      Omri Ceren, right wing Israel lobbyist from The Israel Project, says the US should
      preach “freedom” to Iranians while maintaining Trump’s ban on Iranians seeking
      entry to the US. So much solidarity here. pic.twitter.com/8wYl29dJIn — Max Blumenthal
      (@MaxBlumenthal) January 16, 2018


      Omri’s sister, Merav Ceren, previously worked under the supervision of the Israeli
      Defense Ministry, as well as another Israeli government cutout in Washington,
      the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. The pair were born in Haifa, Israel,
      with Merav embarking on her career of Israel lobbying as a college student.


      Upon Merav Ceren’s appointment to head the Israel and Iran desks of Trump’s National
      Security Council in April 2025, one Israeli publication declared her “One of Our
      Own.” The authors went on to boast that Ceren’s “presence… in the discussion rooms
      gives significant space to voice Israeli interests.” Just a month later, however,
      she was fired as tensions between the Republican Party’s America First and Israel
      First wings came to a head.


      While his sister looked for a new gig, Omri Ceren continued to represent his home
      country as the national security advisor to a senator who has pantomimed “America
      First” conservatism while zealously advancing Israel’s objectives. Cruz’s messaging
      since the US bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities on June 21 clearly bears his Israeli
      advisor’s imprimatur.


      Since the attack, Cruz has posted 14 comments on Twitter/X. 12 of them consisted
      of breathless statements cheering the bombing or attacks on opponents of the war,

    text: 'Leaked war plans sent to the US NSC instructed Kiev to carry out “ISIS”-style
      drone attacks on Russian trains and rail bridges, foreshadowing a series of deadly
      Ukrainian attacks this May and June.


      A coterie of British and American academics advising the US National Security
      Council explicitly urged Ukraine adopt the tactics of ISIS in a detailed proposal
      for “anti-rail drone operations,” according to leaked documents reviewed by The
      Grayzone.


      The aggressive war plans recommended in the files eerily foreshadowed Ukraine’s
      Operation Spider Web, which consisted of a series of brazen drone attacks waged
      inside Russia between May 24 and June 1 – the eve of scheduled negotiations between
      Russia and Ukraine. A pair of Ukrainian bombings of Russian trains in Bryansk
      on May 31 and Kursk and the following day left seven dead, and injured more than
      30 people, including two children.


      The attacks on Russian rail infrastructure have continued since the launch of
      Operation Spiderweb, suggesting the British-born strategy has heavily influenced
      the thinking of Kiev’s increasingly desperate military.


      The leaked plans reviewed by The Grayzone explore the use of “inexpensive drones”
      as “a low-cost means for disrupting Russian logistics,” but also include blueprints
      for terror attacks composed by three “drone experts” before being passed to the
      Biden administration’s then-Director for Russia at the National Council, Col.
      Tim Wright.


      Those experts belonged to a secret academic-intelligence cell called Project Alchemy,
      whose existence was first exposed by The Grayzone, and which was founded with
      a mission to “to keep Ukraine fighting” by imposing “strategic dilemmas, costs
      and frictions upon Russia.”


      As previously reported here, Project Alchemy researchers called “to take a page
      from ISIS’ playbook,” presenting the jihadist group’s psychological operations
      as a model for Ukrainian attacks on Russian civilians. The Grayzone can now reveal
      that Alchemy’s team also urged US war planners to look to the Islamic State for
      inspiration in using commercial drones for attacks on Russian civilian targets.


      One academic advising the Alchemy cell, Zachary Kallenborn of George Mason University,
      recommended Ukraine carry out “two-stage attacks like ISIS did frequently” on
      Russian-held railways, suggesting that Kiev first “break the track, and wait for
      the engineers to come to fix it, then use the drone to kill them.” In other words:
      double tap kamikaze drone strikes.


      “Drones also could provide ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]
      in finding and tracking trains to support larger actions,” with satellite imagery
      exploited for targeting purposes, Kallenborn added.


      An unnamed Durham University researcher consulted by the NSC declared that “ISIS
      showed in their battles against the Iraqi military” that drones could be “modified
      via a simple drop mechanism… to serve as effective munitions delivery platforms.”
      The conversion of everyday commercial drones into munitions-bearing killing machines
      would prove one of the most deadly tactics of the war for both sides.


      The origin of Kiev’s ‘drone swarm’ offensives?


      During a meeting between military historians from Kansas State University and
      faculty from the Command and General Staff School at Ft. Leavenworth, academic
      war planners discussed “the idea of using inexpensive drones to prevent Russia
      from using captured Ukrainian railroads to resupply their combat units.” The academics
      then delivered the proposal to “three drone experts in the Ukraine Working Group
      who each provided their analysis for how to achieve this.”


      A separate leaked document describes the Working Group as a vast collection of
      “strategic studies, military technology and Eastern Europe regional studies experts”
      who “came together to analyze the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to think deeply
      about policy options” which could “assist Ukraine’s defense (short of deploying
      combat forces).” The Working Group was composed of “approximately 60 experts hailing
      from states throughout NATO.”


      The operations file begins by noting that, “when operating in its own territory,”
      the Russian army “relies on its well-developed rail system which is integrated
      with Ukraine’s domestic rail network.” As Russian forces moved deeper into Ukraine,
      the Working Group forecasted that they would “increasingly need to rely on Ukraine’s
      rail system or face logistic-induced paralysis as their lines of supply lengthen
      and their road-based logistical become increasingly inefficient.”


      “The question should therefore be posed as to whether inexpensive drones can be
      used to hinder Russian efforts to use those portions of Ukraine’s railway network
      they have captured,” the document stated. An academic using the initials “M.E.D.”
      who hailed from Britain’s prestigious Durham University declared, “if Ukrainian
      forces could sustain attacks on occupied railroads, they could hamper Russian
      forces’ ability to operate deeper inside of Ukraine.”


      While believing it “unlikely that drone attacks, even kamikaze attacks, could
      bring down bridges” – although this “would be ideal” – they suggested “commercial
      drones could be modified with a sufficient explosive to inflict meaningful damage
      of railroads, it would greatly complicate Russian efforts.” After all, “even a
      small amount of damage would force rail traffic to stop until repairs could be
      made to the line.”


      These attacks “could be carried out away from major stations likely to have active
      air defenses,” and “augment attacks by stay-behind guerrilla forces.” M.E.D. cited
      a July 2018 paper on Islamic State’s “innovative” use of drones published by the
      West Point military academy’s “combating terrorism center” as a reference point
      for such tactics. It discussed “creative ways” ISIS had deployed “simple, low-cost,
      and replaceable devices” to devastating effect against its adversaries, which
      could be replicated by the US and its allies.


      M.E.D. postulated that “if larger drones could be procured, of if light commercial
      aircraft could be modified to fly as drones, they might be able to damage rail
      bridges enough to force substantive repairs, which would greatly slow rail traffic”
      – a proposal which closely resembles the June 1 attacks on rail bridges in Russia’s
      Bryansk and Kursk regions. “Another possibility” was “to use a number of commercial
      drones in a swarm attack” comparable to Ansar Allah’s September 2019 strikes on
      Aramco sites in Saudi Arabia, “wherein a number of thermite munitions are used
      to weaken steel or concrete infrastructure.”


      “Even if the rail bridges are not destroyed outright weakening key areas – perhaps
      through the use of suicide drones striking them directly after triggering their
      payload – would necessitate close inspection and hinder the ability to use the
      bridges safely,” M.E.D. concluded. Throughout the proxy war, Ukraine has regularly
      deployed drone swarms against Russian targets, in some cases inflicting significant
      damage.


      “Track switches would probably be good targets too”


      Another “drone expert” consulted by the St. Andrews cabal was Dominika Kunertove,
      formerly of Swiss university ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies. Kunertove
      currently serves as director of “a research project on future drone warfare and
      technology” at the Atlantic Council, the semi-official, arms-industry funded think
      tank of NATO in Washington DC.


      Kunertove suggested using drones to strike “anything that uses” railroads, rather
      than railways themselves, as this would mean “neither side would be able to use
      railroads for some time (in case [Ukraine] recaptures…territory previously held
      by Russians.” This June, Kiev destroyed a military supply train carrying heavy
      armor, including tanks and artillery systems in an effort dubbed Operation Spiderweb
      2.0.


      Meanwhile, Zachary Kallenborn, a self-described “war doctor in training” from
      George Mason University’s Schar School, noted the “limited payloads” offered by
      commercial drones, with “only a few pounds” of explosive able to be attached to
      them, meant “the best bet would be to hit sensitive, difficult to repair targets
      to maximize harm.” While admitting to “not know too much about rail infrastructure,”
      he suggested “switching yards, engine houses, or the equipment to load and unload
      trains” as prospective targets.


      “Track switches would probably be good targets too,” Kallenborn said, as “a hit
      would disrupt multiple lines and…would be tougher to repair.” He went on to advocate
      “[thinking] about how drones can support broader anti-rail operations.” While
      “slowing” operations intended were “definitely good,” Kallenborn believed it would
      be “be more useful to use drones” to target “supply trains themselves,” echoing
      Dominika Kunertove’s suggestions.


      Kallenborn specifically highlighted five commercial drone models which could be
      outfitted with explosives and sent to disrupt rail operations, including the $2,200
      DJI Mavic III, which Ukrainian forces used in their attack on a Russian fuel train
      this May 24.


      “All of these would need to be modified to allow carrying and dropping of any
      munitions, which will increase the cost,” Kallenborn wrote. But “depending on
      model, there may be secondary suppliers who can help with that,” he noted.


      Still, Kallenborn appeared to express some cynicism about the utility of drones.
      He urged the National Security Council to “consider the opportunity cost of drones
      vs other approaches.” He speculated there were “probably a lot of tracks… in relatively
      isolated areas where planting explosives by hand might be plausible and might
      be better timed to fix a train.”


      That task that could be handily carried out by secret Operation Gladio-style “stay-behind
      guerrilla forces” which other British academics proposed standing up as part of
      a proposal to strike “sensitive, difficult to repair targets to maximize harm”
      in Russian territory.


      In the face of constant Russian battlefield gains and a looming reduction in Washington’s
      military aid to Ukraine, the British government remains committed to spending
      vast sums on ensuring Kiev has a vast supply of drones at its disposal at all
      times.


      As Ukraine places drone attacks on Russian infrastructure at the heart of its
      increasingly desperate strategy, Project Alchemy’s ISIS-inspired plans are more
      relevant than ever.'

      military strategy.

      by using inexpensive drones to target trains and rail bridges, mirroring strategies
      employed by ISIS. This approach culminated in Ukraine's Operation Spider Web,
      which involved multiple drone attacks that resulted in casualties and significant
      damage to Russian rail lines. The academics, part of a secret initiative called
      Project Alchemy, suggested using modified commercial drones for precision strikes
      and emphasized the psychological impact of such tactics. As Ukraine increasingly
      relies on drone warfare amid a challenging military situation, these strategies
      appear to be shaping its ongoing operations against Russian forces.

      on Iran'

    text: 'A Trump official tells The Grayzone that Israel’s Mossad is using CIA Director
      John Ratcliffe and US CENTCOM’s Gen. Michael Kurilla to influence Trump with cooked
      intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program. Inside the White House, dissenters have
      been isolated, setting the stage for a regime change war that could cost American
      lives.


      Listen to/watch Max Blumenthal read this article here.


      An official in the administration of President Donald Trump has told The Grayzone
      that CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US CENTCOM Commander Gen. Michael Kurilla
      have become vehicles for Israel’s Mossad and military as they seek to manipulate
      the US into attacking Iran. The Trump official referred to Ratcliffe as “Mossad’s
      stenographer.”


      According to the official, Ratcliffe and Kurilla have pressured Trump to join
      Israel’s war more directly by regurgitating overblown briefings they received
      from the Israeli military and Mossad director David Barnea – but without informing
      the president that the intelligence was derived from a foreign third party.


      During the Trump administration’s meetings with Israeli intelligence officials
      including Barnea, the official said the Israelis have demonstrated a single-minded
      focus on regime change, clamoring for authorization to assassinate Iran’s leader,
      Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The Israeli officials have emphasized that the moment
      to take out Khamenei is now.


      The issue of Iran’s nuclear enrichment capacity is of secondary concern in the
      Israelis’ presentations, which the official characterized as tactless, hyper-aggressive
      exercises in fear-mongering. At one point, the Trump official recalled, an Israeli
      intelligence briefer declared that Iran could transfer a nuclear weapon to Yemen’s
      Houthi militia in less than a week.


      According to the official, Trump’s lead negotiator with Iran, Steve Witkoff, has
      been pushing the president to preserve the diplomatic track. However, an Israeli
      assassination of Khamanei would almost certainly be the nail in the coffin of
      nuclear negotiations – which is precisely why the Israelis seem so determined
      to do it.


      If the US enters the war by attacking Iran, the official fears that Iran will
      activate IRGC-backed Popular Mobilization Units to attack US troops and bases
      in Iraq and Syria, leading to American casualties and triggering escalation well
      beyond the initial scope of Iran’s nuclear program.


      Having launched a damaging war of attrition with Iran, Tel Aviv is deploying every
      mechanism at its disposal to compel the US to lurch headlong into the conflict
      it initiated, but which it can not finish on its own.


      Inside the Trump administration, the source told The Grayzone that top officials
      who have questioned the logic of attacking Iran, such as Director of Intelligence
      Tulsi Gabbard and her deputy, former CIA officer and director for the National
      Counter-Terrorism Center Joe Kent, have been excluded from meetings by White House
      Chief of Staff Suzie Wiles.


      Taking the lead in briefing the president is a highly suggestible CIA director
      groomed by Israel since he first entered Congress.

      AIPAC director boasts of influence over Ratcliffe


      This April, The Grayzone released exclusive audio of remarks by AIPAC CEO Elliot
      Brandt to an off-the-record Israel lobby session in Washington DC. Boasting of
      his organization’s success in recruiting members of Congress, he described CIA
      Director John Ratcliffe as a “lifeline” inside the administration.


      “You know that one of the first candidates I ever met with as an AIPAC professional
      in my job when he was a candidate for Congress was a guy named John Ratcliffe,”
      Brandt recalled. “He was challenging a long time member of Congress in Dallas.
      I said, this guy looks like he could win the race, and, we go talk to him. He
      had a good understanding of issues, and a couple of weeks ago, he took the oath
      as the CIA director, for crying out loud. This is a guy that we had a chance to
      speak to, so there are, there are a lot – I wouldn’t call them lifelines, but
      there are lifelines in there.”


      Besides Ratcliffe, AIPAC CEO Elliott Brandt also named Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz,
      two former Republican congressmen cultivated by AIPAC in advance of their appointment
      to key national security positions in the Trump administration.


      “They all have relationships with key AIPAC leaders from their communities,” said
      the AIPAC CEO. “So the lines of communication are good should there be something
      questionable or curious, and we need access on the conversation.”


      This May, Waltz was outed by colleagues for secretly coordinating with Israeli
      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to orchestrate a US attack on Iran, costing
      him his job as National Security Council director. Secretary of State Rubio assumed
      the role of acting National Security Director, granting him control over more
      cabinet level positions than any US official since Henry Kissinger. Meanwhile,
      Ratcliffe quickly emerged as the key channel of Israeli influence in the administration.


      The CIA director has come a long way since entering politics as the mayor of a
      backwater Texas town with a population of 7000.


      A small town Texas mayor becomes big time Israeli asset


      With no experience in the US military or intelligence, Ratcliffe spent the early
      part of his political career as mayor of Heath, a small town outside of Dallas,
      which was broken by a year-long stint as a US Attorney between 2007-08. He entered
      Congress in 2014, and emerged two years later as one of Trump’s fiercest attack
      dogs on the Judiciary Committee. The backbencher also served on the House Intelligence
      Committee.


      Trump rewarded Ratcliffe’s loyalty by nominating him as Director of National Intelligence
      in 2019, but quickly withdrew the nomination after Ratcliffe was exposed for lying
      about his role in several federal terrorism cases.


      His most absurd embellishment was on the prosecution of the directors of the Dallas-based
      Holy Land Foundation, in which he boasted that “he convicted individuals who were
      funneling money to Hamas behind the front of a charitable organization.” In fact,
      Ratcliffe played no discernible role in the case at all, prompting several Republican
      senators to withdraw support for his nomination when the lie came to light.


      It is notable nonetheless that Ratcliffe sought credit for taking down the Holy
      Land Foundation, as the case was one of the most politicized and legally dubious
      prosecutions of the Bush-era “war on terror,” leading to life sentences for Palestinian
      American defendants whose only crime was sending charitable donations to organizations
      in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip which were not on any government watchlist,
      and which also received support from the International Committee of the Red Cross
      and USAID. What’s more, the case was heavily influenced by Israeli intelligence.


      Following a mistrial that proved embarrassing for the US government, Israel’s
      Mossad dispatched an agent to Texas to testify against the Holy Land directors.
      The judge allowed the agent to testify in secret, with the courtroom cleared,
      and under an assumed identity as “Avi.” The agent proceeded to brandish a series
      of questionable documents that supposedly proved the Holy Land Foundation was
      set up as the nexus of a vast terrorist financing network that had enabled several
      suicide bombings by Hamas.


      While Ratcliffe’s fantastical claims about his role in the case tanked his nomination
      in 2019, Trump successfully installed him as DNI the following year, paving the
      way for his nomination as CIA director upon Trump’s re-election.


      In 2024, the Jewish Daily Forward listed Ratcliffe among “Trump’s Jewish advisors
      and pro-Israel cabinet.”


      Chief of Staff Suzie Wiles isolates Trump with “Israel’s favorite general”


      The Trump official told The Grayzone that White House Chief of Staff Suzie Wiles
      has ensured that the president remains surrounded by Ratcliffe and Gen. Michael
      Kurilla in briefings related to Iran.


      Ratcliffe is said to take dictation from the Mossad and read the documents they’ve
      prepared to the president without any sense of critical detachment, or disclose
      that the assessments came from a foreign liaison rather than US intelligence.


      Then there is Gen. Kurilla, who appears singularly focused in meetings with Trump
      on making the case for a US attack on Iran. In 2024, the pro-Netanyahu Israeli
      outlet Israel Hayon described Kurilla as “a vital asset to Israel.” The UK’s Telegraph
      referred to Kurilla this June as “Israel’s favorite general.”


      Former Pentagon officials have even speculated that Israel’s decision to launch
      an unprovoked surprise attack on Iran this June 13 was partially influenced by
      Kurilla’s looming retirement in July, as Tel Aviv did not want to go to war without
      him present at CENTCOM.


      The Trump official told The Grayzone that Wiles has excluded Trump’s Director
      of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, from crucial meetings where US intervention
      in Iran was discussed. That included a June 8 meeting at Camp David where Ratcliffe
      used a clumsy sports metaphor to insist that Iran was just days away from producing
      a nuclear weapon: “It’s like saying a football team marched 99 yards down the
      field, got to the one yard line and, oh, they don’t have the intention to score,”
      he argued to Trump.


      Two days later, Gabbard released a social media video invoking the American military’s
      destruction of the Japanese city of Hiroshima with a nuclear bomb in 1945, and
      warned that a similar horror could soon unfold because “political elite warmongers
      are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers.”


      Trump was reportedly infuriated by her comments. Asked by a reporter about Gabbard’s
      testimony this March that Iran had not restarted its nuclear weapons program,
      Trump grumbled, “I don’t care what she said,” then echoed Ratcliffe’s view – and
      by extension, that of the Israelis: “I think they were very close to having [a
      nuclear weapon].”


      This may explain why Gabbard released a June 20 statement on Twitter/X insisting
      that her views on Iran’s nuclear enrichment were faithfully aligned with Trump’s,
      and had been distorted by a “dishonest media” seeking to “manufacture division.”
      Though the statement reaffirmed her commitment to President Trump, her assessment
      of Iran’s nuclear program did not differ from the evaluation she delivered in
      March, which determined Iran was not currently pursuing a nuclear bomb.


      “America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear
      weapon within weeks to months,” Gabbard claimed on Twitter/X, “if they decide
      to finalize the assembly.”


      According to the Trump official, Chief of Staff Wiles has also excluded Secretary
      of Defense Pete Hegseth from meetings on Iran, relying instead on Kurilla to represent
      the US military.


      Vice President JD Vance has held a parallel series of meetings on Iran, the official
      said. In contrast to those controlled by Wiles, Vance has encouraged robust debate
      and included diverse perspectives. In public, however, Vance is constrained by
      the obligation to demonstrate loyalty to Trump.


      For his part, Trump’s views are said to be shaped by constant exposure to Fox
      News, which has transformed in the past two weeks into a 24/7 commercial for war
      on Iran. Fox News’ coverage has become so transparently influenced by Israel’s
      propaganda machine that Steve Bannon, the former White House chief of staff and
      intellectual architect of the America First movement, called for a Foreign Agents
      Registration Act investigation of the network.


      As Trump heads back to Washington on June 21, Bannon lamented that “the party
      is on,” suggesting the president had decided to go to war on Israel’s behalf.'

      Four ultra-wealthy executives from top tech companies were sworn in to the unit
      ahead of President Trump’s heavily promoted military parade, which was itself
      sponsored by Palantir. The Army’s top spokesman declared that Detachment 201 was
      “being created to bring in tech innovation executives leaders to help the Army”
      with the recruitment and the subsequent training of “tech focused people.”


      “By bringing private-sector know-how into uniform, Det. 201 is supercharging efforts
      like the Army Transformation Initiative, which aims to make the force leaner,
      smarter, and more lethal,” the Army wrote in an official statement.


      GEN George and I are thrilled to welcome four brilliant minds from the tech sector
      to the @USArmy! Today, we commissioned four exceptional individuals as Lieutenant
      Colonels in the Army''s Detachment 201 (Executive Innovation Corps).

      Palantir is by far the S&P 500’s top performing stock of the year, thanks in large
      part to the gargantuan contracts it has raked in from the Trump administration.
      According to the company’s founder, Alex Karp, Palantir “is here to disrupt… and
      when it’s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”


      Shares of the dystopian data firm, which is named after the all-seeing orb used
      by the evil wizard Saruman to surveil Middle Earth in the Lord of the Rings, skyrocketed
      to an all-time high following Israel’s unprovoked assault on Iran.


      Elsewhere, Karp has eagerly embraced the model of disaster capitalism, remarking,
      “bad times are very good for Palantir because we build products… that are built
      for danger.”


      In recent years, Palantir has come to dominate the Western information sphere,
      and now enjoys unfettered access to the sensitive data of citizens in countries
      from the US to the UK. With customers including the Department of Defense, CIA,
      NSA, FBI, ICE, and the Special Operations Command, Palantir has become a one-stop
      shop for weaponized AI-based data analysis. Amid the ruins of the national security
      state’s obsessive search for enemies overseas, Palantir built a reputation for
      being both user-friendly and slavishly obedient to the military establishment.


      “If you do not feel comfortable supporting the legitimate efforts of America and
      its allies in the context of war, don’t join Palantir,” Karp declared.


      In an article published on the day that military officials revealed the creation
      of Detachment 201, Mumbai-born Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar revealed he was among
      the four members of the “nation’s business elite” selected for a “special corps”
      meant to “deploy their technical talents in service of the [US] government.”


      “Later today, on the eve of the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, I will raise my right
      hand, take an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and commission as a
      lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve’s newly formed Detachment 201: Executive
      Innovation Corps,” he boasted.


      Sankar was joined by what he described as “some of the most impressive minds from
      the world of technology: Kevin Weil, the chief product officer of OpenAI; Andrew
      “Boz” Bosworth, the chief technology officer of Meta; and Bob McGrew, formerly
      the chief research officer of OpenAI and engineering director of Palantir Technologies,
      where I work as chief technology officer.”


      The creation of the techie Poindexter Patrol was necessary, Sankar suggested,
      due to a geopolitical “sea change” in which “Wars in Europe and the Middle East
      and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific” have “focused the national
      mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization.”


      Despite his obvious glee at being fast tracked to military leadership, Sankar
      acknowledged it was an unusual arrangement.


      “A decade ago, it would’ve been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly
      align with the U.S. military. Equally, it would’ve been out of character for the
      military to enlist the support of the nation’s business elite— much less to create
      a special corps so they could deploy their technical talents in service of the
      government.”


      The Palantir executive pointed to “exploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes
      from shipping containers” as attacks which “prove that technology has once again
      changed the battlefield,” and that “our military has to change with it.”


      With their newly-minted lieutenant colonels a world away, Palantir’s corporate
      officer corps will not be rallying the troops for the next war. But safely ensconced
      behind their digital curtain, they’ll be watching — and talking the next generation
      of nerds into signing up, too.'

      to leverage the skills of wealthy tech leaders to enhance military recruitment
      and training, particularly in technology-focused roles. The appointments, which
      coincide with a military parade sponsored by Palantir, reflect a growing collaboration
      between the tech sector and the military, as executives like Palantir's CTO Shyam
      Sankar express enthusiasm for this unusual alignment. The move is seen as a response
      to global geopolitical tensions, emphasizing the need for the military to adapt
      to technological advancements in warfare.

  - title: Secret British plans to ‘defeat entire Russian Black Fleet’ revealed in leaks
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/11/uk-plans-russian-black-fleet/
    text: 'Leaked files reviewed by The Grayzone expose the covert war waged by British
      intelligence against Russia in the Black Sea, outlining Ukrainian “honey trap”
      plots along with blueprints for blowing up the Kerch Bridge.


      Sensitive documents reviewed by The Grayzone indicate that the United Kingdom
      is the central architect behind Ukrainian military operations targeting Russia’s
      Black Sea Fleet. Among other explosive findings, the files reveal high-ranking
      British military and intelligence figures drew up detailed plans to “maximize
      attrition of [Moscow’s] Black Sea Fleet,” plotted to blow up the Kerch Bridge
      connecting Crimea to mainland Russia with fertilizer bombs, and even devised blueprints
      for a series of submersibles which would allow Ukrainian divers to plant mines
      on Russian ships and infrastructure.


      Further machinations include an explicit “honey trap” plan which called for establishing
      a brothel secretly run by British intelligence in Crimea. There, Russian-speaking
      female Ukrainian agents would ply “drunken sailors” from the Russian navy for
      information.


      The schemes were assembled by Project Alchemy, a secret British military planning
      cell whose existence was first exposed by The Grayzone.


      Alchemy’s intelligence-aligned director, Dominic Morris, once embedded with British
      special forces in Afghanistan while serving as a “political officer” for the UK
      embassy. The first of the relevant files was sent on April 14, 2022 — the same
      day Ukraine achieved its most spectacular naval success of the war when it sank
      Russia’s flagship in the region, the Moskva.


      That feat was cheered by Western media, with the New York Times heralding the
      ship’s destruction as a “signal triumph – a display of Ukrainian skill and Russian
      ineptitude.” As the previously-unpublished files show, admirers of the operation
      also included Project Alchemy’s Dominic Morris, who saw an opportunity to “defeat
      the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet” and immediately began crafting plans to sink
      the rest of Moscow’s warships.


      The destruction of the Moskva purportedly both surprised and panicked the Biden
      administration, as they apparently didn’t believe Ukraine possessed missiles capable
      of striking such a target and, according to one mainstream report, “hadn’t intended
      to enable the Ukrainians to attack such a potent symbol of Russian power.” But
      the attack apparently convinced the White House and Pentagon to double down on
      their military support for Kiev – and as the documents show, it had the same effect
      across the pond.


      In response to an April 23, 2022 brief authored by a fellow cell member on the
      importance of Western powers supporting Ukrainian “land” operations, Morris declared
      “the sinking of Moskva” meant Kiev should focus predominantly on “maritime” operations
      instead. After complaining that “apart from a little bit of moving tanks and planes
      around a peaceful Europe,” NATO was “not doing any fighting,” Morris wrote that
      he saw a chance for the UK to eliminate every Russian vessel in the region without
      even going to war.


      “You could defeat the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet” with “subthreshold options,”
      he wrote, referring to gray zone tactics which the British military has officially
      defined as “all activity up to, but not crossing, the legal definition of armed
      conflict.” Morris specifically proposed “commando raids” as “a fab subthreshold
      activity that will scare the shit out of” Russian President Vladimir Putin.


      The attack on the Moskva appeared to serve as a catalyst for Alchemy’s “Black
      Sea Operations,” which were already being assembled within a few hours of the
      news breaking. In a document dated the same day as the ship sank, Morris boasted
      that the “current situation in Ukraine gives the West an ideal opportunity to
      degrade Russian military capability by destroying as much Russian equipment as
      possible,” and went on to outline a series of multi-pronged and phased operations
      targeting Russia across the Black Sea. “Inflicting a high casualty rate must continue,”
      because “lots of dead soldiers returning to the mainland will have a big impact
      on public opinion” in Russia, Alchemy’s Morris declared.


      Project Alchemy also proposed a joint UK-Ukrainian intelligence operation in which
      “female agents” were surreptitiously inserted into Russian navy “admin posts.”
      In phase one of the operation, Morris proposed “setting up a bar and brothel”
      in Crimea to “gain intelligence from drunken sailors,” and serve as a “honey trap”
      for military and intelligence officers. “The agents must be Russian speakers and
      attractive, able to manipulate, playing to the weakness of the average Russian
      male,” he stressed.


      In the second phase, Morris proposed an “unconventional option” for blowing up
      Kerch Bridge, in which “a hijacked Russian flagged bulk carrier loaded with fertiliser
      rigged with explosives” would be parked under the Bridge and detonated. Morris
      “assessed this will be a significant kinetic event that will be able to blast
      four – six pillars on the bridge, rendering it unusable for a long period of time.”
      Given Kerch Bridge “was Putin’s crowning glory after taking Crimea,” he suggested
      its total destruction had the potential to foment a palace coup in the Kremlin.


      The Kerch Bridge’s collapse, and the infiltration of spies into Crimea, would
      lay foundations for the third phase: the “main offensive” of seizing the peninsula.
      Alchemy’s previously established “honey traps” could establish covert “safe houses
      and weapon stores” in advance of the mission, Morris suggested. Next, “a direct
      attack against Sevastopol using a tanker fully laden with fuel into Strilets Bay.”
      This would be “in essence a fire ship creating further panic” and “sending a strong
      signal to the Russian Navy [that] nowhere is safe in the region.”


      Finally, Morris advocated that Ukraine pursue a strategy of “containment” by seeking
      to “disrupt” and “capture/reflag the [Black Sea Fleet.]” The idea, the Alchemy
      chief explained, was “to target the Black Sea Fleet with the aim of destroying
      as many ships as possible,” as Moscow’s warships were “trapped with little places
      to hide” there. He urged the “use of civilian vessels retrofitted” with British-supplied
      weaponry, and proposed “ambushes using hijacked Russian ships to lure in a warship
      to be attacked by portable anti-ship missiles.”


      While no such operation ever materialized, Sevastopol has been a consistent target
      of Kiev’s drone and missile blitzes throughout the conflict. In fact, the “Black
      Sea Operations” memo identified the Nakhimov Naval Academy in the Crimean capital
      as an ideal target for such attacks. The institution has been repeatedly rocked
      by Ukrainian strikes during this period. An incendiary strike on Kerch Bridge
      did come to pass in October 2022 – and as The Grayzone revealed at the time, it
      was almost certainly the outcome of blueprints prepared by Project Alchemy.


      In a secret memo one month later, Alchemy leader Dominic Morris stated approvingly
      that the “attack on Kerch” had “hurt” the Russians. Noting that a relatively high-ranking
      Russian politician was personally dispatched to oversee the Bridge’s reconstruction,
      Morris claimed this underlined the attack’s political significance to the Kremlin,
      and added: “It is not an easy repair, they need to replace road [sic] in each
      direction (ie the one that wasn’t hit) and bad weather is slowing them.”


      On April 16, just two days after the Moskva went under, Alchemy’s plans had already
      morphed into a “CONOPS” – military jargon which the US Department of Defense defines
      as a “statement that clearly and concisely expresses what the joint force commander
      intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources.” The
      document, which is entitled “Building Ukraine [sic] Maritime Raiding Capability”
      and closely matches a secret British presentation previously exposed by The Grayzone,
      describes the Moskva’s sinking as “a significant blow to Russian naval capability”
      that left the rest of the Black Sea Fleet “vulnerable to missile attack.”


      According to Alchemy, the sinking of more ships would “force the Russian navy
      farther away from the Ukraine coast or into port, opening the potential for the
      Ukrainian Navy to launch littoral, inshore, coastal and riverine raiding operations.”
      The cell noted “the exploitable sea area” was “relatively small” – “just 160 nautical
      miles from Odessa to Sevastopol as an example,” which was “well within the range
      of small assault crafts.”


      Ukrainian marines and naval forces were to be equipped and trained by the British
      to allow for “ambushing… Russian engineer and Spetsnaz reconnaissance teams” and
      “harassing Russian forces in hit and run operations from the waterways.” These
      teams would also be charged with “[taking] out coastal radar stations,” and thus
      “blinding Russian forces.” As these stations were “likely to be well defended,”
      such attacks would “have to be well planned and hit at lightning speed to ensure
      success and escape,” Alchemy wrote, insisting that “agent[s] already inserted
      into Crimea” from mainland Russia would “provide intelligence for the naval commandos.”


      The battle plans specifically called for Ukrainian commandos to “Hunt and destroy
      any Russian patrol craft operating in Dniprovska Gulf and conduct beach reconnaissance
      from Kilburn [sic] Spit to Yahorlyk Bay to identify good landing locations for
      a larger assault force for a future counter attack.”


      The Kinburn spit, a narrow sandbar which comprises the far western end of the
      Crimean peninsula, has been a frequent target of Ukrainian raids since Russia’s
      seizure of the territory.


      In the document, Alchemy suggested “specialist training for chosen men” who spoke
      Russian to carry out “covert undercover missions.” They would also receive training
      in the use of small arms, sabotage “to disrupt civil installations such as electrical
      substations, railways, cyber, hacking skills, locksmith training, advanced unarmed
      combat,” and how “to identify high ranking military officers for assignation while
      off duty in Crimea.”


      Ukraine trained in planting limpet mines


      A leaked Project Alchemy proposal from September 2022 outlined an elaborate scheme
      based on input from three unnamed British companies to target Russia’s Black Sea
      Fleet while harbored in Sevastopol, strike “civilian vessels” used by Russia to
      move troops and equipment in the Dnipro River, and carry out night-time raids
      on “other maritime environment [sic] being used” by Russian forces. The planned
      military campaign was known as “The Tauris Project.”


      The document noted that Russia’s Navy “need to refuel and reprovision in-between
      deployments,” and Sevastopol “is the primary port” for this purpose. According
      to Alchemy, Sevastopol was the one place Moscow’s Kilo Class submarines were “vulnerable
      to attack,” because in other areas the crafts were “able to operate with impunity
      as Ukraine does not possess the subsurface capability to counter the threat.”


      In Sevastopol, however, the Black Sea Fleet could “easily be destroyed by combat
      swimmers delivered covertly” via crewed submersibles that allow divers to deploy
      underwater covertly, which are known in military parlance as Swimmer Delivery
      Vehicles (SDVs). As Alchemy explained, “Once the combat swimmers are in the port
      they can attach limpet mines to [Russian] ships and submarines before slipping
      silently back to Chornomorsk.”


      Alchemy and its unnamed confederates thus designed an SDV “specifically for operating
      in the coastal area of Ukraine,” with “a superior range to reach Sevastopol from
      Chornomorsk.” The file suggested these vehicles could also be deployed along riverbanks
      to “destroy shipping and hit targets out of range of conventional weapon systems”
      and “provide intelligence on enemy movements.” Dubbed the Tauris 1, it purportedly
      boasted “state of the art” technology, and was “capable of operating surfaced
      or submerged.”


      The Tauris 1 would reportedly transport “one pilot and navigator plus four combat
      swimmers to remote locations on covert missions to include, surveillance, infiltration,
      mine clearance & mine laying,” with a system “designed to be fast when operating
      on the surface” – at up to 30 knots – and “ultra-quiet when submerged…with a very
      low radar signature when operating sub-surface at snorkeling depth.” Meanwhile,
      it could be parked on sea and riverbeds, or automatically surfaced via “a coded
      ping sequence.”


      “We believe that the SDVs will give the Ukrainian Navy a huge advantage in disrupting,
      destroying key [Russian] assets and wider forces deployed in the south,” the document
      bragged. It foresaw 24 – 48 Ukrainian Marines and naval personnel being trained
      over “an eight-week course in a secret location in the UK,” overseen by a technical
      team and instructors comprising “former SDV pilots and navigators who served in
      the UK Special Forces community.” This would include “tactical training and limpet
      mine training.”


      Britain exploits Ukraine for Black Sea control


      The document predicted it would take a year to construct the Tauris 1 SDVs, at
      an eye-popping price of £6 – 8 million per vehicle. While there is no evidence
      that Kiev took Alchemy and its partners up on the proposition, there have been
      numerous examples of kamikaze Ukrainian commando raids on Russian-held territory,
      often using jet skis. In addition to the Kinburn Spit, the Tendra Spit, which
      sits 20 kilometers to its south, has also been a repeat target.


      A typically ill-fated raid which took place on February 28, 2024 saw five Ukrainian
      assault boats immediately come under intensive Russian fire as they approached
      the Tendra Spit, leaving dozens dead and just one watercraft able to escape the
      scene.


      Even doggedly anti-Russian news outlets in Britain were forced to acknowledge
      the debacle, with The Telegraph lambasting the operation as a “failure” and noting
      that it was “not clear what the Ukrainian forces were attempting to achieve.”
      The suicidal raids have drawn comparisons to Kiev’s calamitous attempt to capture
      Krynky, which as The Grayzone revealed, was planned and directed by Project Alchemy.


      Elsewhere, British-backed attacks on Russia’s forces in the Black Sea have been
      more successful. In March 2024, following a series of well-publicized sinkings
      of Russian warships, the UK’s then-Defence Minister Grant Shapps boasted that
      drones and missiles supplied by London had helped Kiev “lay waste to nearly 30
      per cent” of the Russian Navy stationed there. On top of weaponry, it’s likely
      the Ukrainian strikes relied heavily on targeting intelligence provided by Britain’s
      RC-135 spy planes, which ramped up surveillance of Russia assets in Black Sea
      following the proxy war’s outbreak.


      Today, London remains determined to neutralize Russia’s presence in the Black
      Sea. In January 2025, a defense contractor and British government-funded think
      tank known as the Council on Geostrategy floated the idea of deploying a British
      naval task force to the region, to “reshape” its “geopolitics.” The Ministry of
      Defence then invited “industry partners from NATO, Ukraine, and Five-Eyes countries”
      to submit designs and plans for “the development of a versatile, fast, and low-observable
      maritime system designed for operations in Ukraine and beyond.”


      Before the month was over, a UK minister confirmed in parliament that in an attempt
      “to support Ukraine,” the Ministry of Defence had developed two “new uncrewed
      maritime [systems]” that were “undergoing final testing,” which it dubbed ‘Snapper’
      and ‘Wasp.’ The uniquely British obsession with exploiting the proxy war to obliterate
      Russia’s Black Sea Fleet may seem peculiar, given its relative lack of impact
      on the battlefield.


      However, the true motivation was clearly spelled out in a March 2022 Council on
      Geostrategy report, which declared that the hostilities in Ukraine meant London’s
      “stake in the Black Sea region has been elevated.” The paper detailed how control
      of the region was essential for Britain’s intended “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific,
      which was laid out in the official July 2021 “integrated review” of UK security
      and defense strategy. As the Council on Geostrategy explained, “any power controlling
      the Black Sea would be able to exert significant pressure on the key maritime
      communication lines from Europe to the Indo-Pacific.”


      This February, a spate of explosions was reported on tankers in the Mediterranean
      which had recently stopped at Russian ports. Italian investigators suspect Kiev
      was responsible for carrying out at least one of these incidents using limpet
      mines — the same weapon they were trained to use by British intelligence.


      Three years after the Moskva’s sinking, Russia still maintains several naval assets
      in the Black Sea. However, its fleet is unable to leave the confines of Moscow-controlled
      waters in the east. Just how much responsibility Britain bears for this feat remains
      unclear, but Project Alchemy’s files demonstrate a substantial role for the UK
      since the onset of the war.'
    one_sentence_summary: Leaked documents reveal that British intelligence orchestrated
      covert military operations against Russia in the Black Sea, including plans for
      "honey trap" espionage and strategies to destroy the Kerch Bridge, aimed at degrading
      Russia's naval capabilities and supporting Ukraine's military efforts.
    paragraph_summary: Leaked documents reviewed by The Grayzone reveal that British
      intelligence has been orchestrating covert military operations against Russia
      in the Black Sea, primarily through a secretive unit called Project Alchemy. These
      files outline plans to significantly weaken Russia's Black Sea Fleet, including
      strategies for blowing up the Kerch Bridge with fertilizer bombs and employing
      "honey trap" tactics involving Ukrainian agents to extract information from Russian
      sailors. The documents indicate that British military and intelligence officials
      aimed to exploit Ukraine's naval successes, such as the sinking of the Moskva,
      to intensify maritime operations against Russia. Additionally, they proposed the
      use of advanced submersibles for covert attacks and training Ukrainian forces
      for various sabotage missions. While some operations were executed, such as drone
      and missile strikes on Russian vessels, the overall effectiveness of these strategies
      remains debated. The UK’s involvement is framed as part of a broader geopolitical
      strategy to control the Black Sea region, which is deemed crucial for exerting
      influence over maritime routes to the Indo-Pacific.

  - title: Israel arming ‘ISIS-affiliated’ gang in southern Gaza
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/05/israel-arming-isis-gang-gaza/
    text: 'This article was originally published by Antiwar.com


      Israeli opposition leader and former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on
      Thursday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was arming a gang in southern
      Gaza that’s affiliated with ISIS, a charge that has been confirmed by Israeli
      officials.


      “The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons,
      identified with the Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister,” Lieberman
      said. “To my knowledge, this did not go through approval by the cabinet.”


      Liberman compared the arming of the criminal gang to Netanyahu’s previous strategy
      of propping up Hamas as a counter to the Palestinian Authority. “No one can guarantee
      that these weapons will not be directed at Israel. We have no way of monitoring
      or tracking them,” he said.


      Netanyahu effectively confirms Israel is running guns to the “lawless criminals”
      in Gaza who a former Defense minister calls “Salafi jihadists [who] began identifying
      with ISIS.” First they propped up Hamas to prevent a secular gov’t—now they’re

      June 5, 2025


      An initial statement released by Netanyahu’s office didn’t deny the allegation.
      “Israel is acting to defeat Hamas in various and diverse ways, upon the recommendation
      of all heads of the security establishment,” the office said.


      Later, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel has been arming “clans” in southern Gaza.
      “On the advice of security officials, we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas.
      This is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers. The publication of this
      only benefits Hamas – but Lieberman doesn’t care,” he said, according to The Jerusalem
      Post.


      Israeli military sources told The Times of Israel that Israel has been arming
      a group described as a “criminal gang of jihadists” led by Yasser Abu Shabab,
      a member of one of the largest clans in southern Gaza. Israel has been providing
      Abu Shabab’s gang with Kalashnikov rifles, including some that were seized from
      Hamas.


      According to the Times, Hamas sources speaking to Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar newspaper
      said that members of Abu Shabab’s gang belong to an extremist Salafi faction that
      has had run-ins with Hamas.


      Abu Shabab’s gang has been operating in Israeli-controlled areas of southern Gaza
      and has been involved in looting aid shipments. Last year, an internal UN memo
      identified Abu Shabab’s gang as “the main and most influential stakeholder behind
      systematic and massive looting” of aid trucks. Haaretz also reported last year
      that the Israeli military was allowing armed gangs to loot aid convoys and extort
      protection fees from drivers.


      In an interview with The Washington Post, Abu Shabab admitted that he and his
      group “take from trucks” but claimed they didn’t touch “food, tents, or supplies
      for children.” According to a report from The New Arab, Abu Shabab is affiliated
      with Shadi al-Soufi, another gang leader who was detained by Hamas in 2020 over
      an alleged murder. The report said al-Soufi fled Gaza with the help of ISIS and
      returned following the start of Israel’s genocidal war.


      Abu Shabab, who was imprisoned by Hamas for drug trafficking before an Israeli
      airstrike allowed him to escape, recently released a video where he said his new
      armed group “cleared” eastern Rafah of Hamas fighters and said Palestinians could
      return to the area, which is under the control of the IDF.


      Yair Golan, another Israeli opposition leader and retired IDF general, slammed
      Netanyahu for arming the gang in a post on X. “Netanyahu, who transferred billions
      to Hamas in cash suitcases, based on a misguided notion that Hamas is an ‘asset’
      and that it would end in flip-flops, is now promoting a new dangerous notion:
      arming a Gazan militia with ties to ISIS,” he said.


      “Netanyahu is dangerous to Israel’s security. Instead of securing a deal, creating
      arrangements with the moderate Sunni axis, and bringing back the hostages and
      security to Israel’s citizens, he is creating a new ticking bomb in Gaza,” Golan
      added.'

      this action as reckless, suggesting it mirrors Netanyahu's past strategy of supporting
      Hamas to counter the Palestinian Authority, raising concerns that the weapons
      could eventually be used against Israel. Netanyahu's office confirmed that Israel
      is indeed arming "clans" in Gaza to combat Hamas, asserting that this strategy
      is intended to protect Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers. Reports indicate
      that the gang, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, has been involved in criminal activities,
      including looting aid shipments. Opposition figures, including retired IDF general
      Yair Golan, have condemned Netanyahu's approach, warning that it poses a significant
      threat to Israel's security by fostering extremist groups in the region.

  - title: Trump’s embrace of dystopian Palantir spying tool sends stock soaring
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/06/04/trumps-palantir-spying-stock/
    text: 'The Trump administration has charged the surveillance firm Palantir with
      agglomerating the US population’s personal data across government agencies, raising
      alarm about a centralized spying tool targeting hundreds of millions without oversight.
      Wall Street responded to the news by sending Palantir’s stock price to unprecedented
      heights.


      During an end-of-year investor call this February, Palantir co-founder and militant
      Zionist Alex Karp bragged that his company was making a financial killing by enabling
      mass murder.


      “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very
      best in the world and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies,” he stated, adding:
      “And on occasion, kill them.”

      is to shareholders while admitting .. "When it''s necessary to scare enemies and
      on occasion kill them .. And we hope you''re in favor of that" Right before he
      dumped $1.23 Billion in company stock pic.twitter.com/gLdiMLS4xj — Nightwatch
      N8 (@NightwatchN8) February 20, 2025


      On this front, Karp claimed Palantir was “crushing it,” and he professed to be
      “super-proud of the role we play, especially in places we can’t talk about.”


      Karp went on to predict social “disruption” ahead that would be “very good for
      Palantir.”


      “There’s a revolution. Some people are going to get their heads cut off,” he warned,
      suggesting that his firm was producing the most vital technology enabling elites
      to restore control during the coming unrest.


      Palantir is already playing a decisive role in the besieged Gaza Strip, where
      its products assists Israel’s application of a ferocious AI targeting system known
      as Lavender which directs its ongoing genocide. In the face of public protest,
      Karp has acknowledged that he is directly involved in killing Palestinians in
      Gaza, but insisted the dead were “mostly terrorists.”


      At the start of January, the overtly pro-Israeli firm’s board of directors gathered
      in Tel Aviv for its first meeting of the new year. Since then, its financial fortunes
      have improved dramatically.


      Throughout May, Palantir’s stock exploded, making it the S&P 500’s top-performing
      company. On June 2, Palantir’s share price hit an all-time high, a year-on-year
      jump of 512%, turbocharging the company’s market value to roughly $311 billion.
      Driving this abrupt burst of investor exuberance was a series of lucrative deals
      signed with multiple US government agencies since Donald Trump took office, and
      the expectation Palantir will ink massive contracts going forward.


      Palantir’s products expand mass surveillance at home, Pentagon targeting across
      the globe


      On May 30th, the New York Times published a lengthy probe linking these deals
      to an executive order signed by Trump in March, calling for seamless, mass sharing
      of data across government agencies through a Palantir application called Foundry.


      The report did not explain to readers how Palantir emerged as a small startup
      thanks to sponsorship from the CIA’s venture capital wing, In-Q-Tel, which gifted
      Peter Thiel’s company $2 million in 2004. Instead, the paper leaned in to a partisan
      angle playing on Democratic fears that Trump could abuse a unified database to
      target political foes.


      Nonetheless, the Times provided valuable insight into Palantir’s penetration of
      a vast array of US government agencies, by raking in more than $113 million in
      federal government spending since Trump took office, on top of “additional funds
      from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland
      Security and the Pentagon.” In late May, the company’s existing contract with
      the Department of Defense was beefed up by $795 million, bringing it to an eye-popping
      total award of $1.3 billion.


      Palantir currently provides the Pentagon with AI targeting software known as Maven,
      which it uses in battlefields from Syria to Yemen to Ukraine and beyond. The contract
      will last until at least May 2029. The Trump administration’s fondness for Palantir
      has placed its data analytics and storage tool Foundry in at least four federal
      agencies, including the DHS and Health and Human Services Department. Talks are
      also apparently ongoing with the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue
      Service to adopt the resource. This would facilitate merging all these agencies’
      datasets.


      According to the Times, Palantir was selected to deliver on Trump’s order to enhance
      intradepartmental data sharing by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.
      At least three DOGE members previously worked at the company, while two others
      have worked at Thiel-funded firms. The outlet cited leaked screenshots indicating
      DHS officials exchanged emails with DOGE in February about merging citizen records,
      while quoting nameless Palantir employees worrying “about collecting so much sensitive
      information in one place,” particularly given the allegedly “sloppy” approach
      to security of “some DOGE employees”.


      While focusing heavily on the risks posed by Trump’s embrace of Palantir technology,
      the Times acknowledged in passing the company “has long worked” with different
      branches of the US federal government, including the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention. In February 2022, Palantir was enlisted by the Biden administration
      to manage Covid vaccine distribution. Meanwhile, in April, Immigration and Customs
      Enforcement’s “removal operations team” gave Palantir $30 million “to build a
      platform to track migrant movements in real time.”


      Karp, for his part, has infuriated Trump’s base by boasting during an interview
      in Davos, Switzerland in 2023 that he “singlehandedly stopped the rise of the
      far-right in Europe” through an application called PG. The following February,
      he claimed before an audience at the Future Investment Initiative Institute that
      by supposedly stopping “innumerable terror attacks” across Europe, Palantir prevented
      the resurgence of fascism.


      “I love when I’m getting yelled at in cities in Europe,” Karp declared. “Keep
      yelling at me… the only reason why someone’s not goose-stepping between me and
      you is my product,” he laughed.

      Palantir penetrates the West as privatized national security state backbone


      For years, Palantir has been at the heart of US-led efforts to neutralize Iran’s
      alleged nuclear program. It has created a predictive analytical tool dubbed Mosaic
      for the purpose, used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and US officials
      to visualize ties between the people, places and material involved in the Islamic
      Republic’s nuclear activities. Data harvested and pored over by the resource includes
      potentially tainted material supposedly stolen from Tehran by Mossad.


      Such work mimics the services Palantir has provided for US government agencies
      such as the CIA, DHS, FBI, and Pentagon. These entities routinely turn over untold
      quantities of data to the firm to exploit for a variety of applications. For example,
      Palantir’s Gotham tool has been weaponized by the US military to supposedly predict
      insurgent attacks. In Afghanistan, it combined maps, intelligence briefings, and
      incident reports for mission planning, leading Bloomberg to dub Palantir the “secret
      weapon” of the so-called war on terror.


      Meanwhile, documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden indicate the US
      signals intelligence giant and its British counterpart GCHQ have relied heavily
      on Palantir’s products. A leaked 2011 presentation connected the company’s wares
      to multiple secret Five Eyes spying operations, and provided glowing personal
      testimonials from the agencies’ analysts. One crowed: “[Palantir] is the best
      tool I have ever worked with. It’s intuitive, i.e. idiot-proof, and can do a lot
      you never even dreamt of doing.”


      Local law enforcement agencies are also making use of Gotham. The total number
      of forces worldwide using the technology is unknown, but leaked Los Angeles Police
      Department training documents on Gotham, including an ‘Intermediate Course’ and
      an ‘Advance Course,’ shed significant light on the tool’s internal workings. The
      sheer volume of data collected on citizens – whether they are law-abiding, are
      suspected of having committed a crime, or are simply connected to individuals
      accused of wrongdoing – is staggering.


      This includes sex, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots,
      surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, tattoos,
      scars, piercings and other identifying features. Such a cutting-edge service doesn’t
      come cheap, and Gotham subscriptions run to millions of dollars annually. The
      vast windfall reaped from multiple state entities since Palantir’s inception has
      made the firm’s founders very wealthy indeed – Karp’s personal worth alone is
      currently estimated at $12.2 billion – and allowed the company to go public in
      September 2020.


      On top of the privacy concerns raised by a secretive company with access to so
      much private data, the practical efficacy of Palantir’s technology has also come
      under scrutiny its Foundry application was implanted in Britain’s NHS in December
      2020. That’s when Palantir was awarded a legally dubious no-bid contract to run
      the Service’s Covid-19 Data Store for two years despite warnings that the company
      could preside over “an ‘unprecedented’ transfer of citizens’ private health information”
      into its own database.


      The following year, the NHS awarded Palantir a $447 million contract to build
      a “Federated Data Platform” combining the medical records of all British citizens.
      Next, the British government paid millions to a consultancy firm called KPMG to
      market Palantir’s platform to local NHS Trusts, which oversee the administration
      of individual hospitals throughout the country. Since then, several senior medical
      officials have warned that Palantir’s technology was inferior to current systems,
      and could actually hinder NHS work.


      Yet British PM Keir Starmer has continued his government’s cooperation with Palantir,
      even visiting the company’s offices in downtown Washington DC immediately after
      meeting with Trump this February. Louis Mosley, the head of Palantir UK, cheered
      Starmer’s attitude after the visit: “You could see in his eyes that he gets it.
      The ambition is there – the will is there.”


      Palantir’s Mosley happens to be the grandson of Sir Oswald Mosley, the World War
      II-era Nazi sympathizer who led the British Union of Fascists.


      Keir Starmer made a special trip to Palantir while he was visiting the US at the
      end of February & apparently "enthused about how Britain wouldn’t over-regulate
      AI, instead seizing its opportunities in pursuit of ''a new economic deal'' with
      advanced technology at its core." pic.twitter.com/piC0vdL76b — 12 Ball (@BoltzmannBooty)
      March 21, 2025


      While Thiel’s personal affinity for Trump and close relationships with key members
      of the president’s cabinet may have eased Palantir’s entry into sensitive government
      areas, the company’s current trajectory has been years in the making. Having penetrated
      the national security state of countries across the West, the firm and its messianic
      CEO are working to consolidate a trans-Atlantic network of control with unprecedented
      powers, lucrative profits, and a growing body count.'
    one_sentence_summary: The Trump administration's partnership with Palantir, a surveillance
      firm accused of aggregating personal data across government agencies, has raised
      concerns over centralized spying without oversight, while the company's stock
      has soared due to lucrative government contracts and its controversial role in
      military operations, particularly in the Gaza Strip.

      criticisms regarding the efficacy of its technology, Palantir continues to expand
      its influence in national security and surveillance, benefiting from close ties

      aid initiative is the linchpin of Israel’s plan to ethnically cleanse northern
      Gaza by forcing the starving population into concentration camp-like hubs.


      Israel’s scheme to commandeer aid distribution in Gaza ended in chaos on May 27,
      with Israeli soldiers reportedly opening fire on stampeding crowds of hungry Palestinians
      after just 8000 boxes of rations were handed out by an opaque organization calling
      itself the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).

      Founded this February in Switzerland under a cloud of mystery, GHF serves as an
      umbrella for a network of private mercenary firms which Israel is using to supplant
      the role of the United Nations in feeding Palestinians after bringing them to
      the brink of starvation.


      At the moment, the public has no idea who is funding the opaque aid boondoggle.
      A GHF spokesman told the Washington Post “the foundation has already secured $100
      million from an undisclosed donor.”


      Right-wing Israeli opposition figure and Member of Knesset Avigdor Lieberman proclaimed
      that GHF’s mysterious financial angel was, in fact, the Israeli government. “The
      money for humanitarian aid comes from the Mossad and the Ministry of Defense,”
      Lieberman wrote on Twitter/X, complaining, “Hundreds of millions of dollars at
      the expense of Israeli citizens.”

      and Israeli Defense Ministry are covertly funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,

      with Trump admin political cover pic.twitter.com/tOWa8E6HzM — Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal)
      May 27, 2025


      Yair Lapid, a Member of Knesset and de facto leader of Israel’s loyal opposition,
      has accused the Israeli government of funding two “shell companies,” pointing
      to GHF and the private mercenary firm, Safe Reach Solutions, which was founded
      by former CIA field operative Phillip Reilly. Two former US officials told the
      Qatari-owned outlet Middle East Eye that Reilly “had won the trust of Israeli
      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several Israeli businessmen close to him.”


      If true, this would mean Israel’s military-intelligence apparatus is effectively
      laundering massive sums of money through a weaponized aid scheme that forms the
      linchpin of its plan to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza. A leaked internal GHF
      document acknowledged that the food distribution centers and residential compounds
      it was constructing in Gaza could be perceived as “‘concentration camps’ with
      biometrics.’”


      The GHF model appears integral to Israel’s stated plan to occupy 75% of the Gaza
      Strip, forcing starving and homeless Palestinians into what its military has branded
      as “humanitarian islands” designed to “divide and rule” the decimated enclave.
      It is also a clear attempt at replacing UNRWA, the United Nations agency that
      has tended to the needs of Gaza’s refugee population since 1949, and which the
      Israeli Knesset designated as a terrorist organization in 2024.


      GHF’s creation can be traced directly to the Israeli government’s COGAT office,
      which presides over the siege of Gaza, as well an Israeli entrepreneur named Liran
      Tancman, who was described in one report as “a reservist in the IDF’s 8200 signals
      intelligence unit, who called for using biometric identification systems outside
      the distribution hubs to vet Palestinian civilians.”


      With no legal standing or formal mandate to operate in Gaza, GHF now operates
      at the pleasure of Israel’s occupation army. But with an endorsement from the
      Trump administration, and with US mercenary muscle maintaining its dystopian distribution
      centers, the scheme functions behind an American facade.


      Just a day before GHF’s planned roll-out in Gaza, the organization’s CEO, Jake
      Wood, resigned in protest, condemning the group’s failure to uphold “humanitarian
      principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality.” Next, GHF’s COO, David Burke,
      fled for the emergency exit. David Kohler, a Swiss board member, has also resigned
      without explanation.


      Following their departure, leadership of the murky outfit passed to John Acree,
      a former USAID administrator who recently accused the President of giving a “free
      pass” to Russia in a rambling Facebook post lashing out at the “criminal” Trump
      for defunding his longtime employer.


      Even after the situation at GHF’s militarized aid outpost in western Rafah ended
      in mayhem on May 27, a network of shady mercenary firms including Safe Reach Solutions
      and UG Solutions have continued to offer high-paying positions to potential guns-for-hire.


      A job listing for UG Solutions appeals to “snipers” with “prior experience in
      combat zones,” the “highest level of weapons proficiencies,” and “advanced combat
      skills” who could “operate effectively in high-threat environments.” Preference
      would be given to “Special Forces qualified personnel,” as well as “personnel
      with OSINT/Intelligence Background.”


      UG Solutions’ founder, Jameson Govoni, has described himself as a “degenerate
      from Boston” who “joined the Army as fast as I possibly could to inflict pain
      on the people who inflicted pain on us.” He also founded a company called “Alcohol
      Armor” that markets hangover recovery solutions supposedly based on his expertise
      in getting wasted. “In the military, we’re hands down the worst drinkers in the
      fucking world. I’ve had my stomach pumped,” Govoni’s business partner, Glenn Devitt,
      boasted.


      Phillip Reilly, the normally publicity hungry former CIA field operative who founded
      Safe Reach Solutions (SRS) – a partner of GHF and UG Solutions – has not spoken
      on the record to any media organization to date about his apparently lucrative
      exploits in Gaza.


      SRS first appeared in Gaza this January, when a collection of middle aged mercenaries
      portrayed in US media as “suburban dads” established a checkpoint along the Netzarim
      Corridor, an area severing Gaza’s northern and central regions which the Israeli
      military has used as a base for abusing and massacring civilians.


      An SRS document circulated to potential supporters (see below) appealed for “humanitarian
      partners” to help transform its checkpoint into “an aid distribution point.” Days
      later, GHF was founded in Geneva, Switzerland.


      A GHF document distributed to the media in early May listed an array of corporate
      heavy hitters and former US officials as board members, and boasted of partnerships
      with financial institutions like Goldman Sachs. Its board included Raisa Sheynberg,
      a former Treasury Department official who served on the public policy team of
      Meta’s original Libra cryptocurrency project, and David Beasley, the former South
      Carolina governor and ex-head of the World Food Program.


      The press release pledged that GHF leaders would put “humanity first” as they
      “pursue pragmatic approaches to intractable problems.”


      Among the most notable figures implicated in the GHF scandal is Nate Mook, the
      former CEO of World Central Kitchen. Named as a board member of GHF, and listed
      as a founder of the group on its incorporation forms, Mook is now denying any
      role in the outfit while ducking from the media.


      The hidden Chef Jose Andres connection


      On the day of GHF’s calamitous launch in southern Gaza, Spanish celebrity chef,
      World Central Kitchen founder and ex-State Department “culinary ambassador” Jose
      Andres slammed the boondoggle, writing on X, “The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation
      has left Palestinians without food. The people that created it are selfish.”


      The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has left Palestinians without food. The people
      that created it are selfish. And now because people are really hungry just stormed

      system of kitchens… pic.twitter.com/A0NQ6snUb1 — Chef José Andrés 🕊️🥘🍳 (@chefjoseandres)
      May 27, 2025


      Chief among those “selfish” figures would be the former CEO of Andres’ World Central
      Kitchen, Nate Mook. As shown by Israeli journalist Uri Blau, incorporating documents
      filed with Swiss authorities list Mook as the founder of GHF. He was also named
      as a board member of the group on the document GHF distributed to the media about
      its launch. Since the resignation of GHF’s leadership, however, Mook has denied
      any formal role in the group while refusing to discuss the issue with journalists.


      Andres owes much of his image as a globe-trotting humanitarian hero to a 2022
      public relations vehicle packaged as a documentary and humbly entitled, “We Feed
      People.” The film as directed by Hollywood bigwig Ron Howard and produced by Mook,
      who worked at the time as the CEO of World Central Kitchen (WCK).


      According to his bio at the arms industry-funded McCain Institute, where he currently
      serves as “Special Advisor on Ukraine,” Mook boasts that he has worked with Andres
      since 2012, “building WCK from one employee and under $1 million per year to $400
      million in global impact in 2022.”


      Despite his condemnation of GHF, Andres played an early and important role in
      the project to subvert Gaza’s humanitarian aid system away from the UN, and into
      line with Israeli objectives. As The Grayzone reported, Andres oversaw WCK’s effort
      in 2024 to construct a pier made of the rubble of homes in Gaza, which would have
      enabled the offloading of aid to kitchens it ran across Gaza in coordination with
      the Israeli military.


      When Spain’s then-Minister for Social Rights, Ione Belarra charged Israel with
      genocide in Gaza, Andres leapt to the apartheid state’s defense, insisting on
      Twitter/X that Israel was merely “defending its citizens,” declaring that Belarra
      did “not deserve to be minister,” and accusing her of “pro-Hamas” sympathies.


      All the while, Andres continued to cozy up to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
      who appointed him as a “culinary ambassador” for the Department of State in Feb.
      2023. As recently as Sept. 2024, nearly a year into Israel’s genocidal siege of
      Gaza, Andres was seen partying at a reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art
      alongside Blinken, then National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, and corruption-stained

      GHF forced out of Switzerland, flees to safer ground in US


      This May 29, Swiss officials announced that GHF was violating several laws for
      foundations registered in that country. The shadowy organization subsequently
      announced that it is moving its operations to the US, where it is likely to receive
      less scrutiny from a Trump administration that endorsed its creation.


      Though its chaotic launch in Gaza generated international headlines, GHF remains
      shrouded in mystery, with masked mercenaries manning its operations on the ground,
      and a cast of corporate lawyers operating behind a series of shell companies whose
      coffers have filled up with millions of dollars from an unknown source.


      Perhaps the only thing that seems certain about the opaque entity is that its
      presence will deliver more misery to the population of Gaza behind the guise of
      charity.'
    one_sentence_summary: Top Israeli lawmakers have accused their government of laundering
      funds through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a shadowy organization linked
      to private mercenary firms, as part of a plan to ethnically cleanse northern Gaza
      by forcing its starving population into controlled zones, amid chaotic aid distribution
      efforts that ended in violence.
    paragraph_summary: Top Israeli lawmakers have accused their government of laundering
      significant funds through a clandestine network of U.S. humanitarian and mercenary
      organizations, particularly the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which aims
      to facilitate Israel's plan for ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza. The GHF, founded
      in Switzerland and linked to private mercenary firms, has taken over aid distribution
      in Gaza, leading to chaos and violence as starving Palestinians attempted to access
      food supplies. Critics, including Israeli opposition figures, allege that the
      Israeli government is covertly funding GHF and its associated companies, which
      operate without legal standing in Gaza. The situation escalated when GHF's leadership
      resigned amid accusations of failing to uphold humanitarian principles, and the
      organization announced its relocation to the U.S. for less scrutiny. The GHF's
      operations, characterized by biometric surveillance and militarized aid distribution,
      have drawn condemnation from various quarters, including celebrity chef José Andrés,
      who criticized the foundation for exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

  - title: Docs expose Israeli influence on UK anti-genocide protest prosecutions
    url: https://thegrayzone.com/2025/05/27/israeli-interference-uk-protests/
    text: 'Files reviewed by The Grayzone reveal a shocking foreign meddling scandal,
      as British state prosecutors are seen colluding with Israeli authorities to classify
      anti-genocide protesters as terrorists and imprison them on heavily politicized
      grounds.


      Documents released by the British government reveal that London has been coordinating
      with Israeli officials to prosecute protestors associated with activist group
      Palestine Action for disrupting the operations of Elbit Systems, which manufactures
      deadly weapons being used in the genocide in Gaza.


      The documents highlight a years-long Israeli influence campaign, and suggest that
      Tel Aviv’s meddling has prompted London to abandon well-established legal standards
      in order to charge anti-genocide activists under highly politicized counter-terror
      provisions.


      One especially revealing document shows the British Attorney General’s Office
      (AGO) furnishing their Israeli counterparts with guidance on how to avoid an arrest
      warrant for war crimes, reassuring them that the Crown Prosecutorial Service (CPS)
      “has strengthened the procedural safeguards around the issuing of private arrest
      warrants in recent years.”


      The Israelis have been on edge since former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni was forced
      to cancel a trip to London in 2009 after a UK court issued an arrest warrant for
      her involvement in the blood-stained assault on Gaza that year. Leaked Israeli
      Ministry of Justice files revealed how Tel Aviv subsequently initiated an intensive
      – and ultimately successful – lobbying campaign to guarantee its officials “special
      mission” certificates which allowed them to visit London without the fear of arrest.
      As Declassified UK reported, the British government has granted Israel three special
      mission certificates through the Gaza genocide.


      Another startling file released by the British government revealed that Nicola
      Smith, the Head of International Law at Britain’s Attorney General’s Office, shared
      “contact details” for UK prosecutors and counter-terror investigators with Israel’s
      deputy ambassador to London.


      The email was sent to Israel’s deputy envoy, Daniela Grudsky Ekstein, with the
      subject line “Nicola Smith to Israelis re CPS/SO15 contact details,” indicating
      the UK government had referred Tel Aviv directly to the CPS, or Crown Prosecutorial
      Service, as well as to SO15, London’s counter-terror squad, to advance the prosecution
      of activists affiliated with Palestine Action.


      Smith’s email, sent on September 9, 2024, came less than two weeks after Ekstein
      and Smith held an in-person meeting on August 29, 2024, at Israel’s notoriously
      spy-infested embassy in London. The message is chummily addressed from “Nicky”
      to “Daniela,” suggesting warm relations between the two.


      Earlier that month, 10 Palestine Action activists were imprisoned after raiding
      an Elbit factory in Filton, South West England. They destroyed Israeli quadcopters
      constructed on the grounds. These small drones have been routinely used to maim
      and murder Palestinian civilians in the besieged Gaza Strip.


      Activists who demonstrated against Elbit are currently being detained under “counter-terror”
      powers, despite facing non-terror related charges such as criminal damage, prompting
      UN rapporteurs to issue a statement condemning their confinement. The CPS has
      indicated it will argue their offenses had a “terrorist connection” in order to
      maximize their sentences.


      The files released by the British government suggest the Israeli government has
      pushed for incarceration and prosecution of the Palestine Action demonstrators,
      who were known at the time as the “Filton 10.”


      The August 2024 rendezvous was not the first face-to-face interaction between
      Smith, the international law advisor to the UK AGO, and the deputy Israeli ambassador,
      Ekstein. A month beforehand, the two met alongside Israeli Embassy Counsellor
      of Political Affairs Yosef Zilberman and UK AGO Director Douglas Wilson. The back-to-back
      meetings hint at frequent coordination between the British and Israeli embassies
      – a notion reinforced by declassified emails reviewed by The Grayzone from May
      2022 showing Israeli embassy officials in London secretly met with AGO representatives,
      including Wilson.


      Though records of the summit are redacted, it seems Tel Aviv was trying to interfere
      in ongoing cases against Palestine solidarity protesters. In a subsequent email
      to Israeli embassy apparatchiks, Wilson signed off, “I know from previous experience
      there is well-established direct contact between [our] legal teams, both between
      capitals and via our missions in New York.”


      Three months after AGO officials provided the Israeli embassy with contact details
      of the officers investigating the activists behind the raid of the Filton facility,
      ten more Palestine Action demonstrators involved in the action were arrested.
      Eight were subsequently charged and remanded in prison under the same counter-terror
      powers as the previous ten, and the group is now referred to as the “Filton 18.”
      If Israel was in any way responsible for this move, it would represent a clear
      breach of core CPS code, and another layer in what appears to be a major foreign
      meddling scandal.


      As the Service’s General Principle 2.1 explicitly states, British “prosecutors
      must be free to carry out their professional duties without political interference
      and must not be affected by improper or undue pressure or influence from any source.”


      Palestine Action cofounder Huda Amori has insisted that Tel Aviv is influencing
      the British prosecutions of anti-genocide protesters. “There is clear evidence
      showing continuous political and foreign interference in Palestine Action cases,”
      Amori told The Grayzone, and that “the ongoing prosecutions of journalists and
      activists who dare stand up for Palestine is politically motivated, and done under
      the influence of the Israeli embassy.”


      “Any violation of the independence of the judiciary is an abuse of process under
      the rule of law,” she continued. “Therefore, the prosecutions must be stopped
      and the prisoners freed.”


      Long-running secret collusion


      Emails obtained by The Grayzone show collusion between British law enforcement
      bodies, Elbit Systems, and the Israeli embassy in London has been ongoing for
      several years. On March 2, 2022, then-Home Secretary Priti Patel met with Elbit’s
      British CEO Martin Fausset. The meeting’s explicit objective was to reassure the
      international death merchant “that the criminal protest acts against Elbit Systems
      UK are taken seriously” by authorities in London.


      A briefing note for Patel outlined “key points to raise” with Fausset. “Palestine
      Action’s criminal activity is for the police to investigate,” one note stated.
      But while local law enforcement were ostensibly “operationally independent of
      government,” the document revealed that Home Office officials had “been in contact
      with the police about [Palestine Action].”


      The declassified record is heavily redacted, although an unexpurgated segment
      on “lines to take” during the secret summit directed Patel to “thank Martin for
      the work Elbit does in support of the British Armed Forces.” A subsequent internal
      email discussing the meeting was then dispatched to various senior Home Office
      “counter-terror” officials, including Michael Stewart, then-chief of Britain’s
      notorious PREVENT program.


      The email summarized the meeting and “immediate next steps as a priority.” Fausset
      was quoted complaining that “the protests Elbit were experiencing from Palestine
      Action were getting more and more severe,” with “well organised, funded and trained”
      protesters, and “a significant online effort to mobilise and train.” Patel was
      reportedly “deeply concerned about everything she heard,” and proposed a variety
      of measures be taken in response.


      Because the documents are heavily redacted, it is unclear what occurred at Patel
      and Fausset’s meeting. Prior to their discussion, not a single Palestine Action
      member had been convicted for targeting Elbit Systems. Just one month later though,
      the British state made the unusual step of appealing the acquittal of four activists
      who toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in June 2020. The
      perpetrators walked free after asserting human rights defenses, which had been
      employed by Palestine Action demonstrators to beat charges of criminal damage
      on previous occasions.


      However, in the Colston case, the court ruled that human rights defenses could
      only be relied on in cases of vandalism of public property, not in cases where
      criminal damage has been caused to private property. Because Elbit is a private
      company, the Attorney General’s Office used this determination to dramatically
      increase prosecutions of Palestine Action activists.


      ‘Terror’ accusations continue despite lack of charges


      The Grayzone has reviewed a declassified February 1, 2023 email sent by a redacted,
      presumably internal British government source to AGO Director Douglas Wilson,
      describing a meeting six days earlier between his office and several Israeli diplomats.
      “The meeting was at the Embassy’s request and covered a variety of topics,” first
      and foremost a “joint declaration” between London and Tel Aviv’s respective Ministries
      of Justice. It was presented by Israel’s then-Deputy Ambassador to Britain, Oren
      Marmorstein, now chief of the Zionist entity’s public affairs and media division.


      The declaration “sought closer bilateral cooperation between the two ministries
      on mutual areas of responsibility” – “namely, legislation and legal reform, civil
      and criminal law and legal education.” As this fell outside the AGO’s jurisdiction,
      Wilson “undertook to engage the relevant leads in the Ministry of Justice on this
      topic for them to engage with the [Israeli] Embassy.” This followed an email to
      Tel Aviv’s London-based diplomats in which British Justice officials promised
      they’d be “in contact with you shortly.”


      “The Attorney General would be delighted to meet with her Israeli counterpart
      if you have any suggestion of suitable dates for a meeting in London,” the email
      cheerily added.


      The interpretation that Tel Aviv influences British laws to the detriment of Palestine
      solidarity activists is reinforced by numerous sections of London’s National Security
      Act, which came into force December 2023. These passages give every appearance
      of being custom built to legally neutralize Palestine Action’s wrecking campaign
      against Elbit Systems.


      Priti Patel introduced the legislation in her capacity as Home Secretary. She
      was reinstated to government in 2019 after being forced to resign from a previous
      position in November 2017 for holding 12 secret meetings with Israeli officials
      without official authorization or notification.


      On April 19, 2023 Britain’s then-Policing Minister Chris Philp met with representatives
      of the AGO, Home Office, several police forces and bodies, Elbit Systems, and
      the company’s French arms supplier Thales, to discuss “Palestine Action criminality.”
      According to an internal readout, “Minister Philp opened the meeting [by] emphasising
      that the UK government wants to make sure that UK based business can continue
      in their lawful activity.” A representative of Elbit “gave an overview of Palestine
      Action (PA) attacks on initially Elbit and now their supply chain.” Due to heavy
      redactions, it’s unclear what decisions, if any, were made regarding prosecutions
      of activists.


      But if the prior meeting between Elbit and then-Home Secretary Patel was any indication,
      acquittal and conviction of Palestine Action members was likely a key subject
      of interest for attendees. During their March 2022 discussion, the British government
      openly acknowledged that Palestine Action “does not meet the threshold for proscription”
      as a terrorist group under British law, “as they do not commit, participate in,
      prepare for, promote, encourage, or otherwise be concerned with acts of terrorism.”


      The recent invocation of counter-terror powers to imprison Palestine Action demonstrators
      may indicate the British government has identified a legal fudge that allows authorities
      to treat the group as a terrorist entity, despite its lack of formal proscription.
      The Filton 18’s pre-trial detention period runs to 182 days, well in excess of
      typical limits for non-terror-related crimes. Their contact with the outside world
      is also severely restricted, again contrary to standard British jurisprudence.


      This May 1, British prosecutors inexplicably announced that “terrorism connections”
      would also be considered in the trial of 10 Palestine Action demonstrators who
      attacked Elbit supplier Instro Precision in June 2024. Again, the charges – aggravated
      burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder – did not fall under even the most
      expansive definition of terrorism. Such considerations, the CPS states, will only
      be explored at the point of sentencing.


      The documentation reviewed by The Grayzone strongly implies these unprecedented
      breaches of long-established legal standards directly result from an extensive
      campaign of Israeli influence and meddling.


      The mother of one imprisoned but as yet unconvicted Filton 18 activist told The
      Grayzone that revelations of AGO officials readily involving Israeli officials
      in the prosecution of her 21-year-old daughter Zoe made her “feel physically sick.”
      Zoe has now been in prison for eight months without trial. It will have been 15
      months by the time her trial begins in November.


      “Zoe took direct action against Elbit Systems because she could not bear to see
      her country being complicit in a genocide,” said the jailed activist’s mother.
      “She saw the UK committing war crimes by arming Israel, so she took action to
      uphold international law. Now we know it’s that same unholy alliance between Israel
      and the UK that conspired to use UK counter terror powers against Zoe and the
      Filton 18.”'
    one_sentence_summary: Documents obtained by The Grayzone reveal a foreign meddling
      scandal in which British prosecutors are collaborating with Israeli authorities
      to label anti-genocide protesters as terrorists and imprison them under politicized
      counter-terrorism laws, undermining established legal standards in the process.
    paragraph_summary: The Grayzone has uncovered a significant scandal involving British
      state prosecutors allegedly colluding with Israeli authorities to label anti-genocide
      protesters as terrorists and imprison them under politically motivated charges.
      Documents reveal that the UK government has been coordinating with Israeli officials
      to prosecute activists from Palestine Action for disrupting operations at Elbit
      Systems, a company manufacturing weapons used in the Gaza conflict. The British
      Attorney General's Office has reportedly provided guidance to Israeli counterparts
      on avoiding arrest warrants for war crimes, indicating a long-standing influence
      campaign by Israel. Activists involved in protests against Elbit have faced severe
      legal repercussions, including being charged under counter-terrorism laws despite
      their actions not constituting terrorism. The revelations suggest a troubling
      breach of legal standards and judicial independence in the UK, driven by foreign
      interference from Israel, raising serious concerns about the politicization of
      the legal system in relation to Palestine solidarity activism.
