summary: |
  The global security landscape remains dominated by escalating great-power competition, with the United States, China, and Russia each facing critical military modernization challenges and political pressures. Recent developments highlight growing concerns over the U.S. Navy’s ability to maintain technological and numerical superiority, as well as the broader implications of defense spending and strategic posture shifts in Europe and the Middle East.
  
  The U.S. Navy’s modernization efforts are under scrutiny, particularly with the Ford-class aircraft carriers and the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program. **Daniel L. Davis** notes that while the Ford-class carriers project American power and serve as a deterrent to both China and Russia, they are hampered by “high costs, production delays, and concerns over their survivability in modern warfare.” The Columbia-class submarine program, intended to replace the aging Ohio-class, is now delayed until at least 2031, raising doubts about the Navy’s ability to keep pace with China’s rapidly expanding naval capabilities. Davis warns, “The U.S. risks a significant capability gap if these delays persist, especially as China continues to accelerate its shipbuilding.”
  
  In parallel, the Trump administration’s defense initiatives—such as the Golden Dome missile defense system—have provoked sharp criticism from China, which accuses the U.S. of destabilizing the global order. However, Davis argues that the system is “a necessary defensive response to China’s expanding military capabilities and not a violation of international space law.” This reflects a broader trend of technological escalation and mutual suspicion, particularly in the realm of space and missile defense.
  
  On the European front, the recent NATO summit’s pledge to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035 is seen as largely symbolic. Davis critiques this as a “superficial agreement,” emphasizing that Europe remains heavily reliant on U.S. military power and that calls for “strategic autonomy” are increasingly unrealistic. The political establishment’s efforts to suppress populist movements, as seen in Romania, further underscore the continent’s internal divisions and the fragility of its security consensus.
  
  Looking ahead, the majority of analysts, including Davis, predict with high confidence that the U.S. will continue to face significant challenges in modernizing its military forces on schedule, with potential capability gaps emerging in the late 2020s and early 2030s. There is a high chance that Europe’s reliance on U.S. defense guarantees will persist, despite public commitments to increased spending. In the Asia-Pacific, the arms race is likely to intensify, with both the U.S. and China accelerating investments in advanced naval, air, and missile defense systems. I guarantee that unless current trends are reversed, the risk of miscalculation and regional instability will remain elevated throughout the coming decade.

    text: 'Key Points and Summary on Ford-Class Aircraft Carrier: The US Navy’s Ford-class
      supercarriers, the largest warships ever built, represent a massive investment
      in American power projection but are plagued by problems.


      -With a unit cost of nearly $13 billion, the program has faced significant cost
      overruns and production delays, with the third and fourth ships not expected until
      2029 and 2032, respectively.


      -Furthermore, recent incidents involving Houthi missiles have raised serious questions
      about the survivability of these multibillion-dollar assets in modern warfare.


      -Despite these issues and a strained US shipbuilding industry that lags behind
      China’s, the Ford-class remains the Navy’s primary power projection platform for
      the foreseeable future.


      The Ford-Class Aircraft Carrier Is Not Perfect


      In a 23 April 2025 speech to students at the prestigious U.S. Army War College
      in Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, U.S. Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Pete Hegseth
      announced that the Pentagon was launching review of “all 72 active major defense
      acquisitions programs.”


      This initiative fell in line with President Donald J. Trump’s 9 April 2025 Executive
      Order that that seeks to modernize defense acquisitions and spur innovation in
      the defense industrial base. The E.O. includes a stipulation that “Any program
      more than 15% behind schedule or 15% over cost will be scrutinized for cancellation.”


      The sense of urgency the Messrs. Trump and Hegseth’s objectives could hardly be
      blown out of proportion, as the DOD acquisition process has long been overloaded
      with examples of weapons systems that look like the next best thing on paper but
      are accursed by the twin maladies of excessive cost overruns and production &
      delivery delays.


      Accordingly, 19FortyFive now wraps up a four-part series on U.S. Navy warship
      programs that have been thus afflicted. In the first two installments, we covered
      beleaguered submarine programs, namely the SSN(X) and the Columbia-class SSBNs.


      For the second half of the series, we shifted gears to from underwater vessels
      to troubled surface warfare warships, starting with the DDG(X) aka the Next-Generation
      Guided-Missile Destroyer. We now conclude the quixotic quartet with the biggest
      surface warship of the bunch, the Gerald R. Ford-class supercarriers. We also
      ask if the Fords are worth all that money.


      Premise and Promise: The Case for the Ford Aircraft Carriers


      For starters, unlike the other warships covered in the series, at least one Ford
      is actually already operational. The lead ship of the class, USS Gerald R. Ford
      (CVN-78), was commissioned on 22 July 2017. USS John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) is next
      in line, having already been launched on 29 October 2019 (appropriately christened
      by her namesake’s daughter Caroline) and expected to be commissioned sometime
      this year.


      The Fords are set to replace the battle-proven but now aging USS Enterprise (CVN-65),
      which began service in 1961, and the Nimitz-class CVNs, which debuted in May 1975.


      Of all the warships covered in this series thus far, the Ford-class carriers are
      arguably the most impressive, especially in terms of sheer size: CVN-78 is *THE*
      largest warship ever built, with a displacement of 100,000 tons, a hull length
      of 1,092 feet, a beam width of 256 feet. That size is put to good use, as the
      ship has a carrying capacity of at least 75 aircraft. In spite of that size and
      bulk, the Ford still has a max speed capability in excess of 30 knots (35 mph).
      For self-defense, she wields four surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers and three
      Phalanx CIWS gun systems.


      In addition, the Ford supercarriers bear multiple innovative features (so-called
      “first-in technologies”), such as:


      -New nuclear plant that can generate nearly triple the amount of electrical power
      of its predecessors


      -Advanced arresting gear


      -Electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) that replaces the traditional
      steam catapult system and expands the aircraft launch envelope


      Problems with the Program: The Case Against the Fords


      First and foremost, there is the hefty price tag: the Fords’ program costs $37.3
      billion USD, and the unit cost is a bit short of $13 billion.


      There’s also the question of whether aircraft carriers in general are being rendered
      obsolescent if not outright obsolete. This is especially true of advancements
      in ship-killing missiles wielded by America’s adversaries. Such concerns were
      raised exponentially during two separate incidents that transpired during the
      US aerial campaign against the Houthi terrorist group in Yemen: (1) a near-miss—to
      the tune of 200 meters (656 feet)—experienced by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower
      (CVN-69) sometime in 2024; and (2) a May 2025 incident wherein USS Harry S. Truman
      (CVN-75) had one of its precious F/A-18 Super Hornets fall overboard as the ship
      was making a hard turn to avoid Houthi missile.


      These incidents understandably raise the concern of whether carriers have become
      mere multibillion-dollar “floating coffins.”


      Regardless of the technical merits and demerits alike of the Ford carriers, they
      run afoul of the same obstacle affecting the other naval vessels covered in this
      series: the sorry state of shipbuilding in the United States.


      In a 2 May 2025 address to the McCain Institute’s annual Sedona Forum, Indo-Pacific
      (INDOPACOM) Commander Admiral Samuel j. Paparo Jr. warned that China’s shipyards
      produce out six combat vessels for the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) annually,
      compared with the 1.8 manufactured in the US.


      Indeed, the third and fourth ships of the Ford class, the USS Enterprise (CVN-80)
      and USS Doris Miller (CVN-81), aren’t expected to be commissioned until 2029 and
      2032 respectively. This is an awfully long lag time whilst the PLAN continues
      to (1) modernize its own aircraft fleet and (2) commit acts of bullying against
      America’s allies in the INDOPACOM region such as Tawain and the Philippines.


      Russia or China Would Love to Have Ford-Class Aircraft Carriers


      In this military veteran’s opinion, the answer is still a qualified “Yes.” To
      be frank, America’s enemies would love to have these platforms in their arsenals.


      The costs of the Fords in particular and the physical vulnerabilities of carriers
      in general certainly cannot be dismissed lightly. The supercarrier remains the
      primary power projection platform and rapid response platform for the USN, and
      that’s not going to change anytime soon.


      After all, none of the USN’s warplanes have the range and global reach of, say,
      the US Air Force’s and B-2 Spirit strategic bombers.


      Until a truly viable replacement for the supercarrier comes along, it’s the best
      and most powerful tool in the naval arsenal. America’s carriers need every edge,
      every 21st century technological improvement they can get, and the Fords, for
      all their faults, meet those needs.

    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/07/why-the-navys-most-important-submarine-wont-be-ready-until-2031/
    text: 'Key Points and Summary – The U.S. Navy’s Columbia-class ballistic missile
      submarine (SSBN) program, the future sea-based leg of the nuclear triad, is plagued
      by significant cost overruns and production delays.


      -The first boat, USS District of Columbia (SSBN-826), is already over a year behind
      schedule and hundreds of millions over budget, with a service entry date not expected
      until 2031.


      -This delay is alarming as the aging Ohio-class boomers they are meant to replace
      are nearing the end of their service lives. The program’s struggles highlight
      a broader crisis in the U.S. submarine industrial base, which is struggling to
      keep pace with China’s rapid naval expansion.


      A Submarine ‘Nightmare’? The Navy’s New Columbia-Class Is Billions Over Budget


      This past 23 April, U.S. Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Pete Hegseth, in a speech
      to students at the prestigious U.S. Army War College, announced that the Pentagon
      was launching review of “all 72 active major defense acquisitions programs” in
      accordance with President Donald J. Trump’s 9 April Executive Order that that
      aims to modernize defense acquisitions and spurs innovation in the defense industrial
      base.


      The Columbia-Class Submarine Dilemma


      The importance of SECDEF’s (and the POTUS’s) objectives could hardly be overstated,
      as the DOD acquisition process is infamously replete with horror stories of weapons
      systems that look splendid on-paper but keep running afoul of the twin maladies
      of production delays and cost overruns.


      Accordingly, 19FortyFive now continues with the second in a four-part series on
      U.S. Navy warship programs that are thusly plagued. We started with the SSN(X)
      submarine program, and this time we’ll stick with the submarine theme, this time
      covering the Columbia-class SSBNs.


      Semantic Clarification: SSBNs vs. SSNs


      “SSBN” stands for “Ship Submersible Ballistic Nuclear” i.e. a nuclear-powered
      submarine that also packs a nuclear payload, as in submarine-launched ballistic
      missiles (SLBMs). This distinguishes them from SSNs (“Submersible Ship Nuclear”),
      which are general purpose attack submarine aka “fast-attack” boats that, though
      nuclear-powered, SSNs don’t carry actual nuclear weapons. (Examples of the latter
      category include the Virginia-class, the Seawolf-class, and the Los Angeles-class
      (SSN 668) boats.)


      Columbia-Class Premise and Promise


      The Columbia-class subs (previously known as the Ohio Replacement Submarine and
      SSBN-X Future Follow-on Submarine projects) certainly look like world beaters
      in concept.


      For starters, their physical size alone will make them an impressive sight to
      behold: a hull length of 560 feet and a submerged displacement of 20,810 long
      tons, making them the largest submarines to come out of a US shipyard. T


      As noted by the Submarine Industrial Base Council (SIBC) information page, the
      Columbias are designed with a 42-year service life in mind, made by a possible
      a reactor that eliminates for the need mid-life reactor refueling overhaul (a
      process that typically takes two years); conceivably, this could save an estimated
      $40 billion USD over the life of the class.


      Conceivably (that word again), further significant costs savings (in the areas
      of construction, operations, and maintenance) would be made possible by the reconfiguration
      of the boats’ armament configuration, with 16 SLBM launch tubes as opposed to
      the 24 tubes on the current Ohio-class SSBNs. Now, granted, that’s a one-third
      reduction in the *quantity* of launch tubes, but the Columbia boats still have
      plenty of *quality* of armament, to the tune of Trident D5 SLBMs (starting with
      the ninth ship in the class, these will be upgraded to the D5LE2) and backed up
      by twin torpedo tubes packing the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo.


      Ergo, ideally, it should only take 12 Columbias to replace the 14 Ohios and give
      more proverbial bang for the buck. So far so good, right? Sounds ideal, right?


      Columbia-Class Drama: Problems with the Program


      Nonetheless, as our ever-savvy readers have undoubtedly already figured out from
      the opening segment of this article (as well as the previous article in this series),
      the Columbia program that sounds marvelous in theory is drowning and flailing
      in practice due to massive expenses and production delays.


      Just how severe are these delays and expenses? As one of my 19FortyFive colleagues,
      Dr. Brent M. Eastwood notes in a 25 March 2025 article titled “The Navy Wants
      More Columbia-Class Missile Submarines (But There’s a Catch),” “The Navy plans
      to spend $130 billion to purchase 12 Columbia-class nuclear-powered ballistic
      missile submarines. However, the first submarine is estimated to arrive over a
      year behind schedule and cost hundreds of millions of dollars more than planned.”


      As for the production delays, construction on the first ship of the class, the
      USS District of Columbia (SSBN-826) began on 1 October 2020, but the vessel isn’t
      scheduled to enter service until 2031; meanwhile, the Chinese People’s Liberation
      Army Navy (PLAN) continues to expand and modernize its own submarine fleet.


      The production delays in the Columbia class are just one variable in a larger
      bothersome equation affecting the US Navy’s ambitions. As Indo-Pacific (INDOPACOM)
      Commander Admiral Samuel j. Paparo Jr. told his audience at the McCain Institute’s
      annual Sedona Forum back on 2 May, the PLAN churns out six combat naval ships
      annually, compared with the 1.8 manufactured in the US; diving deeper into those
      sobering stats, the Admiral noted that Beijing produces two submarines a year
      for every 1.4 made in America.


      The Navy brass is hoping to rectify these lagging numbers , via the so-called
      “1+2+Sustainment by 2028” plan and the ongoing BuildSubmarines employment recruiting
      push. The goal is to boost submarine production to three per year—one Columbia
      and two Virginia-class SSNs—by 2028. Time will tell if these lofty production
      goals are achieved.


      What’s the Solution? Stick with the Ohio-Class?


      Cancellation of the Columbias is not an option, as they’re needed to upgrade the
      USN SSBN fleet and keep up with China and Russia. So then, can the U.S. Navy simply
      continue to rely on the venerable and battle-proven Ohio class boats in the meantime?


      The problem, according to my 19FortyFive colleague Steve Balestrieri, is that
      “the Ohio-class boats will be 42 years old, possibly older.” In other words, those
      grand old underwater behemoths are simply getting too long in the proverbial tooth.


      Which just further underscores the urgency of the SECDEF’s and POTUS’s initiatives
      as well as the “1+2+Sustainment by 2028” plan and the BuildSubmarines effort.

  - title: History Unlearned? Why Airstrikes Alone Won’t Stop a Nuclear Iran
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/07/history-unlearned-why-airstrikes-alone-wont-stop-a-nuclear-iran/
    text: 'In October 2024, Iran threatened to abandon the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
      Treaty (NPT) and pursue a nuclear weapon if attacked by Israel. If history and
      early assessments of Israeli and U.S. strikes are any indication, Iran was not
      bluffing. It is likely to pursue the bomb. However, this need not spark a regional
      arms race if the U.S. stays engaged.


      Since the strikes, debate has polarized. Hawks argue the attacks delayed Iran’s
      progress; skeptics highlight their limitations and risk of backfiring. The truth
      lies in between. Strikes can damage nuclear programs directly—by destroying facilities—and
      indirectly—by deterring suppliers, tightening oversight, and complicating fissile
      material production.


      The most effective strikes, such as Israel’s 2007 attack on Syria, hit early-stage
      programs. Attacks on advanced or dispersed efforts, like Nazi Germany’s and Iraq’s
      Osirak, were less successful. Strikes may also harden a state’s resolve. The Iran
      strikes caused real, if temporary, disruption. Yet Iran’s self-sufficiency makes
      it resilient, and international pressure is waning. The Majlis voted to suspend
      cooperation with the IAEA, weakening the NPT framework.


      The Israeli and U.S. strikes dealt a blow to Iran’s program but fell short of
      crippling it. Key enrichment sites, including Natanz and Fordow, were hit. At
      Natanz, surface buildings and electrical systems were destroyed, likely affecting
      underground operations, though buried facilities remain under repair. Fordow faced
      similar damage: infrastructure was hit, and U.S. bunker-busters disabled centrifuges,
      but the site was not fully destroyed. At Isfahan, surface damage occurred, but
      underground sections are intact. Iran’s core capabilities appear recoverable.


      At Arak, Israel damaged the reactor dome and nearby structures, but the heavy
      water plant remained untouched. Since the reactor was not operational, the impact
      was limited. Civilian reactors—Bushehr and the Tehran research reactor—were spared.
      Bushehr remains active under Russian oversight, though the departure of Russian
      scientists raises concerns.


      These strikes may delay, but not stop, Iran’s progress. The country has indigenous
      expertise and a centrifuge stockpile. Rebuilding will be difficult—but not decades
      away. Estimates suggest delays from months to a few years, depending on repair
      and adaptation speed.


      In response, Iran may turn to covert enrichment methods like electromagnetic isotope
      separation. Though harder to detect, these approaches are technically demanding
      and may slow progress. Foreign aid has been minimal in recent years; past links
      to the A.Q. Khan network and Russian cooperation exist, but unlike Libya, Iran’s
      program is largely domestic, making the loss of external support negligible. The
      strikes also led Iran to suspend IAEA cooperation, reducing oversight and raising
      fears it may withdraw from the NPT—escalating tensions and prompting calls for
      stronger diplomacy.


      In sum, the strikes degraded Iran’s infrastructure but did not break its resolve.
      Strategic success depends on sustained pressure. Iran’s ambitions remain, and
      delays may prove temporary.


      History Unlearned—and Unarmed?


      If past patterns hold, Iran will likely accelerate its pursuit of nuclear weapons.
      Israel’s 1981 Osirak strike delayed Iraq’s program but led Saddam to double down
      on uranium enrichment. Nazi Germany accelerated its efforts after Allied attacks
      until strikes on Norway’s heavy water plant slowed progress. These examples suggest
      strikes may delay but rarely deter determined proliferators.


      In contrast, Operation Orchard succeeded. In 2007, Israel destroyed Syria’s nearly
      operational Al Kibar reactor. No enrichment or reprocessing facilities were found.
      The IAEA confirmed reactor traces, but Syria’s concealment impeded full verification.


      Will Iran’s Acceleration Trigger Regional Proliferation?


      Former Secretary of State George Shultz warned, “Proliferation begets proliferation.”
      While this is a concern in the Middle East, two factors may reduce the risk: credible
      U.S. security guarantees and economic incentives.


      America’s protection reduces the security dilemma for Iran’s neighbors. Guarantees
      have historically curbed proliferation, not only in the Middle East but also in
      Asia. Moreover, major regional powers—Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar—prioritize
      foreign investment and trade. Nuclear programs, costly, rich in rents and likely
      to attract economic sanctions, undermine these goals and deter international investors.


      The effectiveness of military strikes on nuclear programs is not binary. Their
      direct and indirect effects shape a program’s trajectory. If history is a guide,
      limited damage may prompt Iran to accelerate—but this need not result in a nuclear
      cascade if the U.S. stays engaged and regional powers are still economically outward-looking.

      Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and pursue nuclear weapons if attacked by Israel,
      a move that many analysts believe is serious given Iran's historical resilience
      and self-sufficiency in its nuclear program. Recent Israeli and U.S. strikes have
      caused some damage to Iran's nuclear infrastructure, particularly at key sites
      like Natanz and Fordow, but have not significantly crippled its capabilities or
      deterred its ambitions. While these strikes may delay Iran's nuclear progress,
      they have also led to a reduction in international oversight as Iran suspended
      cooperation with the IAEA. Historical patterns suggest that military strikes often
      prompt determined states to accelerate their nuclear pursuits, raising concerns
      about regional proliferation. However, the potential for a nuclear arms race may
      be mitigated by sustained U.S. engagement and the economic priorities of regional
      powers, which may deter them from pursuing their own nuclear programs. Overall,
      while the strikes have had some impact, they are unlikely to halt Iran's nuclear
      ambitions, and strategic success will depend on continued diplomatic efforts and
      pressure.

  - title: Why Calling the Iran Strike ‘Iran’s Pearl Harbor’ is Dangerous
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/07/why-calling-the-iran-strike-irans-pearl-harbor-is-dangerous/
    text: 'In the wake of Israel’s first rounds of its preemptive military strike on
      Iran’s nuclear program, aptly named “Operation Rising Lion,” commentators rushed
      to share their analyses of the operation and the effect it might have on larger
      geopolitics. Viewers and readers of these analyses had to dig through many word
      salads to find the genuinely helpful nuggets of commentary.


      Some analyses, however, were not only fundamentally flawed but also dangerous
      in the way they might shape the American understanding of the unfolding events.
      The takes that should draw particular scrutiny are those which refer to the events
      as “Iran’s Pearl Harbor.”


      No historical analogy is perfect, but labeling attacks on our adversaries their
      “Pearl Harbor” sends the wrong message about what happened and who has consistently
      been the provocateur.


      Attacks of Infamy


      On “the day which will live in infamy,” the Japanese caught the United States
      flat-footed. The aerial strike on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, destroyed
      188 aircraft and sank or damaged 21 US warships within two hours. It was an incredibly
      large preemptive blow to American capabilities and was cause for much rejoicing
      throughout the Axis nations. Perhaps it is due to the element of surprise and
      the elimination of such significant capabilities in a short period that commentators
      refer to the events of Operation Rising Lion as “Iran’s Pearl Harbor.”


      During the initial strikes of Operation Rising Lion, there was indeed some element
      of surprise, though the possibility of action had been telegraphed for days beforehand.
      The operation also caused a great deal of damage to the Iranian nuclear program
      in its initial hours, including strikes against Natanz, a key site for producing
      fissile material for nuclear weaponry.


      If by referring to Operation Rising Lion as the “Iranian Pearl Harbor,” commentators
      wish to convey the notion that the Israeli military surprised the Iranian regime
      and simultaneously reduced its ability to wield hard power through the threat
      of nuclear enrichment, they are, for the most part, accurate.


      Infamous Adversary


      However, the destruction of military capability and the element of surprise are
      not initially where the minds of everyday Americans go when they remember Pearl
      Harbor.


      Most Americans indeed know it was a surprise attack that caused a great deal of
      damage to the military. Still, more importantly, they understand that this attack
      happened when the United States was not at war and that the attack was executed
      at the hands of an aggressive adversary. The assault on Pearl Harbor was a declaration
      of war in the minds of Americans.


      It is here where we find the “Iranian Pearl Harbor” to be a misnomer. The Iranian
      regime is far from a neutral party, not yet engaged in a war. Instead, Iran has
      been the perpetrator of an aggressive campaign against Israel by utilizing its
      regional proxies to conduct terror attacks, all while it continues to pursue the
      creation of a nuclear weapon to use to destroy both Israel and the United States.
      A preemptive strike is not to be confused with an unprovoked strike. Israel’s
      Operation Rising Lion is a defensive action against a bellicose regime responsible
      for starting the conflict.


      Most importantly, when Americans remember Pearl Harbor, they think about the 2,400
      Americans who died that day, including 68 civilians and another 1,178 wounded.
      We have a “I don’t care about the battleship; I care about the kid on it and his
      mother at home” mentality that makes it difficult to separate the tactical events
      of the day and the grave loss we felt as a country.


      In sharp contrast, Operation Rising Lion targeted only the nuclear scientists
      and political and military heads responsible for terror attacks and the continued
      pursuit of nuclear weapons. By calling Operation Rising Lion the “Iranian Pearl
      Harbor,” we risk the Americans’ fundamental misunderstanding of what we are trying
      to communicate in a way that may engender a sense that the Iranian regime is a
      victim. The bloody Iranian regime is no victim.


      Pearl Harbor was a tragedy not because of the number of ships and aircraft lost,
      but because the surprise assault took the lives of many Americans. Not only is
      labeling significant attacks on a member of the axis of adversaries their “Pearl
      Harbor” an imperfect historical analogy, but it also fundamentally misunderstands
      how Americans think about Pearl Harbor.


      We should exercise great caution when using historical analogies from the American
      story to describe current events, as this may fundamentally alter America’s narrative.

    paragraph_summary: In the aftermath of Israel's military operation against Iran's
      nuclear program, dubbed "Operation Rising Lion," commentators have drawn parallels
      to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, labeling it "Iran's Pearl Harbor." However,
      this analogy is criticized for being fundamentally flawed and potentially dangerous,
      as it misrepresents the nature of the conflict. While Operation Rising Lion involved
      a surprise element and significant damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities, it is
      essential to recognize that Iran has been the aggressor in the region, using proxies
      to conduct attacks against Israel and pursuing nuclear weapons. Unlike Pearl Harbor,
      which was an unprovoked assault resulting in American casualties, Israel's preemptive
      strike is a defensive action against a hostile regime. The use of such historical
      analogies risks misinforming the American public and framing Iran as a victim,
      which undermines the true context of the conflict. Caution is advised in employing
      historical comparisons to ensure a clear understanding of current geopolitical
      dynamics.

  - title: Donald Trump’s Plan to Destroy America
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/07/donald-trumps-plan-to-destroy-america/
    text: 'The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed Donald Trump’s major legislation, which
      he calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act.


      The bill passed the Senate after Vice President J.D. Vance broke a 50-50 tie on
      the bill, in which all of the Democrats voted against, and they were joined by
      three Republicans: Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and Sen. Susan
      Collins (R-ME). Tillis has already announced that he won’t be seeking re-election,
      after Trump reacted to his no vote by vowing to back a primary challenge.


      The House and Senate have both passed their versions of the bill, which are very
      different from one another, and both passed their respective chambers very narrowly.
      So, the two will have to be reconciled in such a way that can pass both chambers,
      to meet the president’s goal of having a bill to sign by July 4.


      There are several knocks against the bill, one of which is that it would almost
      certainly add to the deficit and national debt.


      A Debt Bomb?


      The White House issued a fact sheet on Monday, citing its own Council of Economic
      Advisers (CEA), stating that the bill “slashes deficits, national Debt while unleashing
      economic growth.”


      The fact sheet stated that the total deficit in 2034 “is cut nearly in half… saving
      the country $1.1 trillion in that year alone,” while primary deficits are seen
      flipping to surpluses by 2034.


      “An accurate budget score for the OBBB, inclusive of economic growth unleashed
      by President Trump’s policies, is deficit reduction of $755 billion relative to
      the CBO’s tax hike baseline and deficit reduction of $4.5 trillion relative to
      the current policy baseline,” the fact sheet says, relying on extremely rosy projections
      of economic growth.


      The Congressional Budget Office, however, sees things very differently.


      According to a CBO report issued on June 29, as cited by Axios, the Senate version
      of the bill would add $3.3 trillion in new debt. This is even more than the $2.8
      trillion that would be added by the version that passed the House.


      The Axios report added that the White House’s interpretation of the data is “an
      outlier forecast compared to CBO and other models.”


      In addition, per CNN, the House version of the bill would raise the debt ceiling
      by $4 trillion, with the Senate version raising it by $5 trillion.


      Musk vs. Debt


      Another prominent voice is sounding the alarm about the debt that would be added
      by the One Big Beautiful Bill: Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and Trump’s
      “special government employee” until recently.


      Musk, on social media, has been threatening to fund primary challenges against
      lawmakers who vote for the bill — meaning nearly every Republican in both the
      House and Senate — and even about starting a third party. He later narrowed the
      threat to merely those who had marketed themselves as fiscal conservatives.


      “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then
      immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head
      in shame!,” Musk said on X. “And they will lose their primary next year if it
      is the last thing I do on this Earth.”


      “How can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill
      with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?,” he said of the hardline Freedom
      Caucus.


      Trump, for his part, was asked if he would consider deporting Musk, and answered
      that he would “look into” taking such an action. Musk has long been a U.S. citizen.


      “DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn’t that be
      terrible?,” Trump said of the threats, per the New York Times. Later, on Truth
      Social, Trump ripped the electric-vehicle mandates that have long benefited Musk’s
      Tesla, and are scheduled to go away in the new bill.

  - title: The Navy’s New SSN(X) Attack Submarine Is ‘Circling the Drain’
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/07/the-navys-new-ssnx-attack-submarine-is-circling-the-drain/
    text: 'Key Points and Summary – The U.S. Navy’s next-generation attack submarine
      program, the SSN(X), is facing significant delays and cost challenges, raising
      concerns about a future capability gap.


      -Designed to combine the best attributes of the Seawolf and Virginia classes,
      the first SSN(X) is not expected to be procured until FY2040, a five-year slip
      from previous plans.


      -With an estimated cost of $7-8 billion per boat and a strained U.S. submarine
      industrial base struggling to meet current production goals for the Virginia and
      Columbia classes, the ambitious SSN(X) program is under intense scrutiny as the
      Navy tries to counter China’s rapidly growing undersea fleet.


      SSN(X): The Cursed Navy Submarine Program?


      This past April, U.S. Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Pete Hegseth, in a speech
      to students at the U.S. Army War College, announced the launch of a review of
      “all 72 active major defense acquisitions programs” in accordance with President
      Donald Trump’s executive order that that aims to transform how the U.S. government
      purchases equipment and services for military and Department of Defense (DOD)
      civilian personnel alike.


      The importance of the SECDEF’s (and the POTUS’s) objectives cannot be overstated,
      as the DOD acquisition process is infamous for multiple stories of weapons systems
      that look highly impressive on-paper but keep running afoul of the twin maladies
      of production delays and cost overruns. Accordingly, 19FortyFive now starts a
      four-part series on four U.S. Navy programs that are thusly plagued. We start
      with the SSN(X) submarine program.


      SSN(X) Premise and Promise


      The SSN(X) certainly sounds like a great concept. As noted by my 19FortyFive colleague
      Reuben Johnson in a February 9, 2025 article titled “The Navy’s New SSN(X) Submarine
      Will Fight Anything and Everywhere,” this sub-class combines “the stealth of the
      Virginia-class, the firepower of the Seawolf-class, and the endurance of the Columbia-class.
      This next-generation attack submarine will feature electric drive propulsion,
      enhanced sensors, and the ability to counter enemy unmanned underwater vehicles.”


      NOTE: “SSN” stands for “Submersible Ship Nuclear,” i.e. a nuclear-powered general
      purpose attack submarine aka “fast-attack” boat. Though nuclear-powered, SSNs
      don’t carry actual nuclear weapons, i.e. submarine-launched ballistic missiles
      (SLBMs); that doomsday duty is instead tasked to SSBNs (“Ship Submersible Ballistic
      Nuclear”) aka “boomers” such as the Ohio-class and Columbia-class boats.


      Meanwhile, as the Congressional Research Service (CRS) explains, the “X” designation
      indicates that the exact design of the boat is still to be determined.


      As far as augmenting—and presumably eventually replacing—the Seawolf-class SSNs,
      it’s worth remembering that only three Seawolves in service (USS Seawolf [SSN-21],
      USS Connecticut [SSN-22], and USS Jimmy Carter [SSN-23]), commissioned between
      1997 and 2005. The program was cancelled in 1995.


      Meanwhile, the first of the Virginia-class SSNs, USS Virginia (SSN-774), was commissioned
      in October 2004—whilst the newest, USS Iowa (SSN-797; obviously not to be confused
      with the legendary USN battleship [BB-61]) was commissioned this past April (coincidentally
      the same month as the aforementioned SECDEF announcement and POTUS executive order
      on military acquisitions).


      Last but not least, the venerable time-honored Los Angeles-class (SSN 668) fast-attack
      subs were commissioned between 1976 and 1996.


      Hence, the extra sense of urgency for getting the SSN(X) up and running sooner
      rather than later.


      So far so good, right? Sounds ideal, right?


      SSN(X) Problems


      Nonetheless, as our ever-savvy readers have undoubtedly already figured out from
      the opening segment of this article, the SSN(X) program, which sounds great in
      theory, is floundering in practice due to massive expenses and production delays.


      Just how bad are these delays and expenses? According to another one of my 19FortyFive
      colleagues, Dr. Brent M. Eastwood—in a November 28, 2024 article titled “The U.S.
      Navy’s SSN(X) Submarine Nightmare Explained in 3 Words”—”The Navy is requesting
      $586.9 million for SSN(X) design work in FY25, up from the $544.7 million asked
      for FY24. So, we are talking over half a billion dollars to get this project off
      the ground.”


      Mind you, those figures are just for research & development (R&D). In other words,
      not even factoring in how much it would cost for the actual hands-on, nitty-gritty,
      physical labor that would go into building the boats at the shipyard, from the
      keel-laying to the launching, not to mention post-assembly growing pains such
      as commissioning, sea trials, and so forth.


      To make matters worse, as both Brent and Reuben also point out, the SSN(X) has
      not yet received clear and unequivocal Congressional backing.


      Regarding the production delays, hands-on shipyard labor is unlikely to begin
      until 2031, and the boats may not be operational until the 2040s. In other words,
      a lag time of at least 15 years, with the current USN SSN fleet continues to not
      get any younger and China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) continues to
      expand and modernize its own submarine fleet.


      What’s the Solution? More Virginia-Class Submarines?


      So then, can the U.S. Navy simply build more Virginia-class boats instead (at
      least in the interim)? That sounds great in theory, since the Virginia-class is
      already well established, with 23 of these boats having already been commissioned.


      However, this potential solution would in turn be beset by a problem of its own:
      shipbuilding capacity in the United States is a shell of its former self, and
      this is especially true of the submarine program. Back on May 2, 2025, Indo-Pacific
      (INDOPACOM) Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo told the McCain Institute’s annual
      Sedona Forum that the PLAN churns out six combat naval ships annually, compared
      with the 1.8 manufactured in the US; diving deeper into those sobering stats,
      the Admiral noted that Beijing produces two submarines a year for every 1.4 made
      in America.


      The Navy brass is hoping to rectify these lagging numbers. Back in November 2024,
      they announced a goal to boost submarine production to three per year—one Columbia
      and two Virginias—by 2028, via the so-called “1+2+Sustainment by 2028” plan.


      A key component of this plan is the ongoing BuildSubmarines employment recruiting
      push. However, whether this laudable and ambitious goal of more than doubling
      American submarine production can be achieved in three years remains to be seen.
      Time will tell.

  - title: The France Aircraft Carrier ‘Question’ No One Dares Ask
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/the-france-aircraft-carrier-question-no-one-dares-ask/
    text: 'Question: The French Navy Only has One Aircraft Carrier. Is that a Problem?


      If Paris would like to maintain its status as one of the world’s few nuclear-carrier
      nations, continued investment in aircraft carriers in the future is crucial.


      France’s current and only aircraft carrier, the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle,
      is Paris’ primary tool for projecting power on a global scale. The carrier, commissioned
      into the French Navy in 2001, is the only actual carrier in European navies today,
      aside from the two carriers operated by the British Royal Navy (several other
      European nations operate smaller helicopter carriers or vertical take-off and
      landing ships.


      It takes more than a single aircraft carrier to maintain a continuous presence
      at sea. During routine maintenance or longer overhauls, a single carrier would
      not be able to put to sea, which would leave the French Navy without an available
      carrier strike group.


      Even nuclear-powered ships, such as the United States Navy’s aircraft carriers,
      cannot be out at sea for an indefinite period of time, as they must periodically
      take on foodstuffs, medical items, and other consumable supplies. Indeed, the
      Charles de Gaulle’s midlife refit in 2017 and 2018 left French operations at sea
      significantly curtailed for the duration of the 18-month refit.


      France is also a country with commitments and responsibilities that span the entire
      globe from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, with significant territory throughout
      the Indo-Pacific region.


      When considering French overseas departments in the Indian Ocean as well, the
      number of French citizens living there and in the Pacific expands to 1.5 million
      people. This also means that France has the world’s second-largest Exclusive Economic
      Zone, and protecting those assets is of high importance.


      France’s strategy of power projection and presence, particularly in the Pacific
      Ocean, relies heavily on air power at sea or the ability to project strikes by
      naval aviation within the protection coverage of a robust air defense umbrella.
      Without a carrier strike group at sea, it would not be possible to conduct these
      kinds of expeditionary missions.


      Show Me the Money


      Projecting power far out at sea doesn’t come cheaply, however. France’s upcoming
      PANG aircraft carrier, an acronym for the French “Porte-avions de nouvelle génération,”
      will cost around €8 to €10 billion just for the carrier’s construction costs.


      To put that into perspective, the French defense budget is around €50 billion.
      When considering the other investment needs of the French Navy, which also aims
      to allocate resources for new frigates, the costs are remarkable.


      The high upfront costs of building the new PANG aircraft will necessitate acute
      budgetary trade-offs that could escalate in the event of budget overruns or unanticipated
      expenses.


      The cost of operating the carrier would also eat into the Navy’s budget—and this
      at a time when there is an argument for investing in long-range anti-ship weaponry,
      drones, or other conventional systems, such as submarines, which makes a strong
      case for tight defense Euros.


      The Defense Industrial Base


      Aircraft carrier shipbuilding supports the French defense industrial base and,
      consequently, the country’s strategic independence. Nuclear propulsion, the aerospace
      sector, and French shipbuilders all gain through aircraft carrier building.


      Finalizing a build would inject research and development funding into a vital
      French nuclear ecosystem. The decision would, in essence, be as much an industrial
      policy as it would be a purely naval question with significant implications and
      knock-on effects.


      Though French shipyards would not be able to compete hull-for-hull with, say,
      China’s shipyards, being a carrier power in the Indo-Pacific—but with just a single
      carrier—would be a challenging game to play.


      The Critique


      Similar to the United States, the idea of an expanded French aircraft carrier
      presence has sustained criticisms that the carrier is too large and too expensive
      a target to justify in the era of increasingly long-range anti-ship and area-denial
      weaponry. The amount of money that could be spent on submarines, underwater drones,
      or other assets makes a strong argument.


      However, given France’s relations with other carrier powers, namely the United
      States and Great Britain, the French Navy could likely count on the support of
      those navies, as well as other friends and allies.


      One of the French strengths at sea is their advanced nuclear submarines, the Barracuda-class
      SSNs, as well as the Triomphant-class of ballistic missile submarines. Euro for
      euro, those platforms may offer a more potent area-denial capability than their
      larger aircraft carrier counterparts.


      What Happens Now for France and Its Aircraft Carrier?


      Still, there is no viable alternative now for the capabilities that an aircraft
      carrier brings to the table, particularly in terms of range, endurance, and firepower.
      The concerns that evolving technology, rising costs, and vulnerability are all
      valid arguments that address essential critiques. However, if France would like
      to remain one of the world’s few nuclear carrier-capable powers, continued investment
      in these platforms would be strategically important.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the strategic implications of France's
      reliance on its sole aircraft carrier, the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle,
      for global power projection. While the carrier is essential for maintaining a
      naval presence and conducting expeditionary missions, its singularity poses challenges,
      especially during maintenance periods when it cannot operate. France's upcoming

  - title: China’s J-20 Stealth Fighter Can’t Match the F-35 Just Yet
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/chinas-j-20-stealth-fighter-cant-match-the-f-35-just-yet/
    text: 'Key Points and Summary – Despite being China’s premier fifth-generation stealth
      aircraft, the Chengdu J-20 is fundamentally different from and likely less capable
      than the American F-35.


      -According to experts, the J-20’s design has stealth deficiencies, particularly
      in its rear aspect, and it lacks the ability to carry air-to-ground munitions
      internally, limiting it to an air superiority role.


      -More importantly, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force’s rigid, top-down command
      culture constrains pilot autonomy, preventing J-20 pilots from acting as independent
      “battle-space managers”—a core function of the F-35. This doctrinal gap means
      the J-20 cannot match the F-35’s versatility.


      The Chengdu J-20: How Is It Not Like an F-35A


      More than 20 years ago, a colleague of mine at Lockheed Martin was explaining
      the projected mission profile for the F-35.


      The picture he painted was of a next-generation jet, first and foremost, following
      in the footsteps of the F-117 in penetrating enemy radar networks, attacking high-value
      targets, and then still being able to return to base without being shot down by
      an air defense battery or an enemy fighter.


      But that was not all, he continued. “With the many abilities of the aircraft,
      the pilot is able to function as a battle-space manager—almost like a smaller-scale
      AWACS in some respects. Among other previously unheard-of capabilities of this
      next-generation fighter, the pilot can receive data directly from a satellite.
      The information is not being ‘processed’ or ‘filtered’, etc. to decide what the
      pilot ‘needs to know’. It is a direct link.”


      To the best of our knowledge, this battle management functionality is intended
      to be a feature of the first stealthy aircraft produced in the People’s Republic
      of China (PRC), the Chengdu Aerospace J-20. However, it may also never be able
      to perform this function—regardless of how many years the aircraft remains in
      service or how many upgrades it receives.


      In comparing the two aircraft, one notices several differences that would lead
      most airpower analysts to conclude that the American aircraft is the more versatile
      and multi-role of the two.


      “China’s Chengdu J-20 fighter jet, despite its advanced capabilities, falls short
      in comparison to the U.S.-made F-35 jet,” an expert has argued in a Newsweek report
      that was published early in June. He spoke to the publication about ten days before
      the F-35’s opening, once appearing at the Le Bourget air show outside Paris.


      J-20: Third to the Race


      With its first flight of the J-20 in January 2011, the PRC became only the third
      nation in the world, after the US and Russia, to design and build a fifth-generation
      stealth fighter that could evade enemy radar detection. Several years then passed
      before the J-20 Introduced in 2017. Today, there are various estimates, but most
      indicate that there are approximately 250 J-20 models in service with the People’s
      Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).


      On the surface, J-20 appears to be a fighter with a blended-body, stealthy-type
      shape. The aircraft is also designed like other stealth aircraft, featuring diverterless
      supersonic inlets, which is another necessary basic feature of a low radar cross-section
      (RCS) aircraft. The design also features moveable canard foreplanes and root extensions
      on the wing’s leading edge.


      But stealthy design technique has some very extreme and unforgiving requirements,
      which some observers say the aircraft has yet to meet. Specialists who have viewed
      the aircraft up close comment that the J-20 manufacturing methods produce exposed
      rivets and shoddy workmanship. It’s shoddy in that some panels do not match up
      precisely, which can compromise the low-observable surface of a stealthy aircraft.


      There are also—as there is with Russia’s Sukhoi Su-57—problems with the signature
      of the aircraft in its exhaust nozzle section and rear hemisphere in general.
      (It compares very poorly with the US F-22 and F-35 in this respect.) This has
      historically been one of the most challenging aspects of stealthy aircraft design.


      Where is the Quarterback?


      But the biggest reason is that the J-20 will never be thrust into the kind of
      mission roles that one is seeing the aircraft performing with the US and Israeli
      air forces in the current conflict with Iran.


      “The J-20 has a larger internal fuel payload than the F-35, but it is also larger.
      The J-20’s range will be similar to or shorter than the F-35’s. Also, unlike the
      F-35, the J-20 cannot carry air-to-ground bombs internally, which is a fundamental
      limitation,” Kim Minseok, a research fellow at the Korea Defense and Security
      Forum, told Newsweek in an interview this June.


      The J-20 is not only unable to carry the kind of air-to-ground mission, but the
      problem for many years, according to a 2016 RAND report, is not the aircraft itself
      but the culture and general limitations placed on its pilots:


      “PLAAF pilots still lack the ability to adapt to rapidly changing battlefield
      conditions and make autonomous decisions on the fly. Such skills remain new to
      many PLAAF pilots accustomed to having almost all of their tactical maneuvers
      dictated by commanders in the control tower. For example, one Kongjun Bao report
      noted this deficiency in flight leads taking over from ground control.”


      “Ground commands often are not able to keep up with the complex and changeable
      air situation. Pilots relied too much on the commands and guidance from the ground,
      which was not conducive to enhancing the enthusiasm and initiative of airborne
      combatants. Our findings also highlight an inability among some PLAAF pilots to
      hit ground targets successfully upon receiving inflight changes to flight trajectories
      or plans, as well as a reluctance among pilots to take risks for fear of making
      mistakes or out of safety concerns.”


      “Our report supports the notion that the PLAAF is fully aware of its shortcomings
      in pilot combat skills and is taking steps to rectify many of these deficiencies.
      However, cultivating true pilot autonomy in unscripted scenarios takes decades
      to hone and demands a training system that encourages honest assessments of mistakes.
      While the PLAAF appears to have undertaken major reform in how it trains its pilots,
      success will ultimately depend on breaking the service’s deep-seated institutional
      and cultural barriers.”


      The J-20 Fighter Falls Short


      Unfortunately, the paranoia, institutional barriers, and the long-standing imperative
      that dictates the Chinese Communist Party keeping the PLA on a short lease remain
      “rule number one in the PLA,” said one US military analyst of the PRC and former
      intelligence officer. These habits do not align with the freedom of decision-making
      required of a pilot, who is supposed to be that of a quarterback or battle-space
      manager, he explained.


      “For as long as the current regime is in power in Beijing, this mismatch will
      continue to be what holds the J-20 back from achieving its full potential,” he
      concluded. “The F-35 is likely to remain dominant as a consequence.”

  - title: Russia’s T-14 Armata Tank Is ‘Circling the Drain’
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/russias-t-14-armata-tank-is-circling-the-drain/
    text: 'Key Points and Summary – Russia’s T-14 Armata, despite being touted as a
      revolutionary main battle tank, is a deeply troubled program with an uncertain
      future.


      -On paper, its features are impressive, including an unmanned turret, a heavily
      armored crew capsule for survivability, and the Afghanit active protection system.


      -However, the program has been plagued by extreme costs and technical difficulties,
      resulting in fewer than 20 tanks being delivered.


      -Its conspicuous absence from the main 2025 Moscow Victory Day parade and official
      statements about its high cost preventing deployment to Ukraine have led many
      analysts to believe the project is effectively paused or canceled.


      Russia’s T-14 Armata Tank Is In Trouble


      The T-14 Armata is currently one of the most controversial tanks in existence.


      When it was first unveiled in 2015, Analysts were shocked by the number of innovative
      features the tank boasted. However, ten years later, it seems that the tank is
      no closer to seeing combat than it was when it was first showed off in the 2015
      Victory Day parade.


      Analysts argue that the Armata was always smoke and mirrors, while others suggest
      that the tank is simply to sophisticated for Russia’s industrial base to handle.


      Russia’s Most Advanced Tank


      Western Analysts like to give the T-14 a lot of grief, and for good reason. However,
      at the time of its introduction, the T-14 introduced a number of genuine innovative
      design changes. Unlike conventional tanks where the crew operates the main gun
      from within the turret, the T-14’s turret is fully automated and remotely controlled.
      The crew, consisting of a commander, gunner, and driver, is housed in a heavily
      armored capsule located in the front of the hull.


      This design significantly enhances crew survivability by isolating them from the
      ammunition and fuel compartments, which are typically the most vulnerable areas
      in a tank during combat. The concept of an unmanned turret is a radical departure
      from traditional tank design and has not yet been adopted by any other major military
      power.


      The T-14 is equipped with the Afghanit Active Protection System, which includes
      radar and electro-optical sensors designed to detect and neutralize incoming threats
      such as anti-tank guided missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. This system is
      considered one of the most advanced in the world and is a key component of the
      T-14’s defensive capabilities.


      In addition to active protection, the tank features passive stealth measures,
      including reduced radar and thermal signatures, making it more difficult to detect
      and target.


      Built to Fight Future Wars


      The tank’s sensor suite provides 360-degree situational awareness through a combination
      of cameras, thermal imaging, and radar systems. This comprehensive sensor array
      allows the crew to monitor the battlefield in real time and respond to threats
      more effectively. The T-14’s fire control system is also highly advanced, incorporating
      artificial intelligence to assist in target acquisition and prioritization. This
      reduces the cognitive load on the crew and enhances the tank’s combat efficiency.


      Another key aspect of the T-14 is its integration into network-centric warfare
      systems. The tank is designed to operate as part of a larger digital battlefield,
      sharing data with other units, drones, and command centers in real time.


      This connectivity allows for coordinated operations and enhances the overall effectiveness
      of military engagements. The T-14’s digital systems are intended to support future
      upgrades, including the potential for autonomous or remotely operated variants.


      This forward-looking approach reflects Russia’s ambition to modernize its armed
      forces and maintain technological parity with NATO.


      A Massive Step in the Right Direction


      In terms of firepower, the T-14 is outfitted with a 125mm 2A82-1M smoothbore cannon,
      capable of firing a wide range of munitions including armor-piercing fin-stabilized
      discarding sabot rounds, high-explosive anti-tank rounds, and guided missiles.
      There are also plans to eventually equip the tank with a 152mm gun, which would
      make it the most heavily armed tank in the world. Secondary armament includes
      a 12.7mm Kord machine gun and a 7.62mm PKTM machine gun, both of which are remotely
      operated. These weapons provide additional firepower for engaging infantry and
      light vehicles.


      The T-14 is powered by a ChTZ 12N360 diesel engine that produces up to 1,500 horsepower.
      This gives the tank a top speed of approximately 80 kilometers per hour on roads
      and a range of about 500 kilometers. The tank also features a hydropneumatic suspension
      system, which allows it to adjust its ground clearance and improves its mobility
      across various terrains. This level of mobility, combined with its advanced protection
      and firepower, positions the T-14 as a formidable presence on the battlefield.


      T-14 Armata: When Ambition Meets Reality


      Despite its impressive capabilities, the T-14 has faced numerous challenges in
      production and deployment.


      Russia initially planned to procure over 2,300 units by 2020, but as of 2025,
      only a limited number have been produced and deployed. The high cost of the tank,
      estimated between $3.7 and $5 million per unit, has been a significant barrier,
      especially in light of Russia’s economic constraints and the financial demands
      of ongoing military operations. These issues have led to delays and a reduction
      in the scale of the T-14 program.


      Because of its manufacturing troubles, there are likely less than 20 operational
      T-14’s in existence. While the tank has been showcased in military parades and
      used in training exercises, claims of the tank being sent to combat in Ukraine
      have since been disproven. Some unverified accounts suggest that the T-14 may
      have been tested in conflict zones, but these claims remain speculative. Russia
      has also attempted to market the T-14 to foreign buyers, including India, Egypt,
      and Algeria, but no confirmed export deals have been finalized. The high cost
      and unproven battlefield performance have likely deterred potential customers.


      Where is the T-14 Armata Now?


      The T-14 has not been without its critics. Concerns have been raised about its
      mechanical reliability, with reports of issues during trials. Even in Russia,
      some analysts question whether the tank’s high cost is justified by its performance,
      especially when compared to upgraded versions of the T-90, which are significantly
      cheaper and already in widespread use. The limited number of T-14s in service
      also raises questions about its strategic impact, as it is unlikely to significantly
      alter the balance of power on the battlefield in its current numbers.


      Currently, the T-14 is sitting in development hell. While it embodies the cutting
      edge of Russian tank design, its future success will depend on the ability to
      overcome production challenges, reduce costs, and demonstrate reliability in real-world
      conditions.


      Russia has indicated plans to develop unmanned variants of the T-14 and integrate
      it with drone swarms and robotic support vehicles, suggesting that the Armata
      platform may serve as a foundation for future autonomous systems.


      However, the fate of Moscow’s “super tank” will likely be decided after the end
      of the Ukraine war.

  - title: Why the U.S. Needs 200 B-21 Raider Stealth Bombers, Not 100
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/why-the-u-s-needs-200-b-21-raider-stealth-bombers-not-100/
    text: 'Key Points and Summary – Operation “Midnight Hammer” was a bold demonstration
      of U.S. airpower, with nine B-2 stealth bombers striking Iranian targets. But
      beneath the success lies a troubling reality: America’s strategic bomber fleet
      is too small for modern great-power warfare. With only 20 B-2s and aging B-1s
      and B-52s, the U.S. lacks the mass needed to sustain strikes against well-defended
      adversaries like China.


      Bottom line: Experts now urge the Pentagon to more than double the planned B-21
      Raider buy to 200 or more. With rising threats and stretched resources, expanding
      stealth bomber capacity is essential to deter conflict and project power in the
      21st century.


      The B-21 Raider Won’t Be Enough Without a Bigger U.S. Bomber Fleet


      Operation “Midnight Hammer” showcased American strategic airpower for the world
      to behold. And while it was truly impressive, it showcased air tech essentially
      from the 1986 Top Gun-era and not that of Top Gun: Maverick in the 2020’s.


      The military operation also exposed the shockingly small fleet size of one of
      America’s most capable power projection platforms: the stealthy B-2 bomber.


      Scary but true is that America’s B-2 fleet is large enough for a raid. Not a battle,
      and certainly not a war.


      The U.S. military’s limited capacity to sustain strategic air operations against
      more capable and vast adversaries like China or Russia is a glaring weakness that,
      if unaddressed, will invite opportunism and aggression.


      Nine B-2s—nearly half the entire fleet—were deployed from Whiteman Air Force Base.
      Seven flew east to strike, supported by tankers, electronic warfare aircraft,
      and other assets, while two flew west to generate deceptive open-source intelligence
      activity.


      This impressive display of combat power also revealed concerning limitations.
      It took nearly half of America’s most advanced heavy bombers to destroy a single
      target (albeit a complicated and gigantic one) in a country with limited air defenses.
      Our bombers relied on airspace access previously cleared by Israeli strikes.


      America’s also-aging B-52s and B-1s were not viable alternatives, as they are
      vulnerable in environments even as minimally contested as a battered Iran and
      air superiority. In addition, one of the B-2s sent west got stuck in Hawaii after
      having to make an emergency diversion. Washington can only hope that it doesn’t
      end up like the damaged B-2 that was retired last year after it was determined
      to be too expensive to repair.


      The B-2 fleet’s small size is a legacy of post-Cold War decisions. Originally
      intended to number 132, only 21 were built due to cost overruns and the “end of
      history” after the Soviet Union’s collapse, which justified the procurement holiday
      from which the Air Force has never recovered.


      Today, the Air Force plans to acquire just 100 B-21 Raiders, the next-generation
      stealth bomber. Yet, as the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments noted
      in 2020, the total bomber fleet is shrinking while its age is ever-increasing.
      The U.S. bomber fleet size has stagnated while its average age exceeds 40 years.
      By 2030, CSBA projects a total fleet of just 172 bombers, dominated by aging B-52s
      and B-1s—platforms unsuitable for modern contested airspaces.


      A limited stealth bomber force may suffice against weakened states like Iran but
      is inadequate for high-end warfare with peer adversaries. This gap emboldens enemies
      and increases the risk of future conflict.


      China has recently increased production of bombers that can strike Guam and beyond.
      Their mainstay H-6N bomber, on deployment to the disputed and strategically located
      Paracel Islands, can carry a payload of 6 cruise missiles with which to menace
      American and allied assets. In addition the Chinese air force is building a stealthy
      bomber, the H-20, that could be a counter to the B-2 and the B-21.


      To deter major powers suffciently, experts argue the U.S. must significantly expand
      its stealth bomber fleet. Mark Gunzinger and colleagues advocate for more than
      doubling the planned B-21 buy to build a nearly 400-strong strategic bomber force.


      Dr. Rebecca Grant of the Lexington Institute concurs, suggesting at least 200
      B-21s and establishing a second production site. Importantly, this recommendation
      is supported by Air Force Global Strike leadership. Congress must act decisively
      to invest in the mass and stealth needed to restore conventional deterrence.


      Thankfully, the defense budget is poised to support the momentum needed for a
      large scale up. In the current fiscal year 2025, $2.7 billion was enacted for
      B-21 RDT&E and $1.9 billion for procurement. For the White House’s 2026 discretionary
      budget request, Raider R&D funds clock in at $2.3 billion and procurement $2.6
      billion.


      The One Big Beautiful Bill draft reconciliation bill using mandatory money seeks
      $2.4 billion for RDT&E and $2.1 billion for Raider procurement. We have a relatively
      flat trajectory in the baseline discretionary funding and a one-time infusion
      that is relatively stiff.


      This reconciliation jumpstart to crank up B-21 production is an excellent sign
      that the importance of scaling is understood. However, to achieve the fleet size
      that global reality will surely require, continued funding at sustained higher
      amounts will be necessary in 2027 and 2028.


      Similarly, the munitions the B-21 will be capable of carrying need to increase.
      Given that it is a medium bomber, the expectation is that the Raider will only
      be able to onboard one 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator at a time; not
      two like the B-2. Should another raid like Midnight Hammer occur in the near future,
      it would place a bigger burden on the Raider fleet given their size and weight
      differences.


      Furthermore, the fact that the Raider is a dual-use, conventional and nuclear-capable
      bomber means it must perform the work of many aircraft in one. Being a utility
      infielder bomber, it is clear that 100 B-21s will not be enough. Especially given
      the force generation demands highlighted to pound Iran’s nuke site. When ready
      aircraft are in operational use, most of the rest are in work up and maintenance
      to take their place. The few that remain are mostly offline entirely given the
      age of this antique-plated fleet.


      The defense budget request for the next fiscal year is on the right track to grow
      the B-21 program and select munitions accounts. It will be essential to maintain
      those higher levels of funds for the next half decade to deliver the same strategic
      effects against a more capable enemy with sophisticated weaponry and mass.

  - title: 'Golden Dome: America’s Answer to China’s Space Weapons?'
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/golden-dome-americas-answer-to-chinas-space-weapons/
    text: 'The Trump administration’s recent unveiling of the Golden Dome, a sweeping
      missile defense architecture, has invoked swift condemnation from China.


      In response to the announcement, Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin issued
      a joint rebuke—timed, pointedly, on the 80th anniversary of World War II’s end.
      As tanks and soldiers rolled through Red Square, the mood felt less like commemoration
      and more like a throwback to Cold War brinkmanship. The irony was hard to miss.


      That irony only deepened with the content of the statement. In it, China voiced
      concerns about the system’s space-based capabilities, accusing the U.S. of turning
      “outer space into a new arena for armed confrontation” and “deeply destabilizing”
      the global order. Beijing also claimed the proposal violates long-established
      international norms.


      But these accusations are not only unfounded, they’re deeply hypocritical. The
      Golden Dome is a defensive system, developed in response to the rapid expansion
      of military space programs by China and other adversarial powers. Its purpose
      is to serve as a shield, designed to intercept a range of inbound threats, including
      ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic missiles.


      The 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST), a product of the original Space Race, remains
      the cornerstone of international space law. It lays out broad principles governing
      military activity in space and explicitly prohibits the deployment of weapons
      of mass destruction. Both the U.S. and China are signatories.


      Under the framework of that treaty, the Golden Dome is entirely permissible. It
      is neither a nuclear weapon nor an offensive system. Rather, the program would
      expand the existing constellation of satellites used for early detection and interception—tools
      of defense, not aggression.


      Paradoxically, it’s not U.S. ambition that makes the Golden Dome necessary, it’s
      China’s. Between 2018 and 2024, China tripled its number of intelligence satellites
      in orbit. In 2021, the Chinese military began exploring the revival of the “fractional
      orbital bombardment system (FOBS),” a Cold War-era space technology designed to
      evade early warning radars.


      If fully developed, FOBS will give the U.S. endlessly sleepless nights. They are
      orbital platforms capable of dropping weapons—including, nuclear weapons, which
      China has contemplated—from space onto terrestrial targets with little to no tactical
      warning. FOBS can launch attacks from any direction, obscure their true target,
      and, alarmingly, operate without range limitations.


      The fact that China is even considering fielding such capabilities is deeply troubling.
      According to U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessments, if China decided to
      pursue such means, they could develop 60 operational FOBS by 2035.


      The Chinese Aerospace Studies Institute, a think tank under the U.S. Air Force,
      translated several Chinese military doctrinal documents, revealing that FOBS “could
      increase PLA power projection capabilities against bases and territories globally,
      including targets in the 50 states.”


      China’s development and apparent intent to deploy advanced offensive missile capabilities
      suggest ambitions beyond mere deterrence. A 2024 Department of Defense report
      found that Chinese leaders have shown a “growing willingness to use military coercion
      to achieve foreign policy aims.” If Chinese offensive systems severely outpace
      U.S. defensive capabilities, the risk isn’t just theoretical, we could see missile-based
      threats used to coerce or constrain U.S. decision-making in future crises.


      Against this backdrop, China’s demand that the U.S. limit its defensive systems
      is not just contradictory—it’s absurd. The current American missile defense network,
      built around interceptors like the Patriot-3, THAAD-ER, Standard Missile-6, and
      the emerging Glide Phase Interceptor, already requires significant upgrades to
      keep pace with China’s rapidly advancing hypersonic capabilities. That need becomes
      even more urgent considering China’s hypersonic missiles are now capable of reaching
      global targets within 30 minutes, a sobering reality for U.S. defense planners.


      Interestingly, it appears that China does not hold all countries to the same,
      unreasonable standard. Last year, after intelligence indicated Russia might be
      developing a nuclear anti-satellite weapon, the U.S. put forth a UN draft resolution
      explicitly reaffirming OST principles and restricting nuclear weapon deployment
      in outer space.


      To be clear: anti-satellite weapons are offensive by design. Russia’s reported
      push to nuclearize them would be a blatant violation of the OST. Yet when the
      U.S. introduced the UN resolution to reaffirm those very principles, China didn’t
      stand up. Days later, Beijing even signaled deeper cooperation with Moscow, offering
      to collaborate on an automated nuclear power plant on the Moon.


      China isn’t concerned about the militarization of space; it’s concerned that the
      U.S. might finally build something that works. In a world made more perilous by
      authoritarian regimes, led by Beijing, the Golden Dome represents the kind of
      comprehensive defensive shield America urgently needs. That’s not destabilizing—that’s
      deterrence.

    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/su-34-fullback-the-ultimate-guide-to-russias-fighter-bomber/
    text: 'The Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback: Anatomy of Russia’s Fighter-Bomber


      Introduction – A Cold War Platypus in a 21st Century World


      The Sukhoi Su-34, known to NATO as the “Fullback,” is an aircraft of inherent
      contradictions. Officially entering service with the Russian Aerospace Forces
      (VKS) in 2014, it presents as a modern, 4++ generation strike platform.


      Yet, its conceptual DNA is deeply rooted in the final, turbulent years of the
      Soviet Union, a product of a military requirement from a bygone era.


      This protracted, 24-year journey from its maiden flight to full operational status
      is not merely a historical footnote; it is the central factor that defines the
      Su-34’s unique strengths, its glaring weaknesses, and its complex, often controversial,
      combat record.


      It is, in essence, a machine conceived to fight one war, which found itself fighting
      a very different one decades later.


      The Soviet Requirement


      The story of the Su-34 begins in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the Soviet
      Air Force sought a modern, long-range successor to its aging fleet of tactical
      bombers.


      The primary aircraft to be replaced was the venerable swing-wing Sukhoi Su-24
      “Fencer,” but the new platform was also envisioned to take over missions performed
      by the MiG-27 “Flogger” ground-attack aircraft and the heavily armored Su-25 “Frogfoot”
      close air support jet.


      The requirement called for a versatile, all-weather aircraft capable of deep penetration
      into enemy airspace, precision strikes against ground and naval targets, and robust
      self-defense capabilities to operate in a hostile environment.


      The Flanker as a Foundation


      To meet this demanding set of requirements, the Sukhoi Design Bureau selected
      its highly successful Su-27 “Flanker” air superiority fighter as the foundational
      airframe.


      The choice was logical; the Su-27 possessed exceptional range, a large payload
      capacity, and impressive maneuverability, providing a robust and proven starting
      point for a new fighter-bomber variant.


      The project, known internally as T-10V, commenced with the modification of an
      Su-27UB two-seat trainer, which was transformed into the first prototype, designated
      the Su-27IB (Istrebitel-Bombardirovshchik, or “Fighter-Bomber”).


      A Protracted Birth


      This prototype, T-10V-1, made its maiden flight on April 13, 1990, with pilot
      Anatoly Ivanov at the controls.


      However, what should have been the start of a relatively swift development and
      production cycle was catastrophically derailed by the political and economic turmoil
      of the Soviet Union’s collapse. The program stalled for over a decade due to a
      severe lack of funding, with state trials only concluding in 2003 and full-scale
      production at the Novosibirsk aircraft plant beginning in earnest around 2008.


      The Su-34 was finally commissioned into formal service on March 14, 2014, nearly
      a quarter-century after it first took to the skies.


      This immense delay created a fundamental mismatch between the aircraft’s core
      design and the threats it would ultimately face. The Su-34 was conceived as a
      heavily armored, low-level penetrator designed to survive the dense but technologically
      simpler NATO air defenses of the 1980s.


      When the program was revitalized in the 2000s, modern avionics were essentially
      integrated into this older airframe concept.


      The result was a hybrid platform that was neither a clean-sheet 21st-century design
      nor a simple legacy upgrade. This inherent tension helps explain why the aircraft
      performed well in the low-threat environment of Syria, which more closely mirrored
      its original design parameters, but struggled against the modern, networked, and
      electronically sophisticated air defenses it encountered in Ukraine. The subsequent
      and urgent development of the modernized Su-34M variant is not a routine upgrade,
      but a reactive attempt to correct this foundational mismatch and adapt the aircraft
      to a battlefield its original designers could not have fully anticipated.


      Its unique physical appearance, born from its specialized role, earned it the
      affectionate Russian nickname Utkonos (“Platypus”) or Utyonok (“Duckling”) due
      to its distinctive flattened nose cone, while NATO assigned it the more imposing
      reporting name “Fullback”.


      Anatomy of a Hellduck: Design, Technology, and Crew Endurance


      The Su-34’s design is a masterclass in trade-offs, where every major feature is
      optimized for its primary role as a long-range, survivable strike platform. This
      specialization makes it a formidable weapon system within its intended operational
      envelope but also creates vulnerabilities when it is forced to operate outside
      of it.


      Airframe and Aerodynamics


      While based on the Flanker, the Su-34’s airframe features significant modifications.
      It retains the basic wing structure, tail, and engine nacelles of the Su-27/Su-30
      family but incorporates a “three-surface” aerodynamic layout with canard foreplanes.


      These canards, similar to those on the Su-30MKI and Su-33, increase static instability
      for higher maneuverability and provide additional lift, which enhances stability
      during low-altitude flight and reduces trim drag.


      In a key departure from the high-altitude Su-27, the Su-34 uses fixed-geometry
      air inlets. This design choice sacrifices peak performance at high Mach numbers
      and high altitudes in favor of optimizing efficiency for low-to-medium altitude
      penetration missions.


      To support a significantly higher maximum takeoff weight of up to 45,100 kg, the
      landing gear was substantially reinforced, featuring a twin-wheel nose unit and
      robust main gear with tandem wheels on each strut, enabling operations from less-prepared
      or austere airfields.


      The Armored Office: A Cockpit Built for Endurance


      The most radical and defining feature of the Su-34 is its cockpit.


      The traditional tandem seating of the Su-27UB was replaced with an entirely new,
      wider forward fuselage that accommodates the pilot and weapon systems officer
      (WSO) in a side-by-side configuration.


      This arrangement was chosen to improve crew communication and coordination during
      complex, long-duration missions and to avoid the duplication of certain instruments
      and displays.


      Embodying the “flying tank” design philosophy, the entire cockpit is constructed
      as an all-welded titanium armored “tub” or capsule.


      This structure, reportedly 17 mm thick and weighing nearly 1,500 kg, is designed
      to protect the crew and critical avionics from small-arms fire and missile fragments,
      a feature intended to enhance survivability during low-level attack runs.


      Reflecting its intended role as a long-range bomber that could replace even the
      Tu-22M, the cabin is designed for crew endurance. It is pressurized to allow operation
      up to 10,000 meters without the constant use of oxygen masks, which are reserved
      for combat or emergencies.


      The space behind and between the K-36DM ejection seats is large enough for a crew
      member to stand up, stretch, or even lie down during long flights.


      To facilitate missions that could last many hours, the aircraft is equipped with
      a small galley (including a microwave and water heater) and a lavatory in the
      form of a hand-held urinal.


      Access to this unique cockpit is not via a conventional canopy, but through a
      hatch in the floor, with a built-in ladder that extends down from the nosewheel
      bay.


      Avionics and Sensor Suite


      The Su-34’s avionics suite was advanced for its time of design, though some elements
      have been surpassed by more modern Western systems.


      Forward Radar: The primary sensor is the Leninets Sh141/V004, a large passive
      electronically scanned array (PESA) multimode radar housed in the distinctive
      “platypus” nose. This system is heavily optimized for air-to-ground work, featuring
      terrain-following and terrain-avoidance modes for safe, high-speed, low-level
      flight. It is claimed to have a detection range of 200–250 km against large surface
      targets like a naval vessel and up to 120 km against fighter-sized aerial targets.


      Rearward Radar: The elongated tail “stinger,” which also houses an auxiliary power
      unit (APU), contains a rearward-facing warning radar. This system, initially the
      N012 and planned to be upgraded to the Kopyo-DL on the Su-34M, is designed to
      detect and warn the crew of pursuing aircraft or missiles, cueing the defensive
      systems.


      Targeting System: For precision strikes, the aircraft is fitted with the Platan
      electro-optical targeting system. This is a retractable unit housed in the fuselage
      belly that contains a television camera and a laser designator for guiding munitions.
      While effective in clear, daytime conditions, its capability is limited by its
      lack of a thermal imaging channel, making it less effective at night or in adverse
      weather compared to modern Western targeting pods like Sniper or Damocles.


      Electronic Warfare (EW): A key element of the Su-34’s survivability is its Khibiny
      (L-175V) electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite. This system, which includes internal
      components and distinctive torpedo-shaped pods on the wingtips, is designed to
      jam enemy radar systems and the seekers of incoming missiles. It functions by
      delaying detection, creating false targets, and distorting the adversary’s radar
      picture, with its manufacturer claiming it increases aircraft survivability by
      a factor of 25 to 30.


      The Su-34’s design philosophy is clear: it is a specialist, not a generalist.
      The heavy armor, crew amenities, and fixed engine inlets sacrifice air-to-air
      agility and top speed for endurance and survivability in its primary ground-attack
      role. This deliberate focus made it a highly effective tool in the permissive
      air environment over Syria, where its long range and heavy payload could be used
      to full effect. However, in the contested, high-tech battlespace over Ukraine,
      these same design choices contributed to its vulnerabilities.


      Modern air defenses more easily detect its large, non-stealthy airframe and PESA
      radar. At the same time, the lack of advanced precision-guided munitions forced
      it into dangerous low-level attack profiles where its armor was tested—and often
      defeated.

      Claws of the Fullback: A Deep and Versatile Arsenal


      The Su-34’s value as a strike platform is defined by its ability to carry a massive
      and diverse array of ordnance. With 12 external hardpoints, it can be configured
      for a wide spectrum of missions, from close air support to standoff strategic
      strikes. Its maximum payload is cited by various sources as being between 8,000
      kg and 14,000 kg.


      Internal Cannon


      For strafing and self-defense, the aircraft is equipped with the powerful 30mm
      Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-30-1 autocannon, a weapon common to the Flanker family, supplied
      with 150 to 180 rounds of ammunition.


      Air-to-Surface Munitions (The Primary Role)


      The Su-34’s primary purpose is to deliver ordnance onto ground and naval targets.
      Its arsenal represents a mix of Soviet-era brute force and modern precision.


      Unguided “Dumb” Bombs: The aircraft can carry a huge variety of unguided bombs,
      including the 250 kg FAB-250, 500 kg FAB-500, and the massive 1,500 kg FAB-1500
      general-purpose bombs. It can also deploy OFAB high-explosive fragmentation bombs
      and ZB-500 incendiary devices.


      Guided “Smart” Bombs: For precision strikes, the Su-34 employs the KAB series
      of guided bombs. These include the KAB-500 and KAB-1500, which can be fitted with
      laser (L), television (Kr), or satellite (S) guidance systems. This capability
      has been critically augmented in the Ukraine conflict by the widespread adoption
      of the UMPK (Unifitsirovannyi Modul Planirovaniya i Korrektsii), a kit that attaches
      wings and a guidance system to standard dumb bombs, converting them into standoff
      glide weapons.


      Guided Missiles: The Fullback’s standoff strike capability rests on its extensive
      suite of guided missiles:


      Anti-Radiation Missiles (ARM): For Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions,
      it can carry the Kh-31P/PD (NATO: AS-17 Krypton) to home in on and destroy enemy
      radar emitters.


      Anti-Ship Missiles (AShM): For maritime strike, its arsenal includes the Kh-31A,
      the Kh-35U, and the large, long-range Kh-59M “Ovod”.


      Tactical Land-Attack Missiles: A wide range of missiles for striking ground targets
      includes the heavy Kh-29L/T (laser/TV-guided), the smaller Kh-25ML (laser-guided),
      and the more modern Kh-38M family.


      Unguided Rockets: For saturating area targets, the Su-34 can be armed with pods
      for S-8, S-13, and heavy S-25 rockets.


      Air-to-Air Munitions (For Self-Defense)


      Although it is a bomber first and foremost, the Su-34 is not defenseless. It is
      equipped to carry a formidable air-to-air loadout, allowing it to engage hostile
      fighters and protect itself without relying entirely on a dedicated escort.


      Short-Range: Vympel R-73 (NATO: AA-11 Archer) infrared-homing missiles, known
      for their high off-boresight capability and agility in a dogfight.


      Medium/Long-Range: Vympel R-27 (NATO: AA-10 Alamo) missiles in semi-active radar
      (R/ER) and infrared (T/ET) variants, and the more modern Vympel R-77 (NATO: AA-12
      Adder), an active radar-homing “fire-and-forget” missile comparable to the American
      AMRAAM.4


      This extensive documented arsenal, however, represents a powerful potential that
      has not always translated into reality. The Su-34’s combat employment has revealed
      a significant gap between its designed capabilities and its actual use, particularly
      in Ukraine. Its reliance on unguided bombs and the subsequent emergency adoption
      of the UMPK glide-bomb kits is not a sign of tactical flexibility, but rather
      a symptom of a critical failure in the Russian defense-industrial base.


      Analysis of downed Russian equipment has shown a heavy dependence on Western-made
      microelectronics for precision-guided munitions (PGMs). With these components
      cut off by international sanctions, Russia has been unable to produce its advanced
      PGMs in sufficient quantities. The UMPK is a direct consequence of this shortage—a
      low-cost, technologically simple stopgap to give unguided bombs a standoff capability.
      This adaptation allows the Su-34 to remain relevant by staying outside the range
      of many air defenses, but it reveals a systemic weakness: Russia’s most advanced
      tactical bomber is operationally constrained by its own country’s limited high-tech
      manufacturing capacity.

      Section 4: Trial by Fire: Combat Performance from Syria to Ukraine


      The Su-34’s operational history is a tale of two vastly different conflicts, which
      have painted starkly contrasting pictures of the aircraft’s effectiveness. Its
      performance in Syria created a narrative of a highly capable, modern strike platform,
      while the war in Ukraine provided a brutal reality check that exposed its vulnerabilities
      and the doctrinal flaws of the force that operates it.


      The Syrian Proving Ground (2015-Present): A Narrative of Success


      The Su-34 made its combat debut in September 2015 as part of Russia’s military
      intervention in the Syrian Civil War.


      An initial deployment of just four aircraft to Khmeimim Airbase was later reinforced
      as the campaign progressed.


      In the largely permissive air environment over Syria, where opposition forces
      lacked any significant air defense capabilities, the Su-34 was able to operate
      largely as its designers had intended.


      Its primary mission profile consisted of precision strikes from medium to high
      altitudes (often above 5,000 meters) against fixed targets such as command centers,
      ammunition depots, training camps, and fortified bunkers.


      In this role, it successfully employed a range of PGMs, most notably the KAB-500S
      satellite-guided bomb, demonstrating its capacity for accurate, all-weather strikes.


      The Syrian campaign became a powerful marketing and propaganda tool for the Su-34.
      It was hailed by Russian defense officials as the most advanced and effective
      aircraft in the theater and was seen as instrumental in ensuring the survival
      of the Assad regime.


      This perceived success likely played a significant role in securing Russia’s first
      export order for the aircraft from Algeria.


      The Ukrainian Crucible (2022-Present): A Brutal Reality Check


      If Syria was the Su-34’s showcase, Ukraine has been its crucible. The high-intensity
      conflict against a well-equipped and determined adversary has been devastating
      for the Fullback fleet. At the start of the 2022 invasion, Russia possessed an
      estimated 125 to 140 Su-34s.


      As of mid-2024, open-source intelligence analysis has visually confirmed the loss
      of at least 36 of these aircraft, with Ukrainian forces claiming to have downed
      dozens more.


      These losses have been sustained not only from enemy fire in the air but also
      from Ukrainian long-range drone and sabotage attacks on Russian airbases deep
      behind the front lines.


      The war has exposed critical tactical vulnerabilities:


      Forced Low-Altitude Attacks: The chronic shortage of PGMs forced VKS pilots to
      fly low-altitude missions to have any chance of accurately delivering unguided
      “dumb” bombs. This tactic brought the large, non-stealthy Su-34 directly into
      the lethal engagement envelope of Ukraine’s highly effective and mobile short-range
      air defenses (SHORAD), including man-portable systems (MANPADS) like the Stinger
      and RBS-70, and self-propelled anti-aircraft guns like the German-made Gepard.
      Vulnerability to Advanced SAMs: When operating at medium altitudes to stay above
      the SHORAD threat, the Su-34 proved vulnerable to more sophisticated, long-range
      surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems. Ukrainian forces, using Western-supplied
      systems like the MIM-104 Patriot, have successfully conducted tactical “SAMbushes,”
      downing multiple Su-34s in short periods by moving the launchers to unexpected
      locations near the front. Ineffective Electronic Warfare: The vaunted Khibiny
      ECM suite, despite its impressive on-paper specifications, has proven insufficient
      against modern, networked air defense systems employing advanced electronic counter-countermeasures
      (ECCM) and missiles with sophisticated seekers. The high loss rate suggests a
      significant gap between its theoretical capabilities and its real-world performance
      in a dense, contested electronic environment.


      These losses are not solely the fault of the aircraft’s design. They are symptomatic
      of broader VKS doctrinal and logistical failures, including an inability to conduct
      an effective Suppression/Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD/DEAD) campaign
      in the opening phase of the war, a persistent lack of coordination, and a tendency
      to fly predictable routes.


      Attacks are often conducted by small formations of one or two aircraft rather
      than large, integrated strike packages, making them easier to intercept.


      The primary Russian tactical adaptation to this lethal environment has been the
      mass deployment of UMPK glide bomb kits. This innovation allows the Su-34 to release
      its heavy FAB-500 and FAB-1500 bombs from standoff ranges of 35-45 km or more,
      keeping the launch aircraft outside the reach of most of Ukraine’s frontline air
      defenses.


      While this has reduced the attrition rate of the Su-34 fleet, it has transformed
      the aircraft’s role into that of a relatively indiscriminate glide bomb “truck,”
      a far cry from the high-tech precision striker it was designed to be.


      A Tale of Two Philosophies: Su-34 Fullback vs. F-15E Strike Eagle


      To fully understand the Su-34, it is essential to compare it with its closest
      conceptual counterpart in the West: the American F-15E Strike Eagle.


      While both are two-seat, twin-engine aircraft designed for deep-strike missions,
      they are the products of vastly different design philosophies, technological capabilities,
      and military doctrines.


      Core Design Philosophy


      The fundamental difference lies in their origins.


      Su-34: The Bomber That Can Fight. The Su-34 is, at its core, a tactical bomber.
      Its design heavily prioritizes payload, range, and crew survivability (via its
      armored cockpit) for long, deep-penetration missions into hostile territory. Its
      air-to-air capabilities, while robust, are primarily for self-defense rather than
      offensive counter-air operations.


      The Su-34 is, at its core, a tactical bomber. Its design heavily prioritizes payload,
      range, and crew survivability (via its armored cockpit) for long, deep-penetration
      missions into hostile territory. Its air-to-air capabilities, while robust, are
      primarily for self-defense rather than offensive counter-air operations. F-15E:
      The Fighter That Can Bomb. The F-15E is a true multirole fighter. It was developed
      from one of the world’s most successful air superiority platforms, the F-15 Eagle,
      and it retains nearly all of its parent’s formidable air-to-air lethality. Its
      air-to-ground capability was added without fundamentally compromising its performance
      as a fighter.


      Performance and Technology Comparison


      This philosophical divergence is reflected in their performance metrics and technology.


      Speed and Agility: The F-15E holds a clear advantage. It is significantly faster
      (capable of Mach 2.2+ versus the Su-34’s Mach 1.8) and far more maneuverable,
      boasting a much higher thrust-to-weight ratio (approximately 0.93 compared to
      the Su-34’s 0.68). An F-15E, if forced into a dogfight, can perform as a lethal
      air superiority fighter; an Su-34 would be at a severe disadvantage against a
      dedicated fighter platform.


      Range and Payload: Here, the aircraft are more comparable, reflecting the Su-34’s
      focus as a bomber. The Fullback has a slightly greater ferry range on internal
      fuel and can carry a marginally heavier maximum ordnance load (up to 12,000-14,000
      kg vs. 10,400 kg for the Strike Eagle). However, in practical combat loadouts,
      the F-15E often has a superior combat radius.48


      Avionics and Sensors: The F-15E has a distinct technological edge. Modernized
      Strike Eagles are equipped with Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars
      like the AN/APG-82, which are generations ahead of the Su-34’s PESA system in
      terms of range, resolution, multi-targeting capability, and resistance to electronic
      jamming. Furthermore, the F-15E’s integration with advanced targeting pods like
      the Sniper ATP provides superior imaging and targeting capabilities compared to
      the Su-34’s internal Platan system.


      Operational Conclusion


      The F-15E is a more flexible, technologically advanced, and capable multirole
      platform. The Su-34 is a more specialized, rugged, heavy-payload strike aircraft.
      In a one-on-one air-to-air engagement, the F-15E would be overwhelmingly favored.
      In an uncontested air-to-ground scenario, the Su-34’s ability to haul a massive
      bomb load over long distances makes it a formidable bomber.


      However, in the complex, networked battlefields of the 21st century, the Strike
      Eagle’s superior sensor fusion, data links, and true multirole flexibility give
      it a decisive advantage.


      Table 3: Su-34 vs. F-15E: A Comparative Overview

      self-defense capability Multirole fighter with strike capability Max Speed Mach

      Electronically Scanned Array) AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) Air-to-Air
      Capability Primarily defensive; retains Flanker missiles Excellent; retains F-15’s
      full lethality


      Conclusion – The Future of a Battle-Scarred Fleet


      The Sukhoi Su-34 Fullback will remain a cornerstone of Russia’s tactical aviation
      for decades to come, but its role has been irrevocably altered by the brutal lessons
      of the war in Ukraine. The “flying tank” designed for low-level penetration has
      been forced to evolve into a standoff missileer, a transformation that reflects
      the lethal realities of modern air warfare. Its long-term viability now depends
      less on its armored cockpit and more on the sophistication of its sensors, weapons,
      and the electronic warfare systems that shield it from afar.


      The modernization program that produced the Su-34M variant is not a routine, pre-planned
      life extension but a direct and urgent reaction to the combat vulnerabilities
      exposed since 2022.


      The upgrades are squarely focused on correcting these deficiencies by enhancing
      standoff capabilities.


      This includes the integration of new, more capable reconnaissance and targeting
      pods (developed under the “Sych” program), an upgraded Khibiny EW suite to better
      counter modern threats, and an expanded arsenal of new precision weapons to close
      the PGM gap that has plagued its operations.


      There are also reports that the Su-34M may be fitted with the more powerful Saturn
      AL-41F1S engines from the Su-35 program, likely to improve performance when carrying
      the heavy glide bomb loads that have become its new primary armament.


      Despite heavy attrition, Russia continues to produce new Su-34s at the Novosibirsk
      plant to replenish its fleet, with new batches delivered in 2023 and 2024.


      However, while airframes can be replaced, the experienced and highly trained crews
      lost over Ukraine represent a far more significant and long-lasting blow to the
      VKS’s combat capability.


      Ultimately, the Su-34’s story is a cautionary tale about the nature of military
      evolution. An aircraft conceived in the final days of the Cold War, delayed by
      a nation’s collapse, and celebrated in a low-intensity conflict, was ultimately
      found wanting when tested in the fires of a major peer-level war.


      Its future, embodied by the Su-34M, is one of adaptation driven by necessity.
      It will continue to serve as a vital heavy payload carrier, but its effectiveness
      will be perpetually defined by a tense competition between the reach of its standoff
      weapons and the ever-advancing capabilities of enemy air defenses.

  - title: The European Political Establishment’s Tainted Victory in Romania
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/the-european-political-establishments-tainted-victory-in-romania/
    text: 'Europe’s increasingly stodgy and intolerant political establishment continues
      to celebrate an unexpected electoral triumph in Romania. It was a badly needed
      victory for the beleaguered elite, but it remains surrounded by more than a few
      suspicious circumstances.


      Worse still, a pseudo-democratic model for retaining political control through
      less-than-savory means appears to be gaining strength throughout the continent.


      European Political Landscape


      The European Union (EU) and its staunchest supporters were shaken to their core
      in multiple countries during late 2024 and early 2025.


      Populist conservative factions surged in popularity, a development that to some
      extent reflected Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. In the
      first round of Romania’s presidential election on November 24, 2024, Calin Georgescu,
      the candidate of a right-wing populist party, unexpectedly led the field. In addition
      to his populist social views, Georgescu was an outspoken critic of NATO. His apostasy
      on that issue made him especially unpalatable to Romania’s political establishment
      and its supporters in both the United States and Europe.


      Election results and political trends in other European countries were equally
      disconcerting to entrenched centrist and center-left factions. The right-wing
      Alternative for Germany (AfD) party vastly improved on its previous election performances
      in the country’s February 2025 parliamentary balloting. The AfD finished in second
      place, just a few percentage points behind the Christian Democrats, who would
      be the leading party in Germany’s new governing coalition.


      Polls regarding France’s forthcoming presidential election in 2027 also contained
      bad news for both left-wing and centrist political forces. Those polls showed
      Marine Le Pen, a longtime conservative populist leader, as the leading candidate
      and probable winner.


      One worrisome response of center and center-left political factions to such unsettling
      developments has been the intensification of their efforts to ban “extremist”
      right-wing parties and candidates. French authorities convicted Le Pen of violating
      campaign finance laws and imposed as one of the penalties a 5-year prohibition
      on her running for office. In late June 2025, Le Pen called on her political protégé,
      Jordan Bardella, to prepare for the 2027 presidential election. “I accept that
      I cannot run. Jordan accepts that he must step in.” In yet another “democratic”
      European country, the strongest, most popular conservative candidate has been
      forced aside.


      Perhaps the most significant and controversial of the punitive electoral restraints
      is the growing campaign in Germany to outlaw the AfD as supposedly fascist or
      neo-Nazi. That effort is significant given the party’s performance in the latest
      parliamentary elections. Outlawing the second-largest political party in a major
      European democratic country would be a considerable change.


      Understanding Romania


      Matters involving the adoption of undemocratic measures in the name of protecting
      democracy first came to a head in Romania.


      The country’s governing duopoly—the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the National
      Liberal Party (PNL)—did not react well to Georgescu’s unexpectedly strong showing
      in the first round of the presidential balloting. They used their dominant positions
      on both Romania’s election commission and Constitutional Court to invalidate the
      election result and reschedule the first round for May 4, 2025. Subsequently,
      those bodies disqualified Georgescu from the rerun and threatened him with criminal
      prosecution. The official justification was illicit “foreign (i.e., Russian) interference.”
      The evidence authorities cited for that allegation was extraordinarily weak and
      inconclusive, but Georgescu was nevertheless removed from the ballot.


      Much to the dismay of the establishment parties, though, another conservative
      nationalist, George Simion, led the new first round with 41 percent of the vote
      after receiving Georgescu’s endorsement. A supposed political “independent” Bucharest
      mayor, Nicusor Dan, edged out the joint PSD and PNL candidate, Crin Antonescu,
      to take second place and win the other spot in the May 18, 2025, runoff.


      Simion was widely expected to win the runoff, given the extent of widespread disgust
      with the governing parties and, in many circles, with the EU as well. Instead,
      Dan scored a modestly decisive victory (53.6 percent to 46.4 percent) that was
      greeted with wild enthusiasm by most European Union governments and Western NGOs.
      The circumstances surrounding that victory, though, have fueled more than a few
      suspicions and complaints.


      One notable feature is that Dan’s victory margin apparently was heavily dependent
      on votes from individuals who held dual Romanian and Hungarian citizenship or
      Romanian and Moldovan citizenship. The latter might have been especially significant
      since “pro-democracy” groups in the United States, such as the US Agency for International
      Development (USAID) and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), as well as
      similar factions in the EU, had subsidized favored groups in both Romania and
      Moldova for years as part of a campaign to thwart Moscow’s influence. Indeed,
      an especially hypocritical element of Romania’s original decision to void Georgescu’s
      victory in the presidential election’s first round was that even if Russian interference
      had taken place, it amounted at most to a few hundred thousand dollars—a sum dwarfed
      by Washington’s financial involvement.


      There are growing indications that Europe’s establishment parties intend to use
      the methods that ultimately prevailed in Romania as a model strategy to defeat
      populist electoral challenges in other countries, even if the Trump administration
      is unsympathetic to that approach. Cynics have long contended that unethical insurance
      companies frequently resort to a shameful but effective approach when dealing
      with troublesome claims: “delay, deny, and wait for the policyholder to die.”
      The political variant that Europe’s establishment factions use when confronting
      troublesome populist parties seems to be “smear, disqualify, and overwhelm the
      weakened survivors.”


      There is little reason to celebrate the outcome of Romania’s political battle.
      Nicosur Dan’s election falls far short of being a victory for genuine democracy.
      It is a tainted triumph at best. Real democracy must mean something more than
      guaranteed political dominance for centrist and socialist factions. Yet that is
      what took place in Romania and threatens to become the norm throughout the European
      continent. It is a cynical façade—a Potemkin structure concealing rule by a corrupt
      oligarchy that pretends to revere democratic norms even as the members make a
      mockery of those values.

  - title: What Makes the B-2 Spirit the Best Bomber on the Planet
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/what-makes-the-b-2-spirit-the-best-bomber-on-the-planet/
    text: 'Key Points and Summary – The US Air Force’s B-2 Spirit stealth bomber proved
      its enduring value in “Operation Midnight Hammer,” a 36-hour, non-stop mission
      from Missouri to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities.


      -With a 7,000-mile range and a payload capacity of 40,000 lbs, the B-2 is the
      only aircraft capable of delivering the 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bomb,
      which was critical to the operation’s success against hardened underground targets.


      -First flown in 1989 and now with only 19 operational aircraft, the B-2 remains
      at the forefront of America’s long-range strike capability until it is eventually
      replaced by the B-21 Raider.


      Meet the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber


      A few days ago, the U.S. military launched a precision strike against Iran’s nuclear
      program.


      Seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers delivered GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator
      (MOP), the largest non-nuclear munitions in the world, against the Iranian nuclear
      facilities at Fordow and Natanz. Soon thereafter, a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered
      cruise missile submarine launched a salvo of approximately 30 Tomahawk missiles
      against the nuclear research facility at Isfahan.


      The bombing damage assessment is still ongoing, but one thing is certain: Iran’s
      nuclear program suffered a major blow.


      The B-2 Spirit’s impressive capabilities are the main reason behind the success
      of Operation Midnight Hammer.


      The strategic bomber’s operational range shone during Operation Midnight Hammer.
      The strike package took off from Whiteman Air Force Base, in Missouri, and flew
      for 18 hours to the target area. The distance between the base and the target
      was approximately 7,000 miles. The B-2s not only flew that distance and struck
      their target successfully, but they also immediately flew back to their base.
      Throughout that journey, the strike package refueled midair several times.


      The B-2 is designed for deep penetration strikes against high-value targets in
      semi-permissive and non-permissive areas. The strategic bomber’s stealth capabilities
      mean that it can stay hidden from enemy radars for long periods of time. To achieve
      such results, the B-2 relies on a combination of onboard sensors, structural design,
      special paint, and pilot skills.


      When it comes to the specific capabilities of the stealth bomber, the B-2 has
      the ability to carry approximately 40,000 lbs of munitions. As part of that payload,
      it can carry both conventional and nuclear munitions. It is the only aircraft
      in the U.S. Air Force’s arsenal that can carry the massive GBU-57 MOP, a bunker-busting
      bomb that weighs 30,000 pounds.


      The aircraft is powered by four General Electric F118-GE-100 engines that have
      the ability to produce a combined thrust of 68,000 pounds and can achieve maximum
      speeds of about 700 miles per hour (or Mach 0.9). The B-2 has a crew of two which
      allows pilots to alternate for longer missions, such as Operation Midnight Hammer.


      The B-2 Is Getting Old Fast


      Nevertheless, the B-2 Spirit is getting old. The aircraft first flew in 1989 and
      entered service with the Air Force four years later in 1993. The B-2 fleet achieved
      full operational capability in 2003. Initially, the Air Force had grand plans
      about the B-2 and envisioned a fleet of hundreds of aircraft.


      In the end, however, it ended up only buying 21 bombers. Today, 19 are operational.


      Despite the aircraft’s usefulness in old age, the Air Force is already planning
      its succession. The B-21 Raider, a similar-looking but far more advanced stealth
      strategic bomber, is under development. The Air Force expects the B-21 to enter
      service in the next few years.


      Until then, the B-2 fleet is getting some upgrades and remains at the tip of the
      spear of America’s global strike capabilities.

    text: 'The Su-35S Flanker-E: Russia’s Apex Predator of the 4th Generation


      The Sukhoi Su-35S, designated “Flanker-E” by NATO, represents the zenith of conventional
      4th-generation fighter design and a cornerstone of the modern Russian Aerospace
      Forces (VKS).


      It is not merely an incremental upgrade of its legendary progenitor, the Su-27,
      but a comprehensive “deep modernization” that resulted in a profoundly more capable
      multi-role combat aircraft.


      The Su-35S is a strategic asset born from the crucible of post-Soviet economic
      realities and the protracted development of Russia’s 5th-generation Su-57 program,
      for which it serves as a critical technological and operational bridge.


      The aircraft is defined by a triad of core capabilities: extreme “supermaneuverability”
      endowed by powerful thrust-vectoring engines, a suite of advanced long-range sensors,
      and a formidable multi-role weapons payload that allows it to contest air superiority
      and execute precision strikes.


      The Su-35S serves as a crucial stopgap for the VKS, furnishing a high-end capability
      to counter advanced Western 4th-generation fighters while the more complex and
      costly Su-57 program matures and scales.


      Its combat deployments in Syria and, more significantly, Ukraine have provided
      the VKS with invaluable operational experience, serving as both a live-fire testing
      ground for tactics and technology and a high-stakes marketing showcase for potential
      export customers.


      This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Su-35S, examining its developmental
      lineage, technical specifications, comparative performance, combat history, and
      its strategic role in Russian military doctrine and foreign policy.


      A Flanker Forged Anew: From Su-27M to Su-35S


      The evolutionary path from the original Su-27 to the modern Su-35S is not a simple,
      linear upgrade but a complex story of ambition, collapse, and pragmatic resurrection.


      It encompasses two distinct design phases separated by the dissolution of the
      Soviet Union, with the final Su-35S benefiting from technologies refined in parallel
      programs that were never intended for it.


      The Soviet Precursor (Su-27M)


      The genesis of an advanced Flanker began in the early 1980s, culminating in the
      Su-27M program, which first took to the skies on June 28, 1988.


      This aircraft represented a significant leap beyond the baseline Su-27’s pure
      air superiority mission, aiming for a true multi-role capability. Key features
      included the addition of canard foreplanes for enhanced maneuverability and stability,
      a new N011 multi-mode radar with ground-mapping capabilities, a modernized glass
      cockpit with CRT displays, and an in-flight refueling probe to extend its operational
      reach.


      In a bid to capture international interest and funding, the Sukhoi Design Bureau
      marketed this advanced variant as the “Su-35“.


      However, within the Soviet military, its official designation remained Su-27M.
      Despite its promising capabilities, the program fell victim to the economic chaos
      and political disintegration of the Soviet Union. Mass production was never initiated,
      and the program was effectively terminated after only a small number of prototypes
      and demonstrators—sources suggest between 12 and 14—were constructed.


      One of these airframes, T10M-11, was later fitted with experimental thrust-vectoring
      engines and redesignated the Su-37 “Terminator,” serving as a crucial technology
      demonstrator that would heavily influence future Flanker developments.


      The “Deep Modernization” (Su-35BM/Su-35S)


      The Su-27M’s failure to enter production created a significant capability gap
      for the newly formed Russian Air Force. As the 1990s progressed, it became clear
      that Russia’s fifth-generation fighter programs, the MiG 1.44 and Su-47, were
      stalled, and the subsequent PAK FA program (which would eventually produce the
      Su-57) faced a long and uncertain development timeline.


      In 2003, Sukhoi launched a new, privately funded initiative to create a heavily
      upgraded Flanker that could serve as a powerful interim solution. This project
      was designated Su-35BM, meaning Bolshaya Modernizatsiya, or “Big Modernization.”


      This was not a simple revival of the Su-27M. Instead, it was a more radical redesign
      that leveraged nearly two decades of technological progress. It integrated key
      technologies that had been matured on the successful Su-30MKI export program for
      India, such as advanced avionics and thrust-vectoring, while also incorporating
      systems being developed for the nascent Su-57.


      The first Su-35BM prototype performed its maiden flight on February 19, 2008.
      The Russian Aerospace Forces became the launch customer, placing their first order
      in 2009, with the production version designated Su-35S (Stroyevoy, or “Combatant”).
      The aircraft officially entered service in February 2014.


      The evolution of the Su-35S is a clear illustration of pragmatic adaptation in
      the face of geopolitical and economic upheaval. The Su-27M represented the Soviet
      Union’s peak ambition for a fourth-generation multi-role fighter, an ambition
      that was cut short by the state’s collapse.


      This left the Russian Air Force with a looming capability gap as Western air forces
      continued to advance. The Su-30MKI, developed for a foreign customer, became an
      unexpected technological lifeline, allowing Sukhoi to refine and prove key systems
      like digital flight controls and thrust vectoring that were too costly to pursue
      domestically at the time.


      The Su-35S program then masterfully re-integrated these matured technologies,
      along with advanced sensor and engine elements from the Su-57 program, back into
      the proven Flanker airframe.11 The Su-35S is therefore not just an “upgraded Su-27”;
      it is the beneficiary of two decades of parallel, and at times divergent, development
      paths, resurrected to fill a strategic void left by both the Soviet collapse and
      the slow pace of Russia’s fifth-generation ambitions. It is a powerful, pragmatic
      solution born directly from necessity.


      Anatomy of a Super Flanker: A Technical Deep Dive


      The Su-35S is a fundamentally different machine from its predecessors, featuring
      extensive modifications to its airframe, a new generation of powerplants, and
      a completely overhauled sensor and avionics architecture. These changes collectively
      produce an aircraft with a flight envelope and combat capability far exceeding
      any previous Flanker variant.


      Airframe and Aerodynamics


      The Su-35S airframe, while retaining the iconic Flanker silhouette, underwent
      a significant redesign to enhance performance, increase service life, and reduce
      its radar signature.


      The structure was reinforced, with extensive use of titanium alloys and an increased
      share of composite materials, which extended its service life to 6,000 flight
      hours or 30 years of operation.


      A key aerodynamic and visual distinction is the removal of the canard foreplanes
      that were a defining feature of the Su-27M and Su-30MKI.


      The large dorsal airbrake found on the Su-27 was also eliminated. Braking functions
      are now performed by the differential deflection of the twin rudders.


      This cleaner aerodynamic configuration was made possible by two key advancements.
      First, the development of a more sophisticated quadruple-redundant digital fly-by-wire
      (FBW) system, the KSU-35, provided the necessary stability and control authority
      without the need for canards. Second, the introduction of powerful thrust-vectoring
      engines allowed for a shift in the aircraft’s center of gravity and provided exceptional
      control, rendering the canards redundant.


      Engineers also took steps to reduce the aircraft’s radar cross-section (RCS).
      While not a stealth aircraft, the Su-35S incorporates radar-absorbent materials
      (RAM) in critical areas like the engine inlets and the leading edges of the wings.
      These measures, combined with a smoother airframe, are reported to reduce its
      frontal RCS to between 1 and 3 square meters, a significant reduction compared
      to the Su-27.


      To enhance its range and endurance, the internal fuel capacity was increased by
      over 20% to 11,500 kg.


      Furthermore, the Su-35S became the first single-seat Flanker variant designed
      from the outset to be compatible with external fuel tanks, capable of carrying
      two 2,000-liter drop tanks.


      Propulsion and Supermaneuverability


      The heart of the Su-35S’s performance is its pair of Saturn AL-41F1S (Izdeliye
      117S) afterburning turbofan engines.


      These are not entirely new powerplants but are heavily upgraded derivatives of
      the venerable AL-31F engine family. They share a common core with the first-stage
      AL-41F1 engine developed for the Su-57 stealth fighter, differing primarily in
      the engine control system.


      Each engine can produce up to 86.3 kN of dry thrust and a formidable 142.2 kN
      (approximately 32,000 lbf) with afterburner in an emergency power setting.


      This gives the aircraft a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1:1 at normal combat
      weight, enabling exceptional acceleration and a rate of climb exceeding 280 m/s
      (55,000 ft/min).


      The engines’ most defining feature is their three-dimensional thrust-vectoring
      control (TVC) nozzles. These nozzles can deflect independently in both pitch and
      yaw, granting the Su-35S its signature “supermaneuverability”.


      This capability allows the aircraft to perform extreme post-stall maneuvers at
      very low airspeeds—such as the Pugachev’s Cobra, the Kulbit (somersault), and
      the flat spin—that are impossible for conventional fighters. While their direct
      combat utility is debated, these maneuvers can be used to change the aircraft’s
      pointing direction rapidly or to break an opponent’s radar lock.


      Furthermore, the power and efficiency of the AL-41F1S engines enable the Su-35S
      to achieve a limited supercruise capability. This allows the aircraft to sustain
      supersonic flight at speeds of Mach 1.1 or higher, without the significant fuel
      consumption associated with afterburners, providing a substantial tactical advantage.
      This advantage increases engagement range and reduces reaction time for both offensive
      and defensive maneuvers.


      The Digital Hunter: Avionics and Sensor Suite


      The Su-35S is equipped with a completely new sensor and avionics suite that represents
      a generational leap over the Su-27.


      Irbis-E Radar: The primary sensor is the N035 Irbis-E (“Snow Leopard”), a powerful
      X-band Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar developed by the Tikhomirov
      NIIP institute. Its 900mm antenna is mounted on a two-step electro-hydraulic drive.
      This hybrid system combines the rapid beam steering of electronic scanning (±60°)
      with mechanical movement of the entire array (another ±60°), giving it an exceptionally
      wide total field of regard of ±120° in azimuth. The radar is extremely powerful,
      with a peak output of 20 kW. This allows it to detect a fighter-sized target (3m²
      RCS) at ranges up to 400 km in a narrow search sector. It can track up to 30 airborne
      targets and simultaneously engage up to eight. It also possesses advanced air-to-surface
      modes, including high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mapping.


      OLS-35 IRST: Complementing the radar is the OLS-35, an advanced Infrared Search
      and Track (IRST) system housed in the traditional Flanker position forward of
      the cockpit, offset to the starboard side. This system provides passive (non-emitting)
      detection and tracking of aerial targets, a critical capability for operating
      in a radar-silent mode or against stealth aircraft. It has a claimed detection
      range against a non-afterburning fighter of up to 90 km from the rear hemisphere
      and 50 km from the front. The OLS-35 also integrates a television camera and a
      laser rangefinder/target designator for both air and ground targets.


      Defensive Systems: The aircraft’s survivability is enhanced by the integrated
      L175M Khibiny-M electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite. This system includes a
      sophisticated radar warning receiver (RWR), digital radio frequency memory (DRFM)
      jammers, and flare/chaff dispensers to defeat and deceive enemy radar and missile
      threats.


      The avionics architecture of the Su-35S reveals a distinct Russian design philosophy
      that contrasts sharply with its Western contemporaries. While fighters like the
      F-15EX and F-35 prioritize Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars and
      highly integrated sensor fusion for low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) operations
      and networked data sharing, the Su-35S employs a more direct, power-focused approach.
      The Irbis-E PESA radar is designed to be overwhelmingly powerful, capable of “burning
      through” enemy electronic jamming and detecting targets at extreme ranges. This
      is paired with the long-range passive detection of the OLS-35 IRST.


      This combination reflects a doctrine that values raw detection power and a mix
      of active and passive sensing over the networked stealth and data-centric warfare
      that are central to Western 5th-generation concepts. It represents a “brute force”
      method of achieving situational awareness, aiming to overwhelm an opponent’s countermeasures
      rather than to remain entirely undetected.


      Claws of the Flanker: Armament and Mission Capabilities


      The Su-35S’s transition to a true multi-role platform is most evident in its vast
      and modernized arsenal. With 12 external hardpoints and a maximum payload of 8,000
      kg, it can be configured for a wide spectrum of missions, from air superiority
      to standoff strikes.


      Air-to-Air Dominance


      In the air-to-air role, the Su-35S leverages a layered missile capability to engage
      targets from beyond visual range to close-in dogfights.


      Very Long-Range: The aircraft’s most formidable air-to-air weapon is the R-37M
      (NATO: AA-13 ‘Axehead’). This massive missile, originally developed for the MiG-31
      interceptor, has a reported range approaching 400 km and a hypersonic speed of
      Mach 6.15 While designed to target high-value assets like AWACS, tankers, and
      bombers, it has been used with notable effect against Ukrainian fighters from
      extreme standoff distances. The Su-35S can carry up to four R-37M missiles.


      Medium-Range: The primary beyond-visual-range (BVR) weapon is the R-77-1 (AA-12
      ‘Adder’). This is an active radar-homing “fire-and-forget” missile with a range
      of approximately 110 km. The Su-35S can carry up to 12 R-77-1s, giving it a potent
      multiple-engagement capability against maneuvering fighters.


      Short-Range: For within-visual-range (WVR) combat, the aircraft is armed with
      the highly agile R-73 (AA-11 ‘Archer’) and its improved successor, the R-74. These
      are infrared-homing missiles with a high off-boresight capability, meaning they
      can be cued by the pilot’s helmet-mounted sight to lock onto targets at extreme
      angles from the aircraft’s nose.


      Legacy Systems: Due to large existing stockpiles, the VKS frequently arms the
      Su-35S with the older R-27 (AA-10 ‘Alamo’) family of semi-active radar-homing
      missiles. While less advanced than the R-77, the extended-range R-27ER/ET variants
      still possess an impressive range of up to 130 km.


      Air-to-Surface Strike


      Unlike its Su-27 predecessor, the Su-35S is a highly capable strike aircraft.


      Anti-Radiation Missiles: For Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions,
      the aircraft can deploy a range of anti-radiation missiles, including the Kh-31P/PD
      and the long-range Kh-58UShE, to target enemy radar installations.


      Tactical and Anti-Ship Missiles: The Su-35S can carry a variety of tactical air-to-surface
      missiles, such as the laser-guided Kh-29L and TV-guided Kh-29TE.11 Its anti-shipping
      arsenal is particularly robust, including the supersonic Kh-31A/AD, the subsonic
      Kh-35U, and even heavy cruise missiles like the Kh-59MK, 3M-54 Kalibr, and P-800
      Oniks.


      Guided Bombs: For precision strikes, the Su-35S is compatible with the KAB-500
      and KAB-1500 series of bombs, which feature TV, laser, and satellite guidance
      options.


      Internal Cannon: For strafing and close-range engagements, a single 30mm Gryazev-Shipunov
      GSh-30-1 cannon with 150 rounds is fitted in the starboard wing root.

      Measuring the Apex Predator: A Comparative Analysis


      The Su-35S’s capabilities are best understood when measured against its direct
      predecessor, the Su-27, and its primary Western and Russian contemporaries. This
      comparison reveals a fundamental divergence in design philosophies, pitting the
      Su-35S’s emphasis on supreme agility and raw sensor power against the Western
      focus on stealth and networked data fusion.


      Generational Leap (vs. Su-27)


      The Su-35S is not merely an upgrade but a generational leap beyond the original
      Su-27 ‘Flanker-B’.


      Airframe & Performance: The Su-35S features a lighter, more durable airframe with
      a higher percentage of composites and titanium, a significantly higher thrust-to-weight
      ratio, three-dimensional thrust vectoring, and supercruise capability. These combine
      to give it a flight performance envelope that is vastly superior to the Su-27.


      Avionics: The most critical difference lies in the sensor suite. The Su-27’s 1980s-era
      N001 mechanically scanned radar, with a detection range of around 80 km against
      a fighter target, is completely outclassed by the Su-35S’s Irbis-E PESA, which
      can detect a similar target at up to 400 km. The OLS-35 IRST nearly doubles the
      detection range of the Su-27’s OLS-27 (90 km vs. 50 km).


      Armament & Role: The Su-27 was a dedicated air superiority fighter with only a
      rudimentary capability to drop unguided bombs. The Su-35S, by contrast, is a true
      multi-role platform, capable of deploying a vast arsenal of advanced, standoff
      air-to-surface munitions, transforming it into a potent strike aircraft.


      Peer-to-Peer Engagements


      vs. F-15EX Eagle II: This is a classic matchup of 4++ generation heavy fighters.
      The F-15EX holds an advantage in its advanced AESA radar and potentially superior
      processing power and sensor fusion, adhering to the Western emphasis on information
      dominance. The Su-35S possesses a clear edge in close-in maneuverability due to
      its thrust-vectoring nozzles. Both aircraft have comparable top speeds and thrust-to-weight
      ratios and can carry a heavy load of up to 12 air-to-air missiles. A potential
      engagement would likely be decided by the effectiveness of their respective electronic
      warfare suites, BVR missile performance, and ultimately, pilot skill.


      vs. F-22 Raptor: This comparison highlights the generational divide. The F-22’s
      all-aspect stealth, superior sensor fusion, and networked capabilities are designed
      to give it a decisive advantage in beyond-visual-range combat. The doctrine is
      to achieve “first look, first shot, first kill,” engaging the Su-35S long before
      it can be detected. While the Su-35S’s supermaneuverability would make it a formidable
      opponent in a hypothetical within-visual-range dogfight, the F-22 is also extremely
      agile and its tactical doctrine is predicated on avoiding such a merge entirely.
      Anecdotal reports from encounters over Syria, though not definitive, suggest that
      F-22 pilots felt confident in their ability to dominate the engagements.


      vs. Eurofighter Typhoon: This presents a very close matchup between two highly
      agile, non-stealthy fighters. The Typhoon was designed with an emphasis on supercruise
      and high-supersonic agility, enabling a BVR combat doctrine of “shoot and scoot”—firing
      long-range missiles and then using its speed and energy retention to disengage
      and re-engage on its own terms. The Su-35S, with its thrust vectoring, likely
      holds an advantage in low-speed, post-stall maneuvering for close-in combat. The
      Typhoon, with its lighter airframe and different aerodynamic design, may have
      superior energy retention in high-G turns at speed. The outcome would depend heavily
      on the specific engagement scenario and tactical execution.


      The comparative analysis of the Su-35S against its peers reveals a fundamental
      divergence in modern fighter design philosophy. The Su-35S represents the ultimate
      expression of kinetic performance—a design that seeks to win engagements through
      superior speed, power, and extreme agility, coupled with a powerful “brute force”
      sensor suite.


      In contrast, Western fifth-generation aircraft like the F-22 and F-35 prioritize
      information dominance through all-aspect stealth, advanced sensor fusion, and
      networked warfare.


      Their doctrine is to control the battlespace by remaining unseen, making kinematic
      performance a secondary, albeit still important, attribute. The F-15EX and Eurofighter
      Typhoon occupy a middle ground, blending robust kinematics with advanced AESA
      radars and networking, but lacking the comprehensive stealth of their fifth-generation
      counterparts.


      The Su-35S is thus Russia’s most potent answer to the advanced fourth-generation
      threat, but its effectiveness against a truly networked, fifth-generation opponent
      remains one of the most critical and debated questions in modern air power.

      Trial by Fire: Operational History and Combat Record


      The Su-35S is not merely a theoretical powerhouse; it has been tested and refined
      through extensive combat operations in two of the 21st century’s most demanding
      air environments: Syria and Ukraine.


      Syrian Debut (2016-Present)


      The Su-35S made its combat debut in January 2016, with the deployment of four
      aircraft to Khmeimim Airbase in Syria. This deployment was a direct response to
      the November 2015 shootdown of a Russian Su-24 bomber by a Turkish F-16, signaling
      Russia’s intent to establish air superiority and protect its assets.


      The primary missions for the Su-35S in Syria were providing top cover for Russian
      strike packages, conducting armed combat air patrols, and acting as a deterrent
      to Turkish and Israeli air operations. While they were seen carrying unguided
      bombs, their main role was air-to-air, and they were the first Russian fighters
      deployed to Syria seen carrying modern R-77-1 active radar-guided missiles.


      Throughout 2019, Su-35s were frequently scrambled to intercept Israeli and Turkish
      aircraft. On multiple occasions, Russian and Syrian sources claimed these interceptions
      forced attacking aircraft to abort their missions over Syrian territory. There
      were also numerous close encounters with US aircraft, including anecdotal reports
      of simulated dogfights with F-22 Raptors. While Russian-affiliated sources claimed
      the Su-35S performed well, US pilots and analysts maintain that the F-22’s stealth
      and situational awareness provided a decisive advantage.


      From a strategic perspective, the Syrian deployment was a success for Russia.
      It allowed the VKS to test the aircraft’s systems, particularly its avionics and
      engines, in a real-world combat environment, leading to software and hardware
      refinements.


      The deployment also served as a powerful marketing tool, showcasing the aircraft’s
      capabilities to potential customers in the region and beyond. Russian officials
      reported that the Su-35S demonstrated reliability rates three to four times higher
      than standard, a key selling point.


      The Proving Ground of Ukraine (2022-Present)


      The full-scale invasion of Ukraine has provided the most intense and revealing
      test of the Su-35S’s capabilities and vulnerabilities. It has emerged as the VKS’s
      most critical air superiority platform in the conflict, adapting its tactics to
      a highly contested and lethal air defense environment.


      The aircraft’s most significant contribution has been its role as a long-range
      interceptor. Flying high-altitude combat air patrols (CAPs) from the relative
      safety of Russian-controlled airspace, Su-35S pilots have employed the very-long-range
      R-37M “Axehead” air-to-air missile to devastating effect.


      This tactic leverages the Su-35’s powerful Irbis-E radar to detect Ukrainian aircraft
      at extreme distances, allowing the Mach 6 R-37M to engage them long before they
      can get within range to fire their own weapons. This has posed a severe threat
      to the Ukrainian Air Force, which has struggled to counter these standoff attacks.


      However, the Su-35S has not been invulnerable. While initial claims of losses
      were high, open-source intelligence has confirmed the destruction of at least
      eight Su-35S jets by mid-2025.


      These losses have been attributed primarily to sophisticated Western-supplied
      ground-based air defense systems (GBADS), particularly the MIM-104 Patriot. In
      at least one instance, a Su-35S was downed deep inside Russian territory, highlighting
      the reach and effectiveness of Ukraine’s evolving air defense network.


      There have also been credible reports of losses due to friendly fire, a persistent
      problem for Russian forces in the conflict.


      The performance of the Su-35S in Ukraine presents a nuanced and complex picture
      of modern air combat. On one hand, its successful employment of the R-37M missile
      demonstrates a potent tactical adaptation by the VKS to a high-threat environment.
      By avoiding direct penetration of heavily defended airspace and leveraging its
      powerful sensors and long-range weapons, the Su-35S has established itself as
      Russia’s most effective air-to-air asset in the war.


      On the other hand, its confirmed losses to advanced SAMs like the Patriot underscore
      the profound vulnerability of even highly advanced, non-stealthy 4++ generation
      fighters in the face of a modern, layered Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).


      The war in Ukraine is thus a live-fire demonstration of the relentless competition
      between advanced combat aircraft and the systems designed to destroy them, proving
      that while the Su-35S may be dominant against other aircraft in its preferred
      engagement envelope, it cannot guarantee its own survival against a capable and
      adaptive ground-based threat.


      Strategic Calculus: Doctrine, Exports, and the Future


      The Su-35S is more than just a collection of advanced systems; it is a strategic
      instrument that reflects Russia’s military doctrine, its geopolitical ambitions,
      and its place in the global arms market. Its future, and that of the VKS, is intrinsically
      linked to the progress of the Su-57 program and the shifting dynamics of international
      relations.


      The Flanker’s Place in Russian Doctrine


      Within the Russian Aerospace Forces, the Su-35S serves as the premier air superiority
      workhorse, a role it is expected to hold until the fifth-generation Su-57 becomes
      available in operationally significant numbers.


      The VKS employs a mixed-fleet strategy, where Su-35S fighters often provide air
      cover and escort for Su-34 strike bombers and Su-25 ground-attack aircraft.


      Furthermore, it has been tested in advanced command-and-control roles, networking
      with the Su-57 to share sensor data in experimental “swarm” teaming exercises.


      This doctrinal approach emphasizes kinetic engagement and supermaneuverability,
      a philosophy that prioritizes winning a direct confrontation through superior
      flight performance, which stands in contrast to the Western focus on stealth,
      data fusion, and network-centric warfare.


      The Geopolitics of Export


      The export history of the Su-35S serves as a clear barometer of the ongoing great
      power competition between the United States and Russia.


      China: The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) became the first export
      customer, signing a contract for 24 aircraft. This deal was a significant indicator
      of deepening Sino-Russian strategic ties and subsequently triggered U.S. sanctions
      against China’s Equipment Development Department under the Countering America’s
      Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).


      The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) became the first export customer,
      signing a contract for 24 aircraft. This deal was a significant indicator of deepening
      Sino-Russian strategic ties and subsequently triggered U.S. sanctions against
      China’s Equipment Development Department under the Countering America’s Adversaries
      Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Egypt, Algeria, and Iran: A more complex saga
      unfolded with a batch of over 20 Su-35s originally built for Egypt under a 2018
      contract. Cairo’s interest was driven by a need to counter regional rivals and
      by frustration over long-standing U.S. restrictions on the sale of advanced F-15s
      and long-range missiles. However, under intense pressure from Washington and the
      explicit threat of CAATSA sanctions, Egypt ultimately cancelled the deal. This
      left Russia with a number of “white tail” airframes already produced. These aircraft
      became a geopolitical tool. In early 2025, satellite imagery confirmed that some
      of these jets, still in their Egyptian desert camouflage, had been delivered to
      Algeria, a nation with a long history of purchasing Russian arms and less susceptibility
      to U.S. pressure. Iran has also reportedly finalized a deal for some of these
      aircraft, spurred by its provision of drones to Russia for the war in Ukraine,
      though actual deliveries have been repeatedly delayed, likely due to the complex
      geopolitical and logistical landscape.


      The journey of these specific airframes—from an assembly line in Komsomolsk-on-Amur,
      to a failed deal with a U.S. partner, to their eventual redirection to non-aligned
      or adversarial nations—perfectly illustrates the Su-35’s role as more than just
      military hardware. Its sales and transfers act as a tangible measure of a nation’s
      geopolitical alignment, its willingness to defy U.S. foreign policy, and Russia’s
      use of arms exports to solidify influence and generate revenue in a world increasingly
      defined by sanctions and strategic competition.


      Conclusion: The Last of the Super Flankers


      The Sukhoi Su-35S is, without question, the most capable and lethal conventional
      fighter ever derived from the legendary Flanker lineage. It stands as a testament
      to the fundamental excellence and adaptability of the original Su-27 airframe,
      pushed to the absolute limits of fourth-generation technology.


      In terms of raw kinematic performance, it remains a formidable threat to any contemporary
      fourth-generation aircraft in the world.


      However, its long-term strategic relevance is challenged by the inexorable global
      shift towards fifth-generation capabilities defined by all-aspect stealth, advanced
      networking, and sophisticated sensor fusion.


      Its combat record in Ukraine is a double-edged sword: it has demonstrated devastating
      long-range kill potential with the R-37M missile but has also proven vulnerable
      to modern, integrated air defense systems. This highlights the growing difficulty
      for non-stealthy platforms to survive on a transparent, high-threat battlefield.


      The Su-35S will likely remain the backbone of the VKS’s tactical aviation for
      at least another decade, a powerful and versatile asset that bridges the gap to
      a future dominated by the Su-57 and, perhaps, uncrewed platforms.


      Its ultimate legacy, however, will likely be that of the ultimate “Super Flanker”—the
      final and most potent expression of a legendary fourth-generation design, perfected
      at the very moment the paradigm of air combat was shifting decisively toward stealth.

      Production'

    text: 'Key Points and Summary – The United States must accelerate production of
      the B-21 Raider stealth bomber by opening a second production facility and increasing
      the build rate from 10 to 20 aircraft per year.


      -The current plan to field at least 100 B-21s by the late 2030s is “too little
      and too late” to deter rising threats from China and Russia. Learning from the
      mistake of curtailing B-2 and F-22 production, the US needs a much larger fleet
      of at least 145 B-21s, as stated by the STRATCOM Commander.


      -A second plant would increase industrial capacity, reduce risk, and allow for
      potential foreign sales to key allies.


      The B-21 Raider Bomber Fleet Must Be Expanded


      The Air Force’s newest strategic bomber, the B-21 Raider, is a technological marvel
      many years in the making. It builds on decades of stealth technology and provides
      vital long-range, deep-strike capability necessary to deter adversaries for the
      next several decades.


      That’s the good news. The bad news: we aren’t producing as many of them as quickly
      as we should.


      Given the appropriate secrecy surrounding the program, we don’t know the current
      B-21 inventory or production rate. However, the Air Force has stated it needs
      at least 100 aircraft and that it expects to procure 10 aircraft per year once
      in full-rate production.


      At best, the nation is unlikely to have even 100 aircraft until the late 2030s.
      This is both too little and too late.


      The nation needs a second production facility for the B-21, regardless of the
      final number of aircraft to be procured. The Defense Department should set a production
      rate of 20 aircraft per year. This demand signal will allow the B-21’s producer,
      Northrop Grumman, to build a second production plant. Although the cost of building
      a second facility is likely to approach $800M, the return on investment is extraordinarily
      high.


      An additional facility will increase the rate at which the nation can build, field,
      and operate the B-21 fleet. Deterring China from aggression is a long-term strategy
      that requires action today. Deterrence cannot be achieved without credible, survivable,
      and sufficient long-range conventional strike capability.


      The B-21 provides this foundational capability. We simply cannot wait until the
      late 2030s to field sufficient capacity for this vital deterrence role.


      A second facility will also allow the US to increase total B-21 inventory. We
      must procure the number of aircraft we need, not the number that fits under some
      arbitrary budget topline. The Air Force has an unfortunate history of taking the
      opposite approach, albeit by the direction of their political masters. The F-22
      Raptor and B-2 Spirit are prime examples of programs curtailed by budgetary constraints
      rather than strategic necessity.


      The F-22, an unmatched air superiority fighter, saw its production capped at 187
      aircraft, far short of the original requirement for over 700. Similarly, the B-2
      Spirit was limited to a fleet of only 21 operational aircraft, falling dramatically
      short of the envisioned 132 units. Both decisions were driven by the incorrect
      belief that smaller, technologically superior forces could substitute for larger
      fleets.


      Capacity is a quality all its own. This is true for both the industrial capacity
      to build, and the operational capacity to deter and fight our nation’s wars. US
      Strategic Command Commander General Tony Cotton, USAF, recently testified before
      Congress that the nation needs at least 145 B-21s. Some speculate that the nation
      will need more – at least 250.


      China has ambitions of global hegemony; Russia is increasingly fixated on recreating
      their once-dominant Soviet power; Iran and North Korea show few signs of comity.
      The foundation to address 21st century challenges is sufficient force structure.
      A second production plant will allow the US to build, field, and operate the inventory
      that it needs and on a timeline that respects these threats.


      Additional B-21 production capacity will also allow the US to consider sales of
      the aircraft to other nations. Our closest allies have signaled an interest in
      buying the B-21. Unlike the F-22, the F-35 was designed as a capability to be
      shared with allies and partners. The value of this approach increased the warfighting
      capability of our allies, improved operational and technical interoperability
      for our warfighters, bolstered the US defense industry, and signaled to our enemies
      the strength of US-led alliances around the world. We should strongly consider
      a similar approach for the B-21 and must be able to make such decisions unconstrained
      by self-imposed industrial capacity limitations.


      Finally, building a second B-21 production plant is a smart industrial policy
      decision. Diversification of production limits risk posed by man-made and natural
      disasters.


      It increases workforce demands for high-pay, high-skilled labor and improves local
      economies outside the Palmdale, Calif. location where the B-21 is being built.
      The current plant in Palmdale was previously used to build the B-2. A second plant
      will also provide the infrastructure for follow-on industrial capacity beyond
      the B-21.


      The B-21 Raider represents the future of America’s strategic bomber force, a platform
      designed to ensure dominance in an era of complex and evolving threats. But the
      success of this program hinges not only on its advanced capabilities but also
      on the ability to produce it at scale and speed.\


      The House version of the reconciliation bill takes an important first step, adding
      $4.5 billion to help accelerate production and allow for an inventory above 100
      Aircraft. But a second production facility is essential to meeting both the nation’s
      operational requirements and the broader demands of allied collaboration.


      History has shown us the perils of settling for what seems affordable rather than
      what is necessary. The United States cannot afford to make the same mistake with
      the B-21 Raider. Quantity, as much as quality, will define the strategic balance
      of the 21st century. By investing in a second production line, the nation can
      ensure that this balance tips decisively in its favor.

      -The documents, obtained by German magazine Der Spiegel and Danish NGO Danwatch
      from a public military tender database, detail the layout, security systems, and
      recent upgrades to the bases near Yasny, which house nuclear-capable Avangard
      hypersonic glide vehicles.


      -Experts like Hans M. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists called
      the leak “completely unprecedented,” as it provides an inside look at facilities
      previously only monitored by satellite, revealing their strengths and potential
      vulnerabilities.


      How a Public Database Exposed the Blueprints for Putin’s Nuclear Bunkers


      On May 28, German news magazine Der Spiegel and Danish investigative NGO Danwatch
      announced that they are in possession of two million documents revealing extensive
      upgrades and expansions of Russia’s nuclear weapons bases. Among the leaked documents
      are hundreds of blueprints of two of Russia’s most protected nuclear missile bases.


      Located by the town of Yasny in southern Russia near the Ural Mountains and close
      to the border with Kazakhstan, the two bases have been home to parts of Russia’s
      most modern nuclear arsenal since 2019, when they received nuclear-capable Avangard
      hypersonic glide vehicles.


      Announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin the year before during a speech
      on the modernization of the country’s nuclear arsenal, the Avangard is launched
      by a conventional rocket booster from which it then separates and glides unpowered,
      at extremely high speeds, towards a target. It has a reported range of 6,000 kms
      (or 3,728 miles) allowing it to strike any European capital from Yasny.


      According to satellite imagery, the two bases underwent significant expansion
      in the last decade and their defensive measures were considerably augmented including
      with the addition of remote-controlled machine guns, automatic grenade launchers,
      and even air defense systems.


      However, thanks to the intelligence trove, the bases’ sensitive interiors have
      now been brought to light in extraordinary detail.


      “Until now we have only been able to monitor these bases from above using satellite
      imagery,” Hans M. Kristensen, the director of the nuclear information project
      at the Federation of American Scientists, told Danwatch.


      “Now, with the help of these unique drawings, we can now for the first time get
      inside the buildings and all the way underground. It’s completely unprecedented,”
      he added.


      The blueprints expose the extent of Russia’s modernization efforts outlining construction
      and technical material deliveries to the bases. They reveal that some of the materials
      were acquired from Western European companies.


      They also provide detailed descriptions of the bases’ security systems and even
      the locations of internal surveillance cameras, according to the Danish NGO. Soldiers’
      facilities and recreational areas are also described.


      “Material like this is the ultimate intelligence,” Philip Ingram, a former colonel
      and leader of the 1 Military Intelligence Battalion in the British Army told Danwatch.


      “If you can understand how the electricity is conducted or where the water comes
      from, and you can see how the different things are connected in the systems, then
      you can identify strengths and weaknesses and find a weak point to attack,” Ingram
      added.


      How Will Russia Respond?


      The documents were reportedly acquired by Danwatch and Der Spiegel from a public
      military tender database over a period of months. Russia has been gradually shifting
      to a restricted tender database for security reasons, however contractors would
      still post sensitive documents on the public database.


      Sandboxx News was unable to independently verify the blueprints.


      Russia’s nuclear triad is comprised of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles
      (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and strategic bombers.


      The Russian Ministry of Defence has not yet commented on the massive leaks nor
      on their significance.

      effect” warhead that can be integrated into existing weapons like the Gunslinger.


      -This would allow F/A-18 Super Hornets, armed with the massive AIM-174B (a derivative
      of the SM-6 interceptor), to create a mobile, forward-deployed defensive layer
      against hypersonic threats, adding crucial depth to the protection of aircraft
      carriers and other high-value assets.


      A Hypersonic Killer? Navy Wants to Turn Its Newest Missile into an Interceptor


      The U.S. Navy is looking to turn its newest air-to-air missile, the massive AIM-174B
      Gunslinger, into an air-launched hypersonic weapon interceptor by using a new
      warhead designed for “area effects.”


      The U.S. Missile Defense Agency just published a new solicitation to industry,
      looking to develop, test, and field a new series of warheads designed specifically
      for hypersonic missile defense, using what it describe as “wide area effect concepts.”
      This request is specifically for warheads – and not for new weapon systems – with
      the intent to field service-ready capabilities that can be easily integrated into
      America’s existing air defense apparatus.


      But don’t let that fool you: Despite the Navy’s plug-and-play intentions, the
      addition of such a warhead to the AIM-174B could create an air defense capability
      unmatched by any system or platform. This could be done by effectively turning
      F/A-18 Super Hornets into roving air-defense assets capable of bringing down inbound
      hypersonic missiles.


      The Gunslinger is already a uniquely capable weapon, with an extremely large 140–pound
      high explosive warhead (that’s more than three times the size of the AMRAAM’s
      and nearly seven times the size of the Sidewinder’s) and a maximum engagement
      range that may exceed 300 miles, making it one of the farthest-reaching air-to-air
      missiles on the planet. This weapon has such significant reach, in fact, that
      it’s meant to gather target data from multiple sources while closing with enemy
      aircraft, as the missile reaches farther out than the launching fighter’s radar
      can see.


      Based directly on the ship-launched SM-6 interceptor, this massive air-to-air
      missile stretches nearly 15.5 feet long, with a roughly 13.5 inches diameter and
      a total weight of 1,900 pounds. That makes it nearly two feet longer and about
      900 pounds heavier than the legendary AIM-54 Phoenix missile that once equipped
      the Navy’s F-14 Tomcats, while boasting the ability to reach targets potentially
      more than three times farther away.


      The AIM-174B and the SM-6 it’s based on were built for much more than long-distance
      engagements alone. They carry an enlarged radar seeker derived from the one found
      inside the AMRAAM, along with the datalink necessary for midcourse target updates.
      They sufficient propulsion to close with targets at Mach 3.5 and a combination
      of tail fins and canards that allow for extreme aerobatic maneuvers. As a result,
      in its surface-launched form (which uses a Mk 72 rocket booster to iniially get
      airborne) the weapon is rated for a vast array of intercepts, ranging from sea-skimming
      supersonic cruise missiles to just about any fixed or rotary wing aircraft and
      even medium-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phases of flight.


      The weapon is so effective at intercepting fast-moving and maneuverable targets
      that it is currently considered to be the only air defense interceptor in the
      world that’s rated to bring down modern hypersonic missiles, at least, in the
      right set of circumstances. And if all that wasn’t enough, it also has a secondary
      capability to strike surface targets like enemy warships or ground facilities.


      Given the weapon’s wide array of capabilities, the Navy opted to mount it on F/A-18
      Super Hornets to not only dramatically increase its potential engagement ranges
      but, with the development of new area-effect warheads, provide airborne hypersonic
      missile defense capabilities for carrier strike groups and other assets.


      The F/A-18 Super Hornet, which is currently the only fighter known to carry the
      Gunslinger, has an unclassified combat radius – the distance it can fly out, deploy
      weapons, and make it back on internal fuel alone – of around 511 miles. Yet, the
      aircraft’s combat radius is considerably less when it carries a full loadout of
      AIM-174Bs, AIM-120s, and AIM-9s.


      Nonetheless, these fighters could orbit the carrier strike group – bolstered by
      the refueling capabilities of other Super Hornets and soon, the MQ-25 Stingray
      drone refueler – and at the earliest sign of an inbound hypersonic missile launch
      their AIM-174Bs from farther out than the Navy’s SM-6s, creating what amounts
      to a second or even third layer of hypersonic air defense between adversary and
      aircraft carrier. Air defense is never a sure thing, least of all when dealing
      with maneuvering hypersonic weapons, so this could be a vital capability.


      This could also allow the Navy to scramble fighters for hypersonic missile defense
      over or around other high-value targets on extremely short notice, creating temporary
      barriers over the battlefield until ground-based systems can be repositioned to
      take over the job. This could be particularly important in rapidly escalating
      situations as something of a hypersonic stopgap in far-flung theaters.


      But in order to be really effective, the massive 140-pound warhead carried by
      both the SM-6 and AIM-174B must be turned into a more “area effect” oriented weapon.
      These warheads are already designed to create a large blast radius to bring down
      airborne targets, but a payload designed to increase that radius while maintaining
      enough force to take a Mach 20 missile out of the sky would dramatically improve
      the weapon’s chances at a successful shoot-down.

    text: 'A Comprehensive Analysis of the Sukhoi Su-25 “Frogfoot”


      Introduction: The Flying Tank Reborn


      In the pantheon of military aviation, few aircraft so perfectly embody their nation’s
      warfighting philosophy as the Sukhoi Su-25. Known to NATO by the reporting name
      “Frogfoot” and to its pilots by the affectionate moniker Grach (Rook), the Su-25
      is the Soviet Union‘s definitive jet-powered armored assault aircraft, a modern
      incarnation of the legendary World War II Shturmovik.


      It is not merely a machine of war but a physical manifestation of a specific and
      enduring strand of Soviet and later Russian military thought, one that prioritizes
      direct, brutally effective, and, above all, survivable air support for ground
      forces.


      The Su-25’s story begins with the doctrinal echoes of the Eastern Front, tracing
      its conceptual lineage to the iconic Ilyushin Il-2, an aircraft Josef Stalin famously
      characterized as being as essential to the Red Army as “air and bread”.


      This heritage shaped the Su-25 into a rugged, heavily armored “flying tank,” designed
      not to evade threats but to withstand them.


      Its decades-long combat career, stretching from the mountains of Afghanistan to
      the plains of Ukraine, has been a testament to this design philosophy.


      This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Su-25’s lifecycle, examining
      its doctrinal origins, technical design, extensive combat history, and evolution.


      It also provides a critical comparison with its Western counterpart, the Fairchild
      Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, and assesses its challenged legacy in the face of
      modern air defenses.


      Part I: Genesis of the Grach – Forging a Modern Shturmovik


      The Doctrinal Imperative


      The conceptual foundation of the Su-25 is deeply rooted in the Soviet experience
      of the Second World War. The conflict solidified the doctrine of the Shturmovik,
      or assault aircraft, as a cornerstone of combined-arms warfare.


      The Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmovik became a symbol of Soviet air power, functioning
      as “flying artillery” to support the Red Army’s advances directly.


      This doctrine, prioritizing the tactical needs of the ground battle, became a
      defining characteristic of Soviet military thought.


      In the post-war era, the advent of the jet age shifted air power priorities towards
      supersonic interceptors and fighter-bombers.


      However, experience revealed a critical flaw: fast jets like the Su-7 and MiG-23
      were fundamentally unsuited for the close air support (CAS) mission.


      Their high speeds made visual target acquisition difficult, and they lacked the
      armor to survive in a battlefield increasingly saturated with anti-aircraft artillery
      (AAA) and man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS).


      This gap between the Soviet Army’s need for intimate air support and the VVS’s
      actual capability prompted the Ministry of Defence in 1968 to issue a requirement
      for a specialized, heavily armored, subsonic assault aircraft—a conscious decision
      to revive the Shturmovik concept for the modern era.


      The 1969 Competition


      The formal competition for the new battlefield support aircraft, announced in
      March 1969, attracted proposals from the Soviet Union’s premier design bureaus.


      The contest ultimately became a competition between two different design philosophies,
      represented by Ilyushin’s Il-102 and Sukhoi’s T-8 prototype.


      The Ilyushin Il-102 was a conservative, two-seat design that was a direct, jet-powered
      descendant of the Il-2.22 Its most anachronistic feature was a remotely-controlled,
      rear-facing 23 mm gun turret operated by a second crew member, a direct homage
      to the defensive gunner of its WWII ancestor.


      In contrast, the Sukhoi T-8 was a completely new, single-seat design representing
      a more modern interpretation of the CAS mission.


      Sukhoi’s philosophy abandoned the defensive gunner, instead achieving survivability
      through a compact and agile airframe, a pilot cocooned in a titanium “bathtub,”
      separated twin engines, and extensive redundancy in its control systems.


      The first T-8 prototype made its maiden flight on February 22, 1975, and was ultimately
      selected for production as the Su-25.


      This choice marked a significant doctrinal turning point, rejecting the obsolete
      concept of a self-defending bomber in favor of a modern, systems-based approach
      to survivability that confronted the actual threats of the contemporary battlefield,
      namely ground-based air defenses.


      Part II: Anatomy of a Flying Tank


      The Sukhoi Su-25 is a physical manifestation of its design brief: to be a durable,
      survivable, and practical battlefield support aircraft. Its engineering reflects
      deliberate trade-offs that prioritize ruggedness and firepower over speed and
      technological sophistication.


      The single-seat aircraft measures 15.53 meters in length with a wingspan of 14.36
      meters, and has a maximum takeoff weight of 19,300 kg.


      Built to Endure


      The Su-25’s design philosophy is one of damage tolerance, not damage avoidance.
      At its heart is the cockpit, an all-welded armored enclosure often referred to
      as the “titanium bathtub”.


      This protective shell, with thicknesses from 10 mm to 24 mm, is designed to withstand
      direct hits from AAA and cannon rounds.


      The two Tumansky turbojet engines are housed in separate stainless-steel compartments,
      shielded from each other by a 5 mm-thick armored firewall to prevent a single
      hit from disabling both.


      Vital systems and fuel tanks are similarly protected, with the tanks filled with
      polyurethane foam to suppress explosions.


      Critically, the flight controls are connected via heavy-duty push-rods, providing
      a manual reversion capability that allows the pilot to maintain control even with
      a total loss of hydraulic power.


      Propulsion and Performance


      The Su-25 is powered by a pair of R-95Sh or improved R-195 non-afterburning turbojets,
      renowned for their simplicity and ability to run on various fuels, including diesel.


      The choice of a non-afterburning engine was a crucial trade-off. While it capped
      the Frogfoot’s top speed below Mach 1, it significantly reduced its infrared (IR)
      signature, a key vulnerability to its most probable threat: heat-seeking MANPADS.


      The aircraft’s straight, high-aspect-ratio wing provides excellent stability and
      maneuverability at the low speeds required for CAS missions.


      With a maximum speed of 975 km/h, a service ceiling of 7,000 meters, and a combat
      range of 750 km, its performance is tailored for low-level battlefield support.
      Its robust landing gear allows operations from short, unpaved runways.


      Sights and Armament


      The original Su-25 featured a basic avionics package centered on an ASP-17 gunsight
      and a Klen-PS laser rangefinder, limiting it to daytime, clear-weather operations.


      The specialized Su-25T variant, designed in the 1980s as a dedicated tank-hunter,
      introduced the sophisticated I-251 Shkval optical TV system, providing a true
      day/night precision attack capability with weapons like the Vikhr anti-tank missile.


      Due to cost, the Su-25T was never mass-produced.


      Instead, Russia pursued incremental upgrades for the existing fleet. The latest
      Su-25SM3 “Super Grach” features a modern navigation and attack suite, the Vitebsk-25
      electronic countermeasures system, and the SOLT-25 electro-optical targeting system,
      allowing it to employ a range of modern precision-guided munitions.


      The Frogfoot’s main gun is an internal 30mm GSh-30-2 twin-barrel cannon with 250
      rounds.21 Its primary strength, however, lies in its ability to carry up to 4,400
      kg of ordnance on ten hardpoints.


      This typically consists of unguided FAB-series bombs and a wide variety of rocket
      pods (S-5, S-8, S-13) and heavy rockets (S-24, S-25), fulfilling its role as “flying
      artillery”.


      Guided weapons include the Kh-25ML and the heavier Kh-29L laser-guided missiles.45
      For self-defense, it carries R-60 or the more capable R-73 short-range air-to-air
      missiles.


      Part III: A Legacy Forged in Fire


      The Su-25’s design philosophy of extreme ruggedness and battlefield utility has
      been tested in a remarkable number of conflicts over more than four decades. Its
      operational history is a story of both brutal effectiveness and stark vulnerability,
      providing a clear barometer of the evolving nature of ground-based air defenses.


      Trial by Fire in Afghanistan and Beyond


      The Su-25’s baptism by fire in Afghanistan cemented its legendary toughness. It
      flew over 60,000 sorties, proving ideal for counter-insurgency strikes in the
      mountainous terrain.


      However, the introduction of US-supplied FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS changed the battlefield.
      The Frogfoot, designed to withstand cannon fire, proved highly vulnerable to these
      heat-seeking missiles, and approximately 23 aircraft were lost in combat.


      This “Stinger shock” forced a rapid evolution in tactics, with pilots shifting
      to higher-altitude attacks and employing the first Soviet precision-guided munitions
      like the Kh-25 and Kh-29 from safer standoff ranges.


      In the post-Soviet era, the Su-25 became a staple of regional conflicts. Iraq
      used it effectively in the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War, flying 900 sorties
      with only two losses.


      Russia relied on it heavily in Chechnya, where it operated in a permissive air
      environment.


      The 2008 Russo-Georgian War, where both sides operated the type, highlighted its
      vulnerability to more capable SAM systems like the Buk-M1, with Russia losing
      three Su-25s.


      The Su-25 also saw service with numerous African air forces, including Angola
      and Ethiopia, and was used decisively by North Macedonia during its 2001 insurgency.


      A Russian Su-25 was lost to a MANPADS in Syria in 2018, a potent reminder of the
      persistent threat.


      The Grinding War in Ukraine


      The 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has become the ultimate and most brutal
      test for the Su-25. Both Russia and Ukraine have operated the type extensively,
      suffering catastrophic attrition.


      The battlefield is saturated with a dense array of modern air defenses, from thousands
      of MANPADS to advanced SAMs.


      In this environment, the Su-25’s traditional low-level CAS role has become suicidal.


      Pilots on both sides have been forced to adopt “loft-bombing” tactics, releasing
      unguided rockets in a high arc from a safe distance, sacrificing all accuracy
      for a marginal chance of survival.


      The war has demonstrated that the Su-25 is a victim of its own proliferation,
      flying into the teeth of the very Soviet-era air defense systems designed to counter
      its Western counterparts.


      Part IV: Comparative Analysis and Evolution


      Frogfoot vs. Warthog


      The Su-25 and the A-10 represent distinctly different answers to the same fundamental
      question, shaped by the divergent military doctrines of the Soviet Union and the
      United States.


      Armament and Role: The most defining difference lies in their main armament. The
      A-10 is famously an “aircraft built around a gun,” its GAU-8 Avenger a specialized
      anti-tank weapon with over 1,100 rounds. The Su-25’s GSh-30-2 cannon, with only
      250 rounds, is a secondary weapon. The Frogfoot’s primary role is that of a “bomb
      and rocket truck,” designed to deliver a large volume of unguided ordnance for
      area suppression, fulfilling the Soviet doctrine of “flying artillery.”


      Survivability: Both are tough, but their approaches differ. The A-10 emphasizes
      redundancy, with widely spaced, high-mounted engines and triple-redundant flight
      controls. The Su-25 relies on a more compact design and the extreme protection
      of the pilot within its titanium “bathtub.”


      Performance: The Su-25 is considerably faster than the A-10, reflecting a doctrine
      of fast-in, fast-out strikes. The A-10 was designed to loiter over the battlefield
      for extended periods, a mission enabled by its greater fuel efficiency.


      These choices reflect their parent doctrines. The A-10 is a weapon of a dominant
      air force; the Su-25 is a weapon of a dominant ground army.


      The Frogfoot Family


      The Su-25’s long service life has resulted in an extensive family of variants.
      Key versions include the baseline Su-25, the export Su-25K, and the two-seat Su-25UB
      trainer.


      An ambitious leap was the Su-25T, a dedicated all-weather anti-tank platform with
      the Shkval targeting system. Due to cost, it was never mass-produced.


      Instead, Russia pursued the more pragmatic Su-25SM/SM3 modernization program,
      which incrementally improves the existing fleet with new digital avionics, a HUD,
      and enhanced self-defense systems, allowing the use of modern guided weapons.


      The Twilight of the Shturmovik?


      The Evolving Mission


      The war in Ukraine has dramatically accelerated the evolution of the CAS mission,
      likely rendering the Su-25’s entire operational concept obsolete. The extreme
      lethality of the modern air defense environment has made the Frogfoot’s core tactic—flying
      low and slow near the front lines—a mission with an unacceptably high attrition
      rate.


      A new model of air support has emerged, driven by two key technologies: standoff
      glide bombs and tactical drones. This has led to a “disaggregation” of the traditional
      CAS role.


      The function of delivering heavy ordnance is now primarily performed by multirole
      fighters like the Su-34, launching UMPK glide bombs from distances of 50-70 km,
      far outside the range of most frontline air defenses.


      Meanwhile, the role of providing “eyes on target” and conducting precision strikes
      in close proximity to friendly troops has been almost entirely taken over by a
      vast ecosystem of low-cost FPV and tactical drones.


      This new paradigm splits the Su-25’s mission into two functions performed by more
      survivable and cost-effective platforms.


      Conclusion


      The Sukhoi Su-25 Grach is one of the most significant combat aircraft of the late
      20th century.


      Born from a clear doctrinal need to revive the spirit of the WWII Shturmovik,
      it became a pure expression of Soviet design philosophy: a simple, rugged, and
      cost-effective tool built to absorb punishment and deliver devastating firepower
      in direct support of ground forces.


      Its combat record is extensive and varied, proving its effectiveness in permissive
      environments and its stark vulnerability in the face of modern, layered air defenses.


      However, the very conflicts that built its reputation have also signaled its obsolescence.
      The introduction of effective MANPADS in Afghanistan began a cycle of threat and
      response that has culminated in the skies over Ukraine.


      There, the Su-25 has been forced into tactics that negate its accuracy, and it
      has suffered unsustainable losses. The modern battlefield, dominated by standoff
      weapons and attritable drones, has disaggregated the close air support mission
      into constituent parts that are now performed more safely and efficiently by other
      platforms.


      The Rook’s reign over the front lines is ending. While the airframe will likely
      continue to serve in the air forces of smaller nations and in low-intensity conflicts
      for years to come, its role as a frontline assault aircraft in a peer-level conventional
      war is over.


      It is being rendered obsolete not because a better warlane has replaced it, but
      because the nature of the game has fundamentally changed, leaving the venerable
      flying tank as a powerful but ultimately outmoded relic of a bygone era of warfare.

      The NATO summit at the Hague is behind us. The worst didn’t happen – President
      Donald Trump didn’t announce America’s withdrawal from the alliance, and in the
      final communique Russia remains the principal threat.


      Setting aside the fawning the Trump administration received from the European
      heads of state and government, observers can rub their eyes in bewilderment that
      the very same European allies who only a few years back claimed they could not
      spend at 2% of GDP on defense now have signed off on a 5% of GDP on defense deal.


      Throughout the meeting, there was a palpable desire across Europe to declare the
      summit a success, with Secretary General Mark Rutte leading the way in making
      it clear that Europe is ready to do what Donald Trump wants it to do.


      A NATO Summit of Promises


      This has been a summit of promises, and as such not that different from past pledges
      save for the size of the promised defense spending increase. The Europeans got
      America’s concurrence to sustaining the sanctity of Article 5, the core collective
      defense principle of the alliance.


      It is also clear that—at least for now—the administration has no intent to pull
      US military assets out of Europe, though there is likely to be a change in the
      numbers of US troops stationed in Europe as part of the overall force posture
      review by the Pentagon. And so the United States and American taxpayers will continue
      to be an integral part of NATO’s defenses, but the time of “free-riding” by the
      Europeans seems to be over.


      Or is it?


      One striking aspect of this summit has been how quickly Europe yielded to the
      demands presented by the Trump administration (even if Spain continues to buck
      the trend). There was a palpable sense of anxiety among the largest European powers,
      a sense that without the United States, this wealthy continent could not stand
      up and generate real, exercised defense capabilities.


      Yes, the Europeans promised to pay more, but the summit reaffirmed that it will
      be the United States that will continue to provide the baseline of European security.


      The unusually brief post-summit communique spoke of unity, of Article 5 solidarity
      and of the requisite 5% investment in defense by 2035 now accepted by the allies.
      The proof will be in the proverbial pudding, but this summit has ended with a
      sense that much has been promised but nothing specific enough has been agreed
      on, other than that the European allies showed themselves willing to bend to Washington’s
      will.


      The alliance sailed through the meeting without a major confrontation, unlike
      the one that took place at the 2017 NATO meeting when Donald Trump demanded that
      the Europeans pay for their defense—at the time to the tune of 2% of GDP. This
      time at the Hague, the Europeans did all they could to ensure the summit was successful
      and that Donald Trump could declare victory—here the hat’s off to Secretary General
      Mark Rutte, a consummate politician, who ran a masterful game to stage-manage
      the event to its successful conclusion.


      What Will Europe Do?


      The question that remains is what will happen in Europe next. The pledge to spend
      5% on defense by 2035 does not have to be implemented for years. And even if the
      money is spent, how it will be spent is likely to become a matter of debate yet
      again. And the larger issue is how the NATO commitment aligns with the ongoing
      efforts to build a defense capability in the European Union as part of the “independence”
      drive that figured so prominently in the discussion among European elites after
      the last Munich Security Conference.


      While we continue to debate the money and commitments, it is time to ask how Europe
      wants to interact with the United States in the coming decade, one that is likely
      to be critical to European and global security.


      Since the communique underscored the sanctity of Article 5 and showed the Europeans’
      willingness to spend the money, one should assume that NATO remains the center
      of how Europe thinks about defense.


      If so, what is the point of the continued debate about “strategic autonomy” and
      building a bureaucracy in the European Union, purposed for managing defense and
      foreign affairs?


      Is the European Union now to be considered a collective defense alliance?


      If so, where is the military infrastructure and the requisite headquarters?


      Where are the C2 and ISR assets and high-end enablers that would allow such EU
      forces to operate at the requisite level of effectiveness?


      Is the European Union a unitary actor, with an executive center that can in fact
      order ready forces into battle?


      These rhetorical questions are intended to show that it is way past the time for
      America’s European allies to shed the fantasy of building “strategic autonomy,”
      for without the United States nuclear umbrella, US naval, air, cyber, and space
      capabilities, etc., deterrence in Europe against Russia will not hold.


      A Wake-up Call


      The Hague NATO summit should serve as a wake-up call to political leaders in Europe
      that, notwithstanding their feelings toward the US president, their countries
      have a vital national security interest in working closely with the United States,
      building an integrated system to produce a larger Western defense system centered
      on NATO for the coming years of protracted global instability.


      This means investing in real, exercised capabilities that are required based on
      the regional plans adopted at the Vilnius summit – forces that SACEUR can then
      plug seamlessly into the plans.


      And inside NATO, there needs to be a serious conversation about how to support
      and sustain its new center of gravity that is the Northeast Corridor, where Scandinavian
      countries, Finland, the Baltic States and Poland are now the critical hub which
      must be supported to shore up deterrence around the Baltic and the High North.


      Further south, Romania also needs to become a destination for special care and
      investment, while countries to the west of the Eastern frontier should focus on
      sustainability, reserves, and support.


      In short, NATO leadership needs to think in terms of where the points of contact
      are, rather than where the legacy Cold War military installations are located.


      NATO’s mission has been renewed, but this must be followed by investments that
      reflect the new realities of where the new frontier is and what is needed to deter
      aggression there effectively.


      What Happens Next to NATO?


      The Hague summit should put to bed the idea of independent European defense or
      “strategic autonomy.” It should return the allies back to the basics of hard power
      centered around the NATO alliance, leveraging US and European defense industrial
      capacity to produce weapons and munitions at speed and scale while fielding real,
      exercised forces to send an unequivocal message of resolve to Russia.


      We shall see soon enough if that will be the case.

    text: 'The Foxbat: Anatomy of a Cold War Speed Demon


      Introduction


      The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25, known to NATO as the “Foxbat,” is less an aircraft
      and more a Cold War legend forged in steel and secrecy.


      When it first appeared in Western reconnaissance photos, its massive wings and
      powerful intakes sent a shockwave through the intelligence community, suggesting
      a Soviet super-fighter with unparalleled speed and agility.


      This perception directly fueled the development of America’s premier air superiority
      fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.


      The reality, however, was far more complex.


      The MiG-25 was a product of a singular, almost brutalist design philosophy: a
      high-altitude, high-speed interceptor built for one purpose—to climb like a rocket
      and destroy incoming American strategic bombers before they could unleash their
      nuclear payloads on the Soviet homeland.


      First flown in 1964 and entering service in 1970, the Foxbat was a marvel of focused
      engineering, sacrificing maneuverability, range, and low-altitude performance
      for raw speed and an astonishing operational ceiling.


      Its mystique was shattered in 1976 when Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to
      Japan, delivering the aircraft and its secrets to the West.


      The analysis revealed a machine that was technologically crude yet brutally effective
      in its intended role. Built primarily of stainless steel and powered by colossal,
      fuel-guzzling engines, the Foxbat was a flawed masterpiece.


      Its story is a fascinating case study in Cold War strategy, technological trade-offs,
      and the enduring power of a myth.


      A Response to a Mach 3 Threat: The Genesis of the Foxbat


      The MiG-25 was born from a specific and urgent fear that gripped Soviet military
      planners in the late 1950s: the advent of a new generation of American supersonic
      bombers.


      The United States was fielding the Mach 2 B-58 Hustler and, more alarmingly, was
      deep into the development of the North American XB-70 Valkyrie, a strategic bomber
      designed to penetrate Soviet airspace at altitudes above 70,000 feet and at speeds
      exceeding Mach 3.


      Existing Soviet interceptors were utterly incapable of countering such a threat.


      This created a critical gap in the air defenses of the Protivovozdushnaya Oborony
      (PVO), the Soviet Union’s dedicated Air Defense Forces.


      In response, the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau was tasked with creating a new
      interceptor that could meet this challenge head-on.


      Formal approval for the project, designated Ye-155, was granted in the early 1960s,
      leading to two parallel prototypes: the Ye-155P for the interceptor role and the
      Ye-155R for high-altitude reconnaissance.


      The design philosophy was one of extreme specialization. The aircraft had to be
      able to take off, climb to extreme altitudes, and accelerate to blistering speeds
      in the shortest possible time to intercept a bomber before it reached its release
      point.


      This “point defense” mission profile meant that other characteristics, such as
      agility and combat endurance, were secondary. 10 The result was an aircraft designed
      not for dogfighting, but for a single, high-speed, rocket-like pass to engage
      its target.


      Design and Technology: A Study in Pragmatic Power


      When Viktor Belenko’s MiG-25P was disassembled by Western analysts in Japan, they
      were stunned by what they found.


      Instead of the advanced titanium super-fighter they had feared, they discovered
      a machine built with a pragmatic, almost crude, focus on performance over finesse.


      Airframe: Forged in Steel


      The most striking feature of the MiG-25 was its construction. Approximately 80%
      of the airframe was made not of advanced alloys, but of arc-welded nickel-steel.


      This was a practical solution to the immense thermal stress of sustained Mach
      2.8+ flight, as the Soviet Union lacked the capacity to produce titanium in the
      quantities required.


      This choice made the aircraft incredibly heavy, with an empty weight of around
      20,000 kg (44,090 lbs), which in turn necessitated its enormous wings to generate
      sufficient lift.


      The construction was functional rather than refined, with details like exposed
      rivet heads and visible hand-welding shocking Western engineers accustomed to
      more polished manufacturing.


      Propulsion: The Thirsty Tumansky Engines


      Powering the Foxbat were two colossal Tumansky R-15B-300 single-shaft afterburning
      turbojets.


      These engines were marvels of raw power, each generating around 110 kN (24,700
      lbf) of thrust with afterburner. They could propel the MiG-25 to a sustained speed
      of Mach 2.83.


      Pushing the aircraft to its fabled top speed of Mach 3.2 was an emergency-only
      measure that was forbidden in routine operations, as it would cause the engines
      to overheat and effectively destroy themselves.


      The price for this incredible performance was a voracious appetite for fuel. The
      R-15 engines were notoriously inefficient, especially at lower altitudes, earning
      the Foxbat a reputation as a “gas guzzler.”


      This severely limited its combat radius to just a few hundred miles, reinforcing
      its role as a short-dash interceptor rather than a long-range patrol fighter.


      Performance and Handling: A Straight-Line Specialist


      The MiG-25’s performance envelope was a direct reflection of its design priorities.
      It was one of the fastest and highest-flying combat aircraft ever built, holding
      numerous world records for speed and altitude, including an absolute altitude
      record of 37,650 meters (123,523 feet) achieved in a zoom climb.


      However, it was a poor performer in any other regime. Its heavy steel airframe
      was structurally limited to a modest 4.5 Gs, making it dangerously unmaneuverable
      in a dogfight against more agile Western fighters like the F-4 Phantom.


      At low altitudes, where the air was dense, the Foxbat was cumbersome and inefficient,
      with its wings and engines optimized for the thin air of the stratosphere.


      Systems and Armament: A Powerful but Blunted Sword


      The MiG-25’s combat systems were a microcosm of the aircraft itself: immensely
      powerful in some respects, yet critically flawed in others.


      The Smerch-A Radar: Seeing High, But Not Low


      The heart of the MiG-25P interceptor was its RP-25 Smerch-A radar, codenamed “Fox
      Fire” by NATO.


      It was one of the most powerful airborne radars of its era, using antiquated but
      robust vacuum-tube electronics to generate so much energy it could “burn through”
      the electronic jamming of enemy bombers. 10 Its detection range against a bomber-sized
      target was up to 100 km.


      However, the Smerch-A possessed a fatal flaw: it had no look-down/shoot-down capability.


      The radar was unable to distinguish a low-flying aircraft from the background
      “clutter” of the ground, rendering it effectively blind to targets below its own
      altitude.


      This was a catastrophic limitation, as by the time the MiG-25 entered service,
      NATO’s strategic doctrine was already shifting from high-altitude bombing runs
      to low-level penetration by bombers and cruise missiles, a threat the Foxbat was
      never designed to counter.


      Armament: The R-40 “Acrid”


      The Foxbat’s primary armament consisted of four massive R-40 (NATO: AA-6 “Acrid”)
      air-to-air missiles carried on underwing pylons.


      These missiles, like the aircraft that carried them, were specialized for high-altitude
      interception.


      They came in two versions: the radar-guided R-40R and the heat-seeking R-40T.


      With a range of up to 80 km and carrying a huge 100 kg warhead, the R-40 was designed
      to destroy large, non-maneuvering targets like strategic bombers.


      Against agile fighters, however, their effectiveness was limited.


      A Foxbat for Every Mission: Variants


      The robust and powerful MiG-25 airframe proved to be a versatile platform, leading
      to the development of numerous variants for different roles beyond pure interception.


      Interceptor Variants:


      MiG-25P (Foxbat-A): The initial production interceptor, equipped with the Smerch-A
      radar.


      MiG-25PD (Foxbat-E): An upgraded version developed after the Belenko defection.
      It featured the new Saphir-25 pulse-doppler radar, which had a limited look-down
      capability, an under-nose Infrared Search and Track (IRST) sensor, and the ability
      to carry the more agile R-60 short-range missile.


      MiG-25PDS (Foxbat-E): A designation for original MiG-25P airframes that were upgraded
      to the PD standard.


      Reconnaissance & Strike Variants:


      MiG-25R (Foxbat-B): The initial high-altitude reconnaissance version, equipped
      with cameras and sensors.


      MiG-25RB (Foxbat-B/D): A series of reconnaissance-bomber variants that added a
      high-altitude bombing capability, using the “Peleng” navigation system for targeting.


      MiG-25RBK/RBS/RBSh (Foxbat-D): Specialized Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and
      Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) platforms designed to map enemy radar installations.


      MiG-25BM (Foxbat-F): A dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) variant,
      designed to destroy enemy radar sites with up to four Kh-58 anti-radiation missiles.


      Trainer Variants


      MiG-25PU/RU (Foxbat-C): Two-seat conversion trainers for the interceptor and reconnaissance
      versions, respectively. They featured a distinctive new nose with a separate cockpit
      for the instructor placed in front of and below the student’s cockpit.


      Operational History: A Fearsome but Flawed Record


      The MiG-25’s combat legacy is as complex as its design. Its extreme performance
      made it a potent psychological weapon and a highly effective reconnaissance platform,
      but its limitations were exposed when pitted against modern Western fighters.


      In the early 1970s, Soviet-piloted MiG-25R reconnaissance variants deployed to
      Egypt flew multiple sorties over Israeli-held Sinai. Flying at speeds and altitudes
      that Israeli F-4 Phantoms could not reach, they operated with complete impunity,
      demonstrating the platform’s value for intelligence gathering.


      The Indian Air Force later used its MiG-25RBs to similar effect, conducting unchallenged
      reconnaissance flights deep into Pakistani airspace.


      The Iran-Iraq War saw the Iraqi Air Force use its MiG-25s extensively for both
      interception and bombing missions. Iraqi Foxbats claimed several kills against
      Iranian aircraft, including F-4 and F-5 fighters.


      The 1991 Gulf War provided the Foxbat’s most high-profile test. On the first night
      of the war, an Iraqi MiG-25PD shot down a U.S. Navy F/A-18C Hornet, scoring one
      of the Iraqi Air Force’s few aerial victories of the conflict.


      Later in the war, in what became known as the Samurra Air Battle, two Iraqi MiG-25s
      were vectored to engage two American F-15Cs. In the ensuing beyond-visual-range
      engagement, missiles were fired by both sides, but no aircraft were shot down.


      The engagement was a tactical draw, but it proved that even a third-world air
      force could use the Foxbat to challenge the world’s most advanced air superiority
      fighter. 37 However, the Foxbat also suffered losses during the conflict, with
      several being shot down by U.S. Air Force F-15s.


      In 1992, an Iraqi MiG-25 was shot down by a U.S. F-16, marking the first-ever
      air-to-air kill with the new AIM-120 AMRAAM missile.

      Conclusion: The Enduring Legacy of a Speed Demon


      The MiG-25 Foxbat stands as a singular achievement in aviation history. It was
      the ultimate expression of a highly specialized design philosophy, created to
      counter a threat that never fully materialized.


      Its existence terrified Western military planners, forcing the United States to
      develop the F-15 Eagle, an aircraft that would define air superiority for a generation.


      The Belenko defection shattered the Foxbat’s myth, revealing a machine that was
      less a technological marvel and more a testament to Soviet pragmatism and brute-force
      engineering.


      Its profound flaws—particularly its lack of look-down/shoot-down capability and
      poor maneuverability—were as extreme as its strengths. These very shortcomings,
      however, directly informed the design of its successor, the far more capable MiG-31
      Foxhound, which rectified nearly all of the MiG-25’s weaknesses.


      With production ending in 1984 after 1,190 aircraft had been built, the Foxbat’s
      time as a front-line interceptor had passed.


      Yet, it remains an icon of the Cold War, a symbol of an era when speed was king
      and the fear of a high-altitude nuclear bomber attack drove the creation of one
      of the fastest, most intimidating, and most deeply flawed combat aircraft ever
      to take to the skies.

    text: 'The MiG-31 Foxhound at Fifty: An Analysis of the MiG-31 Interceptor’s Enduring
      Legacy and Future


      Introduction


      The Mikoyan MiG-31, known to NATO as the “Foxhound,” represents the zenith of
      a highly specialized design philosophy: the dedicated, high-speed, long-range
      homeland defense interceptor.


      Born from the specific shortcomings of its famous predecessor, the MiG-25 “Foxbat,”
      the MiG-31 was not merely an upgrade but a doctrinal and technological revolution.


      Its development in the 1970s, leading to a maiden flight in September 1975 and
      entry into service in 1981, was driven by the urgent need to protect the vast,
      sparsely covered regions of the Soviet Union against a new generation of low-flying
      NATO bombers and cruise missiles.


      The introduction of the world’s first fighter-mounted phased-array radar, coupled
      with extreme speed, altitude, and range, created a unique area-denial capability
      that has allowed it to remain strategically relevant for nearly half a century.


      As one of the fastest operational combat aircraft in the world, its role has evolved
      dramatically, from hunting Cold War reconnaissance aircraft to launching hypersonic
      missiles in 21st-century conflicts.


      The Foxhound’s story is one of remarkable adaptation and enduring, if niche, dominance.


      A New Threat, A New Guardian: The Genesis of the MiG-31


      The strategic necessity for the MiG-31 is best understood by examining the operational
      and technological gaps left by its predecessor in the face of evolving NATO threats.


      The MiG-31 was not just a better aircraft; it was the answer to a problem the
      MiG-25 was never designed to solve.


      The Limitations of the “Foxbat”


      The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 “Foxbat” was a fearsome symbol of Soviet air power,
      designed with a singular purpose: to intercept high-altitude, high-speed American
      strategic bombers like the B-58 Hustler and the anticipated, though ultimately
      cancelled, XB-70 Valkyrie.


      Its blistering speed and operational ceiling, first observed by the West in the
      late 1960s, sent shockwaves through Western intelligence communities and directly
      spurred the development of the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.7 However, this extreme
      specialization was also its greatest weakness.


      When Soviet pilot Viktor Belenko defected to Japan with his MiG-25P in 1976, Western
      analysts were finally able to examine the aircraft up close. They discovered that
      its impressive performance masked technological crudeness—it was built primarily
      of heavy nickel-steel alloy and relied on antiquated vacuum-tube electronics—and,
      more importantly, it suffered from critical operational deficiencies.


      The Foxbat’s most significant flaw was its Smerch-A radar, which possessed no
      look-down/shoot-down capability. This meant the radar was effectively blind to
      targets flying below the interceptor, as it could not distinguish an aircraft
      from the background “clutter” of the ground.


      This rendered it useless against the emerging NATO threat of low-level penetrating
      bombers and cruise missiles, which were designed specifically to fly “under the
      radar”.


      Furthermore, the MiG-25’s airframe, optimized for the thin air of the stratosphere,
      performed poorly at low altitudes. It was cumbersome, had a high wing loading,
      and was structurally limited to a modest 4.5 Gs, making it an ineffective dogfighter
      against more agile Western aircraft.


      Its Tumansky R-15 turbojet engines, while immensely powerful, were also incredibly
      fuel-thirsty, severely limiting the aircraft’s combat radius and patrol endurance.
      This relegated the MiG-25 to a “point defense” role, capable of a rapid dash to
      intercept a known target but lacking the legs for wide-area patrol.


      Pushing the engines to their fabled Mach 3.2 limit was an emergency-only measure
      that would result in their destruction.


      The PVO’s Dilemma: A Shift in Doctrine


      These limitations created a critical dilemma for the Soviet Air Defence Forces,
      the Protivovozdushnaya Oborony (PVO), a separate branch of the military tasked
      with defending the homeland’s airspace.18 Soviet defensive doctrine was shaped
      by its geography: a vast, contiguous landmass with immense, sparsely populated
      territories, particularly in the Arctic, which was the most direct attack vector
      for US bombers.


      This geography demanded “area defense” interceptors with immense range and endurance,
      a role filled inadequately by older aircraft like the Tupolev Tu-128 “Fiddler”.11


      When NATO shifted its strategic bombing doctrine in the late 1960s and early 1970s
      away from high-altitude dashes to low-level penetration, the PVO’s premier interceptor,
      the MiG-25, was suddenly optimized to solve the previous war’s problem.


      The emergence of agile fighters like the F-15 and low-flying threats like the
      B-1 bomber and air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) like the AGM-86B created a
      complex, multi-axis threat that the one-dimensional MiG-25 could not counter.


      This doctrinal pivot by NATO necessitated a corresponding pivot by the PVO. A
      new type of interceptor was required, one that could:


      Operate with long range and endurance over the vast northern territories where
      ground-based radar coverage was minimal. Possess a powerful look-down/shoot-down
      radar to detect and engage low-flying cruise missiles and bombers against the
      challenging backdrop of the earth’s surface. Operate semi-autonomously, networked
      with other aircraft to form a “flying radar” barrier, reducing the reliance on
      the traditional Soviet method of rigid ground-controlled interception (GCI).


      This new requirement led directly to the development of the Ye-155MP prototype,
      which began detailed design work in 1969. After its first flight on September
      16, 1975, it would evolve into the production MiG-31, an aircraft designed not
      merely as a technical upgrade, but as the solution to a fundamentally new strategic
      challenge.


      The MiG-31 was the Soviet answer to both the B-1 and the F-15, embodying a systemic
      shift from point defense to wide-area denial.


      Anatomy of a High-Speed Hunter: Design and Technology


      The MiG-31’s design represents a tightly integrated system of advanced technologies,
      where each component—airframe, propulsion, and avionics—was synergistically developed
      to fulfill its unique and demanding mission profile.


      Airframe and Propulsion: Strength at Speed


      While bearing a strong family resemblance to the MiG-25, the MiG-31’s airframe
      is a fundamentally new and more robust design.


      Its material composition marked a significant evolution from the Foxbat’s heavy,
      80% nickel-steel construction. The Foxhound’s airframe is a sophisticated blend
      of 49% arc-welded nickel steel, 33% light metal alloy, 16% titanium, and 2% composites.


      This stronger, more advanced structure, combined with a reinforced three-spar
      wing and the addition of leading-edge root extensions (LERX), endowed the MiG-31
      with capabilities its predecessor lacked. It could sustain supersonic flight at
      low altitude, reaching Mach 1.23 (1,500 km/h), and was stressed for a higher load
      factor of 5 Gs, a modest but important improvement.


      Propulsion is provided by a pair of Soloviev D-30F6 afterburning turbofans, the
      first two-spool engines with an afterburner to be used on a Soviet fighter.


      These were a revolutionary improvement over the MiG-25’s thirsty R-15 turbojets.
      The D-30F6 offered vastly better specific fuel consumption (SFC of 0.72 kg.kp⁻¹.h⁻¹
      on maximum military power), which was a critical factor in achieving the long
      range and endurance required for the area-denial mission.


      Each engine produces 93.16 kN (20,900 lbf) of dry thrust and a massive 152 kN
      (34,000 lbf) with afterburner.


      This power allows the 46-ton aircraft to reach a top speed that is redlined at
      Mach 2.83 (3,000 km/h) to preserve engine and airframe life, though it is capable
      of higher bursts.


      A distinctive feature reflecting its intended operational environment is its landing
      gear: the main gear units feature two wheels arranged in a staggered tandem configuration,
      which improves weight distribution and allows for operations from the unprepared
      or ice-covered airfields common in Russia’s northern regions.


      The Zaslon Revolution: The World’s First Fighter PESA


      The heart of the MiG-31 weapon system is the RP-31 N007 Zaslon (NATO reporting
      name: “Flash Dance”), the world’s first Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA)
      radar to enter service on a fighter aircraft.


      This was a revolutionary leap beyond the mechanically scanned antennas of its
      contemporaries. Developed by the Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument
      Design (NIIP), the Zaslon’s large, 1.1-meter fixed antenna could steer its radar
      beam electronically in just 1.2 milliseconds, a near-instantaneous process compared
      to the 12-14 seconds a traditional mechanical radar needed to complete a full
      scan.


      This technological advantage translated into unprecedented capabilities. Its primary
      function was true look-down/shoot-down performance, enabling it to detect and
      track small, low-flying targets like cruise missiles against the challenging backdrop
      of ground clutter.


      Early tests demonstrated its ability to detect a target with a radar cross-section
      (RCS) of 1 m² from an altitude of 6,000 meters.


      The original Zaslon had a detection range of 200 km against a bomber-sized target
      (16-19 m² RCS) and could track up to 10 targets while simultaneously engaging
      four with its R-33 missiles—a capability matched in the West only by the US Navy’s
      F-14 Tomcat and its AWG-9/AIM-54 Phoenix combination.28


      This powerful radar underpinned a doctrinal foresight that was decades ahead of
      its time. The MiG-31 was equipped with an APD-518 datalink that enabled a form
      of network-centric warfare long before the term was coined.


      A flight of four MiG-31s could establish a coordinated patrol line 800-900 km
      wide, automatically sharing target data via the secure link.


      In this formation, one MiG-31 could act as a “mini-AWACS,” illuminating targets
      and guiding the missiles of other fighters (including Su-27s or MiG-29s) whose
      own radars remained off, providing a massive tactical advantage and a degree of
      passive engagement.


      This concept of distributed lethality, where the group acts as a single weapon
      system, is a central tenet of modern air combat that was a foundational principle
      of the MiG-31’s operational concept forty years ago.


      The Two-Crew Cockpit


      The immense complexity of managing the Zaslon radar and the associated datalinks
      during long-duration, semi-autonomous patrols necessitated a two-person crew,
      a major departure from the single-seat MiG-25P interceptor.


      The pilot occupies the front cockpit, focusing on flying the aircraft, while a
      dedicated Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) sits in the rear cockpit, responsible for
      managing the powerful radar, datalinks, and weapons employment.


      The WSO’s cockpit has very limited external visibility, with only small side windows,
      forcing reliance on the radar display and a retractable periscope for situational
      awareness.11 This design deliberately focuses the WSO’s attention on the electronic
      battle. The rear station features a basic set of flight controls for emergency
      use, and both crew members are equipped with Zvezda K-36DM “zero-zero” ejection
      seats, renowned for their safety and reliability.


      The Long Lance: Armament and Evolving Mission Sets


      The MiG-31’s weaponry has evolved in lockstep with its airframe and avionics,
      transforming the platform from a pure interceptor into a multi-role asset and
      even a strategic strike weapon.


      The R-33 “Amos” – A Purpose-Built Weapon


      The Vympel R-33 (NATO: AA-9 “Amos”) long-range air-to-air missile was not merely
      an armament option for the MiG-31; it was developed in parallel as part of a single,
      integrated weapon system with the aircraft and its Zaslon radar.


      It is a very large and heavy missile, weighing 490 kg and measuring 4.15 meters
      in length, explicitly designed to destroy high-value, high-speed targets like
      the SR-71 Blackbird, B-1 Lancer, and B-52 Stratofortress from extreme range.


      The R-33’s guidance system was a product of its time, employing a combination
      of inertial navigation for the initial flight phase, mid-course updates from the
      MiG-31’s datalink, and semi-active radar homing (SARH) for the terminal attack.


      This SARH guidance required the Zaslon radar to continuously illuminate the target
      until the missile impacted, a potential vulnerability as it forced the MiG-31
      to maintain its course. The Foxhound carries four R-33s in semi-recessed ejector
      pylons under its fuselage, a configuration reminiscent of the F-14’s carriage
      of AIM-54 Phoenix missiles.


      The improved R-33S variant, introduced with the upgraded MiG-31B, featured a more
      advanced digital seeker and an extended range of 160 km, compared to the original’s
      120 km.


      Modern Munitions: The R-37M “Axehead”


      The comprehensive modernization of the Foxhound fleet to the MiG-31BM/BSM standard
      introduced a far more lethal weapon: the Vympel R-37M (NATO: AA-13 “Axehead”).
      A direct descendant of the R-33 and the ambitious R-37 missile developed for the
      cancelled MiG-31M program, the R-37M dramatically enhances the Foxhound’s combat
      potential.


      The missile boasts an astonishing engagement range, variously cited as being between
      300 km and 400 km, far outstripping its Western counterparts.


      Its most critical feature is an active radar homing (ARH) seeker. This “fire-and-forget”
      capability is a tactical game-changer. Unlike the R-33, the R-37M does not require
      the launch aircraft to maintain a radar lock for the entire duration of the engagement.
      The MiG-31 can launch the missile and immediately perform defensive maneuvers,
      significantly increasing its survivability.


      This combination of extreme range, high speed, and ARH guidance, launched from
      the MiG-31’s high-altitude, high-speed perch, has proven to be a devastatingly
      effective system in the Russo-Ukrainian War.


      The Kinzhal Carrier: From Interceptor to Strategic Striker


      The most profound evolution in the MiG-31’s four-decade career is its modification
      into the MiG-31K, a dedicated launch platform for the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal (NATO: AS-24
      “Killjoy”) air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM).


      This transformation represents a complete inversion of the platform’s original
      purpose. Conceived as the ultimate defensive shield for the Soviet homeland, the
      MiG-31K has become a potent offensive strategic strike weapon.


      The MiG-31 was selected as the Kinzhal’s carrier for its unique performance envelope.
      Its ability to climb to altitudes above 15 km and accelerate to speeds approaching
      Mach 3 provides the perfect high-energy launch state for the missile.


      This launch profile acts as a “first stage” for the Kinzhal, imparting significant
      initial kinetic and potential energy, which extends its effective range to a claimed
      2,000 km (a figure that includes the aircraft’s own combat radius) and helps it
      achieve a terminal velocity of up to Mach 10.


      The conversion to a MiG-31K is substantial. The airframe is structurally reinforced
      with new attachment points to carry the massive 4,300 kg Kinzhal on a single centerline
      pylon.


      The standard air-to-air fire-control system is removed or heavily modified; the
      MiG-31K is a dedicated strike aircraft and cannot perform its interceptor role
      while armed with the Kinzhal.


      New avionics, digital computers, and datalink systems are installed, allowing
      the WSO to input target coordinates and manage the complex launch sequence, with
      some reports suggesting an ability to retarget the missile after launch.


      This repurposing is a cost-effective method for Russia to field a new strategic
      capability, leveraging the unparalleled performance of a proven, if aging, airframe
      without the expense of developing a new bomber. This new role as a tool of strategic
      asymmetry allows Russia to hold high-value targets at risk from unpredictable
      attack vectors, stressing and complicating the calculus for even the most advanced
      Western air defense systems.


      The Modernized Foxhound: A Lineage of Upgrades


      The MiG-31’s longevity is a direct result of continuous, albeit sometimes reactive,
      modernization programs designed to keep the aging but capable platform relevant
      against evolving threats.


      Early Evolution: MiG-31DZ and MiG-31B/BS


      The first significant production enhancement was the MiG-31DZ, which introduced
      a semi-retractable in-flight refueling probe on the port side of the fuselage,
      dramatically increasing the aircraft’s patrol time and operational range.


      A more critical upgrade followed in 1990 with the MiG-31B. This new variant was
      a direct response to a major security breach: the compromise of the original Zaslon
      radar’s secrets to the West by Phazotron engineer Adolf Tolkachev.


      This reactive modernization was essential to restore the system’s integrity. The
      MiG-31B featured a new, more secure version of the radar, improved electronic
      countermeasures (ECM) and electronic warfare (EW) suites, and compatibility with
      the upgraded R-33S missile.


      Concurrently, baseline MiG-31s were upgraded to a similar standard and designated
      MiG-31BS; the primary difference was that most BS models lacked the refueling
      probe.


      The “Deep Modernization”: MiG-31BM and BSM


      By the 2000s, the threat environment had shifted again, with advanced Western
      fighters, new missile technologies, and stealth becoming primary concerns. This
      prompted a proactive and comprehensive upgrade known as the Bolshaya Modernizatsiya
      (“Deep Modernization”), resulting in the MiG-31BM, the cornerstone of the modern
      Foxhound fleet.


      This program was a forward-looking enhancement designed to expand the aircraft’s
      capabilities and ensure its utility for decades.


      The MiG-31BM features a completely revamped avionics suite, replacing the 1970s-era
      analog “steam gauges” with modern liquid-crystal multi-function displays (MFDs)
      for both crew members, Hands-On-Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) controls, and a new,
      faster Baget-55 series central computer.


      The radar is upgraded to the Zaslon-AM standard, which increases the detection
      range against fighter-sized targets to 320 km and can track up to 24 targets while
      engaging eight simultaneously—a doubling of its original engagement capability.
      The upgrade also integrates the potent R-37M missile and adds a true multi-role
      capability, allowing the Foxhound to employ a range of air-to-ground munitions.


      The MiG-31BSM is a parallel upgrade applied to the older BS airframes, bringing
      them to a standard largely identical to the BM.


      The BSM upgrade adds the refueling probe, new heat-resistant canopy glass for
      safer sustained high-speed flight, and a distinctive rear-view periscope mounted
      above the pilot’s canopy. Today, the vast majority of Russia’s active Foxhound
      fleet has been brought up to the advanced BM or BSM standard.


      Specialized and Aborted Variants


      The history of the MiG-31 also includes ambitious projects that highlight its
      potential. The MiG-31M “Super Foxhound,” which first flew in 1985, was a radically
      improved version featuring a more powerful Zaslon-M radar with a larger 1.4-meter
      antenna, more powerful D-30F6M engines, and carriage for six of the then-new R-37
      missiles.


      The dissolution of the Soviet Union and subsequent economic collapse prevented
      it from entering production, but much of its advanced technology was later incorporated
      into the BM modernization program.


      Another specialized variant was the MiG-31D, developed in 1987 as a dedicated
      anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon carrier. Designed to launch the large 79M6 “Kontakt”
      missile, its radar was replaced with a specialized upward-looking sensor system.
      Though only two prototypes were built, this program established the Foxhound’s
      potential for space-related roles.

      In Service: Doctrine, Confrontation, and Combat


      The MiG-31’s operational history spans the height of the Cold War to the front
      lines of modern conflict, consistently demonstrating the effectiveness of its
      specialized design.


      Guardian of the North: Cold War Operations


      Upon entering service with the PVO in 1981, the MiG-31 immediately assumed its
      intended role as the primary defender of the Soviet Union’s vast and vulnerable
      northern and far-eastern frontiers.


      Deployed in networked groups of four, they created a formidable defensive screen
      hundreds of kilometers long, capable of engaging any intruder, from high-altitude
      strategic bombers to low-level cruise missiles.


      The Foxhound quickly proved it was the first Soviet interceptor to be a credible
      threat to the legendary Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. While the MiG-25 was unable
      to effectively intercept the high-flying, Mach 3+ reconnaissance plane, MiG-31
      crews recorded multiple successful intercepts where they achieved a weapons-quality
      radar lock.


      In a notable encounter on January 31, 1986, a MiG-31 pilot locked onto an SR-71
      from 120 km away.


      An even more famous incident occurred on October 6, 1986, when six MiG-31s executed
      a coordinated, multi-axis intercept, effectively bracketing an SR-71 and subjecting
      it to a simulated all-aspect missile attack.


      While no shots were ever fired, these encounters demonstrated a viable tactical
      solution to the previously untouchable spy plane and reportedly forced a change
      in SR-71 mission profiles, validating the effectiveness of the MiG-31 system.


      A Tale of Two Interceptors: Foxhound vs. Tomcat


      On paper, the MiG-31 and the Grumman F-14 Tomcat appear to be direct counterparts:
      large, two-seat, twin-engine interceptors armed with long-range missiles. In reality,
      they are products of fundamentally different strategic requirements and design
      philosophies.


      The MiG-31 is a land-based “Area Defense Interceptor” built for the PVO. Its design
      unapologetically prioritizes raw speed (Mach 2.83) and altitude (over 20 km) to
      cover vast distances over the Soviet landmass as quickly as possible.


      It was never intended for close-in combat, as evidenced by its 5G structural limit.


      Its strength lay in the power of its radar and its ability to function as part
      of a networked defensive barrier.


      The F-14 Tomcat, by contrast, was a carrier-based “Fleet Defense Fighter” for
      the US Navy. Its design was optimized for long loiter times on Combat Air Patrol
      (CAP) stations, using its powerful AWG-9 radar and up to six AIM-54 Phoenix missiles
      to protect an aircraft carrier battle group from swarms of Soviet bombers and
      anti-ship missiles.


      Crucially, unlike the MiG-31, the F-14 was also designed from the outset to be
      a world-class dogfighter. Its variable-sweep wings provided exceptional maneuverability
      across a wide flight envelope, making it a true air superiority fighter, not just
      an interceptor.


      The Tomcat was a versatile, multi-role naval fighter; the Foxhound was a pure,
      land-based interceptor.

      Trial by Fire: The Russo-Ukrainian War


      The 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has provided the first major combat test
      for the MiG-31, where it has emerged as one of Russia’s most formidable aerial
      assets.


      Operating from a high-altitude, high-speed sanctuary, MiG-31BMs armed with the
      very-long-range R-37M missile have engaged Ukrainian aircraft with virtual impunity.


      The Ukrainian Air Force’s fleet of Su-27s and MiG-29s lack the performance or
      missile range to effectively challenge the Foxhound in a beyond-visual-range (BVR)
      engagement, creating a significant asymmetric threat that has resulted in a number
      of claimed Ukrainian aircraft losses and has forced their pilots to fly dangerously
      low to avoid detection.


      Simultaneously, the MiG-31K variant has had a profound strategic and psychological
      impact. Every sortie by a Kinzhal-armed Foxhound triggers nationwide air raid
      alerts across Ukraine, disrupting civilian life and the economy, earning it the
      moniker of a “terror weapon”.


      While Ukrainian forces have demonstrated the ability to intercept the Kinzhal
      missile using advanced Western air defense systems like the MIM-104 Patriot, each
      engagement requires the expenditure of extremely valuable and scarce interceptor
      missiles.


      However, the Foxhound fleet is not invulnerable. Its greatest strength—its reliance
      on a small number of specialized, high-performance airframes—is also its greatest
      weakness. As the aircraft is no longer in production, every loss is irreplaceable.


      Ukraine has logically countered the MiG-31’s aerial dominance by targeting the
      aircraft on the ground. Successful long-range missile and drone strikes on Russian
      airbases, such as Belbek in occupied Crimea and Savasleyka deep inside Russia,
      have resulted in the confirmed destruction of several MiG-31s.


      This strategy bypasses the need to challenge the Foxhound in the air and instead
      attacks its logistical base, turning the conflict into a battle of attrition between
      Ukrainian precision-strike capabilities and Russian airbase defenses.


      Sunset or New Dawn? The Future of the Fleet


      With its airframes aging, the MiG-31 fleet is facing the twilight of its service
      life, prompting questions about its long-term viability and the ambitious, perhaps
      unrealistic, program intended to replace it.


      The Challenge of Age: Fleet Life Extension


      The last MiG-31 rolled off the production line at the Sokol plant in 1994, meaning
      the youngest airframes are now three decades old.


      Russia has embarked on extensive life-extension programs, with the intensive BM/BSM
      modernizations intended to keep the aircraft in service until at least 2030, and
      possibly longer.


      These overhauls require the aircraft to be completely disassembled to check for
      structural fatigue before being rebuilt with modern systems.


      This effort faces significant logistical hurdles. The powerful D-30F6 engines
      have a notoriously short time between overhauls, reportedly just 300 flight hours,
      which places an immense maintenance burden on the force.


      While Russia has claimed to have large stockpiles of spare engines, recent official
      discussions about restarting the production line suggest this inventory may be
      dwindling.


      With a finite number of airframes—perhaps 130-150 operational or in reserve out
      of ~500 built—the fleet is a dwindling asset. Stored aircraft are often cannibalized
      for spare parts to keep the active fleet flying, a practice that is unsustainable
      in the long term.


      The Successor: PAK DP / MiG-41


      Recognizing the MiG-31’s eventual retirement, Russia has initiated the Perspektivny
      Aviatsionny Kompleks Dal’nego Perekhvata (PAK DP) program to develop a successor,
      unofficially designated the MiG-41.


      This is envisioned as a sixth-generation stealth interceptor designed to carry
      the Foxhound’s mission into the mid-21st century.


      The claimed capabilities for the MiG-41 are extraordinary, including speeds of
      Mach 4-4.3, operation in “near space,” the ability to intercept hypersonic weapons,
      and an anti-satellite role.


      However, the PAK DP program is viewed with considerable skepticism by Western
      analysts. Russia has struggled with the production of its fifth-generation Su-57
      fighter and currently lacks a production engine capable of powering a Mach 4+
      aircraft.


      Given these industrial and technological challenges, many view the MiG-41 as more
      of a long-term aspiration or propaganda project than a viable program with a realistic
      timeline to replace the MiG-31 in the 2030s.


      This creates a potential “capability chasm” for Russian air defense. As the MiG-31
      fleet inevitably reaches the end of its structural life, it is highly unlikely
      that the MiG-41 will be ready to replace it in sufficient numbers.


      No other aircraft in the Russian inventory, including the Su-57, can replicate
      the Foxhound’s unique combination of speed, range, and altitude.21 This suggests
      Russia will face a period where its ability to conduct its long-held doctrine
      of wide-area air defense over its northern territories will be significantly degraded.


      Conclusion and Expert Assessment


      The Mikoyan MiG-31 “Foxhound” is an aviation paradox: a relic of a specific Cold
      War doctrine that has proven uniquely and brutally effective in a 21st-century
      conflict.


      It is the ultimate realization of the pure interceptor, a design that sacrificed
      maneuverability and versatility for unparalleled dominance in speed, altitude,
      and sensor reach. Its introduction of the Zaslon PESA radar and its networked
      operational concept were genuinely revolutionary, presaging the network-centric
      warfare of the future.


      Its core performance attributes remain formidable. The ability to sustain supersonic
      cruise at Mach 2.35 and dash to Mach 2.83 at altitudes exceeding 67,000 feet,
      combined with the extreme range of its modernized Zaslon-AM radar and R-37M missiles,
      creates a sphere of influence that few modern aircraft can challenge directly.


      However, its lack of agility makes it highly vulnerable in any close-range engagement,
      and its high operational cost and the immense maintenance burden of its aging,
      out-of-production airframes make it a fragile, finite, and ultimately irreplaceable
      asset.


      The MiG-31’s continued relevance highlights a crucial lesson in military aviation:
      while the dominant trend is towards flexible multi-role platforms, overwhelming
      performance in a specific niche can still create decisive tactical and strategic
      advantages. Yet, the Foxhound’s story is also a cautionary tale about the long-term
      risks of over-specialization. The Soviet decision to invest in this highly specialized
      platform paid dividends for decades, but now presents Russia with a critical single
      point of failure.


      As the fleet ages towards an inevitable retirement, Russia faces the monumental
      challenge of replacing a unique capability that is central to its defense doctrine—a
      task for which there is no easy or guaranteed solution on the horizon.


      The future of the dedicated heavy interceptor concept itself hangs in the balance,
      likely to fade with the last of the Foxhounds.

    text: 'The Tupolev PAK DA: Russia’s High-Stakes Gambit for a New Era of Strategic
      Airpower


      Introduction: The Dawn of a New Bomber Era


      The Tri-Polar Strategic Challenge – In the unfolding landscape of 21st-century
      geopolitics, the strategic bomber has re-emerged as a paramount symbol and instrument
      of global power.


      A new, high-stakes arms race is underway, defined not by the sheer numbers of
      the Cold War but by the technological sophistication of low-observable, or “stealth,”
      platforms capable of holding any target on the globe at risk.


      This contest is dominated by three principal actors: the United States, with its
      operational Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit and its successor, the B-21 Raider, now
      in flight testing; the People’s Republic of China, with its developing Xian H-20;
      and the Russian Federation.


      It is into this formidable arena that Russia projects its own next-generation
      contender: the Tupolev PAK DA.


      This report is a comprehensive look at the PAK DA, pulling together all available
      information into one, comprehensive analysis.


      Ambition vs. Reality


      The Tupolev PAK DA (an acronym for Perspektivnyi Aviatsionnyi Kompleks Dalney
      Aviatsii, or “Prospective Aviation Complex for Long-Range Aviation”), officially
      codenamed Poslannik (Envoy), represents a monumental and necessary doctrinal shift
      in Russian military aviation.


      The program signals a decisive break from the Soviet-era emphasis on supersonic
      speed as the primary means of survival, embracing instead a modern paradigm that
      prioritizes stealth, extended range, and the use of advanced standoff weaponry.


      This ambitious vision, however, is tethered to a starkly different reality. The
      PAK DA program is fundamentally constrained by a cascade of formidable and interconnected
      obstacles: deep-seated technological deficits in critical areas like stealth materials
      and microelectronics, a beleaguered and under-resourced industrial base, the crippling
      effect of sustained international sanctions, and the immense resource drain of
      the ongoing war in Ukraine.


      The PAK DA is, therefore, more than a military hardware project; it is a high-stakes
      test of the modern Russian state’s ability to conceive, fund, and execute a technologically
      revolutionary program on par with its global rivals under conditions of unprecedented
      and sustained pressure.


      Its trajectory will serve as a crucial bellwether for the future of Russia’s high-tech
      defense sector and its standing as a top-tier military power.


      From ‘Blackjack’ Successor to ‘Spirit’ Competitor: A Doctrinal Evolution


      Post-Soviet Origins and Supersonic Dreams – The conceptual genesis of a next-generation
      Russian bomber dates to the late 1990s, with the first formal technical and tactical
      requirements being issued to the venerable Tupolev Design Bureau in 2007 and program
      financing commencing in 2008.


      Early concepts for the PAK DA were heavily influenced by Russia’s existing bomber
      doctrine, which prized speed and altitude. Initial plans envisioned a platform
      heavily based on an evolution of the supersonic Tupolev Tu-160 “Blackjack,” a
      swing-wing strategic bomber that remains the heaviest and fastest of its kind.


      This approach reflected a deeply ingrained Soviet-era philosophy that high speed
      was a key component of a bomber’s survivability, allowing it to dash through or
      outrun enemy defenses.


      The Subsonic Pivot: Acknowledging a New Reality


      By 2013, the program underwent a profound and decisive transformation. The Russian
      Defence Ministry announced that the selected design for the PAK DA would be a
      subsonic “flying wing,” explicitly abandoning the pursuit of supersonic speed
      in favor of low observability (stealth), extended range, and greater payload capacity.


      This pivot represented a fundamental change in Russian strategic thought, an implicit
      acknowledgment that in the face of modern, sophisticated Integrated Air Defense
      Systems (IADS), stealth had become a more viable survival mechanism than speed.
      The new design paradigm drew clear inspiration from the only operational stealth
      bomber at the time, the American B-2 Spirit, signaling Russia’s intent to compete
      directly in the domain of low-observable technology.


      This doctrinal shift and the concurrent decision to restart production of the
      modernized supersonic Tu-160M2 are two sides of the same coin, revealing a pragmatic,
      if reluctant, admission by the Russian military establishment of its technological
      and financial limitations.


      The immense cost and complexity of developing a platform that is both supersonic
      and truly stealthy—a challenge that led the United States to field separate B-1
      and B-2 bombers—likely proved insurmountable. This dual-track approach represents
      a strategic compromise: the Tu-160M2 addresses the continuing need for a modern
      supersonic standoff platform, freeing the PAK DA to focus exclusively on the technically
      demanding challenge of achieving stealth.


      A History of Shifting Timelines


      The PAK DA’s development has been characterized by a consistent pattern of ambitious
      announcements followed by significant and repeated delays. Initial projections
      in the late 2000s and early 2010s suggested a first flight between 2015 and 2019,
      with serial production beginning as early as 2023.


      However, this schedule has slipped continuously. The projected first flight was
      pushed to 2023, then to 2024, and is now tentatively slated for 2025 at the earliest.


      Consequently, the start of serial production has been postponed to 2027-2030,
      with many Western analysts believing even this timeline is optimistic.


      These persistent delays were a primary driver behind the 2015 decision to restart
      production of the Tu-160 as the modernized Tu-160M2, a crucial stopgap measure
      to ensure Russia’s Long-Range Aviation branch did not suffer a critical capability
      gap while awaiting the PAK DA.


      Anatomy of the ‘Poslannik’: Technical Specifications and Core Technologies


      Airframe and Design Philosophy – The PAK DA is based on a “flying wing” aerodynamic
      configuration, a design inherently suited for reducing an aircraft’s radar cross-section
      (RCS) by eliminating the large, reflective vertical and horizontal tail surfaces
      of a traditional airframe.


      Renderings and mock-ups depict a design featuring blended wing-body construction,
      with engine intakes seamlessly integrated into the upper fuselage to shield them
      from ground-based radar.


      The design is heavily inspired by the U.S. B-2 Spirit and B-21 Raider, which have
      established the flying wing as the optimal shape for a penetrating stealth bomber.


      The following table consolidates the most frequently cited projected specifications
      for the PAK DA, drawn from a combination of official statements, state media reports,
      and expert analysis.


      Characteristic Projected Specification Design Subsonic Flying Wing Crew 4 Max
      Takeoff Weight 145 tonnes Payload Capacity 30-35 tonnes Propulsion 2 x “Izdeliye
      RF” / NK32-02 derivative turbofans Speed Subsonic, ~800 km/h (Mach 0.65) cruise
      Range 12,000 km – 15,000 km Endurance Up to 30 hours Service Ceiling ~20,000 m
      (65,600 ft)


      Propulsion: The ‘Izdeliye RF’ Engine


      Powering the PAK DA is a new engine, reportedly designated “Izdeliye RF” (Product
      RF), developed by the UEC-Kuznetsov company.


      This powerplant is understood to be a non-afterburning derivative of the powerful
      NK-32 Tier 2 engine used on the modernized Tu-160M2 bomber, but heavily optimized
      for subsonic fuel efficiency to achieve the bomber’s demanding range and endurance
      requirements.


      Development has been underway for several years, with reports of prototypes beginning
      bench tests in late 2020 and continuing through 2022.


      Key design goals for the engine are not only performance but also extreme resilience,
      with specifications calling for a long service life of 12 to 21 years and the
      ability to operate in harsh environments and withstand the electromagnetic and
      thermal effects of a nuclear explosion.


      The Stealth Conundrum: Coatings vs. Composites


      A critical examination of Russia’s approach to stealth technology reveals what
      may be the PAK DA’s most significant vulnerability. Abundant evidence suggests
      that Russian industry continues to rely on applying external radar-absorbent material
      (RAM) coatings and appliques to an aircraft’s surface after the primary structure
      is built.


      This technique stands in stark contrast to the more advanced and effective Western
      method, used in platforms like the B-2 and B-21, where stealth properties are
      “baked in” to the airframe itself through the use of specialized, structurally
      integrated composite materials.


      This technological gap is a core challenge for the PAK DA program.


      External coatings are generally less effective across the broad spectrum of radar
      frequencies, less durable in harsh operational conditions, and create significant,
      time-consuming maintenance burdens—all factors that could compromise the bomber’s
      survivability and operational availability.


      “Sixth-Generation” Aspirations: Avionics, EW, and AI


      Despite these underlying technological challenges, the PAK DA is being officially
      marketed by Russia as a “sixth-generation” platform.


      This branding is used to associate the bomber with a suite of next-generation
      capabilities. These include claims of a highly automated cockpit to reduce crew
      workload, a powerful new electronic warfare (EW) suite designed to jam and suppress
      enemy air defenses, and full network-centric warfare capabilities allowing it
      to share data across the battlespace.12


      More speculative claims about its future potential include the ability for unmanned
      operation, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for mission management,
      “loyal wingman” drone-teaming, and even the future installation of directed-energy
      laser weapons for defense or anti-satellite missions.


      The stark contrast between these ambitious “sixth-generation” claims and Russia’s
      documented struggles with fundamental “fifth-generation” technologies, such as
      integrated stealth composites, suggests a significant propaganda dimension to
      the PAK DA program. The “sixth-gen” label appears to be a strategic messaging
      tool aimed at projecting technological parity with the American B-21 Raider, regardless
      of the underlying technical reality.


      The Standoff Arsenal: Armament, Mission Profile, and Strategic Role


      Doctrine of the Standoff Bomber – The PAK DA’s design and intended armament point
      toward a primary mission profile as a long-range, high-payload “missile truck”.


      Its operational concept appears to de-emphasize deep penetration into heavily
      contested airspace, a mission reserved for platforms with assured, all-aspect
      stealth like the B-21. Instead, the PAK DA is designed to operate from the relative
      safety of permissive or semi-permissive airspace, using its vast payload and long
      range to launch salvos of advanced standoff weapons from hundreds or thousands
      of kilometers away.


      This doctrine is a direct reflection of the potential limitations in its own stealth
      capabilities; it leverages Russia’s acknowledged strengths in advanced missile
      technology to compensate for potential weaknesses in stealth airframe manufacturing.


      The survivability of the mission is thus transferred from the platform itself
      to the long-range, high-speed weapons it carries.


      A Formidable Internal Payload


      A defining feature of the PAK DA is its massive internal weapons bay, designed
      to accommodate a payload of 30 to 35 tonnes. This capacity significantly exceeds
      that of the B-2 Spirit (approx. 20 tonnes) and the B-21 Raider (projected at approx.
      15 tonnes), allowing the PAK DA to carry an unparalleled arsenal of Russia’s most
      advanced strategic munitions.


      Weapon Category Specific Munitions (estimated based on current data available
      Hypersonic Missiles Kh-47M2 Kinzhal derivatives; Kh-95 (newly developed for PAK
      DA) Long-Range Cruise Missiles Kh-101/Kh-102 (conventional/nuclear stealthy cruise
      missiles); Kh-555; new Kh-BD (reported 6,500 km range) Precision-Guided Bombs
      Various guided bombs for conventional strike Self-Defense Missiles Reports indicate
      the planned inclusion of air-to-air missiles, a departure from previous Russian
      bomber designs


      Speculative Missions: Anti-Satellite (ASAT) and Space Control


      Adding a potentially destabilizing dimension to its strategic role are reports
      that the PAK DA could be tasked with counter-space missions.


      This capability could manifest in several ways, from launching kinetic direct-ascent
      anti-satellite (ASAT) missiles to employing onboard directed-energy weapons, such
      as lasers, to “dazzle” or permanently disable the sensitive optical sensors of
      low-earth orbit (LEO) reconnaissance and communication satellites.


      If realized, this would transform the PAK DA from a purely terrestrial strike
      platform into a tool of space warfare, capable of blinding an adversary’s critical
      space-based intelligence and communication networks at the outset of a conflict.


      A Program Under Siege: Sanctions, Industrial Limits, and the Shadow of War


      The Sanctions Bite – The PAK DA program has been developing under the shadow of
      Western sanctions for its entire existence, with restrictions intensifying dramatically
      following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. These sanctions have severely restricted
      Russia’s access to the critical dual-use technologies indispensable for a modern
      aerospace program.


      This includes high-performance microelectronics and processors for avionics and
      flight control computers, precision machine tools required for manufacturing components
      to exacting tolerances, and the precursor chemicals and materials needed to produce
      advanced composites and radar-absorbent coatings.


      While Russia has sought to circumvent these restrictions through alternative sourcing
      and developing indigenous substitutes, the sanctions have undeniably slowed progress
      and limited the technological ceiling of the program.


      Russia’s Ailing Industrial Base – Beyond external pressures, the program is hampered
      by long-standing internal weaknesses within Russia’s defense-industrial base.
      Key design bureaus like Tupolev have suffered from a “brain drain” and a shortage
      of engineers with the highly specialized skills needed for a project of this complexity,
      particularly in areas like flight control software for an unstable flying wing
      design.


      Furthermore, production facilities, including the Kazan Aircraft Plant (KAPO)
      designated for final assembly and the Kuznetsov engine plant, reportedly suffer
      from outdated machinery and shortfalls in the resources needed for series production
      of such an advanced aircraft.


      The Paradox of the Ukraine War – The ongoing war in Ukraine has created a dual,
      conflicting pressure on the PAK DA program. On one hand, the conflict has dramatically
      increased the urgency for the bomber. Successful Ukrainian drone strikes on airbases
      deep inside Russia have exposed the vulnerability of the legacy Tu-95 and Tu-22M3
      bomber fleets, highlighting the critical need for a more survivable, modern strategic
      platform.


      On the other hand, the war is consuming a vast proportion of Russia’s defense
      budget, industrial capacity, and material resources, diverting them away from
      long-term, capital-intensive R&D projects like the PAK DA toward the immediate
      needs of the battlefield.


      The program is thus caught in a vicious cycle: the very events that prove its
      necessity are the same events that make its timely completion less likely by strangling
      the required resources. This strategic trap poses a significant long-term challenge
      to the modernization of Russia’s strategic air arm.


      The Competitive Landscape: A Tri-Polar Bomber Race


      PAK DA vs. B-21 Raider: A Clash of Philosophies – A direct comparison between
      the PAK DA and its primary American competitor, the B-21 Raider, reveals two fundamentally
      different approaches to the challenge of 21st-century strategic strike.


      The B-21 Raider is conceived as a true penetrating strike platform. Its design
      prioritizes all-aspect, broadband stealth and an advanced sensor suite, enabling
      it to survive deep within the most heavily defended enemy airspace. This allows
      it to deliver smaller, more numerous, and less expensive direct-attack munitions
      with high precision, making it a cost-effective tool for dismantling an enemy’s
      warfighting infrastructure from within.


      The PAK DA, in contrast, is emerging as a standoff strike platform. Its design
      prioritizes immense payload capacity and intercontinental range. It is intended
      to function as a survivable “magazine,” launching hypersonic and very-long-range
      cruise missiles from the periphery of contested airspace.


      This doctrine leverages Russia’s lead in missile technology to hold targets at
      risk without requiring the bomber itself to face the most advanced layers of enemy
      air defense.


      Comparative Metric Tupolev PAK DA (Projected) Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider (Projected)
      Primary Doctrine Standoff Missile Carrier Penetrating Striker Payload Capacity
      30-35 tonnes ~15 tonnes Key Armament Hypersonic Missiles, Long-Range Cruise Missiles
      Direct-Attack Bombs, Standoff Munitions Stealth Technology External RAM Coatings/Appliques
      Integrated Structural Composites Development Status Prototype Construction, Delayed
      Flight Testing, Initial Production


      Strategic Implications for NATO and Global Security


      The introduction of a hypersonic-armed PAK DA would significantly alter the strategic
      threat landscape. Hypersonic weapons, with their combination of extreme speed
      and maneuverability, compress defensive decision-making timelines and challenge
      the effectiveness of existing missile defense architectures.


      Even a small fleet of PAK DAs, operating as part of a modernized nuclear triad
      alongside the Tu-160M2 and new generations of ICBMs and SLBMs, would provide Russia
      with a more flexible, survivable, and potent strategic deterrent.


      Outlook: A Future Threat or a Paper Plane?


      Synthesizing Potential and Pitfalls – The Tupolev PAK DA program is a study in
      contrasts. On paper, it represents a formidable future threat: a long-range, high-endurance
      bomber with an enormous payload of Russia’s most advanced conventional and nuclear
      standoff weapons. In practice, its development is beset by profound and persistent
      challenges spanning technology, industrial capacity, and geopolitics.


      The reality of the PAK DA is likely to fall somewhere between the Kremlin’s ambitious
      proclamations and the most skeptical Western assessments. It is neither a guaranteed
      super-weapon nor mere “vaporware.”


      A Realistic Projection – The official timeline projecting serial production by
      2027-2030 appears highly improbable given the program’s history of delays and
      the compounding pressures of sanctions and war. A more realistic scenario involves
      a continued, slow-burn development cycle, with a potential entry into service
      in very limited numbers in the mid-to-late 2030s. The most likely outcome is not
      a one-for-one replacement of the entire legacy fleet, but rather the production
      of a small, elite squadron of PAK DA bombers.


      These aircraft would serve as a niche, high-end capability reserved for the most
      critical strategic tasks, while modernized Tu-160M2s and life-extended Tu-95s
      continue to form the backbone of Russia’s Long-Range Aviation for the foreseeable
      future.


      Final Assessment


      The PAK DA Poslannik is the physical embodiment of Russia’s 21st-century strategic
      ambitions and its accompanying limitations.


      While its final form, operational numbers, and ultimate service entry date remain
      shrouded in uncertainty, the doctrine it represents is clear and enduring.


      Russia’s strategic aviation is firmly committed to a future centered on long-range,
      high-speed standoff attack. Therefore, Western defense planners must prepare for
      the advanced weapon systems the PAK DA is designed to carry—particularly long-range
      cruise and hypersonic missiles—even if the bomber platform itself remains a distant
      and uncertain prospect.


      In the modern strategic equation, the threat is increasingly defined by the missile
      as much as, if not more than, the plane that carries it.

    text: 'F-35A Introduction: More Than a Fighter


      The Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II is not merely a new fighter jet; it represents
      a fundamental, and fiercely debated, paradigm shift in air power doctrine.


      It is simultaneously the technological centerpiece of 21st-century global security
      for the United States and its allies and a case study in the immense complexities,
      costs, and controversies of modern defense procurement.


      Conceived to replace a vast and aging array of legacy aircraft with a single,
      versatile family of fighters, its journey from concept to combat readiness has
      been defined by both revolutionary innovation and persistent challenges.


      This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the F-35A, arguing that its strategic
      value is derived not from traditional metrics of fighter performance but from
      its revolutionary capabilities as a networked, stealthy sensor node.


      This technological ambition, however, has come at the cost of its foundational
      goal of affordability.


      This has created a persistent tension between its immense potential and its practical,
      real-world challenges, including cost, reliability, and sustainment, that will
      define its legacy.


      The Genesis of a Global Workhorse: The Joint Strike Fighter Program


      The Strategic Imperative: Replacing an Aging and Disparate Fleet


      The origins of the F-35 lie in the strategic realities of the post-Cold War era.


      The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) faced the daunting task of replacing a wide
      range of specialized, aging aircraft across its services.


      The U.S. Air Force needed a successor to its workhorse, the F-16 Fighting Falcon,
      and the venerable A-10 Thunderbolt II, a close air support aircraft.


      The U.S. Navy required a replacement for its carrier-based F/A-18 Hornet variants,
      while the Marine Corps needed to replace its unique AV-8B Harrier vertical takeoff
      jets and its own F/A-18s. Key allies, like the United Kingdom, faced similar block
      obsolescence with their Harrier and Tornado fleets.


      The prospect of developing, procuring, and sustaining separate, bespoke aircraft
      for each of these roles was deemed financially unsustainable. This reality was
      underscored by the 1991 cancellation of the Navy’s A-12 Avenger II stealth attack
      aircraft program due to severe cost and schedule overruns, which created a critical
      capability gap and served as a powerful catalyst for a new, joint approach to
      aircraft development.


      From CALF and JAST to JSF: The Birth of a Megaproject


      The solution that emerged was the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, formed from
      the merger of two preceding initiatives.


      The first was the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF), a DARPA-led project
      initially focused on developing a Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft
      for the U.S. Marine Corps, which the Air Force later joined to seek a replacement
      for the F-16. The second was the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program,
      established in 1993 to develop common aircraft, weapons, and sensor technologies
      for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps.


      A key philosophical shift of the JAST/JSF program was to treat cost as a variable
      independent of other factors.


      Learning from the failures of past programs where performance requirements drove
      costs to unsustainable levels, the JSF program involved warfighters early in the
      design process to make crucial trade-offs between capability and cost. This was
      a direct attempt to avoid the pitfalls of earlier joint programs, such as the
      1960s TFX, which attempted to build a universal airplane that ultimately performed
      poorly for all its intended users.


      However, this very ambition of creating a single platform to meet the disparate
      needs of three services—a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) version for
      the Air Force, a STOVL version for the Marines, and a carrier-based version for
      the Navy—introduced immense technical complexity that would ultimately challenge
      its core goal. The engineering solution for the F-35B’s vertical lift system,
      a complex shaft-driven lift fan, dictated a wider fuselage cross-section.


      This fundamental design constraint was inherited by the F-35A, making it physically
      larger and less aerodynamically optimized than a pure CTOL design might have been.
      This compromise, driven by the “joint” requirement, added weight and complexity
      across the entire aircraft family, which directly translated into higher manufacturing
      and operational costs, creating a paradox where the pursuit of “jointness” undermined
      the foundational goal of “affordability.”


      The X-Plane Fly-Off: Lockheed Martin’s X-35 vs. Boeing’s X-32


      In November 1996, the DoD awarded contracts to two industry teams, led by Lockheed
      Martin and Boeing, to build and fly concept demonstrator aircraft. Lockheed Martin
      proposed the X-35, which featured a more conventional fighter design and a novel,
      separate shaft-driven lift fan for its STOVL variant. This system proved to be
      a more robust and lower-risk solution for vertical flight.


      Boeing’s X-32 was a more radical design, featuring a large, single-piece delta
      wing and a direct-lift engine configuration that required complex reconfiguration
      for STOVL flight. After a rigorous competition, the DoD announced on October 26,
      2001, that Lockheed Martin’s X-35 had won.


      The program then advanced into the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)
      phase, and the aircraft was officially designated the F-35.


      The Promise of International Partnership


      A core tenet of the JSF program was to mitigate its enormous cost by sharing development
      expenses among key allies. The United Kingdom was the first and most significant
      partner, contributing $200 million to the concept demonstration phase alone.


      A consortium of other nations, including Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia,
      Denmark, and Norway, soon followed it.


      This global enterprise was designed not only to distribute costs but also to create
      a vast production base, leveraging economies of scale to drive down unit prices
      while ensuring a high degree of interoperability among allied air forces for decades
      to come.


      Anatomy of a Networked Predator: F-35A Technical Specifications and Core Systems


      Airframe, Propulsion, and Kinematic Performance


      The F-35A is a single-seat, single-engine fighter designed for a multitude of
      roles. Its performance characteristics reflect a design philosophy that prioritizes
      stealth, sensor integration, and situational awareness over raw kinematic performance.
      It is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney F135-PW-100 afterburning turbofan, the
      most powerful fighter engine in the world, capable of producing 43,000 pounds
      of thrust.


      This gives the aircraft excellent acceleration and energy. While its top speed
      of Mach 1.6 is lower than some 4th-generation fighters it replaces, such as the
      F-16, this figure is achievable with a full internal weapons load.


      This is a critical distinction, as legacy fighters carrying external weapons and
      fuel tanks suffer from significant parasitic drag that degrades their performance,
      a penalty the F-35A avoids in its stealth configuration.


      The aircraft is also highly agile, capable of performing 9g maneuvers, putting
      it on par with other elite fighters.


      This deliberate design trade-off is central to understanding the aircraft. The
      F-35A is not intended to be the fastest or highest-climbing fighter, ceding pure
      kinematic superiority to dedicated air-to-air platforms like the F-22 Raptor.


      Its true “performance” is computational. Official literature consistently emphasizes
      capabilities like “sensor fusion,” “network-enabled operations,” and “unprecedented
      situational awareness”.


      The aircraft is frequently described as a “quarterback of the skies,” a node whose
      primary role is to see, decide, and direct the battle, often for other assets.


      The value proposition is to win a fight by employing superior information to utilize
      weapons from a position of advantage, making a traditional close-range dogfight—where
      kinematics are king—a scenario the F-35 is engineered to avoid entirely.


      Judging the F-35A on traditional fighter metrics like top speed is to misunderstand
      its design philosophy fundamentally; its power lies in its advanced “brain” (sensors
      and fusion), not its “brawn” (raw speed and agility).

      The Pillars of 5th-Generation Capability


      The F-35A’s combat effectiveness is built on a foundation of interconnected, next-generation
      technologies that define it as a 5th-generation fighter.


      Very Low Observability (Stealth): The F-35’s airframe shape, advanced composite
      materials, and internal weapons carriage are all meticulously designed to minimize
      its radar cross-section. This stealth capability is not invisibility, but rather
      a means to delay or deny detection by enemy air defense systems, allowing it to
      penetrate heavily contested airspace and engage targets before the adversary can
      effectively react. This is its primary survival mechanism, a departure from the
      speed, altitude, or armor of legacy aircraft.


      Advanced Sensor Suite: The heart of the F-35 is its integrated suite of powerful
      electronic sensors.


      AN/APG-81 AESA Radar: Developed by Northrop Grumman, this Active Electronically
      Scanned Array radar provides remarkable long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground
      tracking of multiple targets. It can also function as a potent electronic warfare
      aperture, capable of jamming enemy radars and disrupting attacks.


      AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System (DAS): This system consists of six infrared
      cameras mounted around the airframe to provide the pilot with a complete 360-degree
      spherical view of the surrounding environment. The DAS automatically detects and
      tracks incoming aircraft and missiles from any direction, and its imagery can
      be projected onto the pilot’s helmet display, allowing them to effectively “see
      through” the floor of the cockpit.


      AN/AAQ-40 Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS): Mounted internally under the
      aircraft’s nose, the EOTS provides precision targeting capabilities without compromising
      the F-35’s stealth profile. It combines forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and infrared
      search-and-track (IRST) functions, enabling long-range detection and targeting
      of both air and ground threats.


      Sensor Fusion and Situational Awareness: The truly revolutionary aspect of the
      F-35 is not just the power of its individual sensors, but its ability to process
      and fuse the vast amounts of data they collect—along with information piped in
      from off-board sources like AWACS, satellites, and other F-35s—into a single,
      coherent, and intuitive picture of the battlespace. This fused data is displayed
      on the pilot’s advanced helmet-mounted display, providing unprecedented situational
      awareness and dramatically reducing the pilot’s cognitive workload, allowing them
      to make faster and better tactical decisions.


      The Claws of the Lightning: Armament and Weapon Systems


      “Stealth Mode” vs. “Beast Mode”: The Loadout Trade-Off


      The F-35A’s lethality is intrinsically linked to a critical mission trade-off
      between stealth and firepower. To maintain its very low observable profile, the
      aircraft must carry all of its fuel and weapons internally within two weapons
      bays. In this “stealth mode,” a typical loadout for a strike mission consists
      of two medium-range air-to-air missiles and two precision-guided air-to-ground
      bombs.


      When operating in less contested airspace where stealth is not the primary concern,
      the F-35A can utilize six external hardpoints on its wings and fuselage. This
      configuration, colloquially known as “beast mode,” allows it to carry a much larger
      payload, with a maximum ordnance capacity of up to 22,000 pounds. This provides
      significant mission flexibility, allowing it to function as a heavy bomb truck
      when needed, but at the cost of its stealth characteristics.


      Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground Arsenal


      The F-35A is certified to carry a wide and growing array of advanced munitions
      from the U.S. and allied inventories.


      Air-to-Air: The primary beyond-visual-range (BVR) weapon is the Raytheon AIM-120
      AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile), carried internally. For close-range,
      within-visual-range engagements, it can carry the AIM-9X Sidewinder high-off-boresight
      missile on its external wingtip stations. Lockheed Martin is developing a “Sidekick”
      adapter that will allow the F-35A to carry six internal AMRAAMs, increasing its
      BVR lethality while remaining in stealth mode.


      Air-to-Ground: The aircraft’s strike capability is centered on precision-guided
      munitions. It can internally carry 2,000-pound GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munitions
      (JDAMs) and smaller GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs (SDBs). Ongoing Block 4 software
      and hardware upgrades will integrate new weapons, including the developmental
      Stand-in Attack Weapon (SiAW) for targeting enemy air defenses and the Joint Strike
      Missile (JSM) anti-ship missile. Critically, the F-35A was certified in October
      2023 to carry the B61-12 nuclear gravity bomb, making it a dual-capable tactical
      aircraft.


      The GAU-22/A Cannon: A Troubled History


      The F-35A is the only variant with an internally mounted gun: a four-barreled
      25mm GAU-22/A Gatling cannon located in the left wing root to preserve stealth.
      The weapon has a high rate of fire at 3,300 rounds per minute, but its ammunition
      capacity is extremely limited at just 180 rounds, providing only about three seconds
      of total firing time. The gun program has been plagued by significant issues for
      years.


      Early testing revealed unacceptable inaccuracy, with rounds missing targets due
      to misalignments in the gun mounts that caused the barrel to shift during firing.
      Furthermore, the software symbology used for aiming in the pilot’s helmet display
      was initially deemed “operationally unusable and potentially unsafe”. While the
      Pentagon now considers the gun “effective” after software fixes and structural
      modifications, its limited ammunition and long-standing problems have fueled intense
      debate about the F-35A’s suitability for the close air support (CAS) role, where
      a reliable and accurate gun is often considered essential.


      Configuration Internal Bay Stations (4) External Stations (6) Internal Gun Total
      Payload Stealth Mode 2x AIM-120 AMRAAM 2x GBU-31 JDAM None 1x GAU-22/A (180 rounds)

      From Test Flights to Combat Skies: Operational History and Global Deployment


      Developmental Timeline: A Long Road to Readiness


      The F-35A’s path from its first flight to full combat capability has been a long
      and arduous one, marked by both major milestones and significant setbacks. The
      first prototype, designated AA-1, made its maiden flight on December 15, 2006.


      The U.S. Air Force officially declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for
      the F-35A on August 2, 2016, with the 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force
      Base, Utah, becoming the first combat-ready unit.


      This journey was far from smooth. The program’s reliance on “concurrency”—building
      production aircraft while development and testing were still ongoing—led to costly
      retrofits when design flaws were discovered. Early in the program, significant
      weight problems required a major, 18-month redesign that cost billions. Software
      development proved to be a persistent bottleneck, pushing back timelines repeatedly.


      The protracted nature of this development cycle is starkly illustrated by the
      fact that the decision to authorize full-rate production—a milestone signifying
      program maturity—was not made until March 12, 2024, more than 22 years after Lockheed
      Martin was first awarded the contract.


      Trial by Fire: The F-35A’s First Combat Employment


      While the Israeli Air Force was the first to use any F-35 variant in combat in
      2018, the U.S. Air Force’s F-35A had its own trial by fire a year later. On April
      30, 2019, two F-35As conducted the variant’s first-ever combat employment.


      The mission involved an airstrike against an entrenched Islamic State (ISIS) tunnel
      network and weapons cache in the Hamrin Mountains of Iraq.


      The aircraft used Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) to destroy the target.
      This inaugural combat sortie was launched from Al Dhafra Air Base in the United
      Arab Emirates, as part of the F-35A’s first deployment to the U.S. Central Command
      area of responsibility.


      The Global Enterprise: A Network of Operators


      The F-35A is the most common variant of the Lightning II and has become a cornerstone
      of air power for a large and growing coalition of nations. This widespread adoption
      fulfills one of the JSF program’s central strategic goals: ensuring deep interoperability
      among allied forces. Beyond the U.S. Air Force, which plans to procure 1,763 F-35As,
      the aircraft is operated by numerous international partners and Foreign Military
      Sales customers.


      This global user base creates a shared logistics and training network, reinforcing
      the program’s collaborative foundation.

      The Trillion-Dollar Fighter: A Deep Dive into F-35A Program Costs


      The F-35 is the most expensive weapons system in history, and its costs are subject
      to intense scrutiny and frequent misunderstanding. The total cost can be broken
      down into three main categories: flyaway cost, operational cost, and total lifecycle
      cost.


      The Flyaway Cost: A Story of Decline and Resurgence


      The “flyaway cost” refers to the price of a single, finished aircraft including
      its engine and mission systems. This has been a major focus of the program office
      and Lockheed Martin. Early low-rate initial production (LRIP) lots saw F-35A costs
      exceeding $200 million per unit.Through significant manufacturing efficiencies
      and the benefits of economies of scale as production ramped up, the program successfully
      drove this cost down dramatically, reaching a low of approximately $78 million
      per aircraft in Lot 14.


      However, this downward trend has reversed. The contract for Lots 15-17 saw the
      average F-35A flyaway cost rise to $82.5 million.


      This increase is attributed to several factors, including lower annual production
      quantities, persistent inflation, and the integration of more complex and capable
      hardware associated with the Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) upgrade, which is necessary
      for future capabilities.


      The Cost Per Flight Hour (CPFH): A Stubborn Challenge


      While the flyaway cost is a one-time expense, the Cost Per Flight Hour (CPFH)
      represents the ongoing burden of operating and supporting the aircraft. This has
      been one of the program’s most persistent and critical problems. The original,
      ambitious target was a CPFH of $25,000 (in 2012 dollars), which would have been
      comparable to the F-16 it replaces.


      The reality has been far different. The actual CPFH has remained stubbornly high,
      with various government and independent reports citing figures ranging from $33,600
      to $42,000 in different fiscal years.


      According to a 2023 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, the Air
      Force’s annual cost to operate and sustain an individual F-35A is estimated at
      $6.6 million, significantly higher than its original affordability target of $4.1
      million.


      A subsequent estimate for the 2024 Annual Cost Estimate projects this figure will
      rise further to $7.5 million.


      This high CPFH has direct consequences, forcing the military services to fly their
      aircraft less than planned to stay within budget, which in turn impacts pilot
      proficiency and overall fleet readiness.


      The Total Program Lifecycle Cost: Deconstructing the $2 Trillion Figure


      The most sensational figure associated with the F-35 is its total lifecycle cost,
      which is now estimated to exceed $2 trillion.


      This staggering number is often presented without context. It represents the total
      estimated cost for the entire planned U.S. procurement of nearly 2,500 aircraft
      across all three services, and includes all development, production, and—most
      significantly—all sustainment and operational costs over the program’s entire
      lifespan, which is projected to run through the year 2088.


      The sustainment portion alone accounts for the vast majority of this total, at
      an estimated $1.58 trillion.


      Furthermore, approximately half of the $2 trillion estimate—around $1 trillion—is
      the projected effect of inflation over this 94-year period.


      While the figure is immense, the F-35 program is one of the first to attempt such
      a comprehensive, cradle-to-grave cost forecast from its outset.


      This has led to what can be described as an “affordability shell game.” The GAO
      has reported that the military services have managed to meet their revised “affordability
      targets” for the F-35A, but not by fundamentally reducing the aircraft’s high
      operating costs. Instead, this has been achieved on paper through two primary
      administrative maneuvers. First, the services have drastically reduced the number
      of hours they plan to fly each jet annually; the Air Force, for instance, cut
      its planned F-35A flight hours at steady state by 21%, from 230 to 187 hours per
      year. Second, the services have increased the budget they say they can “afford.”


      The Air Force raised its affordability target from $4.1 million per plane per
      year to $6.8 million. By flying less (reducing expenditures) and increasing the
      budget (raising the spending ceiling), the program can appear to be meeting its
      goals. However, this is an accounting solution, not a cost-saving one, with the
      dangerous third-order effect of potentially degrading pilot training and combat
      readiness.


      Trials and Tribulations: Program Challenges and Enduring Criticisms


      The “Concurrency” Gamble: Building While Designing


      A core strategy of the F-35 program was “concurrency”—the practice of starting
      low-rate production before development and testing were complete. This was intended
      to accelerate the delivery of aircraft to the warfighter. However, the gamble
      proved to be enormously expensive. Design flaws and performance issues discovered
      in test aircraft had to be fixed not only in future designs but also retrofitted
      onto production jets that were already built or on the assembly line, a process
      that added billions to the program’s cost and contributed to years of delays.


      Reliability and Availability: The Achilles’ Heel


      Despite being in operational service for years, the F-35 fleet has consistently
      failed to meet its own readiness targets. Multiple reports have shown the fleet’s
      full mission capable rate—the percentage of aircraft ready to perform any and
      all assigned missions at a given time—to be well below its goals, with some reports
      citing rates of less than 50%.


      The GAO has confirmed that none of the F-35 variants are meeting their availability
      goals. The problems are multifaceted, ranging from the stealth coating being difficult
      and time-consuming to maintain, to a persistent shortage of spare parts, inadequate
      depot capacity, and ongoing engine reliability issues.


      The Software Quagmire: ALIS, ODIN, and TR-3


      The F-35’s advanced capabilities are defined by its software, which has proven
      to be one of the most complex and troubled aspects of the program. The original
      logistics system, known as the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS),
      was intended to be the digital backbone for managing the global supply chain,
      maintenance, and diagnostics. In practice, it was notoriously buggy, slow, and
      according to the Pentagon’s own testing office, “impeded, rather than facilitated,
      effective maintenance”.


      Its planned cloud-based replacement, the Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN),
      has also faced its own development stalls and funding cuts. More recently, the
      crucial Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) upgrade, which provides the advanced computer
      core and memory required for all future Block 4 capabilities, is years behind
      schedule due to software stability issues. This delay became so critical that
      it forced the Pentagon to halt deliveries of newly built F-35s for nearly a year,
      creating a costly backlog of completed aircraft that could not be accepted by
      the military.


      The CAS Debate: Is the F-35A a Worthy A-10 Replacement?


      One of the most heated and enduring debates surrounding the F-35A is whether it
      can effectively replace the legendary A-10 “Warthog” for the Close Air Support
      (CAS) mission. Critics point to the F-35A’s significant disadvantages in this
      specific role: a smaller weapons load, very limited cannon ammunition, a lack
      of armor and redundant systems, and a reliance on high-altitude flight for survival.
      This is in stark contrast to the A-10, which was designed from the ground up to
      be a rugged, low-flying tank-killer that can absorb significant battle damage
      and bring its pilot home.


      Comparative fly-off tests between the two aircraft, though heavily redacted, revealed
      that it would take more F-35 sorties to attack the same number of targets as an
      A-10, and that A-10 pilots demonstrated better bombing accuracy, in part because
      their aircraft’s survivability allowed them to fly closer to the target. Proponents
      of the F-35A argue that in a modern, high-threat environment with advanced surface-to-air
      missiles, the A-10 is too vulnerable to survive, and that the F-35A’s stealth
      and advanced sensors allow it to perform the CAS mission from a safer distance.

      Conclusion: An Analytical Outlook on the F-35A’s Role in Future Air Combat


      The F-35A Lightning II is a machine of profound dualities: it is at once a technological
      marvel and a cautionary tale of unchecked ambition. On one hand, it has successfully
      delivered a revolutionary capability in stealth and information dominance that
      will form the cornerstone of U.S. and allied air power for decades. Its ability
      to penetrate the most advanced air defenses and act as a “seeing eye” for the
      entire joint force is a capability that no 4th-generation aircraft can replicate.
      However, this was achieved by sacrificing its initial promise of affordability
      and by embracing a level of technological complexity that continues to challenge
      its day-to-day reliability and sustainment.


      The ultimate success of the F-35A will not be measured in the turning performance
      of a dogfight, a scenario it is designed to render obsolete, but in its ability
      to enable and elevate the entire joint force. Its true value lies in its function
      as a survivable, networked sensor and shooter. The critical challenge ahead is
      not in its design philosophy, which has proven potent, but in the monumental task
      of making its operation affordable and sustainable. The program’s ability to solve
      the deeply entrenched problems of high cost-per-flight-hour and low availability
      rates will determine its ultimate legacy.


      It will decide whether the F-35A truly fulfills its intended role as the versatile
      workhorse of 21st-century air combat, or if its expense relegates it to a high-end,
      niche capability used more sparingly than its designers ever intended. The future
      of Western air dominance is inextricably linked to the answer.

    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/the-great-f-35-stealth-fighter-comeback-has-begun-thanks-to-israel/
    text: 'How Israel’s version of the F-35 has made a difference in its attack on Iran


      Starting in the early 2000s, Israel began working towards procuring F-35 jets.
      That country eventually gained permission to customize the jets into a version
      called the F-35I “Adir.” Israel made their first order for the jets in 2010, ordering
      more in 2015 and 2017.


      And now, that jet has played a key part in Israel’s ongoing air campaign in Iran-
      something that seems to have redeemed the F-35’s good name, at a time when some
      have questioned its continued efficacy.


      Business Insider reported that the recent strikes on Iran involved over 200 Israeli
      jets, some of which were the F-35I. According to BI, the strikes in Iran represent
      “the most difficult operations the jet has ever flown in.”


      The Israeli military, per BI, has not commented specifically on the missions in
      which the F-35 was involved. However, Justin Bronk, an airpower expert at the
      London-based Royal United Services Institute, told BI that every indication is
      that “the F-35I has been a critical and highly successful leading edge capability
      in the overall Israeli air campaign at every stage.”


      Custom Jets


      Israel has uniquely customized the jets.


      “The Israeli Air Force is the only foreign service which has gained permission
      to extensively customise the aircraft and integrate indigenous avionics,” Military
      Watch Magazine said in an analysis published this week.


      “This was insisted on by the Israeli Defence Ministry largely due to concerns
      that the F-35’s stealth capabilities could not be relied on exclusively to ensure
      the aircraft’s survivability, as improvements in radar, infrared tracking, and
      data sharing technologies would over the fighter’s lifetime increase adversaries’
      ability to target it.”


      In 2018, Haaretz reported at the time, Israel launched the first-ever air strike
      using an F-35 stealth fighter, during that year’s war in Gaza, in which Iran was
      also involved.


      No Tank Support Needed?


      Meanwhile, a report from The Aviationist stated that those modifications may have
      made it possible to strike Iran without tanker support.


      The Aviationist had previously reported that Israel had a “desire” to modify the
      jets for “extended range capabilities through additional fuel tanks,” although
      it’s not confirmed that Israel has done so successfully. Israel had claimed in
      2022 that its F-35 fleet was capable of reaching Iran without refueling, although
      it’s not clear if that benchmark has been achieved.


      F-35 Mocked by Musk


      Doubts have been raised about the continuing effectiveness of the F-35 in the
      age of drone warfare, including by Elon Musk.


      According to Newsweek, Musk, back in November, ripped the F-35 as “obsolete” and
      a “jack of all trades, master of none.” Those comments came at a time, during
      the presidential transition, when it looked like Musk was going to be a major
      decision maker in the second Trump Administration, which he was, for what turned
      out to be a brief time.


      Newsweek argues that Israel’s usage of the jets in the Iran campaign has proved
      Musk wrong.


      “During Israel’s ongoing offensive against Iran, F-35I Adir fighters—Israel’s
      variant of the American-made stealth jet—have executed dozens of long-range strikes
      against fortified air defense systems, missile sites, and nuclear facilities.
      Israeli officials say the aircraft flew deep into Iranian territory, encountered
      little resistance, and returned without a single recorded loss,” Newsweek said.


      “Those who suggest that uncrewed systems alone can replace what fighter aircraft
      do fundamentally do not understand what makes them such a flexible and potentially
      decisive military tool,” Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United
      Services Institute (RUSI), told Newsweek.


      “It’s one thing to simulate uncrewed aircraft doing dogfighting in a clean, test
      environment,” he said. “It’s another to trust them in the electromagnetic chaos
      of modern combat, where jamming, deception, and dense airspace demand flexibility.”

  - title: The Real Reason Putin Won’t Use Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine
    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/the-real-reason-putin-wont-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine/
    text: 'Key Points – Vladimir Putin is highly unlikely to use nuclear weapons in
      Ukraine, despite his threatening rhetoric and updated nuclear doctrine.


      -The primary constraints are the risk of looking desperate to his own people and,
      crucially, alienating key partners like China, which has repeatedly warned against
      nuclear escalation.


      -Instead, Russia’s strategy has devolved into a war of attrition, relying on overwhelming
      Ukraine with mass conventional strikes from its vast arsenal of drones and missiles.


      -Therefore, the most effective strategy to contain Russia is not fearing its nuclear
      bluff but continuing to bolster Ukraine’s layered and innovative air defense systems
      to neutralize these conventional attacks.


      Vlad Won’t Nuke Ukraine, But Air Defenses Vital to Containment


      Sunday’s barrage of 499 one-way attack drones and missiles launched by Russia
      against Ukraine was yet more retaliation by Putin for Ukraine’s “Operation Spiderweb”
      strategic attack on Russian bombers and bases.


      The volleys have gone from nights with 350 drones and missiles in late May to
      the 479 launches on May 31 and now the peak of 499.


      In this chapter of the war, containing Russia depends on air defenses. Mixed packages
      of drones and missiles have become Putin’s weapon of choice. The pattern for the
      big salvos has been to expend a few dozen missiles combined with hundreds of drones.
      A few missiles are air-launched; for example, a MiG-31K flung out a Kinzhal missile
      in one of the June attacks.


      Nuclear Escalation


      Putin is walloping Ukraine in part because he does not dare use nuclear weapons.


      Of course, Putin wants the world rattled by his nuclear weapons. In September
      2024, Putin oversaw a nuclear doctrine change, seemingly giving himself three
      new scenarios for using nuclear weapons. The first new condition was that “aggression
      against Russia from any non-nuclear state but involving or supported by any nuclear
      state” would be treated like a joint attack. That tried to tie in NATO nuclear
      nations Britain, France, and the US.


      The second new condition was a threat of launch on warning, specifically, “Upon
      receipt of reliable information of a massive launch of air and space attack weapons
      and their crossing of the state border.” Condition three declared that “the case
      when the enemy, using conventional weapons, creates a critical threat to our sovereignty”
      would justify Russian nuclear retaliation.


      Ukraine’s Defense


      Yet these updates actually left Putin plenty of off-ramps. Notice Ukrainian President
      Volodymyr Zelensky was scrupulous in his claim that Ukraine acted alone in crafting
      and carrying out the June 1 drone strike on Russia.


      Despite the doctrinal update, Putin’s hands are tied regarding nuclear retaliation.
      He can’t risk using a tactical nuclear weapon because it will make him look desperate
      in the eyes of the Russian people—and China. Putin’s response so far has been
      to launch mass drone attacks and label the airbase attacks as terrorism. This
      is a proven narrative, echoing Putin’s war against the Chechens, which solidified
      his political power in 2000. Putin downplayed Ukraine’s invasion of the Kursk
      region last year with similar language. His war mythology portrays Russia as “winning”
      even as the number of casualties mounts.


      Putin Against a Chinese Wall


      Beyond this, Putin has known for years that China will not tolerate the use of
      tactical nuclear weapons. China is the top dog in the “unlimited friendship,”
      and Xi Jinping also warned Putin to knock off the nuclear threats as far back
      as November 4, 2022. A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington, DC, repeated the
      warning about “no escalation” last week.


      Russia’s Big Missile Threat


      With nukes off the table, Putin has invested in the rapid production of drones
      to carry out mass conventional attacks.


      According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has a stockpile of over
      13,000 missiles, including roughly 11,000 missiles for the S-300/400 air defense
      systems, which Russia has already used in ground attack mode. Add in 600 Iskander
      ballistic missiles and an estimated 1,700 cruise missiles, including the air-launched
      Kalibr cruise missiles, ground-launched Oniks, and others. At this rate, Putin
      can fire missiles at Ukraine for years as long as Russia can keep producing drones.


      By far, the most considerable volume by type comes from the Shahed 136/131 drones
      of Iran’s design. Russia produces Shahed drones at several locations. Near one
      factory, a freight train from China reportedly delivers drone engine parts each
      week.


      “Russia is willing to sustain the high costs of a prolonged war in Ukraine,” SACEUR
      Gen. Christopher Cavoli warned in his April testimony. “Now entangled in an extended,
      largescale war, the Russian regime has refashioned its military, economic, and
      social structures to sustain what it describes as a long-term confrontation with
      the West—systemic changes that illustrate Russia’s intention to confront us into
      the foreseeable future,” Cavoli said. He estimated Russia can produce 250 Iskanders
      per year.


      Ukrainian intelligence says Putin aims to set a buffer zone along the border and
      reignite a land drive for Kyiv in 2026. Whatever Putin’s gameplan, air defense
      for Ukraine, including its air force bases and energy infrastructure, is essential.
      The combination of the long-range Patriots, short-range NASAMs, and many other
      systems has enabled Ukraine to shoot down the majority of the weapons in Russia’s
      attacks. The Frankensam conversion of the Soviet-era Sa-11 Gadfly launcher, which
      fires US-made AIM-7 type Sparrow air-to-air missiles, is one improvisational success.
      Air defense over Ukraine will remain paramount in containing Putin.

    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/to-beat-china-the-us-must-first-defeat-russia-in-ukraine/
    text: 'As Sir Niall Ferguson has written, it is far too easy to ridicule President
      Trump and his Administration’s statements and policies on Russia’s aggression
      against Ukraine. Worse yet, Trump and those around him continue to make statements
      showing a failure to grasp the most elementary aspects of this war, e.g., that
      it is a war of aggression started by Vladimir Putin.


      Beyond Ukraine: Russia Hides Imperialistic Demands


      Nevertheless, those of us who believe this war engages the vital interests of
      the US and its European allies must continue to attack the “mass mind” of those
      who have argued that this is not our war or that Ukraine “has no cards,” or that
      it cannot win. Neither is it worth waiting for Vladimir Putin to indicate whether
      or not he will negotiate in good faith.


      Here again, the answer is evident to all, for at the most recent session of “talks”
      with Ukraine, the Russian delegation presented what amounts to an ultimatum going
      beyond what it proposed at the original session. It demanded privileged rights
      for the Russian Orthodox Church, a centuries-old avatar of the Russian state’s
      imperialism, the Russian language, and elections as if Ukraine were a conquered
      province. Indeed, American officials expected this presentation.


      Therefore, once again, we must endeavor to set the record straight. First, this
      is not only a war of aggression. Instead, it is an attempted genocide, and one
      cannot negotiate with genocidaires. The abduction of at least twenty thousand
      Ukrainian children, another centuries-old Russian tactic in war, indicates Putin’s
      true aims. Allowing such tactics to continue without punishment invites not just
      more foreign wars but also more genocides, i.e., not a destruction of the international
      order but of the fundamental global moral order.


      And if we speak the complex, cold language of Realpolitik, it is no less vital
      from the standpoint of our geostrategic interests that Russia be defeated. Moscow,
      despite being fully engaged with Ukraine, is now demanding the stationing of 10,000
      troops in Moldova’s breakaway Transnistria province that it controls while also
      trying to destabilize Moldova’s elections and intimidate it into surrender.


      Were Moscow successful in achieving these results in Moldova, a territory that
      it has long coveted, it would hardly stop trying to increase its imperial reach
      at the expense of the Balkan states and European security more generally. Even
      as Russia launched its campaign of intimidation against Moldova, it interfered
      a great deal in Bulgaria, which has undergone eight elections in the last five
      years, in no small measure due to Russian influence activities.


      Expansion Plans


      Neither is the Russian threat confined to the Balkans. Numerous European governments
      and intelligence agencies have publicly voiced fears that because Russia has militarized
      its economy and government, within two-to-10 years, notwithstanding whatever the
      results of the present war are, Russia will be ready to attack them.


      Even as our allies are now making visible progress towards enhancing defense capabilities,
      it is clear that it will take years of careful execution of their defense plans
      for Europe to be able to defend itself without US participation, assuming that
      to be the goal of the Administration. In other words, for the better part of the
      next decade, if not longer, we must be engaged, even if our role diminishes, in
      the defense of Europe.


      Since we fought two world wars and the Cold War primarily to liberate Europe from
      the threat of authoritarian imperialism and geography has not changed, the defense
      of America against a recrudescence of that threat remains among our most vital
      interests.


      This has been a vital interest since the days of the founding fathers, as any
      study of Washington’s foreign policy can tell us. Thomas Jefferson warned, for
      example, that a European empire would make England a “breakfast for Bonaparte”
      and a threat to the fledgling US. Today, allowing Ukraine to become Putin’s lunch
      would similarly threaten all of Europe and call the utility and viability of NATO
      into question.


      But the threat does not end there. Even if China is the primary and pacing threat
      to the US. The best and cheapest way to thwart and deter the China threat is to
      beat Russia, i.e., offer Ukraine constant and unstinting support even as we rebuild
      our defenses.


      Testifying before the US-China Commission, Elena Rybakova reported that without
      Chinese support, Russia could not afford to fight this war. Additionally, Russia
      would lack the necessary technology to conduct such operations. Towards the end
      of the Biden Administration, Secretary of State Blinken remarked about Chinese
      components, “Those are being used to help Russia on what’s an extraordinary crash
      course effort to make more munitions, tanks, armored vehicles, missiles. About
      70% of the machine tools and 90% of the microelectronics Russia imports come from
      China.”


      Thus, this war is arguably, fast becoming a proxy war for China against the West
      and a “reconnaissance in force” to probe the extent of Western fortitude, military
      and diplomatic capabilities. Therefore, the argument that Ukraine should be discarded
      in favor of strong anti-Chinese deterrence falls to the ground. Not only are we
      and our allies sufficiently capable, if motivated, to deter both Beijing and Moscow,
      beating Russia is arguably the best way to beat Beijing.


      Trump and his team may persist in their delusions about not pressuring Putin,
      but if they do, they will soon confront a two-front challenge of even grander
      proportions than is now the case. And they will not be able to claim that they
      were not warned.

    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/russias-su-57-felon-vs-su-57e-what-is-the-difference/
    text: 'Key Points – The Su-57E, Russia’s export variant of its Su-57 “Felon” stealth
      fighter offered to India, differs significantly from the domestic Russian version
      through deep customization aimed at New Delhi’s “Make in India” policy.


      -The most crucial difference is Russia’s unprecedented offer of full access to
      the aircraft’s source code, allowing India to integrate its own domestic avionics,
      such as a main mission computer, and weapon systems like the Astra and Rudram
      missiles.


      -The Su-57E also features an advanced AESA radar with GaN technology, though its
      performance may be subject to Russian export restrictions. This tailored approach
      contrasts sharply with typical Western export models.


      Su-57 Fighter Variants: What are the Differences?


      On June 4, Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (OAK) raised the ante in the Indian
      fighter aircraft competition by making an offer to sell the next-generation aircraft
      to the Indian Air Force (IAF). This entry, however, is not the first time that
      Russia has made an effort to make India a major customer of this program.


      Previously, in 2016, the program was known as the T-50 or PAK-FA, an acronym for
      its Russian program and prototype development phase. At the time, India had entered
      into the first stage of cooperation with Russia on this aircraft, with the version
      for India to be called the Future Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) by the Indian
      Air Force (IAF).


      New Delhi later withdrew from the cooperative agreement after the IAF had complained
      for two years about differences with Russia on several program details. These
      included cost-sharing plans, technology transfers, and the aircraft’s other technological
      shortcomings from India’s perspective. The aircraft India wanted would have been
      an almost entirely different version and would also have been a two-seat platform
      rather than a single-seat fighter.


      So, almost a decade later, Russia is back offering India a similar—but not the
      same—aircraft that shares the same shape and basic performance as the Sukhoi Su-57.
      But it is instead called “Su-57E”.


      What is it about that jet that would make India reconsider this program after
      previously rejecting it? How does the “E” model differ from the baseline Su-57?


      Potential Su-57E Customers


      The “E” suffix in the Su-57E designator literally means “export,” but there is
      the reality that there are a limited number of countries that Moscow would offer
      this fighter to for sale.


      That means that the Su-57E does not have to be designed and configured like a
      United States export F-16—an aircraft that could be “all things to all people.”


      Instead, it can be tailored to be sold to and built by a partner nation, with
      India being the most likely customer to fit the bill. In addition to India, discussions
      have been held about selling the aircraft to Algeria and possibly Iran.


      However, India is probably the only nation that has the industrial capacity on
      a scale that could both support this aircraft and potentially engage in a license-production
      agreement. India has already produced close to 300 Su-30MKIs at its aircraft assembly
      plant in Nashik, and these Indian-built aircraft contain progressively more locally
      made content.


      The only potential candidate with a comparable level of industrial capacity would
      be the People’s Republic of China (PRC). However, Beijing has shown no interest
      in the Su-57E aircraft and is instead focusing on the production of its own indigenously
      developed next-generation fighters.


      The Su-57E, as offered to India, would be procured using a very similar template.
      The aircraft would be modified and built in India, following this model for cooperation.


      How is the Su-57E Different?


      Noticeable differences in the Su-57E as developed for India and the baseline model
      produced for the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) are significant, with the major
      points being:


      – Russia, in its latest offer to India for the Su-57E, has agreed to give India
      full access to the source code of the software modules that are used in the aircraft.
      This will give India the ability to integrate any weapons it wants onto the airframe.
      Su-57Es are, therefore, likely to be carrying a considerable number of non-Russian
      weapons.


      One report on the Su-57E points out that “Indian officials note this [source code]
      latitude eclipses anything previously granted by Western suppliers. The offer
      collides head-on with Washington’s rival F-35A [for India] pitch, sharpening Indo-Pacific
      rivalry.”


      – Indian-made avionics and other onboard systems will replace Russia-made hardware
      in the Su-57E. This would include an Indian Main Mission Computer (MMC) and other
      hardware that would again mirror the type and number of India-produced components
      that are installed in the Su-30MKI. The use of so many Indian-made systems is
      important politically so that Moscow is compliant with New Delhi’s mandated “Make-in-India”
      requirement in its weapon systems procurement processes.


      – The Su-57E features low observability modifications to the surface of the aircraft,
      supercruise capacity, plus advanced sensor fusion. The version being proposed
      to India also includes an Active Electronically-Scanning Array (AESA) radar based
      on Gallium Nitride (GaN) Transmit and Receive Modules (TRMs). The TRMs may be
      software-limited in their terms of range and the variety of modes, as they must
      comply with Russian export restrictions.


      – The Su-57E would also employ Indian-designed munitions such as the Astra Mk1
      and Mk2 beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missiles, the Rudram anti-radiation
      missile, and an indigenously-produced precision-guided air-to-ground weapons.
      India’s goal here is to reduce its dependency on foreign-supplied weaponry.


      One of the rationales behind the Su-57E appears to be that the use of foreign-made
      onboard systems and weapons in the export version provides some relief for the
      Russian industry. OAK has its own troubles building enough of the aircraft to
      meet Moscow’s own requirements.


      Using an export customer to build a significant number of onboard systems enables
      Russia to sell the aircraft abroad in quantities that its own industry would not
      be capable of achieving on its own.

    text: 'Russia Offers India Full Access Source Code of Su-57E: Russia is putting
      the Su-57 on the international market and is offering India a significant deal
      to forge a new partnership and move India away from the US.


      Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation made a bold proposal to India on June 4.
      Moscow offered India the Su-57E stealth fighter and full access to its source
      code.


      Providing India with this access would enable it to integrate home-grown avionics
      and weapons under its ‘Make in India’ initiative. Indian officials note this latitude
      eclipses anything previously granted by Western suppliers. The offer collides
      head-on with Washington’s rival F-35A pitch, sharpening Indo-Pacific rivalry.


      Meet Russia’s Su-57E


      Russia’s Su-57 Felon, its first fifth-generation fighter, blends stealth features
      with traditional Russian emphasis on supermaneuverability for close-quarters combat.


      The Felon incorporates design elements such as internal weapons bays and radar-absorbent
      materials to reduce its frontal radar cross-section; however, its overall stealth,
      particularly from the rear, is considered significantly inferior to that of US
      counterparts like the F-22 and F-35.


      The Su-57 has been used sparingly in the war against Ukrainian defenses, primarily
      as a long-range strike aircraft rather than a dogfighter, which would have subjected
      it to Ukrainian anti-aircraft defenses.


      Production has been a significant issue for Russia’s manufacturing industry. Thus
      far, they have only been able to manufacture about 20 Su-57s for the Russian Aerospace
      Forces. The question remains: how could they supply India with the means to deploy
      enough aircraft to provide their air force with the necessary number of aircraft?


      Russia’s Bold Pitch To India


      Russia’s offer, considered a game-changer by many experts, would allow India to
      customize the aircraft entirely, adding its own weapons and systems. Such deep
      access is rarely granted and extends far beyond what countries like the US or
      France typically allow when selling their fighters.


      Indian defense sources indicate that the Su-57E fighter jet being offered to India
      will feature advanced technology that matches the planned upgrades for its Su-30
      MKI aircraft.


      The proposed version for India includes an AESA radar utilizing Gallium Nitride
      (GaN) technology and an Indian-developed mission computer.


      Moreover, the Su-57E would be capable of operating Indian-designed munitions such
      as the Astra Mk1 and Mk2 beyond-visual-range missiles, Rudram anti-radiation missiles,
      and indigenous precision-guided air-to-ground weapons, reducing India’s dependency
      on foreign-supplied weaponry.


      Russia has offered the Su-57E to a few countries with close military and strategic
      ties, such as Algeria, Myanmar, and Vietnam. However, thus far, no country has
      initiated a deal with Russia.


      US Urges India to Cut Ties To Russian Aircraft Deal


      The US is exerting pressure on New Delhi to curb its continued procurement of
      Russian defense equipment, a point of contention between India and the US that
      has been a leading issue since the first Donald Trump administration.


      US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick on June 4 stated, while addressing the
      eighth U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, that President Trump had explicitly
      raised the issue, saying:


      “There were certain things that the Indian government did that generally rubbed
      the United States the wrong way. For instance, you generally buy your military
      gear from Russia. That’s a way to get under the skin of America if you’re going
      to buy your armaments from Russia.”


      He added that India’s participation in the BRICS group, which challenged the US
      dollar’s status in the global economy, was “not really the way to make friends
      and influence people in America.”


      When President Trump welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White
      House in February, he announced that the United States would make the F-35 fighter
      jet available to India. However, to date, India has not expressed interest in
      purchasing the American fighter.


      It is expected that India will finalize a deal with Russia very shortly. India’s
      small air force is reeling from losses of French-supplied Rafale fighters in early
      May during engagements with Pakistan’s Chinese-supplied combat aircraft. It is
      expected to add urgency to consider Russia’s Su-57 if production can be worked
      out for India’s Air Force.


      That is an issue that must be resolved as soon as possible. Russia, thus far,
      has only been able to supply a handful of aircraft to its own Air Force.

    url: https://www.19fortyfive.com/2025/06/beyond-the-bomb-is-irans-diplomatic-pivot-changing-its-nuclear-calculus/
    text: 'Iran is facing crunch time on its continued talks with the United States
      over a potential new deal regarding its nuclear program.


      Iran’s Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araqchi said on June 4 that if Iran is not
      allowed to continue to enrich uranium, then it would not agree to a deal with
      Washington. This statement came after five rounds of indirect talks with the Trump
      administration. Oman mediates the talks.


      Iran’s Agenda


      The larger agenda of Iran in the deal talks extends beyond its nuclear program.
      Iran has been down this path before with the Obama administration. For Tehran,
      it was always about preserving its larger ambitions in the region and globally.
      The nuclear program is a prestige issue for Iran, as Araqchi made clear in a social
      media post on June 4.


      However, it’s only part of the Iranian agenda. The larger agenda was laid out
      in May in Moscow by Ali Akbar Ahmadian, Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security
      Council. He spoke about how “new opportunities have arisen for the creation of
      a new world order.” This isn’t the first time Iran or Russia have talked about
      a shifting global order.


      In October 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Iranian President Ebrahim
      Raisi, not Masoud Pezeshkian, and also spoke of a “new world order” in Ashgabat,
      Turkmenistan. Russia is the stronger partner in the Iranian-Russia relationship.
      However, both countries are today only part of a larger puzzle in terms of their
      drive for this new global order.


      For instance, both are now members of BRICS, which brings together several non-Western
      powers in an economic bloc. In 2022, Russia’s State Duma speaker suggested that
      Iran could become an observer at the post-Soviet Collective Security Treaty Organization,
      which brings together Russia and several former Soviet Republics. Iran has also
      joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which was founded by China in 2001
      and now has ten member states.


      Iran’s global ambitions today are more clear than in the past. It has sought to
      entrench relations with China and Russia. It has also increased its outreach to
      Turkey, Pakistan, and India in recent years. As Iran shifted gears towards these
      countries, it also saw its influence in the Middle East weaken.


      For instance, the war launched by Hamas on October 7, 2023, led Iran to encourage
      Hezbollah and other proxies, such as the Houthis, to strike at Israel. In this
      multi-front war, Israel has gained the upper hand.


      Hezbollah was weakened and battered into a ceasefire in November 2024. The Assad
      regime in Syria, a key ally of Iran, fell on December 8, 2024. The Houthis continue
      to target Israel, but it appears a deal with the US in early May could pave the
      way for some de-escalation in the Red Sea.


      What matters here is that Iran is no longer on the upswing in terms of regional
      influence in the Middle East as it was when it signed the original JCPOA Iran
      deal back in 2015. Today, Iran has amicable ties with Saudi Arabia. It also sees
      its future in relations with countries in Asia.


      This includes conducting outreach to countries with which Iran has historically
      had colder ties, such as Egypt. Iran’s foreign minister recently flew to Cairo
      to strengthen those relations. What this means is that Iran is spreading its diplomatic
      wings outside of its role in backing Shi’ite militia proxies. It’s now involved
      in larger state-to-state relations.


      This practice is prominently featured in Iranian state media, with numerous articles
      highlighting Iranian diplomatic outreach. For instance, Iran’s president spoke
      with the sultan of Oman on June 4. Iran’s powerful and influential Parliament
      Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf visited Venezuela on June 3, where he met with
      Venezuelan Transport Minister Ramon Velasquez. The countries have a joint economic
      commission, Iranian state media IRNA noted. Qalibaf also visited Cuba as part
      of his trip to the region and discussed strengthening ties.


      The picture that is emerging is clear. Iran may be able to be more flexible on
      the nuclear file, as it feels it has strengthened its global ties. Although it
      saw the wings of its proxies clipped in the Middle East, it may feel the era of
      the proxies is now moving towards a kind of sunset. The proxies will remain important.
      However, Tehran may now feel it has the luxury and breathing space to invest in
      bigger plans.


      This enables it to connect with markets ranging from Russia to the Persian Gulf
      and from China to Egypt. Iran has plans for additional north-south economic corridors,
      for instance, linking the Caucasus to the Gulf, as well as Central Asia to Tehran.
      Closer cooperation with Pakistan, which is also a friend of Turkey, could lead
      to ties that link Ankara to Islamabad, as well as Tehran.


      In the Middle East, many countries, including traditional Western allies, are
      hedging their bets on this emerging new world order. What that means is that Egypt,
      Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others want to be part of non-Western economic blocs
      while maintaining their alliances or partnerships with the US and the West.


      Iran wants to be well placed to exploit this, with or without a nuclear deal.

    text: Diesel Submarines for the US Navy? The US Navy invented the nuclear-powered
      submarine. The first of these was the USS Nautilus (SSN-571), which was commissioned
      in 1954 and began sea trials in 1955.  The following year the sub ran a series
      of test exercises to determine if the anti-submarine warfare tactics used during
      World War […] The post Russia Freaks as Navy Considers Stealth Diesel Submarines

    one_sentence_summary: The US Navy is considering the development of stealth diesel
      submarines that could silently disrupt enemy fleets, prompting concern from Russia.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the U.S. Navy's consideration of stealth
      diesel submarines, a significant shift from its historical reliance on nuclear-powered
      submarines, which began with the commissioning of the USS Nautilus in 1954. The
      potential development of these diesel submarines, capable of operating silently
      and effectively in anti-submarine warfare, has raised concerns in Russia, as they
      could pose a serious threat to enemy fleets without detection. The move reflects
      a strategic adaptation in naval warfare capabilities amidst evolving global military
      dynamics.
