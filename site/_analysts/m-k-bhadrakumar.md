  **Geops Report – July 3, 2025**
  
  **Context:**  
  The Middle East remains at the center of global geopolitical tensions, with the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, shifting U.S. policy under President Trump, and evolving European and Russian positions. Recent weeks have seen military escalations, diplomatic maneuvering, and renewed debate over Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
  
  **Key Developments:**
  
  **1. Russia-France Dialogue Signals Shift in Western Approach**  
  In a notable diplomatic development, Russian President Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron held their first direct conversation since September 2022. According to **M. K. Bhadrakumar**, the two-hour call on July 1, 2025, marks a potential thaw in Russia-France relations and reflects a broader recognition among Western leaders that efforts to isolate Russia over Ukraine have faltered. The leaders discussed the Middle East, particularly Iran’s nuclear program, and agreed on the importance of diplomatic solutions and upholding Iran’s rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, their positions on Ukraine remain divergent, with Macron facing both international and domestic pressures. This engagement suggests a trend toward re-engagement and reevaluation of Western strategies, with possible implications for European security architecture.
  
  **2. U.S. Policy on Iran: Pressure for Diplomacy Over Military Action**  
  The U.S. political landscape is increasingly focused on the Iran nuclear issue, especially following recent comments by President Trump and criticism from Democratic lawmakers. **M. K. Bhadrakumar** notes that Trump, under pressure from both domestic critics and international allies such as Israel, has publicly rejected negotiations with Iran and emphasized a hardline stance. However, voices like Senator Chris Coons are urging a return to diplomacy and warning against military escalation, stressing the need for congressional authorization for any military action. The prevailing view among analysts is that Trump’s options are narrowing, with diplomatic engagement seen as the more sustainable path—especially as military action could have significant repercussions for his political legacy and the upcoming U.S. mid-term elections.
  
  **3. Implications and Trends**  
  The recent Russia-France dialogue and the U.S. debate over Iran policy both point toward a gradual shift from confrontation to cautious re-engagement. As **Bhadrakumar** observes, there is growing recognition in Western capitals that isolating Russia and relying on military solutions in the Middle East are proving ineffective. The consensus among independent analysts is that diplomatic solutions, particularly regarding Iran’s nuclear program, are gaining traction, even as hardline rhetoric persists. The evolving situation suggests a period of recalibration in international alliances and strategies, with the potential for new diplomatic initiatives and realignments in the months ahead.
  
  **Expected Outcomes:**  
  - Increased diplomatic activity between Russia, Europe, and the U.S. on Middle East security and the Iran nuclear issue.
  - Continued debate within the U.S. over the balance between military pressure and diplomatic engagement with Iran.
  - Potential for renewed multilateral talks and a gradual easing of tensions, though significant obstacles remain, particularly regarding Ukraine and Israel-Iran hostilities.
  
  **Geops Report will continue to monitor these developments as the situation evolves.**

    text: 'Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) with French President Emmanuel Macron
      in talks in Kremlin early February 2022, Moscow


      France seeks a role in Iran situation


      On July 1, did you hear the crunching sound of ice cracking on the frozen lake
      of Russia-France ties? President Vladimir Putin’s decision to take a phone call
      on that day from his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, for the first time since
      September 2022, signifies that the western narrative to ‘erase’ Russia in the
      proxy war in Ukraine has comprehensively unravelled.


      That narrative, aimed at casting an enemy image of Russia, was pivoted on a bizarre
      thought process that Kremlin intended to invade Europe, but now it serves no purpose
      as the principal protagonists of the proxy war in the collective west — US, UK,
      France and Germany — realise that the war has been irretrievably lost and it is
      about time to move on.


      The first sign of it appeared at the recent G-7, NATO summits last month. Following
      up on the tiding from the NATO Summit, Putin has since green lighted a Russian-American
      Summit in the near future, something that President Trump has been seeking. (See
      my blog Trump nudges Europe to ease off on Russia, Deccan Herald, June 1, 2025.)


      Now, it is Macron’s turn to synchronise his watch. There are rumours that German
      Chancellor may follow Macron’s footfalls very soon.


      Evidently, Putin and Macron see the need to re-engage to bring Russian-French
      ties to a new normalcy. There is growing realisation that Russia’s demand to negotiate
      a security architecture for Europe, which was one of the core demands of the Kremlin
      while opting for the special military operations in Ukraine in February 2022,
      is showing signs of slowly, steadily gaining traction with Trump. He is unilaterally
      begun relaxing some financial sanctions on Russia which would also mean that he
      is taking control of European Union’s reckless moves on Russia. May be this surmise
      is looking beyond the curve, but it is only logical.


      From the Russian readout of the Putin-Macron conversation, it emerges that the
      discussion devolved upon two topics — the critical Middle East situation and the
      Ukraine war. The two-hour long discussion certainly went beyond an in-depth exchange.


      The Russian readout adopts a positive note on the whole that apropos the Middle
      East situation at least, despite the past discord and acrimony, the two countries
      may find convergence in regard of the Iran situation in the wake of the US strike
      insofar as they “bore a particular responsibility for upholding peace and security”
      in West Asia as permanent members of the UN Security Council “as well as for preserving
      the global non-proliferation regime.”


      Significantly, the two leaders “noted that respecting Tehran’s legitimate right
      to develop peaceful nuclear technology and continue fulfilling its obligations
      under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which includes cooperating
      with the IAEA, was crucial.” This is a steady Russian position with which France
      seems to concur.


      The conversation was timely because the E-3 [France, Britain and Germany] now
      have to notify to the UN Security Council if they intend to invoke the so-called
      ‘snapback mechanism’ to reimpose the sanctions regime on Iran [on the plea that
      Iran has violated the provisions of the JCOPA] as the 2015 accord itself is set
      to expire in October. Time is running out.


      The peculiarity of the ‘snapback mechanism’ is that it is immune to veto by any
      permanent member (in this case, Russia or China.) Ironically, this unusual idea
      was the brainwave of the Russian negotiators as a guarantee to Europeans that
      Iran intended to observe in letter and spirit the JCPOA during the ten-year period
      ahead till October this year.


      The US is no longer qualified to invoke the JCPOA and it is a tough call for E-3
      in today’s circumstances as Iran may altogether quit the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
      Treaty [NPT] if push comes to shove so that it is no longer answerable to the
      UN.


      The wording of the Russian readout — “for preserving the global non-proliferation
      regime” — is an indication that Russia and France have an abiding interest in
      Iran continuing as an NPT member. The big question is, are we getting a glimpse
      of a possible solution to the problem based on some sort of flexibility on the
      part of the US to concede Iran’s right to enrich uranium?


      Such a possibility cannot be ruled out although Israel won’t give up on its maximalist
      stance that Iran should not have any rights to enrich uranium, no matter the NPT.


      The bottom line is that Russia and France have underscored the imperative of “settling
      the crisis around Iran’s nuclear programme and any other differences arising in
      the Middle East exclusively via political and diplomatic means.” Putin and Macron
      have an understanding to “maintain contact in order to coordinate their stances
      if necessary” in the current volatility where there are moving parts.


      Interestingly, on the day before the conversation with Putin, Macron had a call
      with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian where he expressed concern over Tehran’s
      decision to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.


      As regards the Ukraine war, Russian and French positions remain miles apart. That
      is only to be expected. Putin is unlikely to shift, as the wording of the readout
      emphatically states. Anyway, Russia counts on the US as its principal interlocutor
      . And the disclosure that the US arms supplies for Ukraine have virtually stopped
      is a powerful signal to Europeans to rethink on their own commitments.


      Macron finds himself at a loose end, as never before in recent years. The Franco-German
      axis no longer works in the European Union. Macron has drawn close to the UK PM
      Keir Starmer but the latter himself is grappling with withering criticism within
      the Labour Party that his excessive involvement in Ukraine has been at the cost
      of neglect of domestic issues. Labour Party now trails behind Nigel Farage’s populist
      Reform UK in opinion polls.


      At any rate, Starmer has given up on the crazy idea of a “coalition of the willing”
      to carry on with the Ukraine war even without the US. That leaves Macron in the
      lurch in the middle of nowhere, with Trump keeping him at arm’s length. On the
      sidelines of the G-7 Summit, Trump publicly ridiculed Macron. There are incipient
      signs that France is already beating the retreat on Ukraine war. Putin understands
      all this, but he didn’t show it.


      Putin and Macron go back a long way. But they seem to have decided to forget that
      as recently as in March they were calling each other names.

    text: 'Funeral ceremony for military commanders and nuclear scientists martyred
      during Israel’s 12-day war, Tehran, June 28, 2025


      Trump flip-flops on Iran, again. Why?


      The US President Donald Trump’s latest Truth Social post yesterday on Iran nuclear
      issue reads as follows: “Tell phony Democrat Senator Chris Coons that I am not
      offering Iran ANYTHING, unlike Obama, who paid them $Billions under the stupid
      “road to a Nuclear Weapon JCPOA (which would now be expired!), nor am I even talking
      to them since we totally OBLITERATED their Nuclear Facilities.”


      Trump’s post suggests that the Iran question threatens to move to the centre court
      of American party politics. Trump is upset by Senator Coon’s criticism, who is
      a senior lawmaker in the Senate from Delaware (Joe Biden’s ‘eyes and years’, as
      New York Times once put it) for the past 15 years.


      Interestingly, Senator Coon is an ordained elder with West Presbyterian Church,
      who continues to preach regularly at houses of worship across Delaware and, importantly,
      is committed to bipartisan engagement in politics aiming to bring Americans of
      all backgrounds, faiths, and political parties together through a celebration
      of spirituality and prayer. Coon has an evangelical base, regularly participates
      in the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast, and is one opposition politician who can
      attract a hefty breakaway wing of MAGA movement if it were to splinter over Trump’s
      abandonment of campaign pledge on farewell to arms.


      Coon has trenchantly criticised Trump’s handling of the Iran question. In doing
      so, he aligned with four other senior Democratic senators — Senate Minority Leader
      Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Senate Appropriations Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-Wash.),
      Senate Armed Services Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Senate Intelligence
      Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.)


      They have issued a statement on the Iran question on June 18 which argued that:
      1. The eruption of Israel-Iran conflict represented “a dangerous escalation that
      risks igniting a broader regional war” 2. Trump should “prioritise diplomacy and
      pursue a binding agreement that can prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. 3. Trump should
      not expand US engagement in the war, given the “lack of preparation, strategy,
      and clearly defined objectives, and the enormous risk to Americans and civilians
      in the region.” 4. Trump administration is yet to provide answers to fundamental
      questions, such as


      Intelligence Community’s current assessment of Iran’s nuclear program, its leaders’
      intent, and its capabilities;


      the objective of US military intervention in Iran, especially Trump’s call for
      “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” by Iran;


      the estimated scope and duration of any US military campaign;


      the risk to US forces across its bases in the region;


      evacuation plans for US citizens; and, most important,


      the constitutional or statutory authority that would underpin the military intervention.


      On the last point, in a stinging rebuke, the five senators reminded Trump that
      “Congress is an equal partner in preserving and defending US national security
      around the world, and Congress has not provided authorisation for military action
      against Iran… The United States cannot sleepwalk into a third war in as many decades.
      Congress has a critical role to play in this moment.”


      Trump is unused to checks and balances. What made Trump particularly furious would
      be that Sen. Coon also happens to be a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
      committee and a staunch supporter of Israel and a guest speaker at AIPAC events.


      Coon is an interesting politician who can take bold positions. Last year, for
      example, he opposed a resolution proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders that would
      have applied human rights norms to US assistance for Israel, while on the other
      hand, urging the Biden administration to recognise a “non-militarised” Palestinian
      state after the end of the Gaza war!


      The bottom line is that a groundswell of opinion is building up in the US, reminiscent
      of the undercurrents after President Kennedy’s assassination that eventually swept
      America as Lyndon Johnson accelerated the Vietnam War, ultimately turning it into
      a tsunami that forced him to retire from politics.


      In reality, Trump’s options are limited. He is insisting that the air strikes
      of June 22 “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites. That is to say, the Iranian bomb
      is no longer a compelling reality.


      On the other hand, Israel is mighty upset that Iran has given it such a battering
      that its economy is in shambles and it cannot hope to take on Iran directly. It
      expects the US to do the heavy lifting, which, to my mind — and, perhaps, special
      envoy Steve Witkoff’s mind too— Trump is loathe to do. (More about Witkoff later.)


      If Trump embarks on the war path regardless, he needs a mandate from the UN Security
      Council and the US Congress. But neither is likely forthcoming. That aside, if
      Iran inflicts serious damage to the US interests in a military confrontation,
      it can potentially become a hot button issue in the mid-term elections next year
      that could mean an ignominious end to MAGA movement and Trump’s legacy.


      What is the alternative? I would go back to Trump’s default position and do ground
      work to negotiate the so-called Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which Witkoff had
      promised as recently as last week in a CNBC interview.


      Trump should have known that Iran’s political rhetoric at the level of the Supreme
      Leader is mostly meant for the domestic audience of observant Muslims. Any Iran
      expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft could have compiled
      a list of past instances in such volatile moments in the US-Iran standoff during
      the past 47 years and someone in the White House could have prepare a bulky document
      and got Trump to glance through it.


      The problem with the White House all along has been that it eats out of Israeli
      hands — with a new exceptions such as Barack Obama. But that habit is no longer
      viable, since a point has come when the US and Israeli interests no longer converge.


      Simply put, Trump had no conceivable reason to name calling Grand Ayatollah Ali
      Khamenei on the eve of the funeral ceremony for top military commanders and nuclear
      scientists martyred during Israel’s 12-day war against Iran, which he could not
      even attend due to security considerations.


      What would Trump have done in a similar situation at the Cathedral Church of Saint
      Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Episcopal Diocese of Washington if body bags
      were to arrive from Middle East? A Fox News interview? A post on Truth Special?


      Life moves on. Trump should return to a priori history and let Witkoff negotiate
      the agreement that he promised. Let things cool down meanwhile through the multiple
      back channels that are available.

    text: 'America’s peacemaking president Donald Trump emerges out of White House after
      wrapping up a ceasefire in the war in West Asia, heading for the Netherlands for
      the 2025 NATO Summit that marks a consolidation of the western alliance system
      under US leadership, Washington, DC, June 23, 2025


      Trump won’t brook opposition to peace talks with Iran


      As the 12-day war ends in the Middle East, it is abundantly clear that the conflict
      erupted almost entirely due to Israel’s plan to undermine the US-Iran talks. Israel
      feared that fundamentally, both Washington and Tehran sought an improvement of
      relations, which would be a historic reconciliation ushering in a New Middle East,
      where its regional hegemony would be at risk.


      The destruction of Iraq and Syria testifies to what extent Israel would go to
      pin down the US foreign policy strategy to the old groove despite nagging awareness
      in Washington’s thoughtful circles, including the CIA, over the years that without
      addressing the Iran question, American diplomacy in West Asia would remain sub-optimal.


      Barack Obama realised this but wouldn’t take the bull by its horns. Joe Biden
      also knew this but became a victim of the Russophobia that warped his thinking,
      and Iran got relegated to the back burner. Things were in drift until the October
      7 attacks on Israel. The rest is history.


      Donald Trump, on the other hand, is clear-headed that he has three major foreign
      policy challenges to be sorted out in the four years ahead — Russia, Iran and
      China. Arguably, he prefers to handle the three areas sequentially but also realises
      that is not feasible or even advisable.


      Thus, Trump found himself reopening the Iran file. Paradoxically, he saw Iran
      reconciliation as a low-hanging fruit, although it is an incredibly complicated
      issue where memory mixes with desire.


      The mitigating factor is that although the US’ capacity to influence the region’s
      politics is in decline and interventionism no longer an option, West Asia has
      transformed beyond recognition during the four years he was out of power. Trump
      feels emboldened that Iran has much greater acceptability in its neighbourhood
      than ever before and this allows out-of-the-box solutions.


      The nomination of Steve Witkoff as special envoy for Middle East was the first
      sure sign that Trump was aiming at a paradigm shift on a grand scale where Iran
      nuclear issue was only one segment. Indeed, it is a stunning turnaround that Trump
      sees potential to tap into normalisation with Iran to create synergy for ‘America
      First’.


      Trump sees that American interests are best served through Iran’s integration
      into the Western market. He is shrewd enough to assess that basically, Iran’s
      elites (and the influential Tehran bazaar) desired good relations with the US.
      The election of Masoud Pezeshkian as president was an affirmation of the national
      mood and the religious establishment’s refusal to block his ascendance was a massive
      signal that winds of change were sweeping over Iran.


      When I visited Iran to observe the presidential election last year, it was apparent
      that Iran was not only ready for reconciliation with the US but also favoured
      Trump to emerge in the November election, the consensus opinion being that they
      could do business with the billionaire-businessman president. It, actually, left
      me wondering at times whether Iranian elites were already quietly talking to Trump’s
      circle.


      When I returned from Tehran, I wrote in the wake of Pezeshkian’s victory, that
      we should anticipate a ‘Look West’ shift in Iran’s foreign policy strategy.


      However, Israel refuses to budge from its maximalist stance that Iran should capitulate
      — ie., not only surrender its rights to enrich uranium but must roll back its
      conventional deterrent capability as well. Predictably, it turned out to be the
      deal breaker in Witkoff’s negotiations.


      To my mind, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites and Iran’s acquiescence thereof
      has since cut this Gordian knot so that talks can be resumed after the 12-day
      interruption! One crucial detail here, unreported by the Western press, is that
      days before the US strike, Iran’s foreign ministry had already announced the transfer
      of enriched uranium from the nuclear sites!


      Suffice it to say, Iran is not contesting Trump’s triumphant claim that the US
      “obliterated” the nuclear programme. The word play reminds me that the US-Iranian
      standoff all along has had traits of a pantomime of love-hate between an estranged
      couple.


      Trump couldn’t care less anymore about the Israeli demand for Iran’s ‘de-nuclearisation’
      and ‘de-militarisation.’ Certainly, he has no time for Netanyahu’s agenda to force
      a regime collapse in Iran or a break-up of Iran along ethnic lines, etc. Trump
      pins hopes on a grand bargain with Iran as partner in America First.


      While for Netanyahu, this war is an extension of the so-called Greater Israel
      project, there isn’t a shred of evidence that Trump is a votary of Zionism. The
      plain truth is: Israel has taken a beating from Iran like it never took in its
      entire life story. Israel’s missile stockpiles, especially interceptors, have
      been depleted and the US has only limited capacity to replenish, while Iran still
      has a vast stockpile of tens of thousands of missiles.


      Israel’s much-vaunted air defence capability turned out to be dysfunctional in
      combat conditions. And, Trump will not hesitate to browbeat Netanyahu if push
      comes to shove. By now, Netanyahu would knows pretty much about Trump’s explosive
      fury littered with expletives if provoked.


      Evidently, Trump also feels the imperative need to preserve the backing of the
      MEGA movement, his core political constituency, which is anchored on his vociferous
      commitment as a peacemaking president who will never allow another interventionist
      war abroad. Therefore, the bottom line is that the ceasefire should hold rather
      well. Don’t worry!


      The message from the 2025 NATO Summit in the Netherlands is that the entire western
      world has rallied behind Trump. Possibly, Russia and China also see these geopolitical
      realities, which may explain the belated decisions by Putin and Xi Jinping to
      skip the upcoming BRICS summit in Brazil.


      I expect US-Iran talks to begin any day. There is a sense of urgency on both sides,
      as evident from Trump’s announcement waiving sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and
      specifically allowing China to buy Iranian oil.


      Trump is pacifying Tehran so that oil flows smoothly through the Strait of Hormuz.
      But the main thing about Trump’s announcement is that he justified it by saying
      Iran needs money for its reconstruction after the war and oil exports should help!


      We should anticipate a big Saudi role going forward. That is the impression I
      get from Pezeshkian’s conversation with Saudi Crown Prime Mohammed bin Salman.
      They see in MBS a visionary. Tehran wants MBS to come on board Iran’s normalisation
      process with the US so that it gains in gravitas.


      This is Persian ingenuity at its best for the remaking of ‘Muslim West Asia’,
      putting behind the tragic history of Shia-Sunni sectarian divides created by foreigners,
      which pitted Muslims against Muslims.


      What is there in all this for Trump himself? To be sure, Trump and Witkoff envisage
      that economic cooperation with Iran will be a game changer for America First.
      As a potential energy supplier for Europe to replace Russian oil, Iran’s integration
      will help Europe’s economic revival, which boosts US’ pre-eminence on the global
      stage.


      With a hugely successful NATO Summit wrapped up at the Netherlands, Trump is preparing
      to end the 47-year old rift with Iran to pave the way for a New West Asia. This
      week must be counted as the finest hour of Trump’s five-month old presidency.
      Trump is closer than ever to claim the Nobel as America’s peacemaking president.

    paragraph_summary: 'In a significant diplomatic development, President Donald Trump
      has successfully brokered a ceasefire in the recent 12-day conflict in West Asia,
      primarily driven by Israel''s concerns over US-Iran negotiations. As he heads
      to the 2025 NATO Summit in the Netherlands, Trump is focused on addressing three
      major foreign policy challenges: Russia, Iran, and China, with a particular emphasis
      on reconciling with Iran, which he views as a potential ally in advancing American
      interests. Despite Israel''s maximalist demands for Iran''s de-nuclearization,
      Trump appears willing to overlook these in favor of a broader partnership that
      could integrate Iran into the Western market and stabilize the region. His administration
      is already taking steps to ease sanctions on Iranian oil exports, signaling a
      shift towards normalization. This approach not only aims to enhance US geopolitical
      standing but also seeks to foster economic cooperation that could benefit Europe
      and reshape Middle Eastern dynamics, marking a pivotal moment in Trump''s presidency
      and positioning him as a peacemaking leader on the global stage.'

    text: 'Russian President Vladimir Putin received Iran’s foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi,
      Kremlin, June 23, 2025


      The former President and Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev
      who is one of the most authoritative voices in the Kremlin, wrote on the Telegram
      channel on June 23 a critique on the Middle East crisis following the US attack
      on Iran’s three key nuclear sites of Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.


      Medvedev listed ten points, which, taken together, messaged that Russia’s stance
      on the developing situation around Iran has markedly shifted to one of proactive
      mode marked by profound scepticism and deep concern about President Donald Trump’s
      intentions.


      As recently as on June 4, Trump had sought Putin’s help to advance the US-Iran
      negotiations on the nuclear issue and Putin, in good faith, agreed to help. Indeed,
      the Iranian government spokesperson had disclosed on June 12 that preparations
      were under way for a visit by Putin to Tehran.


      But on June 22, Trump ordered the air strike on Iran’s three nuclear sites without
      taking Putin into confidence. Such surreptitious behaviour may be nothing new
      to Washington in inter-state relationships but it caused embarrassment to the
      Kremlin. Medvedev’s comments show it when he ridicules Trump’s triumphalism about
      the air strike.


      Medvedev listed ten points under the heading What did the Americans achieve with
      their night strike on three points in Iran? They underscore that Russia’s stance
      on the developing situation around Iran has shifted to one of unequivocally distancing
      itself from the US approach going forward. The 10 points are:


      Quote.


      The critical infrastructure of the nuclear cycle, apparently, was not damaged
      or was damaged only slightly. The enrichment of nuclear materials, and now we
      can say directly – and future production of nuclear weapons — will continue. A
      number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their nuclear weapons.
      Israel is under attack, explosions are thundering, people are in a panic. The
      United States is drawn into a new conflict with the prospect of a ground operation.
      The political regime of Iran is preserved, and with a high degree of probability
      it has become stronger. The people are consolidating around the spiritual leadership,
      and even those who did not sympathize with him. Trump, who came as a peacemaker
      president, started a new war for the United States. The absolute majority of countries
      in the world are against the actions of Israel and the United States. With such
      success, Trump will never see the Nobel Peace Prize, even despite all the venality
      of this nomination. A good start, congratulations, Mr. President!


      Unquote.


      On the whole, Medvedev’s assessment is in sync with the swathe of opinion among
      neutral observers, including Western analysts, about the state of play. However,
      Points 2 and 3 stand out as particularly noteworthy in their prognosis that inexorably,
      Iran has now been pushed into a path of making the nuclear bomb and, more importantly,
      Tehran can expect help in this direction from “a number of countries (who) are
      ready to directly supply Iran with their nuclear weapons.”


      This is the first time that Russia has explicitly spoken about Iran’s likely ‘nuclearisation’.
      That in itself is a paradigm shift. Medvedev has approvingly presented it in a
      marked departure from Russia’s stated affirmations in the past that Iran’s nuclear
      programme is for peaceful purposes. Russia has been historically a cornerstone
      of the nuclear non-proliferation regime.


      Three things have changed. First, the US itself has become a proliferator. In
      Europe, the US’s allies freely fly its planes fitted with nuclear bombs during
      exercises. German pilots have familiarised themselves with such planes. In Asia-Pacific,
      AUKUS alliance actually involves transfer of nuclear weapon technology to Australia,
      which is technically an NPT member.


      Second, when it comes to Iran, a key ally of Russia, the US aggression has crossed
      Iran’s “big red line” — to borrow the words of foreign minister Abbas Araghchi
      — which leaves Tehran with no alternative but to act in self-defence. Besides,
      in the ‘rules-based order’ imposed by the US on Iran, its own ally Israel, a non-NPT
      member country, has a fully-developed clandestine nuclear weapon programme and
      is estimated to have a stockpile of some 200 nuclear missiles but all that Trump
      blithely ignores.


      Third, things have come to such a pass today that smaller countries must nuclearise
      in the quickest way possible, which is their only iron-clad guarantee to preserve
      their sovereignty and territorial integrity from the US attacks in the chaotic
      international situation today. North Korea’s success in pushing back US pressure
      is due to its nuclear deterrent capability. What is absolutely galling is that
      Trump has not even cared to seek a mandate from the UN Security Council and has
      gone to war with Iran without getting Congressional approval.


      Evidently, Medvedev’s commentary pooh-poohs the pious hopes in Washington and
      Tel Aviv about forcing a ‘regime change’ in Iran. Medvedev assertively proclaims
      that not only has Iran’s political system become stronger but “people are consolidating
      around the spiritual leadership” including elements that “did not sympathise with
      him” previously.


      Russia shares the prevailing opinion in the world community that by embracing
      on a military confrontation with Iran, Trump has added to the US’ growing isolation
      in the world community.


      An intriguing point here is that in Medvedev’s prognosis, the US is being drawn
      into a new conflict abroad “with the prospect of a ground operation.” He didn’t
      explain how this may happen. Iran, which is almost the size of Europe, is a big
      country and has approximately 610,000 active duty personnel plus 350,000 reserve
      and trained personnel that can be mobilised when needed. Then, there is the Islamic
      Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) which has approximately 125,000 personnel and
      a voluntary militia, Basj, under it with a further approximately 90,000 active
      personnel.


      Even a limited US commando operation is fraught with high risk. The Operation
      Eagle Crew — undertaken in April 1980 in an attempt to rescue the US hostages
      — ended tragically. Of eight helicopters sent into Iran, two became disabled and
      a third was blown into a C-130 cargo plane in a fierce desert sandstorm, killing
      eight American servicemen whose bodies, left behind, were later paraded before
      Iranian television cameras. The Carter administration, humiliated by the failed
      mission and loss of life, expended great energy to have the bodies returned to
      the US. Trump is unlikely to risk such escapades.


      In geopolitical terms, the seismic shift in the Kremlin thinking can be a game
      changer for Iran which must be regretting that it declined a Russian offer to
      include a provision for mutual security assistance in times of war in the two
      countries’ recently concluded treaty of strategic partnership, similar to what
      Russia has with DPRK. Also, Putin disclosed last week that Russia had offered
      to develop an integrated air defence system jointly with Iran (that could access
      Russian satellite data) but Iran showed no interest. Curiously, he revealed that
      Tehran was yet to ask for any help, either!


      That was on June 19. But on June 22 Trump struck and a terrible beauty was born.
      It appears that Khamenei ordered Araghchi who was busy parleying with Europeans
      to go East and meet Putin.


      Anyway, at a meeting with Araghchi in the Kremlin today, Putin used exceptionally
      strong words to condemn the US attack on Iran which he called a “completely unprovoked
      act of aggression against Iran … without foundation or justification.”


      Putin added, “Russia has long-standing, strong, and trustworthy relations with
      Iran, and we are committed to supporting the Iranian people through our continued
      efforts… Your visit provides us with an important opportunity to discuss these
      sensitive issues in depth and to explore ways we might work together to navigate
      the current situation.” (The Kremlin readout is here.)


      Will Russia’s entry deter Trump on his warpath? That is the million dollar question
      in the coming days. If Trump persists with such belligerence in cahoots with Israel’s
      Benjamin Netanyahu, a protracted war of attrition will ensue that will most certainly
      bring in China at some point with which Iran has a strong mil-to-mil relationship.

    text: 'Putin in reflective mood muses on US-Iran confrontation


      The US President Donald Trump who sought President Vladimir Putin’s active help
      a fortnight ago to mediate in the negotiations over Iran nuclear issue has abruptly
      changed his mind. In retrospect, Putin probably showed undue enthusiasm no sooner
      than Trump sought his help, and even mooted a trip to Iran shortly to meet Iran’s
      Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but only to realise just days later that
      Trump had other thoughts on his impressionable mind following the Camp David meeting
      with his aides and advisors and has since wandered into strange thoughts, including
      such tragic notions as decapitation of the Iranian leader. (here and here)


      Putin’s terse remarks to a group of senior foreign journalists in St.Petersburg
      on Wednesday were made in a sombre mood. Putin wouldn’t answer a pointed question
      from Reuters as to what he thought of Trump’s shocking hint a day earlier in a
      Truth Social post that he might order the assassination of Khamenei.


      Perhaps, it was a folly on Putin’s part to rush into playing second fiddle to
      Trump on the highly complicated Iran nuclear problem, blithely ignoring that this
      is quintessentially a geopolitical problem too, where the interests of the US
      and Russia do not necessarily converge.


      In reality, Russian-Iranian relations are no less complex than the US-Russia tango.
      The two countries had a deeply troubled common history. During World War 2, Soviet
      forces even occupied Tehran in cahoots with Britain; earlier, imperial Russia
      carved out vast territories of the Persian Empire and annexed them. How could
      Iranians forget all that?


      In an article in January when Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed
      a strategic partnership treaty, I had written that the event in Moscow signified
      at best a breakthrough in the ties but the road ahead would be long and winding.
      I estimated that the treaty was “an attempt to build guardrails so as to enable
      a new trajectory of relationship in mutual interests.” (See Russia-Iran treaty
      signifies a ‘breakthrough’ in ties, Indian Punchline, January 24, 2025)


      Curiously, Article 3 of the treaty painstakingly flags the maleficent activities
      that both sides should avoid and goes on to commit both sides not to help either
      side’s adversary in a conflict situation! What sort of strategic partnership can
      be a treaty with such caveats and mutual suspicions?


      At the media event in St.Petersburg on Wednesday, Putin revealed that it was Iran
      who did not want a mutual defence clause to be included in the treaty (as Russia
      has with North Korea) — and, furthermore, that in the emergent circumstances while
      battling the US-Israeli juggernaut, Tehran has not so far sought any help from
      Moscow!


      There is an abject lesson here for Trump, too. Iran is a fiercely independent
      country which, no doubt, is interested to have a productive relationship with
      the US, but the question, from the US perspective, is how to go about it. Certainly,
      it cannot be the John Wayne way.


      Where the US failed repeatedly is also on this score — its inability or refusal
      to seek an equal relationship with Iran based on mutual respect. If Trump carries
      out a decapitation of the Iranian leader, he might as well forget about a normalisation
      of the US-Iran relationship for decades to come. And its debilitating consequence
      will be that even the US’ residual influence in the West Asian region will drain
      away within Trump’s presidency. In fact, any such incredibly stupid act may even
      lead to the emergence of a ultra-nationalistic nuclear weapon state.


      Iran question needs to be handled with subtlety and sophistication. A hugely successful
      businessman like Trump ought to have the sense of realism (and pragmatism) to
      know the art of the possible.


      Putin told on Wednesday, “We see that today in Iran with all the complexity of
      the internal political processes taking place there – we know about it, and I
      think there is no point in going into depth – but still there is a consolidation
      of society around the political leadership of the country. This happens almost
      always and everywhere, and Iran is no exception.” In short, Putin noted that a
      regime change in Iran to Washington’s satisfaction will remain a pipe dream.


      Second, Putin said referring to Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities and missile
      manufacturing defence industry, “I will only repeat what we know and hear from
      all sides, these underground factories, they exist, nothing has happened to them
      — And in this connection, it seems to me that it would be right for all of us
      to seek ways to end the hostilities together …This is a delicate question, and
      of course you need to be very careful here. But, in my opinion, in general such
      a solution can be found.”


      This is the best advice Trump can hope to get from any quarter today from within
      his circle or from foreigners. The level of trust and cooperation in the nuclear
      field between Russia and Iran is very high and Trump should have no difficulty
      to tap into it.


      Putin disclosed that Moscow has given “certain signals to our Iranian friends.
      And in general it is possible to secure Iran’s interests in the field of peaceful
      nuclear energy and at the same time go out to allay concerns on the part of Israel
      regarding its security.


      “Such options, in my opinion, there are. We have outlined them, I repeat, to all
      our partners: and the United States, and Israel, and even to Iran. We’re not imposing
      anything on anyone – just talking about how we see a possible way out of the situation.
      But the solution, of course, lies behind the political leadership of all these
      countries, above all Iran and Israel.”


      Frankly, Iran is not an easy country to negotiate with. It can be stubborn as
      a mule while defending its national interests and preserving strategic autonomy.
      The collective consciousness of a civilisation state going back to circa 700 BC
      must be reckoned with. Putin pointed out that Russia had once offered to jointly
      develop an integrated air defence system for Iran but “the [Iranian] partners
      did not show much interest, and that’s it.” Look at the irony of it today!


      Putin probably senses that a US intervention in Iran is in the cards. Of course,
      he is a worried man. Putin’s advice to both Netanyahu and Trump is deceptively
      simple: “You should always look at whether the goal is achievable or not when
      starting something.”

    text: 'Israel’s Dimona nuclear facility from where, according to Iranian reports,
      ‘plumes of smoke were rising’, June 17, 2025


      Trump orders ‘unconditional surrender’ by Iran. Who’s listening?


      Israel’s blitzkrieg against Iran five days ago is failing spectacularly. The Russian
      media reported that: i) Israel’s Rafael weapons complex has been destroyed; ii)
      Haifa oil refinery is in flames; iii) the Iron Dome has been breached; iv) and,
      Israel’s air dominance is a figment of imagination.


      On Tuesday, Iran fired cruise missiles for the first time against Israel. Another
      wave of Iranian missile and drone attack targeted the Nevatim Airbase in southern
      Israel, where stealth fighter jets, transport aircraft, tanker aircraft and machines
      for electronic reconnaissance/surveillance, etc. are stationed.


      Some Iranian reports claim that “plumes of smoke were rising from areas near the
      Dimona nuclear facility,” where an estimated 90 Israeli nuclear warheads are stored.
      If true, this must be highly embarrassing for Israel which has been maintaining
      a policy of deliberate ambiguity in regard to its nuclear capabilities as well
      as for President Donald Trump who is constantly hectoring Iran while turning a
      blind eye on Israel’s clandestine nuclear weapon stockpiles right under his nose
      — apart from exposing the IAEA.


      According to the independent Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,
      Israel’s nuclear warheads are capable of being delivered anywhere within a maximum
      radius of 4,500 km by its F-15, F-161, and F-35I “Adir” aircraft, its 50 land-based
      Jericho II and III missiles, and by about 20 Popeye Turbo cruise missiles, launched
      from submarines.


      Suffice to say, rational minds among the Israeli elite feel worried. Typically,
      Danny Yatom, former head of Mossad, is quoted as saying, “Iranians will not kneel;
      they will not raise the flag of surrender and they will not give in!”


      The American broadcast television network NBC has reported that Israel asked Iran,
      through western mediators, to stop its retaliatory attacks and return to nuclear
      negotiations. This would probably explain Trump’s bombastic post on Sunday in
      Truth Social that Israel and Iran will end their violent conflict by “making a
      deal” through his mediation. Trump wrote, ”We will have peace, soon, between Israel
      and Iran. Many calls and meetings now taking place.” He even drew the analogy
      of his success in brokering peace between India and Pakistan recently.


      However, the realisation may have since dawned on Trump that Iranians will not
      forget or forgive the assassinations of their military commanders or the destruction
      and loss of life of dozens of civilians in the Israeli Blitzkrieg, which targeted
      Iran’s nuclear facilities, military infrastructure, and residential buildings
      in Tehran and other cities.


      Trump has a major decision to take in coming days as regards the next move — specifically,
      how to rescue Israel from the attritional war that lies ahead. Pressure for US
      military intervention is mounting. Trump is obligated one way or another to all
      three segments of the Israel Lobby — Zionists, evangelical Christians and wealthy
      Jewish elites who are kingmakers in American politics.


      The pendulum is wildly swinging in Trump’s mercurial mind. He was in an irritable
      mood at the G-7 summit in Canada on Monday, cut short his trip and picked a nasty
      public quarrel with French President Emmanuel Macron for simply commenting that
      Trump hurried back to wrap up a ceasefire.


      Trump wrote angrily, “Publicity seeking President Emmanuel Macron, of France,
      mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work
      on a “cease fire” between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now
      on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire.
      Much bigger than that. Whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong.
      Stay Tuned!”


      Four hours later, he clarified, “I have not reached out to Iran for “Peace Talks”
      in any way, shape, or form. This is just more HIGHLY FABRICATED, FAKE NEWS! If
      they want to talk, they know how to reach me. They should have taken the deal
      that was on the table — Would have saved a lot of lives!!!”


      Seven hours later, Trump claimed, “We now have complete and total control of the
      skies over Iran. Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and
      plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured
      “stuff.” Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA.”


      But a few minutes later, Trump threatened Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
      Khamenei: “We know exactly where the so-called “Supreme Leader” is hiding. He
      is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!),
      at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American
      soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”


      Seven minutes later, another nasty post followed in capital letters: “UNCONDITIONAL
      SURRENDER!”


      That was 9 hours ago. Presumably, Trump wound up Tuesday by ordering Iran to crawl
      on its knees. The chances of Iran obliging him are zero. In fact, the Chairman
      of the Chiefs of Staff of Iran’s Armed Forces Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi
      said on Tuesday that the operations carried out so far have served as a deterrent
      warning, and the actual “punitive operations” are set to begin soon. The general
      asked the inhabitants of Tel Aviv and Haifa “to leave these areas for the sake
      of their lives.”


      In fact, an Iranian commentary underscored yesterday that “Israeli strikes on
      Iran’s energy infrastructure and southern ports near the Persian Gulf could shift
      the nature of the conflict dramatically… This is precisely what Iran identifies
      as its strategic red line.”


      The commentary continues: “What we’re witnessing is a multi-level hybrid conflict,
      a complex puzzle involving direct warfare, proxy engagement, diplomatic pressure,
      and a simmering “cold peace”—all unfolding at once… But such a scenario is unsustainable,
      as Israel… knows it cannot endure a prolonged high-intensity conflict.


      The commentary estimates that a ceasefire “would likely be a tense calm or a “cold
      peace” rather than true stability.” Because, “What’s emerging now is a fluid and
      brutal new balance of power… The Persian Gulf, Israel, the Axis of Resistance,
      and the global energy market are no longer separate arenas—but interconnected
      pieces in a simultaneous, high-stakes game.” (here)


      The great dilemma for Trump is that there’s no quick fix solution in sight. On
      his way back to the US yesterday evening, Trump said he wanted a “real end” to
      the conflict and that he was “not too much in a mood to negotiate.” German Chancellor
      Friedrich Merz also noted that Trump was indeed considering that option. The US
      is rapidly building up its forces in the Gulf region.


      However, US intervention may trigger a continental war that will outlive Trump’s
      presidency and destroy his presidency, as Bush’s 2003 Iraq invasion destroyed
      his. And Trump might as well forget about America First, MAGA, Ukraine, Taiwan,
      tariff wars, immigration, inflation, China, etc.


      Even European allies won’t stand by Trump. Macron told reporters on the sidelines
      of the G7 summit after Trump’s departure, “The biggest mistake today would be
      to try to do a regime change in Iran through military means because that would

      actions of regional de-stabilisation.”


      Do not forget that the skeptics include Vice President JD Vance also, whose suspicion
      of foreign entanglements had its origins in his time as a US Marine in Iraq, where
      he became disillusioned with America’s interventionist regime change projects
      and ill-fated ‘forever wars’ in the region.

    text: 'Scene of an apartment building destroyed by an Iranian ballistic missile
      impact, Bat Yam, Israel, June 15, 2025


      Netanyahu’s war on Iran has no future


      An unnoticed undercurrent of the Israel-Iran war is that three Christian nations
      in Europe — UK, France and Germany — have joined the fray with alacrity on the
      side of Israel.


      Strange, isn’t it, that these European countries comprising the so-called E-3
      have a well-established exclusive path of dialogue with Iran but are joining Israel’s
      warpath? It’s a Crusade, stupid!


      The three ‘Crusader nations’ share Israel’s obsession to check the rise of a Muslim
      nation as an emerging power in the Middle East that could radically transform
      its geopolitical alignments. Simply put, destroying the Islamic regime in Iran
      is the real objective of Israel’s war — and of the three Christian nations from
      Europe.


      Reportedly, Israeli fighter jets which attacked Iran used the British air base
      in Cyprus; British refuelling planes are on deployment in Syrian-Iraqi airspace
      for use of Israeli fighter jets; French president Emmanuel Macron, as defender
      of Roman Catholicism openly vows that he will act to prevent Israel’s defeat;
      Germany, the fountainhead of Protestantism, has also similarly positioned itself
      behind Israel.


      However, on the other hand, what emerges from the hour-long phone conversation
      between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday is that they will
      work together to advance the path of dialogue with Iran, the current conflict
      situation notwithstanding. The Kremlin readout stresses that Putin forcefully
      denounced the Israeli aggression.


      Such a line-up of the principal actors signals that Israel’s best bet lies in
      killing the war itself as a strategic error and create a ‘new normal’? But will
      Tehran allow Netanyahu to get away with murder? That’s the million dollar question.
      Putin will have to use all his persuasive power doing the planned visit to Iran
      — ie., if it still goes ahead.


      The Israeli thinking behind its assassination of the IRGC leadership and military
      commanders stemmed out of the foolish miscalculation that Tehran lacks a political
      will to resist aggression. The Israeli objective is on the one hand to create
      conditions for a regime change in Iran and on the other hand to derail any form
      of US-Iran constructive engagement.


      All through, terror has been the chosen weapon for Israel and the western powers
      to undermine and weaken Iran. But a point has been reached where a containment
      of Iran is no longer feasible. Logically, Iran’s neighbours in the Muslim world
      should have rallied in support of Iran but that’s too much to expect, given their
      limited sovereignty to act independently.


      Nonetheless, Iran will not capitulate. Iran’s sense of national pride and honour
      as a civilisation state will prompt it to circle the wagons and wage a protracted
      war until victory. From the early days of the revolution, the Islamic republic
      which was founded on the principles of justice and resistance on the bedrock of
      nationalism and independence, got attracted to Mao’s concept of ‘protracted people’s
      war’ to keep predator nations at bay. That strategy paid off during the Iran-Iraq
      War (1980-1988).


      Saddam Hussein too, like Netanyahu, miscalculated that Iran was a hopelessly weakened
      nation in the civil war conditions with its economy in virtual collapse, army
      in disarray, state formation yet to crystallise, and with no allies in the region
      to lend a helping hand. But as it turned out, Iran fought an 8-year war defiantly
      to a stalemate, undeterred by the lavish support extended to Saddam by the Western
      powers and their regional allies.


      The US even equipped Saddam’s army with chemical weapons to stop the human-wave–attack
      tactics of Iranian fighters, but of no avail — although, an estimated quarter
      million Iranians sacrificed their lives.


      At some point, in a very near future, Israel will also meet the fate of Saddam,
      having miscalculated Iran’s grit to resist. Netanyahu also estimated that Iran
      is a much weakened country compared to last year due to the setbacks taken by
      the Axis of Resistance. Such naïveté underestimates the potency of resistance
      at the very core of Shi’ism.


      Last week, the resistance forces that were supposedly vanquished from the face
      of the earth regrouped and began firing missiles at Israel — from Syria, of all
      places! On May 4, Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv hitting the perimeter
      of the main terminal of Ben Gurion Airport! Reports suggest that Hezbollah has
      restored its supply routes from Iran.


      What Israel fails to grasp is that resistance movements do not die their raison
      d’être remains. Israel is, in reality, in very deep crisis fighting on multiple
      fronts amidst a cascading domestic political crisis and an economy that requires
      drip feeding by Washington.


      As the US’s capacity to influence events in the Middle East keeps diminishing,
      Israel’s unviability as a nation propped by the Jewish Lobby in the Beltway appears
      sharper in focus. Already, there is resentment within the US about bankrolling
      Israel and fighting its wars.


      On the contrary, the rise of Iran is inevitable — with a population base 10 times
      bigger than Israel’s, vast mineral resources, a self-sufficient agricultural sector
      and broad-based industry, innovative progress in technology, big domestic market,
      highly strategic location and trained manpower.


      Iran’s stamina is of a long distance runner, as Iran-Iraq war showed, whereas,
      Israel’s forte is as sprinter on a 100 metre track. Make no mistake, Israel, a
      small country with a population of 8 million people will get hollowed out in a
      protracted war.


      In the current scenario, what goes against Israel critically is that while President
      Donald Trump tried and failed to stop Netanyahu on the warpath, he is not going
      to deploy American forces to fight Israel’s war.


      Trump has an evangelical base in US politics and is on friendly terms with wealthy
      Jewish donors, but has nothing in common with the Crusader nations of the Old
      World — be it on Ukraine or Iran. In both cases, actually, he tends to view the
      paradigm through the America First prism where he sees immense potential to generate
      wealth through business links with Russia or Iran.


      Besides, Trump is far too smart a politician to risk the future of his MAGA movement
      whose core tenet is the total rejection of all interventionist ‘forever wars’.
      Trump knows only too well that American public opinion is staunchly opposed to
      Middle Eastern wars.


      The replacement of Mike Waltz as NSA on May 1 (a known Israeli proxy who found
      himself in the top echelons of Trump administration) and the subsequent purge
      of the entire pack of ‘Iran hawks’ in the National Security staff under him, signalled
      that Trump is wary of Netanyahu’s diabolical plots to derail his negotiations
      with Iran through back channels. (here and here)


      During their phone conversation on Saturday, according to the Kremlin readout,
      Trump and Putin agreed to prioritise the “negotiating track in Iran’s nuclear
      programme… Trump noted, the team of US negotiators is ready for resuming work
      with Iranian representatives.” Clearly, a military confrontation with Iran does
      not figure in Trump’s calculus.


      That being the case, Netanyahu’s bombastic rhetoric apart, Israel’s best interests
      lie in ending this futile war in the quickest way possible. Conceivably, that
      is also the preference of the IDF. A protracted war on its own steam with a clutch
      of crusader nations in tow as cheer leaders is not something that can save Israel
      from destruction.


      Curiously, Trump in his latest Truth Social post on Sunday after the conversation
      with Putin advised Israel “to make a deal” with Iran! Does that fit into Netanyahu’s
      war mongering? And Trump went on to burnish his own credentials as a peacemaker
      president!


      Trump concluded predicting that “we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and
      Iran!” Succinctly put, Trump has no intentions whatsoever to risk American lives
      by fighting Netanyahu’s wars.


      Obviously, “PEACE, soon” will be Russia and Iran’s preference too, as serious
      negotiations can be resumed and agreement reached that would herald a US-Iran
      normalisation and the lifting of American sanctions. But does that suit Netanyahu?


      The paradox is, Israel has no future in a protracted war with Iran, but an inconclusive
      end to this war will pose the high risk for Netanyahu of a cascading demand for
      a regime change in Israel. Loss of power means loss of parliamentary immunity
      from prosecution that Netanyahu hitherto enjoyed from corruption charges against
      him and his family members, and a possible imprisonment.

    text: 'Protestors in an anti-Israeli gathering hold up Iranian and Palestinian flags,
      Tehran, Iran, June 13, 2025


      Why did Israel jump the gun?


      The Israeli Defence Forces called the aerial attack on Iran by some 200 planes
      in the early hours of Friday, June 13, as a “preemptive strike.” International
      law gives no scope to attack a country over 1000 kms away on a vague pretext of
      ‘self-defence’ — or, ‘an immediate operational necessity.’


      The UN Charter allows acts in self-defence, but there is nothing that Iran has
      done in the recent period — at least after President Donald Trump returned to
      the White House — that can be construed as threatening Israel. Israelis claim
      to have significantly weakened Iran’s capacity to threaten their country.


      So, call it naked aggression. The statement by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio
      sought to distance the US from Israeli strikes stressing that “Israel took unilateral
      action” and had advised Washington that “they believe this action was necessary
      for its self-defence.”


      Trump had been telling Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu that such attacks would only
      undermine the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. The sixth round of US-Iran
      negotiations is scheduled to take place in Muscat on June 15.


      Rubio’s statement underscored that “We are not involved in strikes against Iran
      and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.” Rubio did not
      make the slightest attempt to voice US support for Israel in defending against
      any Iranian counterstrikes. This is extremely unusual.


      The big question is, what forced Netanyahu’s hands — apart from the obvious one
      of distracting attention from the aggravating domestic political crisis?


      One factor is that his personal equations with Trump have been steadily going
      south, especially since the removal of Mike Waltz on May 1 from the crucial post
      of National Security Advisor, a key policy-shaping role in the White House.


      Waltz’s reassignment as ambassador to the UN came in the aftermath of the so-called
      “Signalgate” incident, but with hindsight, his leaning towards aggressive military
      action against arch foe Iran too weighed on Trump’s decision.


      No sooner than Waltz lost his position, a purge of key foreign policy and national
      security positions in the White House began. Known ‘Iran hawks’ whom Waltz had
      handpicked to assist him have been shuffled out while ‘America First’ realists
      are in ascent.


      They include Eric Trager, who was heading the Middle East and North Africa portfolios
      for the National Security Council who is considered an ‘Iran hawk’ whom Waltz
      brought into the post from the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
      Again, Morgan Ortagus, considered one of the “strongest pro-Israel supporters
      in the administration,” was shuffled out of her role as the Lebanon envoy under
      Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff.


      According to YNet News, Ortagus’ removal from the position “stunned officials
      in Jerusalem, where she is viewed as closely aligned with Israeli interests.”
      Also, Merav Ceran (an Israeli-American who was a former official in Israel’s Ministry
      of Defense) has been removed from the Iran and Israel desk in the National Security
      Council.


      Certainly, Israel’s moles who favoured war over diplomacy with Iran, have been
      shown the door while the president himself is negotiating with Iran to curb its
      nuclear program! (See a fuller account of the White House changes in two reports
      by the Responsible Statecraft website of Quincy Institute — here , here and here.)


      Israelis claim that there was “full and complete coordination” with the Americans
      ahead of Friday’s attacks but the sentiment has not yet been echoed in Rubio’s
      statement. Admittedly, Rubio did issue a warning for Iran: “Let me be clear: Iran
      should not target US interests or personnel.” But that is more of a red line.


      Another sensitive factor at work is the growing pressure on Trump from some recognised
      figures in the Make America Great Again (MAGA) camp backing him, such as Steve
      Bannon, former chief White House strategist and influential figure. They warn
      Trump against a hawkish foreign policy stance, particularly by way of support
      for military interventions abroad, as that is fraught with the risk of splintering
      the MAGA camp, which would be politically damaging.


      Finally, there is the big picture of geopolitical realignments. Last fortnight
      was a critical period. The audacious Ukrainian attack on Russian nuclear triad
      on June 1 prompted a call from Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin within
      forty-eight hours.


      The outcome of their conversation appears to be that: i) US-Russia constructive
      engagement must run its course; ii) diplomacy will continue on the Ukraine issue
      even while new facts on the ground may keep shaping diplomacy; and iii) the US
      is decoupling from European allies in the proxy war in Ukraine.


      The stunning part of the phone call was that Trump sought Putin’s intervention
      in Iran nuclear issue. Putin agreed to help. Only a week later, Iran’s government
      spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani was quoted by Russia’s state RIA news agency as
      saying, “Putin’s trip to Tehran is currently being worked out, preparations are
      underway.”


      Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei holds Putin in great esteem. Succinctly
      put, Israel’s worst nightmare is coming true — US-Iran negotiations gaining in
      the statesmanlike gravitas of a world leader. Without doubt, Putin knows that
      this could be potentially a game changer in Russia-US relations as resolution
      of the Iran issue remains critical to the stabilisation of the Middle East and
      further opportunities may arise to address the Middle East crisis, including the
      Palestine issue.


      Evidently, time is running out for Israel. And Netanyahu has chosen to act now,
      whether Trump likes it or not. From the Iranian perspective, advantage lies in
      continuing the talks with Steve Witkoff in Muscat on Sunday. Any attack on the
      US bases in the region is avoidable in the retaliation that can be expected for
      sure. Let Israel stew in its aggression. Hurt them where it matters most in the
      upcoming war.


      BBC reported that “In the hours before Thursday’s attacks, US officials were briefing
      that there would be no American support in the event of Israeli action, even going
      as far as to say they would not help with any aerial refuelling. That was meant
      for Tehran’s consumption.”


      Trump’s first reaction to Israeli strikes is also in the nature of a case for
      negotiations and compromise:


      “I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest
      of words, to “just do it,” but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close
      they got, they just couldn’t get it done.


      “I told them it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were
      told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment
      anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more
      to come – And they know how to use it.


      “Certain Iranian hardliners spoke bravely, but they didn’t know what was about
      to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!


      “There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to
      make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal,
      come to an end.


      “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known
      as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE
      IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!”

      an act of "naked aggression" since international law does not justify such an
      attack based on vague claims of self-defense. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
      distanced the U.S. from the Israeli action, emphasizing that it was unilateral
      and cautioning against Iranian retaliation, while President Trump had previously
      warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that such strikes could jeopardize
      ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran. The backdrop to this escalation includes
      a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy under Trump, with the removal of key
      officials who favored military action against Iran and a growing focus on diplomatic
      resolutions, including potential Russian involvement in the Iran nuclear talks.
      As tensions rise, Netanyahu's decision to strike appears to be driven by both
      domestic political pressures and a sense of urgency in the face of changing geopolitical
      dynamics, leaving Israel in a precarious position as it confronts the consequences
      of its aggressive actions.

    text: 'The Indian media reports make out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reception
      for the seven parliamentary delegations waging the war on terror turned into a
      social occasion to celebrate the flashes of ‘national unity’ before the hurly-burly
      of politics returns as the election cycle picks up.


      The PMO did not issue any press release on PM’s remarks. We wouldn’t know whether
      this event on Tuesday is a substitute for a special session of the parliament
      to discuss Pahalgam incident, which opposition parties demanded.


      Regrettably, we won’t even know the international reaction to our war on terror
      against Pakistan. There have been no public statements. How can a war be waged
      when there is no clarity about the enemy?


      Terrorism is a dicey subject with a complicated history. It is not only China
      which maintains “ambiguity or double standards”on terrorism — per EAM S. Jaishankar’s
      allegation — but even within India there are misconceptions. The contesting legacies
      of Bhagat Singh and Savarkar bear testimony to it.


      We need to tread softly. Proposals are being mooted lately that India should rally
      the Global South in the war on terror. There is great risk that we may lethally
      erode our article of faith that Kashmir is an internal matter. The world-wide
      perception is already that the periodic eruption of India-Pakistan violence stems
      from the unresolved Kashmir problem. (See my article Operation Sindoor Outreach:
      What Did Panda & Co Achieve In West Asia? Rediff, June 5, 2025)


      Our solution lies in diligently picking up the thread of negotiations during the
      time of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf. But no serious
      attempt has been made in this direction in the past decade or more — nor is it
      ever likely by the ideology-driven present government.


      If the bilateral track is unproductive or damaged, what is the alternative? Fixation
      about bilateralism shouldn’t be an alibi for inertia. The international environment
      today has dramatically changed and old dogmas have become obsolete. India is no
      longer vulnerable to external aggression / interference / interventions. Indians
      are a patriotic people and national unity doesn’t have to be promoted if the country
      faces an existential danger. We, our children and grandchildren are all stakeholders,
      because we live here and this is our only country.


      We see a remarkable convergence between the three big powers — the US, Russia
      and China — on the efficacy of dialogue between India and Pakistan. What drives
      the big powers may not be altruistic motives, but, quintessentially, there is
      convergence that all three dread a weakened, failed Pakistani state and will prevent
      it no matter what it takes — IMF / ADB / World Bank, etc., have been lined up.
      Pakistan is a highly strategic entity in geopolitical terms.


      Arguably, China’s helping hand to Pakistan too is not really any different — although
      a powerful lobby in our country is raising the spectre of a military ‘fusion’
      between the two countries. Their diabolical agenda is to legitimise the hypothesis
      that our problematic relations with these two neighbours have no real solutions
      and all that is possible is a cauterisation of gaping wounds. This is a defeatist
      mentality unbecoming of a civilisation state.


      After all, is China doing anything essentially different from what the US did
      during India’s cold-war era wars with Pakistan— or for that matter, what Russia
      is doing for India’s militarisation and national defence? Where was the ‘fusion’
      then?


      Russia has openly acknowledged the US’ good offices in checking the India-Pakistan
      tensions from spiralling out of control. All three big powers offered to promote
      dialogue. So, where lies the real problem?


      Simply put, we remain stuck with the ‘management’ of Kashmir problem rather than
      seek a permanent solution. There are interest groups that adopt maximalist positions.
      And political leadership lacks the courage or the moral authority to approach
      the problem in a spirit of give and take. Remember, Germany and France also used
      to be eternal enemies; they even fought two world wars.


      Ironically, even as PM hosted the seven multi-party delegations that returned
      home, in a hearing in the US Congress, at the House Armed Services Committee,
      the commander of the US Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla lavishly praised
      Pakistan as a key partner in counterterrorism.


      The general unequivocally commended a “phenomenal partnership” on the part of
      the Taliban with Pakistan in the tribal areas on their border in the fight against
      ISIS with the support of US intelligence, which eliminated dozens of ISIS fighters
      and captured at least five high-value terrorists, who included Jafar, one of the
      key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing.


      Gen. Kurilla disclosed that Pakistani army chief Gen. Asim Munir called him personally
      to inform, “I have caught him [Jafar], ready to extradite him back to the United
      States, please tell the Secretary of Defence and President.”


      Gen. Kurilla added, “So we are seeing Pakistan, with the limited intelligence
      that we provide, go after them using their means to do that, and we are seeing
      an effect on ISIS Khorasan…


      “And I would also tell you that since 2024 — the beginning — Pakistan has had
      over 1000 terrorist attacks in the western area [Baluchistan], killing about 700
      security and [2500] civilians. They have an active counterterrorism fight right
      now, and they have been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world.”


      Interestingly, Gen. Kurilla alluded to a US-Russian convergence — and even possibly
      US-Iranian — in this regard, saying, “But remember, these [ISIS] are the same
      individuals that did the Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow [in March 2024 in which
      the death toll touched 143 and more than a hundred people were injured.] They
      did the attack in Kerman [in January 2024 at a commemorative ceremony marking
      the assassination of Gen. Qassem Soleimani at his grave in eastern Kerman, eastern
      Iran, where two bomb explosions killed at least 95 people and injured 284 others.]”


      The US Army general summed up: “That’s why we need to— we have to have a relationship
      with Pakistan and with India. I do not believe it is a binary switch that we can’t
      have one with Pakistan if we have a relationship with India. We should look at
      the merits of the relationship for the positives it has.”


      Isn’t it all too obvious that Shashi Tharoor who led the parliamentary delegation
      to Washington was beating a dead horse?


      EAM condemned China publicly, but it is common sense that China also cannot afford
      the weakening of the Pakistani state. They’ve invested deeply in the CPEC. Or,
      consider Xinjiang’s stability and security and the nexus between ISIS and Uighur
      terrorists.


      In reality, our irritation with China is that it is countering terrorist threats
      supported from abroad effectively, with a long-term perspective, in its own way,
      with all the wisdom that it can bring to bear on the challenge as a civilisation
      state — which has shown results, too — rather than follow our footfalls and muddling
      methods.


      China cannot afford a hybrid war like Don Quixote’s against giant windmills because
      well-trained battle-hardened terrorists from Xinjiang actually constitute the
      cadres of the ISIS and terrorism is not an optical illusion.

    one_sentence_summary: The reception hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for parliamentary
      delegations addressing terrorism was overshadowed by the lack of clarity on India's
      war on terror, the absence of a coherent strategy regarding Pakistan, and the
      complexities of international relations, particularly in light of recent U.S.
      commendations of Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts.
    paragraph_summary: The Indian media's portrayal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
      reception for parliamentary delegations addressing terrorism suggests a shift
      toward a celebratory atmosphere of 'national unity' amidst the impending election
      cycle, overshadowing the lack of substantive discussion on pressing issues like
      the Pahalgam incident. The absence of a press release from the PMO raises questions
      about the government's clarity and strategy in the war on terror, particularly
      regarding its stance on Pakistan, while the international community's response
      remains unaddressed. The article critiques India's historical and current handling
      of terrorism, emphasizing the need for dialogue with Pakistan, akin to past negotiations,
      rather than mere management of the Kashmir issue. It highlights the complex geopolitical
      landscape, noting the convergence of interests among major powers like the US,
      Russia, and China in promoting dialogue between India and Pakistan, while also
      pointing out the paradox of US military support for Pakistan in counterterrorism
      efforts. Ultimately, the piece argues for a more proactive and courageous political
      approach to resolving longstanding conflicts rather than succumbing to defeatist
      mentalities.

    text: 'Satellite image from Planet Labs PBC shows damage after Ukrainian drone attack
      on Belaya Air Base, Irkutsk, eastern Siberia, June 4, 2025


      President Donald Trump had a difficult week. No, this isn’t about Elon Musk or
      Harvard University. On Wednesday, his call to Russian President Vladimir Putin
      didn’t go well. It turned into a ‘conversation’, as Trump wrote on Truth Social,
      lasting only an hour and 15 minutes, which means, setting aside the time for interpretation,
      it left no room for substantive discussions.


      The call took place against the backdrop of the attack on Russia’s nuclear force
      on June 1. Trump acknowledged in his Truth Social post later that Putin spoke
      “strongly” about Russia’s response to come. The post was notable for its subdued
      tone.


      We wouldn’t know whether Putin brought up Western involvement. The Kremlin merely
      noted that “Donald Trump reiterated that the Americans had not been informed about
      this [attack] in advance.”


      Zelensky’s version is that the attack was in the pipeline for the past 18-month
      period. Yet, we are to believe, neither the CIA nor MI6 whose operatives run the
      show in Kiev got an inkling of it. Trump’s Truth Social post simply omitted this
      crucial part of the conversation with Putin, which is highly significant — and
      consequential.


      Especially, as Kremlin-funded RT had already carried one report citing the assessment
      of an ex-French intelligence officer that the Ukrainian targeting couldn’t have
      been possible without US satellite inputs.


      Earlier, Tass also had carried a similar report citing a former US naval officer
      who estimated that the 18 month-period was when the Biden administration was virtually
      on auto-pilot (due to the president’s dementia). An interesting thought in itself?


      Tass quoted the American source who actually said on a War Room podcast: “So,
      who was it on the American side that either gave the greenlight to this or provided
      the initial intelligence targeting? Hey, where is William Burns and Jack Sullivan,
      the neocon whizkids in Biden’s team?


      Again, on the same day as Trump spoke to Putin, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
      Sergey Ryabkov warned at a news conference in Moscow, “The fact that certain circles
      in the United States have been and are still hatching plans to move towards eradicating
      Russia as a state is also undeniable… We should not underestimate the consequences
      of such a mindset… Russian society should remain in a state of high readiness
      for any intrigues.”


      Interestingly, Ryabkov called on Washington and London specifically to speak up
      on the attack on Russian airfields. As he put it, “We demand that both London
      and Washington respond in a manner that stops this recent round of escalation
      of tensions.”


      When asked about the Ukrainian attack on Wednesday in Brussels, NATO secretary-general
      Mark Rutte came up with an ingenious argument : “Let’s not forget that the capabilities
      they hit were the capabilities the Russians were using to attack innocent people
      going about their daily lives in Ukrainian cities and communities. So I think
      we should take note of that.” Clearly, the poor chap was in the loop! Rutte refused
      to speak further.


      Equally, the social media is awash with the assessments by some prominent American
      experts, especially ex-CIA analysts, pointing finger directly at the agency’s
      involvement. Of course, Russia has the experience and technical expertise to dig
      deep.


      There are comparable situations. What comes to mind is the famous U-2 spy plane
      incident on May 1, 1961. Perhaps, Trump is finding himself in the same embarrassing
      situation as President Dwight Eisenhower.


      Do we give the benefit of the doubt to Trump that he too was unaware of the strike
      on Russia’s nuclear force on June 1? To my mind, the analogy of the U-2 incident
      holds good — a rare cold-war era confrontation over the US’ blatant violation
      of Russian sovereignty and territory at a critical juncture just when the White
      House was navigting an improvement of relations with Russia.


      Eisenhower was kept in the dark about the full details of the U-2 although countdown
      had begun for his planned summit meeting with Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader,
      in Paris to discuss a Soviet-American detente (just what Trump is attempting with
      Putin.) The following excerpts from the archives of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial,
      Eisenhower National Historic Site are most insightful:


      “[U-2 spy plane pilot Gary] Powers did have a contingency in the form of a concealed
      needle with the poison Saxitoxin. If injected, this would have killed him and
      prevented his capture. Powers did not utilize this and was surrounded by Soviet
      citizens very soon after he touched down. Soviet citizens soon found his United
      States issued firearm, and other items bearing the flag of the U.S., turning him
      over to Soviet officials. Powers, and what was left of his spy plane, were shipped
      to Moscow be researched and documented. In a matter of hours, Khrushchev was informed
      of the captured pilot and the wrecked U-2.


      “When Powers was overdue to land at Norway [U-2 had taken off from its base in
      Peshawar], the CIA started to consider what might have happened. As a result,
      their contingency plan went into action. To prevent the public and the Soviets
      from learning the true nature of the U-2 aircraft, a misinformation campaign began.
      A NASA press release stated one of their high-altitude weather research U-2 aircraft
      had gone missing over Turkey, and that it may have drifted into Soviet airspace
      because of an unconscious pilot. A U-2 was shown off in NASA colors as well to
      help sell the story. Khruschev learned of this story from the Americans and decided
      to lay a trap for the United States and for Eisenhower.


      “The Soviets released information that a spy plane was shot down but did not include
      any other information on the status of the aircraft or Powers. The U.S. believed
      it could shape the narrative further and kept releasing “reports” of oxygen difficulties
      in the aircraft and that the auto pilot may have sent the plane into Soviet territory.
      Once the deception from the United States grew large enough, on May 7th, Khruschev
      sprung his trap by stating the pilot was alive, and that the Soviets had captured
      the remains of the aircraft, which contained a camera and film of Soviet Military
      Installations. This destroyed the cover story and was a public embarrassment for
      the United States and for President Eisenhower. The President learned of this
      at the office of his Gettysburg residence, where he got a phone call informing
      him the Soviets had captured Powers. This shattered the peace and tranquility
      of his stay in Gettysburg, and he knew that he would be held responsible in the
      eyes of the Soviet Union. In a remark to an aide, Eisenhower reportedly said,
      “I would like to resign.”


      While Eisenhower did not resign, the U-2 incident and the acute embarrassment
      so close to the end of his second term defined his Cold War legacy. Khrushchev
      cancelled the Paris summit and Soviet-American detente had to wait until Henry
      Kissinger consolidated his grip over US foreign policy strategies. Nonetheless,
      the Deep State, which loathed detente, booby-trapped Richard Nixon’s presidency!


      Eisenhower’s sense of betrayal is reflected in his farewell address when he bitterly
      called out the Deep State and prophesied that it will someday wreck America’s
      democracy.


      History is repeating. Look at the cascading turbulence already around Trump presidency.
      Eighty two out of 100 members of the Senate are co-sponsoring a bill by Senator
      Lindsey Graham (whose affiliation to the Deep State is legion), forcing Trump’s
      hands to impose “bone-breaking” sanctions against Russia, whose sole objective
      is to stall any improvement of US-Russia relations. Meanwhile, a call for impeachment
      of Trump is already in the air.
