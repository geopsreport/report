      Blog Friday, July 4, 2025 Larch Dug Up An Interesting Piece ... ... on Chinese
      HQ-9 AD complex. In support of the facts in this piece you have to recall that
      during recent (few years ago) tensions around Taiwan with the US Navy maneuvering
      in the area, China moved all its available S-400s and its regiment of SU-35 closer
      to the coast. Mind you, this is all after non-stop claims that HQ-9 is better
      than S-400. I omit here this Su-35 saga. Here is this piece and huge thanks to
      our good friend Larch. The Chinese "S-400 competitor" turned out to be weak Pakistan
      is dissatisfied with the performance of the HQ-9B complex, which was advertised
      in China as "more advanced than the Russian Triumph." Local conflicts, such as
      the Indo-Pakistani war, are often particularly interesting because of these duels,
      where systems that were competing in peacetime find themselves on the front lines
      against each other. The Chinese anti-aircraft missile system, like the S-400,
      is based on the Soviet S-300PM system. The first models were presented in the
      early 1990s, and since then, several modifications have been developed, each more
      advanced than the last. The latest model, with the letter "B" and an integrated
      AESA radar and digital combat control system, was introduced by the Chinese in
      2021. It was positioned as a "more advanced competitor to the S-400," although
      the Chinese were the first to acquire the "Triumfs" and are now using them in
      the most critical areas. But what can not be said for the sake of marketing. Many
      countries were quite satisfied with this relatively inexpensive alternative, and
      it has recently become one of the most exported high-tech products from China''s
      military-industrial complex. Pakistan acquired the HQ-9B in 2021. Its combat debut
      took place during the brief conflict in May. However, it was a bit of a misfire.
      The system managed to intercept some of the French SCALP-EG cruise missiles launched
      by the Rafales, but it was completely ineffective against the Russian-Indian BrahMos
      missiles, which caused significant damage to Pakistan''s rear airfields. Shortly
      after the end of the conflict, Islamabad requested more advanced HQ-19 systems
      from Beijing, and tried not to even discuss the operation of the HQ-9B. However,
      it is now revealed that behind this conspiracy of silence lay a deep disappointment
      with one of China''s top air defense systems. Pakistanis on military forums complained
      that the complex is highly susceptible to electronic warfare systems, and its
      missiles require constant target illumination, which in turn quickly attracts
      enemy anti-radar missiles. At least one full battery protecting the key Nur Khan
      airbase was destroyed by Indian Rudram-1 anti-radar missiles. The Pakistani military
      also complained that the HQ-9B could only shoot down subsonic cruise missiles,
      even though the advertisement promised that all missiles, including hypersonic
      and quasi-ballistic missiles, would be shot down. This example once again proves
      that the original is always better than a copy, especially when the developer
      of that copy uses the original Russian Triumph for their own urgent needs. So,
      make your own conclusions. Posted by smoothiex12 at 12:14 PM Email This BlogThis!

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the performance and reputation of China's
      HQ-9B air defense system, which was marketed as a superior alternative to Russia's
      S-400 system. Despite claims of advanced capabilities, particularly in the context
      of recent military tensions involving Pakistan and India, the HQ-9B has faced
      criticism for its effectiveness. During a recent conflict, it successfully intercepted
      some French missiles but failed against Indian BrahMos missiles, leading to significant
      damage for Pakistan. Complaints from Pakistani military forums highlight the system's
      vulnerabilities to electronic warfare and its limitations in targeting advanced
      missiles, raising doubts about its touted superiority. The piece suggests that
      the original Russian systems are more reliable than their Chinese counterparts,
      emphasizing the challenges faced by countries relying on the HQ-9B.

      of U.S. strategic forces under the START framework, suggesting that the U.S. has
      lost its military supremacy and that any potential military-political alliance

    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post, Andrei Martyanov discusses the current
      state of U.S. strategic forces within the framework of the START treaty, asserting
      that the U.S. has effectively lost its position, leaving no room for meaningful
      dialogue with Russia. He expresses concern over former President Trump's dissatisfaction,
      emphasizing the dire implications of the U.S. military's decline in the face of
      rising powers like Russia and China. Martyanov highlights his book, "Losing Military
      Supremacy," which argues that a formal military-political alliance between Russia
      and China could signal the end of U.S. dominance as a global power. The post underscores
      the urgent need for a reevaluation of military strategies to avoid catastrophic
      conflicts, particularly nuclear ones.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses Andrei Martyanov's influential book,
      "The (Real) Revolution in Military Affairs," which argues that the United States
      faces significant military challenges from Russia and China, potentially leading
      to its decline as a global power.
    paragraph_summary: The article on Andrei Martyanov's blog discusses the implications
      of military advancements and geopolitical dynamics, particularly focusing on the
      rise of Russia and China as formidable nuclear and industrial superpowers. Martyanov's
      book, "Losing Military Supremacy," argues that the potential formalization of
      a military-political alliance between these two nations could signify the end
      of the United States' global dominance. The blog also highlights the importance
      of understanding these shifts in military affairs, emphasizing the need for awareness
      and preparedness to avoid catastrophic conflicts, especially nuclear wars. The
      post reflects on recent military developments, including the capabilities of Russian
      forces, and underscores the urgency of addressing these evolving threats.

    text: 'Reminiscence of the Future... Si Vis Pacem, Para Vinum     © Andrei Martyanov''s
      Blog Saturday, July 5, 2025 Say It Ain''t So. In related news--water is wet, fire
      is hot and concrete floors are hard. Israel concealed that Iranian missiles hit
      several key military sites across the country during the recent 12-day war, The
      Telegraph reported on Saturday, citing radar data. The data, provided to the British
      paper by Oregon State University researchers who track bomb damage using satellite
      radar, indicates that six Iranian missiles hit five military facilities in the
      north, south, and center of Israel, including a major air base, an intelligence
      gathering center, and a logistics base. The extent of the reported damage is unclear.
      However, the hits were not publicly reported due to heavy military censorship,
      according to the report. When pressed on the issue, the Israel Defense Forces,
      declined to comment, only saying that “all relevant units maintained functional
      continuity throughout the operation.” But this is not what catches an eye, no.
      This does: Analysis cited by The Telegraph suggests that Israeli and US air defenses
      generally performed well, intercepting most of the incoming fire, although the
      share of missiles that penetrated through Israeli defenses rose to about 16% by
      the seventh day. The paper noted that this could have been linked with Israeli
      attempts to conserve ammunition, improved tactics by Iran, or the deployment of
      more advanced and harder-to-intercept weaponry. This is an utter BS, concocted
      for hiding a devastating effect of Iranian strikes and a pathetic performance
      by Israeli-US AD, which led Israel to begging for a cease-fire. A "performance"
      corroborated by a dismal (lack of) effectiveness of NATO AD complexes in 404--which
      IS a feature of all West''s AD systems. While classifying the impact of strikes
      is understandable, claims of 84% "effectiveness", especially from some "researches"
      from Oregon State University are down right propaganda, considering the well established
      trend of most US "academe" and military accepting Ukrainian propaganda about shooting
      down "most" of Russian drones and missiles, including hypersonic ones. Where are,
      one may ask, those "satellite radar" data on Yuzhmash? I thought so. This is Nevatim
      base last year. You can all see how "effective" Israeli AD is, all 84% of it/s.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the concealment by Israel of Iranian
      missile strikes on key military sites during a recent conflict, highlighting the
      effectiveness of Israeli air defenses and criticizing the portrayal of their performance

    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Andrei Martyanov discusses the concealed
      impact of Iranian missile strikes on Israeli military sites during a 12-day conflict,
      as reported by The Telegraph based on radar data from Oregon State University.
      The data indicates that several Iranian missiles successfully hit key military
      facilities in Israel, including an air base and intelligence center, although
      the extent of the damage remains unclear due to military censorship. While Israeli
      and US air defenses reportedly intercepted most incoming missiles, the effectiveness
      of these defenses is questioned, with claims of an 84% success rate being labeled
      as propaganda. Martyanov criticizes the narrative surrounding the air defense
      performance, suggesting it masks a significant failure and highlights broader
      issues with Western air defense systems.

    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the portrayal of U.S. and Israeli air
      defense systems in the media, arguing that they are ineffective and highlighting
      the devastation faced by Israel, while also referencing Andrei Martyanov's significant
      works on military affairs and the shifting global power dynamics involving Russia
      and China.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post by Andrei Martyanov, the author critiques
      the portrayal of U.S. and Israeli air defense systems in the media, suggesting
      that they are being misrepresented to obscure their failures, particularly in
      the context of Israel's military engagements, which he argues have left the country
      severely damaged. Martyanov references a guest columnist's analysis that highlights
      the ineffectiveness of these defense systems, using images of destruction in Israeli
      cities to illustrate his point. He also promotes his own book, "The (Real) Revolution
      in Military Affairs," which argues that the U.S. faces significant challenges
      from rising powers like Russia and China, warning that a formal alliance between
      them could spell the end of U.S. global dominance. The post reflects Martyanov's
      broader concerns about military strategy and the implications of current geopolitical
      dynamics.
