summary: |
  As the global balance of power continues to shift, recent commentary by **Andrei Martyanov** underscores the accelerating decline of U.S. military supremacy and the deepening strategic partnership between Russia and China. This context frames the latest developments in U.S.-Russia relations, Western military capacity, and the broader implications for international security.
  
  The most recent analysis from **Martyanov** challenges the narrative of a once-promising rapport between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He asserts that any notion of a "bromance" was illusory, noting, "Russia gave Trump a chance, but it was clear early on he could not deliver peace in Ukraine and prioritized personal ambition." Martyanov further contends that the U.S. is incapable of mediating the Ukraine conflict due to its role as an instigator, and criticizes Trump for advancing Israeli interests above American ones. This, he argues, exacerbates the risk of escalation with nuclear powers.
  
  On the military front, Martyanov reiterates the "significant decline of U.S. military supremacy," emphasizing that the U.S. is no longer able to maintain its traditional dominance in the face of Russian and Chinese advances. He points to the potential formalization of a military-political alliance between Moscow and Beijing as a pivotal threat to U.S. global standing, stating that such an alliance would "most definitely" end American hegemony. The urgency of understanding these shifting dynamics is highlighted as essential for avoiding catastrophic conflict, especially nuclear war.
  
  Recent revelations about Trump’s approach to Russia further illustrate the unpredictability of U.S. policy. In reference to a CNN audio clip, Martyanov notes Trump’s claim that he threatened to "bomb the sh*t out of Moscow" if Russia invaded Ukraine, but observes that "Putin only believed him 10%," underscoring Trump’s lack of credibility and the unseriousness with which such threats are regarded in Moscow.
  
  **Trends and Predictions:**  
  The consensus across Martyanov’s recent writings is clear: the U.S. is rapidly losing its ability to project power globally, both due to material shortages—such as dwindling missile stockpiles—and the erosion of its strategic credibility. The likelihood of a formal Russia-China alliance is described as "most definitely" leading to the end of U.S. global dominance. The risk of miscalculation and escalation, particularly with nuclear-armed adversaries, is rising. Martyanov guarantees that unless U.S. policymakers fundamentally reassess their approach and recognize the new realities of military and geopolitical power, the era of American supremacy is ending.

      Blog Tuesday, July 8, 2025 There Never Was Any "Bromance". Russians knew who Trump
      was already in 2018-19. Trump says Putin ‘just wants to kill people’ — is their
      bromance over? Russia was willing to give this Admin a chance, while Russian General
      Staff was dealing with REAL strategy. Trump blew it, big time and that was clear
      after roughly first 100 of his presidency. As The Times notes: The US policy reversal
      came as Trump appeared to be re-evaluating his relations with Putin. In an unusually
      frank admission of failure, the US president confessed last week that he had been
      unable to use his “great relationship” with the Russian leader to secure a peace
      deal in Ukraine , or even a ceasefire. Trump didn''t want any "peace deal" in
      404, he wanted a pause for the combined West while satisfying his narcissists''
      aspirations. The choice was between Trump and a real high probability of nuclear
      exchange if the cackling idiotess would have been elected. Russians naturally
      supported the lesser of the two evils. In the end, the United States cannot be
      a mediator--it is an instigator and a party to the conflict and because of that
      it is a losing side. Trump better concentrate on what he does best--promoting
      Israel''s interests at the expense of the American ones. Posted by smoothiex12

      policy and the potential risks of escalating tensions with nuclear powers like
      Russia and China.

      Blog Tuesday, July 8, 2025 Granted, It Is CNN. But still, the audio is available.
      Donnie chose a very wrong country to threaten and fuck with. Donald Trump told
      a private gathering of donors last year that he once sought to deter Russian President
      Vladimir Putin from attacking Ukraine by threatening to “bomb the sh*t out of
      Moscow” in retaliation, according to audio provided to CNN. “With Putin I said,
      ‘If you go into Ukraine, I’m going to bomb the sh*t out of Moscow. I’m telling
      you I have no choice,’” Trump said during one 2024 fundraiser, according to the
      audio. “And then [Putin] goes, like, ‘I don’t believe you.’ But he believed me
      10%.” Here is audio. The news itself is not new, it is a good insight into Trump''s
      psychology, though, and into his utter lack of statesmanship qualities. But somebody
      should have told him that "believing 10%" to something means that people know
      100% that you are full of shit. He chose a very wrong man to get into the dick
      measuring contest with. Here are more details from Canadians . As democracy is
      perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the
      people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain
      folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last, and the White House
      will be adorned by a downright moron. Prescient by Mencken. Posted by smoothiex12

    one_sentence_summary: In a private donor meeting, Donald Trump revealed he threatened
      to "bomb the sh*t out of Moscow" to deter Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine,
      highlighting his lack of diplomatic finesse and understanding of international
      relations.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post, Andrei Martyanov discusses an audio clip
      released by CNN in which Donald Trump recounts a conversation with Vladimir Putin,
      claiming he threatened to "bomb the sh*t out of Moscow" if Russia invaded Ukraine.
      Trump’s assertion that Putin only "believed him 10%" is interpreted by Martyanov
      as indicative of Trump's lack of credibility and statesmanship. The article reflects
      on the implications of Trump's comments, suggesting he miscalculated the seriousness
      of his threats and the nature of international relations, while also referencing
      a quote by H.L. Mencken about the potential decline of political leadership in
      America.

      on the precarious nature of an artist's life, humorously noting an incident where
      an artist with multiple injuries was rushed to the emergency room. The post also
      highlights Martyanov's significant contributions to military analysis, particularly
      through his book "The (Real) Revolution in Military Affairs," which argues for
      the necessity of understanding modern military dynamics in a world where the U.S.
      faces formidable nuclear powers like Russia and China. He emphasizes the importance
      of this book for Americans who value peace and wish to avoid nuclear conflict,
      suggesting that the potential formalization of a military alliance between Russia
      and China could spell doom for U.S. global dominance.

      Blog Tuesday, July 8, 2025 Sounds About Right. Of course, some ever doubtful people
      forwarded the idea that the "10 batteries" was supposed to be sent, but the issue
      here is that the US simply has no missiles left for itself. US President Donald
      Trump has promised to send more Patriot missiles to Ukraine, but the number will
      apparently be very limited, Axios has reported, citing sources briefed on a recent
      call between Trump and Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. Last week, the Pentagon
      announced the suspension of some weapons shipments to Ukraine, including precision
      munitions and air defense interceptors, citing concerns over depleting US stockpiles.
      On Monday, however, Trump stated that Washington would continue sending “defensive
      weapons” to Kiev. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell has also confirmed that,
      at the president’s direction, the Department of Defense would “send additional
      defensive weapons to Ukraine.” Trump did not disclose exactly which weapons would
      be delivered or in what amount, but according to Axios, the US leader told Zelensky
      during a phone call on Friday that the US would immediately send ten Patriot missile
      interceptors. If you think that this is a joke--don''t. It is not. Go to may two
      last videos where I talk about untouchable stores and that the US is being demilitarized
      together with 404. Remarkably--and I will be talking about it in my today''s video--The
      Guardian corroborates. US only has 25% of all Patriot missile interceptors needed
      for Pentagon’s military plans. Exclusive: Low stockpiles for the crucial Patriot
      missile interceptors led to Trump administration pausing transfers to Ukraine
      That tells you everything you need to know about US industrial capacity or rather
      lack thereof, and why NATO behaves the way it does. Trump, who is most likely
      completely compromised by Israel, evidently doesn''t even understand basic economics
      and that figures he gets on GDP, whether nominal or PPP, do not reflect the reality.
      Especially in the military-industrial field. It is a catastrophe in a slow, however
      accelerating, motion. Posted by smoothiex12 at 9:41 AM Email This BlogThis! Share

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the U.S. military's dwindling stockpile
      of Patriot missiles, highlighting President Trump's limited commitment to sending
      additional defensive weapons to Ukraine amid concerns about depleting U.S. resources.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post, Andrei Martyanov discusses the dwindling
      U.S. missile stockpiles amid ongoing military support for Ukraine. Despite President
      Donald Trump's commitment to send additional Patriot missiles, reports indicate
      that the U.S. military is facing significant shortages, with only 25% of the necessary
      Patriot missile interceptors available for its strategic plans. This situation
      has led to the suspension of some weapons shipments to Ukraine due to concerns
      about depleting U.S. resources. Martyanov criticizes the U.S. military-industrial

      Saturday, June 7, 2025 Open Thread. Very busy. Go at it. But before--NATO "elites"
      continue to demonstrate the depth of cretinism. Russia is at war with Britain,
      the US is no longer a reliable ally and the UK has to respond by becoming more
      cohesive and more resilient, according to one of the three authors of the strategic
      defence review. Fiona Hill, from County Durham, became the White House’s chief
      Russia adviser during Donald Trump’s first term and contributed to the British
      government’s strategy. She made the remarks in an interview with the Guardian. “We’re
      in pretty big trouble,” Hill said, describing the UK’s geopolitical situation
      as caught between “the rock” of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and “the hard place” of
      Donald Trump’s increasingly unpredictable US. If Russia would have been "at war
      with Britain", Britain would cease to exist. But never mind--she is an "expert".

    one_sentence_summary: The article consists of a series of open thread posts from
      Andrei Martyanov's blog, discussing various geopolitical issues, particularly
      the tensions between Russia, the UK, and the US, while also highlighting the author's
      busy schedule and personal updates.
    paragraph_summary: The article from Andrei Martyanov's blog features a series of
      open threads where the author invites readers to engage in discussions on various
      topics, primarily related to geopolitical issues and military affairs. A notable
      highlight is a comment on the UK's strategic defense review by Fiona Hill, who
      expresses concern over the UK's precarious position between Russia and an unpredictable
      United States, suggesting that the UK needs to become more cohesive and resilient.
      Martyanov critiques Hill's perspective, emphasizing the absurdity of her claim
      that Russia is "at war with Britain." The blog also touches on the author's personal
      updates and reflections on military and geopolitical dynamics, underscoring the
      complexities of international relations in the current era.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses a statement made by Trump regarding
      tariffs on Japanese cars, while also highlighting the significance of Andrei Martyanov's
      book on military affairs, which argues that the U.S. faces a serious threat from
      the military alliance between Russia and China.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post, Andrei Martyanov reflects on the geopolitical
      landscape, particularly highlighting a statement from former President Trump regarding
      a 25% tariff on Japanese cars, juxtaposed with the ongoing success of American
      brands like Mr. Coffee. Martyanov emphasizes the critical nature of military dynamics
      in his book "Losing Military Supremacy," where he argues that the United States
      faces significant challenges from nuclear and industrial powers like Russia and
      China. He warns that a formal alliance between these two nations could lead to
      the decline of U.S. global dominance, underscoring the importance of understanding
      military affairs in a post-MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) world. The blog
      serves as a commentary on current events and a call to recognize the shifting
      balance of power in international relations.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post, Andrei Martyanov reflects on the obsolescence
      of the U.S. Navy's surface force, particularly focusing on the FFG Constellation,
      which he views as emblematic of this decline. He emphasizes the critical insights
      from his book, "Losing Military Supremacy," which argues that the United States
      faces significant challenges from nuclear and industrial superpowers like Russia
      and China. Martyanov warns that a formal military-political alliance between these
      two nations could spell disaster for U.S. global dominance. He advocates for a
      reevaluation of military strategies in a post-MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction)
      world, underscoring the importance of avoiding nuclear conflict.

      Blog Friday, July 4, 2025 Larch Dug Up An Interesting Piece ... ... on Chinese
      HQ-9 AD complex. In support of the facts in this piece you have to recall that
      during recent (few years ago) tensions around Taiwan with the US Navy maneuvering
      in the area, China moved all its available S-400s and its regiment of SU-35 closer
      to the coast. Mind you, this is all after non-stop claims that HQ-9 is better
      than S-400. I omit here this Su-35 saga. Here is this piece and huge thanks to
      our good friend Larch. The Chinese "S-400 competitor" turned out to be weak Pakistan
      is dissatisfied with the performance of the HQ-9B complex, which was advertised
      in China as "more advanced than the Russian Triumph." Local conflicts, such as
      the Indo-Pakistani war, are often particularly interesting because of these duels,
      where systems that were competing in peacetime find themselves on the front lines
      against each other. The Chinese anti-aircraft missile system, like the S-400,
      is based on the Soviet S-300PM system. The first models were presented in the
      early 1990s, and since then, several modifications have been developed, each more
      advanced than the last. The latest model, with the letter "B" and an integrated
      AESA radar and digital combat control system, was introduced by the Chinese in
      2021. It was positioned as a "more advanced competitor to the S-400," although
      the Chinese were the first to acquire the "Triumfs" and are now using them in
      the most critical areas. But what can not be said for the sake of marketing. Many
      countries were quite satisfied with this relatively inexpensive alternative, and
      it has recently become one of the most exported high-tech products from China''s
      military-industrial complex. Pakistan acquired the HQ-9B in 2021. Its combat debut
      took place during the brief conflict in May. However, it was a bit of a misfire.
      The system managed to intercept some of the French SCALP-EG cruise missiles launched
      by the Rafales, but it was completely ineffective against the Russian-Indian BrahMos
      missiles, which caused significant damage to Pakistan''s rear airfields. Shortly
      after the end of the conflict, Islamabad requested more advanced HQ-19 systems
      from Beijing, and tried not to even discuss the operation of the HQ-9B. However,
      it is now revealed that behind this conspiracy of silence lay a deep disappointment
      with one of China''s top air defense systems. Pakistanis on military forums complained
      that the complex is highly susceptible to electronic warfare systems, and its
      missiles require constant target illumination, which in turn quickly attracts
      enemy anti-radar missiles. At least one full battery protecting the key Nur Khan
      airbase was destroyed by Indian Rudram-1 anti-radar missiles. The Pakistani military
      also complained that the HQ-9B could only shoot down subsonic cruise missiles,
      even though the advertisement promised that all missiles, including hypersonic
      and quasi-ballistic missiles, would be shot down. This example once again proves
      that the original is always better than a copy, especially when the developer
      of that copy uses the original Russian Triumph for their own urgent needs. So,
      make your own conclusions. Posted by smoothiex12 at 12:14 PM Email This BlogThis!

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the performance and reputation of China's
      HQ-9B air defense system, which was marketed as a superior alternative to Russia's
      S-400 system. Despite claims of advanced capabilities, particularly in the context
      of recent military tensions involving Pakistan and India, the HQ-9B has faced
      criticism for its effectiveness. During a recent conflict, it successfully intercepted
      some French missiles but failed against Indian BrahMos missiles, leading to significant
      damage for Pakistan. Complaints from Pakistani military forums highlight the system's
      vulnerabilities to electronic warfare and its limitations in targeting advanced
      missiles, raising doubts about its touted superiority. The piece suggests that
      the original Russian systems are more reliable than their Chinese counterparts,
      emphasizing the challenges faced by countries relying on the HQ-9B.

    one_sentence_summary: In a blog post, Andrei Martyanov discusses the dire state
      of U.S. strategic forces under the START framework, suggesting that the U.S. has
      lost its military supremacy and that any potential military-political alliance
      between Russia and China could lead to the end of U.S. global power.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post, Andrei Martyanov discusses the current
      state of U.S. strategic forces within the framework of the START treaty, asserting
      that the U.S. has effectively lost its position, leaving no room for meaningful
      dialogue with Russia. He expresses concern over former President Trump's dissatisfaction,
      emphasizing the dire implications of the U.S. military's decline in the face of
      rising powers like Russia and China. Martyanov highlights his book, "Losing Military
      Supremacy," which argues that a formal military-political alliance between Russia
      and China could signal the end of U.S. dominance as a global power. The post underscores
      the urgent need for a reevaluation of military strategies to avoid catastrophic
      conflicts, particularly nuclear ones.

      Blog Saturday, July 5, 2025 Say It Ain''t So. In related news--water is wet, fire
      is hot and concrete floors are hard. Israel concealed that Iranian missiles hit
      several key military sites across the country during the recent 12-day war, The
      Telegraph reported on Saturday, citing radar data. The data, provided to the British
      paper by Oregon State University researchers who track bomb damage using satellite
      radar, indicates that six Iranian missiles hit five military facilities in the
      north, south, and center of Israel, including a major air base, an intelligence
      gathering center, and a logistics base. The extent of the reported damage is unclear.
      However, the hits were not publicly reported due to heavy military censorship,
      according to the report. When pressed on the issue, the Israel Defense Forces,
      declined to comment, only saying that “all relevant units maintained functional
      continuity throughout the operation.” But this is not what catches an eye, no.
      This does: Analysis cited by The Telegraph suggests that Israeli and US air defenses
      generally performed well, intercepting most of the incoming fire, although the
      share of missiles that penetrated through Israeli defenses rose to about 16% by
      the seventh day. The paper noted that this could have been linked with Israeli
      attempts to conserve ammunition, improved tactics by Iran, or the deployment of
      more advanced and harder-to-intercept weaponry. This is an utter BS, concocted
      for hiding a devastating effect of Iranian strikes and a pathetic performance
      by Israeli-US AD, which led Israel to begging for a cease-fire. A "performance"
      corroborated by a dismal (lack of) effectiveness of NATO AD complexes in 404--which
      IS a feature of all West''s AD systems. While classifying the impact of strikes
      is understandable, claims of 84% "effectiveness", especially from some "researches"
      from Oregon State University are down right propaganda, considering the well established
      trend of most US "academe" and military accepting Ukrainian propaganda about shooting
      down "most" of Russian drones and missiles, including hypersonic ones. Where are,
      one may ask, those "satellite radar" data on Yuzhmash? I thought so. This is Nevatim
      base last year. You can all see how "effective" Israeli AD is, all 84% of it/s.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the concealment by Israel of Iranian
      missile strikes on key military sites during a recent conflict, highlighting the
      effectiveness of Israeli air defenses and criticizing the portrayal of their performance
      as overly optimistic amidst evidence of significant damage.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Andrei Martyanov discusses the concealed
      impact of Iranian missile strikes on Israeli military sites during a 12-day conflict,
      as reported by The Telegraph based on radar data from Oregon State University.
      The data indicates that several Iranian missiles successfully hit key military
      facilities in Israel, including an air base and intelligence center, although
      the extent of the damage remains unclear due to military censorship. While Israeli
      and US air defenses reportedly intercepted most incoming missiles, the effectiveness
      of these defenses is questioned, with claims of an 84% success rate being labeled
      as propaganda. Martyanov criticizes the narrative surrounding the air defense
      performance, suggesting it masks a significant failure and highlights broader
      issues with Western air defense systems.

    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the portrayal of U.S. and Israeli air
      defense systems in the media, arguing that they are ineffective and highlighting
      the devastation faced by Israel, while also referencing Andrei Martyanov's significant
      works on military affairs and the shifting global power dynamics involving Russia
      and China.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent blog post by Andrei Martyanov, the author critiques
      the portrayal of U.S. and Israeli air defense systems in the media, suggesting
      that they are being misrepresented to obscure their failures, particularly in
      the context of Israel's military engagements, which he argues have left the country
      severely damaged. Martyanov references a guest columnist's analysis that highlights
      the ineffectiveness of these defense systems, using images of destruction in Israeli
      cities to illustrate his point. He also promotes his own book, "The (Real) Revolution
      in Military Affairs," which argues that the U.S. faces significant challenges
      from rising powers like Russia and China, warning that a formal alliance between
      them could spell the end of U.S. global dominance. The post reflects Martyanov's
      broader concerns about military strategy and the implications of current geopolitical
      dynamics.
