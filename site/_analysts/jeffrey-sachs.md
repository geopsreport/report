summary: |
  As President Trump arrives in the Gulf this week, the Middle East faces a pivotal moment with the potential for historic change. The region’s leaders, unified in their message, are pressing the United States to lift its veto on Palestine’s admission to the United Nations—a move seen as the linchpin for peace and economic development across the region. According to **Jeffrey Sachs**, “All Arab partnerships with the US and of course with Israel are contingent upon a lasting peace through the two-state solution, which the US can bring about.”
  
  **Recent Diplomatic Shifts and US Policy**
  The Trump administration is signaling a significant departure from previous US foreign policy, emphasizing pragmatic deal-making and direct diplomacy. Notably, diplomatic channels have been opened with Iran, with both sides now entering a fourth round of nuclear talks in Oman. President Trump has expressed optimism, stating, “I think we’re going to make a deal with Iran,” and has shown willingness to meet with Iran’s president. Additionally, the US recently brokered a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen and negotiated directly with Hamas to secure the release of a hostage. These moves underscore a broader US strategy shift: prioritizing peace and US strategic interests over longstanding alliances with Israel’s current government.
  
  **Israel’s Growing Isolation**
  Israel’s far-right government, led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, remains steadfast in its opposition to a Palestinian state and continues military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. However, international patience is waning. Even the UK, once a reliable supporter, has now publicly opposed any Israeli annexation of Gaza. As **Sachs** notes, “This Israeli government is now completely isolated in the international community.” The majority of UN member states, along with the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, have reiterated their support for the two-state solution, with the upcoming High-level International Conference on Palestine poised to further solidify this consensus.
  
  **Trends and Predictions**
  The momentum for a two-state solution is at its highest in decades, with Arab states making clear that normalization with Israel and continued US partnerships depend on Palestinian statehood. The Trump administration’s willingness to engage diplomatically with Iran and regional actors signals a high likelihood of further breakthroughs. **Sachs** predicts with high confidence: “If the US backs the admission of Palestine to the UN, this will happen.” Should the US shift its position, the region could see a rapid move toward peace, economic investment, and stability. Conversely, continued Israeli intransigence risks deepening its isolation and economic decline.
  
  In summary, the coming days represent a historic opportunity for the US and its Arab partners to reshape the Middle East through diplomacy, with the two-state solution as the foundation for lasting peace. The prevailing expectation among analysts is that the US is quite likely to seize this moment, setting the stage for a new era in the region.

  - title: This is Trump’s moment to deliver peace to the Middle East
    url: https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/5/14/this-is-trumps-moment-to-deliver-peace-to-the-middle-east
    text: 'The Arab world stands at a crossroad – a moment of truth that hinges on the
      region’s unified leadership and moral clarity. As President Trump arrives in the
      Gulf this week, seeking investments and strategic partnerships, the opportunity
      for regional peace and security is overwhelmingly clear. The Arab leaders should
      explain clearly to President Trump that peace and economic development in the
      Middle East are within reach and depend on one critical condition: The admission
      of Palestine to the United Nations as its 194th member state.


      For this to become a reality, the United States must lift its veto on Palestine’s
      entry to the UN. As the President meets with regional partners, he should hear
      an unambiguous message from his counterparts: All Arab partnerships with the US
      and of course with Israel are contingent upon a lasting peace through the two-state
      solution, which the US can bring about.


      What is at stake is not simply a diplomatic negotiation. The two-state solution
      is a practical imperative and a test of international resolve. There can be no
      peace in the region, and no long-term development, if Israel continues to maraud
      its way through Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and others. Israel must be compelled
      – through diplomacy – to live within its own borders, and to allow Palestine to
      live within its legal borders, those of June 4, 1967. If the US backs the admission
      of Palestine to the UN, this will happen.


      The stakes could not be higher. The US would receive a windfall of investments.
      The Middle East would achieve normalcy and the basis for a surge of economic development,
      and both Israel and Palestine would live in peace.

      The Trump administration, in a significant departure from previous administrations,
      is moving towards a foreign policy centred on pragmatic deal-making diplomacy.


      Under his guidance, diplomatic negotiation channels were opened with Iran – as
      both countries enter their fourth round of negotiations in Oman regarding nuclear
      talks. President Trump has repeatedly stated his willingness to reach consensus:
      “I think we’re going to make a deal with Iran”, and is even willing to meet Iran’s
      president. Similarly, the US reached a ceasefire agreement with the Houthis in
      Yemen last week, an encouraging step for both global trade and stability. Another
      bold diplomatic manoeuvre is the US direct negotiations with Hamas, which resulted
      in the release of hostage Edan Alexander.


      It has become increasingly clear that President Trump holds US strategic interests
      above all else, and that he correctly views peace as his country’s overarching
      strategic interest. This translates into true potential for peace in the Middle
      East.


      The foes of peace in Israel’s extremist government want us to believe that there
      is an intrinsic, almost innate reason for the war on Palestine to continue. In
      essentially racist terms, Netanyahu and his ilk are arguing that peace with Palestinians,
      based on Palestinian political self-determination and self-rule, is impossible.
      The result is Israel’s brutal destruction and de facto annexation of Gaza and
      Israel’s ongoing war on Palestinians in the West Bank.


      Netanyahu’s government has two main interests: Continuing the war in Gaza and
      the West Bank to block a Palestinian state, and drawing the United States into
      direct confrontation with Iran. Both are contrary to US interests.


      This Israeli government is now completely isolated in the international community.
      Even the United Kingdom, previously a staunch supporter of Netanyahu’s war, has
      shifted its position. Minister for the Middle East Hamish Falconer stated that
      the government’s position is “crystal clear”: “We strongly oppose the expansion
      of Israel’s operations. Any attempt to annex land in Gaza would be unacceptable.”


      The vast majority of UN member states have already demonstrated their support
      for the two-state solution, most recently by adopting the UN General Assembly
      resolution. The will of the global community is clear: Israel’s illegal occupation
      must end, and a Palestinian State must be established in accordance with international
      law. This is possible under the mantle of the United Nations, this upcoming June,
      during the High-level International Conference on Palestine.

      Peace has been the generational clear-cut position of the League of Arab States,
      the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and all regional partners. The Arab Peace
      Initiative (API), adopted at the Beirut Summit in 2002 and reiterated consistently
      over the years, demands Israel’s withdrawal from the occupied territory and the
      establishment of a Palestinian state as the basis for peace and diplomatic normalisation
      with Israel.


      President Trump and the Arab leaders have a historic opportunity this week to
      end a conflict that has raged for one century. By adopting the two-state solution,
      Trump would not only bring peace to Israel and Palestine, but also to Lebanon,
      Syria, and Iran. An agreement between the US and Iran regarding nuclear non-proliferation
      and an end to US sanctions on Iran would immediately come within reach. Belligerents
      could lay down their arms, and rebuilding and economic development could come
      to the forefront. In short, this week offers the extraordinary opportunity for
      the US and the Arab world to make history, for the benefit of the entire Middle
      East, including Israel and Palestine, and indeed for the benefit of the entire
      world.

      as President Trump visits the Gulf, emphasizing the need for unified leadership
      and moral clarity to achieve peace and economic development in the region. The
      author argues that the key to this progress lies in the admission of Palestine
      as the 194th member state of the United Nations, contingent upon the U.S. lifting
      its veto. The two-state solution is presented as essential for lasting peace,
      with the article highlighting the negative impact of Israel's actions on regional
      stability. It also notes a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards pragmatic diplomacy,
      including negotiations with Iran and Hamas. The piece calls for a historic opportunity
      for Trump and Arab leaders to resolve a century-long conflict, suggesting that
      achieving peace could lead to broader stability and economic development throughout
      the Middle East.

  - title: The Time Has Arrived for a Comprehensive Middle East Peace
    url: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/middle-east-peace-plan
    text: 'The attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran had two significant effects. First,
      it once again exposed the root cause of turmoil in the region: Israel’s project
      to “reshape the Middle East” through regime change, aimed at maintaining its dominance
      and blocking a Palestinian state. Second, it highlighted the futility and recklessness
      of this strategy. The only path to peace is a comprehensive agreement that addresses
      Palestine’s statehood, Israel’s security, Iran’s peaceful nuclear program, and
      the economic recovery of the region.




      Israel wants to topple the Iranian government because Iran has supported proxies
      and non-state actors aligned with the Palestinians. Israel has also consistently
      undermined U.S.-Iran diplomacy regarding Iran’s nuclear program.


      Instead of endless wars, Israel’s security can be ensured by two key diplomatic
      steps—ending militancy by establishing a Palestinian state with United Nations
      Security Council guarantees, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful
      and verifiable nuclear program.


      Israel has driven the region to a 4,000-kilometer swash of violence from Libya
      to Iran through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately
      aimed at preventing a State of Palestine by “remaking” the Middle East.


      The far-right Israeli government’s refusal to accept a Palestinian state is the
      root of the problem.


      When the British empire promised a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine in 1917,
      the Palestinian Arabs constituted 90% of the population and Jews less than 10%
      of the population. In 1947, with intense U.S. lobbying, the U.N. General Assembly
      voted to grant 56% of Palestine to a new Zionist state , while the Jews were only
      33% of the population. Palestinians rejected this as a violation of their right
      to self-determination. After the 1948 war, Israel expanded to 78% of Palestine,
      and in 1967, occupied the remaining 22% —Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem,
      and the Golan Heights.


      Instead of returning occupied lands in exchange for peace, Israeli right-wing
      politicians insisted on permanent control of 100% of the land, with the Likud
      founding charter declaring in 1977 that there would be only Israeli sovereignty
      “between the Sea and Jordan.”


      Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu represents this policy of domination—and
      has served as prime minister for a total of 17 years since 1996. When he came
      to power, he and his U.S. neocon allies authored the “ Clean Break ” strategy
      to block the creation of a Palestinian state. Instead of pursuing land for peace,
      Israel aimed to reshape the Middle East by overthrowing governments that supported
      the Palestinian cause. The U.S. would be the implementing partner of this strategy.


      This is exactly what happened after 9/11, as the U.S. led or sponsored wars against
      Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon (U.S. funding and arming Israeli aggressions),
      Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (CIA operation during 2010’s), Sudan (supporting
      rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011), and Somalia (backing Ethiopia’s invasion
      in 2006).


      Contrary to the glib promises by Netanyahu to the U.S. Congress in 2002—that regime
      change in Iraq would bring a new day to the Middle East—the 2003 Iraq War augured
      the events that were to come across the region. Iraq descended into turmoil, and
      since then, each new war has brought death, destruction, and economic disarray.


      This month, Israel attacked Iran even as negotiations between Iran and the U.S.
      were underway to ensure the peaceful use of Iran’s nuclear program—repeating the
      same WMD propaganda that Netanyahu used to justify the Iraq War.


      Israel has been claiming for more than 30 years that Iran is on the verge of acquiring
      nuclear weapons. However, on June 18, 2025, the International Atomic Energy Agency
      (IAEA) director general stated that there is “no proof of a systematic effort”
      by Iran to develop nuclear weapons. More to the point, Iran and the U.S. were
      actively engaged in negotiations according to which the IAEA would monitor and
      verify the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program.


      The attack on Iran proves yet again the futility and nihilism of Netanyahu’s approach.
      The Israeli and U.S. attacks accomplished nothing positive. According to most
      analysts, Iran’s enriched uranium remains intact, but is now in a secret location
      rather than under IAEA monitoring. In the meantime, with Israel’s ongoing genocide
      in Gaza, neither peace nor security have been achieved.


      Israel has driven the region to a 4,000-kilometer swash of violence from Libya
      to Iran through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately
      aimed at preventing a State of Palestine by “remaking” the Middle East.


      The solution is clear: It is time for the United States to recognize that its
      own strategic interests require a decisive break from partnering in Israel’s destructive
      strategy.


      Prioritizing genuine peace in the Middle East is not only a moral imperative,
      but a fundamental U.S. interest—one that can only be achieved through a comprehensive
      peace deal. The key pillar of this deal is for the U.S. to lift its veto on a
      Palestinian State on the borders of June 4, 1967, and to do so at the start, not
      in some vague distant future that never actually arrives.


      For more than 20 years, Arab nations have backed a practical peace plan . So too
      has the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), with its 57 member countries,
      and the League of Arab States (LAS), with its 22 members. So too have almost all
      the nations in the U.N. General Assembly. So too has the International Court of
      Justice in its 2024 ruling that Israel’s occupation is illegal. Only Israel, with
      support from the U.S. veto, has stood in the way.


      Here is a seven-point peace plan in which all parties would benefit. Israel would
      gain peace and security. Palestine would achieve statehood. Iran would win an
      end to economic sanctions. The U.S. would win an end to costly and illegal wars
      fought on Israel’s behalf, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation if the
      current violence continues. The Middle East would win economic development, security,
      and justice.'
    one_sentence_summary: The recent attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran has underscored
      the destructive nature of Israel's strategy to reshape the Middle East through
      regime change, revealing the need for a comprehensive peace agreement that addresses
      Palestinian statehood, Israel's security, and Iran's nuclear program to achieve
      lasting stability in the region.
    paragraph_summary: 'The recent attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran has underscored

      for Palestinians, and subsequent Israeli policies have aimed at permanent control
      over these lands. The article argues that true security for Israel can only be

      state and the lifting of sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful nuclear

  - title: Stop Netanyahu Before He Gets Us All Killed
    url: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/netanyahu-war-on-iran
    text: 'For nearly 30 years, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has driven
      the Middle East into war and destruction. The man is a powder keg of violence.
      Throughout all the wars that he has championed, Netanyahu has always dreamed of
      the big one: to defeat and overthrow the Iranian Government. His long-sought war,
      just launched, might just get us all killed in a nuclear Armageddon, unless Netanyahu
      is stopped.


      Netanyahu’s fixation on war goes back to his extremist mentors, Ze’ev Jabotinsky,
      Yitzhak Shamir, and Menachem Begin. The older generation believed that Zionists
      should use whatever violence–wars, assassinations, terror–is needed to achieve
      their aims of eliminating any Palestinian claim to a homeland.


      The founders of Netanyahu’s political movement, the Likud, called for exclusive
      Zionist control over all of what had been British Mandatory Palestine. At the
      start of the British Mandate in the early 1920s, the Muslim and Christian Arabs
      constituted roughly 87% of the population and owned ten times more land than the
      Jewish population. As of 1948, the Arabs still outnumbered the Jews roughly two
      to one. Nonetheless, the founding charter of Likud (1977) declared that “between
      the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.” The now infamous
      chant, “from the River to the Sea,” which is characterized as anti-Semitic, turns
      out to be the anti-Palestinian rallying call of the Likud.


      Israel’s war on Iran is the final move in a decades-old strategy. We are witnessing
      the culmination of decades of extremist Zionist manipulation of US foreign policy.


      The challenge for Likud was how to pursue its maximalist aims despite their blatant
      illegality under international law and morality, both of which call for a two-state
      solution.


      In 1996, Netanyahu and his American advisors devised a “ Clean Break ” strategy.
      They advocated that Israel would not withdraw from the Palestinian lands captured
      in the 1967 war in exchange for regional peace. Instead, Israel would reshape
      the Middle East to its liking. Crucially, the strategy envisioned the US as the
      main force to achieve these aims—waging wars in the region to dismantle governments
      opposed to Israel’s dominance over Palestine. The US was called upon to fight
      wars on Israel’s behalf.


      The Clean Break strategy was effectively carried out by the US and Israel after
      9/11. As NATO Supreme Commander General Wesley Clark revealed , soon after 9/11,
      the US planned to “attack and destroy the governments in seven countries in five
      years—starting with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran.”


      The first of the wars, in early 2003, was to topple the Iraqi government. Plans
      for further wars were delayed as the US became mired in Iraq. Still, the US supported
      Sudan’s split in 2005, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 2006, and Ethiopia’s incursion
      into Somalia that same year. In 2011, the Obama administration launched CIA operation
      Timber Sycamore against Syria and, with the UK and France, overthrew Libya’s government
      through a 2011 bombing campaign. Today, these countries lie in ruins, and many
      are now embroiled in civil wars.


      Netanyahu was a cheerleader of these wars of choice–either in public or behind
      the scenes–together with his neocon allies in the U.S. Government including Paul
      Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, Victoria Nuland, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Richard
      Perle, Elliott Abrams, and others.


      Testifying in the U.S. Congress in 2002, Netanyahu pitched for the disastrous
      war in Iraq, declaring “If you take out Saddam, Saddam’s regime, I guarantee you
      that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.” He continued,
      “And I think that people sitting right next door in Iran, young people, and many
      others, will say the time of such regimes, of such despots is gone.” He also falsely
      told Congress, “There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking, is working,
      is advancing towards to the development of nuclear weapons.”


      The slogan to remake a “New Middle East” provides the slogan for these wars. Initially
      stated in 1996 through “Clean Break,” it was popularized by Secretary Condoleezza
      Rice in 2006. As Israel was brutally bombarding Lebanon, Rice stated:


      “What we''re seeing here, in a sense, is the growing -- the birth pangs of a new
      Middle East and whatever we do we have to be certain that we''re pushing forward
      to the new Middle East not going back to the old one.”


      In September 2023, Netanyahu presented at UN General Assembly a map of the “ New
      Middle East” completely erasing a Palestinian state. In September 2024, he elaborated
      on this plan by showing two maps : one part of the Middle East a “blessing,” and
      the other–including Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran–a curse, as he advocated regime
      change in the latter countries.


      Israel’s war on Iran is the final move in a decades-old strategy. We are witnessing
      the culmination of decades of extremist Zionist manipulation of US foreign policy.


      The premise of Israel’s attack on Iran is the claim that Iran is on the verge
      of acquiring nuclear weapons. Such a claim is fatuous since Iran has repeatedly
      called for negotiations precisely to remove the nuclear option in return for an
      end to the decades of US sanctions.


      Since 1992, Netanyahu and his supporters have claimed that Iran will become a
      nuclear power “in a few years." In 1995, Israeli officials and their US backers
      declared a 5-year timeline . In 2003, Israel’s Director of Military Intelligence
      said that Iran will be a nuclear power “ by the summer of 2004 .” In 2005, the
      head of Mossad said that Iran could build the bomb in less than 3 years. In 2012,
      Netanyahu claimed at the United Nations that “it’s only a few months, possibly
      a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.” And on
      and on.


      This 30-year-plus pattern of shifting deadlines has marked a deliberate strategy,
      not a failure in prophecy. The claims are propaganda; there is always an “existential
      threat.” More importantly, there is Netanyahu’s phony claim that negotiations
      with Iran are useless.


      Iran has repeatedly said that it does not want a nuclear weapon and that it has
      long been prepared to negotiate. In October 2003, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
      Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production and use of nuclear arms—a ruling
      later officially cited by Iran at an IAEA meeting in Vienna in August 2005 and
      referenced since as a religious and legal barrier to pursuing nuclear weapons.


      Even for those skeptical of Iran’s intentions, Iran has consistently advocated
      for a negotiated agreement supported by independent international verification.
      In contrast, the Zionist lobby has opposed any such settlements, urging the US
      to maintain sanctions and reject deals that would allow strict IAEA monitoring
      in exchange for lifting sanctions.


      In 2016, the Obama Administration, together with the UK, France, Germany, China,
      and Russia, reached the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran—a
      landmark agreement to strictly monitor Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for
      sanctions relief. Yet, under relentless pressure from Netanyahu and the Zionist
      lobby, President Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018. Predictably, when Iran
      responded by expanding its uranium enrichment, it was blamed for violating an
      agreement that the US itself had abandoned. The double-standard and propaganda
      is hard to miss.


      On April 11, 2021, Israel’s Mossad attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities in Natanz.
      Following the attack, on April 16, Iran announced that it would increase its uranium
      enrichment further, as bargaining leverage, while repeatedly appealing for renewed
      negotiations on a deal like the JCPOA. The Biden Administration rejected all such
      negotiations.


      At the start of his second term, Trump agreed to open a new negotiation with Iran.
      Iran pledged to renounce nuclear arms and to be subject to IAEA inspections but
      reserved the right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes. The Trump Administration
      appeared to agree to this point but then reversed itself. Since then, there have
      been five rounds of negotiations, with both sides reporting progress on each occasion.


      The sixth round was ostensibly to take place on Sunday, June 15. Instead, Israel
      launched a preemptive war on Iran on June 12. Trump confirmed that the US knew
      of the attack in advance, even as the administration was speaking publicly of
      the upcoming negotiations.


      Israel’s attack was made not only in the midst of negotiations that were making
      progress, but days before a scheduled UN Conference on Palestine that would have
      advanced the cause of the two-state solution. That conference has now been postponed.


      Israel’s attack on Iran now threatens to escalate to a full-fledged war that draws
      in the US and Europe on the side of Israel and Russia and perhaps Pakistan on
      the side of Iran. We could soon see several nuclear powers pitted against each
      other and dragging the world closer to nuclear annihilation. The Doomsday Clock
      is at 89 seconds to midnight, the closest to nuclear Armageddon since the clock
      was launched in 1947.


      Over the past 30 years, Netanyahu and his US backers have destroyed or destabilized

  - title: How the US and Israel Destroyed Syria and Called it Peace
    url: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/us-israel-syria
    text: 'In the famous lines of Tacitus, Roman historian, “To ravage, to slaughter,
      to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they
      call it peace.”


      In our age, it is Israel and the U.S. that make a desert and call it peace.


      The story is simple. In stark violation of international law, Israeli Prime Minister
      Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers claim the right to rule over seven million
      Palestinian Arabs. When Israel’s occupation of Palestinian lands leads to militant
      resistance, Israel labels the resistance “terrorism” and calls on the U.S. to
      overthrow the Middle East governments that back the “terrorists.” The U.S., under
      the sway of the Israel Lobby, goes to war on Israel’s behalf.


      The fall of Syria this week is the culmination of the Israel-U.S. campaign against
      Syria that goes back to 1996 with Netanyahu’s arrival to office as Prime Minister.
      The Israel-U.S. war on Syria escalated in 2011 and 2012, when Barack Obama covertly
      tasked the CIA with the overthrow of the Syrian Government in Operation Timber
      Sycamore. That effort finally came to “fruition” this week, after more than 300,000
      deaths in the Syrian war since 2011.


      Syria’s fall came swiftly because of more than a decade of crushing economic sanctions,
      the burdens of war, the U.S. seizure of Syria’s oil, Russia’s priorities regarding
      the conflict in Ukraine, and most immediately, Israel’s attacks on Hezbollah,
      which was the key military backstop to the Syrian Government. No doubt Assad often
      misplayed his own hand and faced severe internal discontent, but his regime was
      targeted for collapse for decades by the U.S. and Israel.


      Since 2011, the Israel-U.S. perpetual war on Syria, including bombing, jihadists,
      economic sanctions, U.S. seizure of Syria’s oil fields, and more, has sunk the
      Syrian people into misery.


      Before the U.S.-Israel campaign to overthrow Assad began in earnest in 2011, Syria
      was a functioning, growing middle-income country. In January 2009, the IMF Executive
      Board had this to say:


      Executive Directors welcomed Syria’s strong macroeconomic performance in recent
      years, as manifested in the rapid non-oil GDP growth, comfortable level of foreign
      reserves, and low and declining government debt. This performance reflected both
      robust regional demand and the authorities’ reform efforts to shift toward a more
      market- based economy.


      Since 2011, the Israel-U.S. perpetual war on Syria, including bombing, jihadists,
      economic sanctions, U.S. seizure of Syria’s oil fields, and more, has sunk the
      Syrian people into misery.


      In the immediate two days following the collapse of the government, Israel conducted
      about 480 strikes across Syria, and completely destroyed the Syrian fleet in Latakia.
      Pursuing his expansionist agenda, Prime Minister Netanyahu illegally claimed control
      over the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights and declared that the
      Golan Heights will be a part of the State of Israel “for eternity.”


      Netanyahu’s ambition to transform the region through war, which dates back almost
      three decades, is playing out in front of our eyes. In a press conference on December
      9th, the Israeli prime minister boasted of an “absolute victory,” justifying the
      on-going genocide in Gaza and escalating violence throughout the region:


      I ask you, just think, if we had acceded to those who told us time and again:
      ''"The war must be stopped"– we would not have entered Rafah, we would not have
      seized the Philadelphia Corridor, we would not have eliminated Sinwar, we would
      not have surprised our enemies in Lebanon and the entire world in a daring operation-stratagem,
      we would not have eliminated Nasrallah, we would not have destroyed Hezbollah''s
      underground network, and we would not have exposed Iran''s weakness. The operations
      that we have carried out since the beginning of the war are dismantling the axis
      brick by brick.


      The long history of Israel’s campaign to overthrow the Syrian Government is not
      widely understood, yet the documentary record is clear. Israel’s war on Syria
      began with U.S. and Israeli neoconservatives in 1996, who fashioned a “Clean Break”
      strategy for the Middle East for Netanyahu as he came to office. The core of the
      “clean break” strategy called for the Israel (and the US) to reject “land for
      peace,” the idea that Israel would withdraw from the occupied Palestinian lands
      in return for peace. Instead, Israel would retain the occupied Palestinian lands,
      rule over the Palestinian people in an Apartheid state, step-by-step ethnically
      cleanse the state, and enforce so-called “peace for peace” by overthrowing neighboring
      governments that resisted Israel’s land claims.


      The long history of Israel’s campaign to overthrow the Syrian Government is not
      widely understood, yet the documentary record is clear.


      The Clean Break strategy asserts, “Our claim to the land—to which we have clung
      for hope for 2000 years—is legitimate and noble,” and goes on to state, “Syria
      challenges Israel on Lebanese soil. An effective approach, and one with which
      American can sympathize, would be if Israel seized the strategic initiative along
      its northern borders by engaging Hizballah, Syria, and Iran, as the principal
      agents of aggression in Lebanon…”


      In his 1996 book Fighting Terrorism, Netanyahu set out the new strategy. Israel
      would not fight the terrorists; it would fight the states that support the terrorists.
      More accurately, it would get the US to do Israel’s fighting for it. As he elaborated
      in 2001:


      The first and most crucial thing to understand is this: There is no international
      terrorism without the support of sovereign states.… Take away all this state support,
      and the entire scaffolding of international terrorism will collapse into dust.


      Netanyahu’s strategy was integrated into U.S. foreign policy. Taking out Syria
      was always a key part of the plan. This was confirmed to General Wesley Clark
      after 9/11. He was told, during a visit at the Pentagon, that “we’re going to
      attack and destroy the governments in seven countries in five years—we’re going
      to start with Iraq, and then we’re going to move to Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia,
      Sudan and Iran.” Iraq would be first, then Syria, and the rest. (Netanyahu’s campaign
      for the Iraq War is spelled out in detail in Dennis Fritz’s new book, Deadly Betrayal.
      The role of the Israel Lobby is spelled out in Ilan Pappé’s new book, Lobbying
      for Zionism on Both Sides of the Atlantic). The insurgency that hit U.S. troops
      in Iraq set back the five-year timeline, but did not change the basic strategy.


      The U.S. has by now led or sponsored wars against Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon
      (U.S. funding and arming Israel), Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (CIA operation
      during 2010’s), Sudan (supporting rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011), and Somalia
      (backing Ethiopia’s invasion in 2006). A prospective U.S. war with Iran, ardently
      sought by Israel, is still pending.


      Strange as it might seem, the CIA has repeatedly backed Islamist Jihadists to
      fight these wars, and jihadists have just toppled the Syrian regime. The CIA,
      after all, helped to create al-Qaeda in the first place by training, arming, and
      financing the Mujahideen in Afghanistan from the late 1970s onward. Yes, Osama
      bin Laden later turned on the U.S., but his movement was a U.S. creation all the
      same. Ironically, as Seymour Hersh confirms, it was Assad’s intelligence that
      “tipped off the U.S. to an impending Al Qaeda bombing attack on the headquarters
      of the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet.”


      Operation Timber Sycamore was a billion-dollar CIA covert program launched by
      Obama to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. The CIA funded, trained, and provided intelligence
      to radical and extreme Islamist groups. The CIA effort also involved a “rat line”
      to run weapons from Libya (attacked by NATO in 2011) to the jihadists in Syria.
      In 2014, Seymour Hersh described the operation in his piece “The Red Line and
      the Rat Line”:


      “A highly classified annex to the report, not made public, described a secret
      agreement reached in early 2012 between the Obama and Erdoğan administrations.
      It pertained to the rat line. By the terms of the agreement, funding came from
      Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the CIA, with the support of MI6, was
      responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi’s arsenals into Syria.”


      Soon after the launch of Timber Sycamore, in March 2013, at a joint conference
      by President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House, Obama said:
      “With respect to Syria, the United States continues to work with allies and friends
      and the Syrian opposition to hasten the end of Assad’s rule.”


      To the U.S.-Israeli Zionist mentality, a call for negotiation by an adversary
      is taken as a sign of weakness of the adversary. Those who call for negotiations
      on the other side typically end up dead—murdered by Israel or U.S. assets. We’ve
      seen this play out recently in Lebanon. The Lebanese Foreign Minister confirmed
      that Hassan Nasrallah, Former Secretary-General of Hezbollah had agreed to a ceasefire
      with Israel days before his assassination. Hezbollah’s willingness to accept a
      peace agreement according to the Arab-Islamic world’s wishes of a two-state solution
      is long-standing. Similarly, instead of negotiating to end the war in Gaza, Israel
      assassinated Hamas’ political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran.


      To the U.S.-Israeli Zionist mentality, a call for negotiation by an adversary
      is taken as a sign of weakness of the adversary.


      Similarly in Syria, instead of allowing for a political solution to emerge, the
      U.S. opposed the peace process multiple times. In 2012, the UN had negotiated
      a peace agreement in Syria that was blocked by the Americans, who demanded that
      Assad must go on the first day of the peace agreement. The U.S. wanted regime
      change, not peace. In September 2024, Netanyahu addressed the General Assembly
      with a map of the Middle East divided between “Blessing” and “Curse,” with Lebanon,
      Syria, Iraq, and Iran as part of Netanyahu’s curse. The real curse is Israel’s
      path of mayhem and war, which has now engulfed Lebanon and Syria, with Netayahu’s
      fervent hope to draw the U.S. into war with Iran as well.


      The U.S. and Israel are high-fiving that they have successfully wrecked yet another
      adversary of Israel and defender of the Palestinian cause, with Netanyahu claiming
      “credit for starting the historic process.” Most likely Syria will now succumb
      to continued war among the many armed protagonists, as has happened in the previous
      U.S.-Israeli regime-change operations.


      In short, American interference, at the behest of Netanyahu’s Israel, has left
      the Middle East in ruins, with over a million dead and open wars raging in Libya,
      Sudan, Somalia, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, and with Iran on the brink of a
      nuclear arsenal, being pushed against its own inclinations to this eventuality.


      All this is in the service of a profoundly unjust cause: to deny Palestinians
      their political rights in the service of Zionist extremism based on the 7th century
      BCE Book of Joshua. Remarkably, according to that text—one relied on by Israel’s
      own religious zealots—the Israelites were not even the original inhabitants of
      the land. Rather, according the text, God instructs Joshua and his warriors to
      commit multiple genocides to conquer the land.


      Against this backdrop, the Arab-Islamic nations and indeed almost all of the world
      have repeatedly united in the call for a two-state solution and peace between
      Israel and Palestine.


      Instead of the two-state solution, Israel and the U.S. have made a desert and
      called it peace.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the U.S. and Israel have systematically
      undermined Syria through military intervention, economic sanctions, and support

      of Syria and the suffering of its people.

      It argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's expansionist agenda,

      traces the origins of this strategy back to a 1996 plan that rejected the idea
      of "land for peace" in favor of maintaining control over occupied territories
      and destabilizing neighboring governments. It highlights the role of U.S. covert
      operations, such as Operation Timber Sycamore, in exacerbating the Syrian conflict,
      leading to significant loss of life and the collapse of a once-functioning state.
      Ultimately, the article condemns the U.S.-Israeli alliance for perpetuating violence
      and chaos in the region while undermining the possibility of a peaceful resolution
      to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

  - title: 'Here''s the Truth: It Is the Lack of a Two-State Solution That Most Threatens
      Israel'
    url: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/israel-two-state-solution
    text: 'Israel rejects the two-state solution because it claims that a sovereign
      state of Palestine would profoundly endanger Israel’s national security. In fact,
      it is the lack of a two-state solution that endangers Israel. Israel’s illegal
      occupation of Palestinian lands, its continuing apartheid rule over millions of
      Palestinians, and its extreme violence to defend that rule, all put Israel’s survival
      in jeopardy, as Israel faces dire threats from global diplomatic isolation and
      the ongoing war, including the war’s massive economic, social, and financial costs.


      There are three basic reasons for Israel’s opposition to the two-state solution,
      reflecting a variety of ideologies and interests in Israeli society.


      The first, and most mainstream, is Israel’s claim that Palestinians and the Arab
      world cannot live alongside it and only wish to destroy it. The second is the
      belief among Israel’s rapidly growing religious-nationalist population that God
      promised the Jews all of the land from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, including
      all of Palestine. We recently wrote about that ideology , pointing out that it
      is roughly 2,600 years out of step with today’s realities. The third is straightforward
      material gain. With its ongoing occupation, Israel aims to profit from control
      over the region’s freshwater resources, coastal zones, offshore natural gas deposits,
      tourist destinations, and land for settlements.


      These various motives are jumbled together in Israel’s continued intransigence.
      Yet taken individually or as a package, they fail to justify Israel’s opposition
      to the two-state solution, certainly not from the perspective of international
      law and justice, but not even with regard to Israel’s own security or narrow economic
      interests.


      Consider Israel’s claim about national security, as was recently repeated by PM
      Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations on September 27th. Netanyahu accused
      the Palestinian Authority, and specifically President Mahmoud Abbas, of waging
      “unremitting diplomatic warfare against Israel’s right to exist and against Israel’s
      right to defend itself.”


      After Netanyahu’s speech, Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs,
      standing beside Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa replied to Netanyahu
      in a press conference :


      All of us in the Arab world here, want a peace in which Israel lives in peace
      and security, accepted, normalized with all Arab countries in the context of ending
      the occupation, withdrawing from Arab territory, allowing for the emergence of
      an independent, sovereign Palestinian state on the June 4, 1967 lines with East
      Jerusalem as its capital.


      Minister Safadi was speaking on behalf of the 57 members of the Muslim-Arab committee,
      who are all willing “ to guarantee Israel’s security ” in the context of a two-state
      solution. Minister Safadi, alongside the Palestinian Prime Minister, articulated
      the region’s peace proposal, an alternative to Netanyahu’s endless wars.


      Earlier this year, the Bahrain Declaration in May 2024 of the 33rd Regular Session
      of the Council of the League of Arab States, on behalf of the 22 member states,
      re-iterated:


      We call on the international community to assume its responsibilities to follow-up
      efforts to advance the peace process to achieve a just and comprehensive peace
      based on the two-state solution, which embodies an independent Palestinian state
      with East Jerusalem as its capital on the lines of the fourth of June 1967, able
      to live in security and peace alongside Israel in accordance with the resolutions
      of international legitimacy and established references, including the Arab Peace
      Initiative.




      The many Arab and Islamic statements for peace, including those of the Organization
      of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), in which Iran is a repeated signatory, trace back
      to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative of Beirut—where Arab countries first proposed
      the region’s readiness to establish relations with Israel in the context of the
      two-state solution. The initiative declared that peace is based on Israel’s withdrawal
      from the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese occupied territories.


      Israel claims that even if the Arab states and Iran want peace, Hamas does not,
      and therefore threatens Israel. There are two crucial points here. First, Hamas
      accepted the two-state solution, already 7 years ago, in their 2017 Charter. “Hamas
      considers the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state,
      with Jerusalem as its capital along the lines of the 4th of June 1967, with the
      return of the refugees and the displaced to their homes from which they were expelled,
      to be a formula of national consensus.” This year again, Hamas proposed to disarm
      in exchange for Palestinian statehood on the 1967 borders. Israel, in turn, assassinated
      the Hamas political chief and cease-fire negotiator , Ismail Haniyeh.


      Second, Hamas is very far from being a stand-alone actor. Hamas depends on funds
      and arms from the outside, notably from Iran. Implementation of the two-state
      solution under UN Security Council auspices would include the disarmament of non-state
      actors and mutual security arrangements for Israel and Palestine, in line with
      international law and the recent ICJ ruling, which Iran voted in favor of at UN
      General Assembly .


      The giveaway that Hamas is an excuse, not a deep cause, of Israel’s intransigence
      is that Netanyahu has tactically if quietly supported Hamas over the years in
      a divide and conquer strategy . Netanyahu’s ruse has been to prevent the unity
      of different Palestinian political factions in order to forestall the Palestinian
      Authority from developing a national plan to forge a Palestinian state. The whole
      point of Netanyahu’s politics for decades has been to prevent the emergence of
      a Palestinian state using any argument at hand.


      Israel and its boosters often claim that the failure at Camp David in 2000 proves
      that the Palestinians reject the two-state solution. This claim also is not correct.
      As documented by many, including Clayton E. Swisher in his meticulous account
      in The Truth About Camp David: The Untold Story about the Collapse of the Middle
      East Peace Process, the Camp David negotiations in 2000 failed owing to Bill Clinton’s
      last-minute approach to deal making, combined with then Israeli Prime Minister
      Ehud Barak’s political cowardice in failing to honor Israeli obligations under
      the Oslo Accord.


      As time ran out at Camp David, Clinton was a dishonest broker, as were the blatantly
      pro-Israel US negotiators, who refused to acknowledge Palestine’s legal claim
      to the borders of 4 June 1967, and prevarications about Palestine’s right to its
      capital in East Jerusalem. The “final offer” abruptly pushed by the Israelis and
      their American backers on the Palestinians did not secure basic Palestinian rights,
      nor were the Palestinians given time to deliberate and respond with alternative
      proposals. The Palestinians were then falsely blamed by the Americans and Israelis
      for the failure of the negotiations.


      Israel persists with its intransigence because it believes that it has the unconditional
      backing of the United States. Through decades of large campaign contributions
      and assiduous lobbying , the Israel lobby in the United States not only controls
      votes in the Congress, but also has also placed arch-Zionists in top positions
      in every administration. Yet due to Israel’s brutality in Palestine and Lebanon,
      the Israel Lobby has lost its ability to control the narrative and votes across
      mainstream American society .


      Trump, Biden, and Netanyahu all believed that Israel could “have it all”—Greater
      Israel and peace with the Arab states, while blocking a Palestinian state—through
      a US-brokered normalization process. The Abraham Accords (which established diplomatic
      relations of Israel with Bahrain and the UAE) was to be the role model for normalizing
      relations between Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This approach was always
      cynical (as it aimed to block a Palestinian state) but is surely delusional now.
      The Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia has made crystal clear in his op-ed in the
      Financial Times on October 2 , that the two-state solution is the only pathway
      to peace and normalization.


      “A two-state solution is not merely an ideal; it is the only viable path to ensuring
      Palestine, Israel and the region’s long-term security. Uncontrolled escalatory
      cycles are the building blocks of wider war. In Lebanon, we are witnessing this
      firsthand. Peace cannot be built on a foundation of occupation and resentment;
      true security for Israel will come from recognising the legitimate rights of the
      Palestinian people.”


      Israel’s ongoing intransigent opposition to the two-state solution, recently reiterated
      by a vote of the Knesset , has become the greatest danger to Israel’s own security.
      Israel is now almost completely ostracized by the international community, and
      also faces grave economic and military threats as the regional war expands. As
      just one indicator of the emerging economic disarray, Israel’s credit rating is
      already plummeting, and Israel is likely to lose its investment grade credit rating
      very soon, with dire long-term economic consequences.


      Nor does Israel’s violent pursuit of its extremist vision serve US security or
      US interests, and the American people oppose Israel’s extremism. The Israel Lobby
      is likely to lose its grip. Both the US public and the US deep state are very
      likely to withdraw their uncritical and unconditional support for Israel.'
    one_sentence_summary: Israel's rejection of the two-state solution, based on claims
      of national security and ideological beliefs, ultimately jeopardizes its own survival
      by perpetuating occupation and violence, leading to international isolation and
      economic decline.
    paragraph_summary: The article argues that Israel's rejection of the two-state solution
      is rooted in a combination of national security fears, religious-nationalist ideologies,
      and material interests, but contends that this stance ultimately jeopardizes Israel's
      own survival. It critiques Israel's claims that Palestinians cannot coexist peacefully
      with it, highlighting that many Arab nations, including Jordan and those represented
      in the Arab Peace Initiative, support a two-state solution that would ensure Israel's
      security. The piece also points out that Hamas has shown willingness to accept
      a two-state framework, contradicting Israel's narrative that the group is an insurmountable
      obstacle. Furthermore, it critiques past failed negotiations, such as Camp David
      in 2000, as being misrepresented to blame Palestinians for the lack of progress.
      The article concludes that Israel's ongoing opposition to the two-state solution,
      coupled with its violent policies, is leading to international isolation and economic
      decline, suggesting that the U.S. may soon reassess its unconditional support
      for Israel.
