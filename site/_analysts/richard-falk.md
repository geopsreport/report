summary: |
  The geopolitical landscape in the Middle East remains tense, with recent developments highlighting both ongoing crises and evolving strategies for international advocacy. The aftermath of the June 2023 US and Israeli strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities continues to reverberate, as independent analysts debate the broader implications for regional stability and US foreign policy.
  
  In a recent interview, **Stephen Zunes** and **Lawrence Davidson** emphasized the dual objectives behind the strikes: not only to disrupt Iran’s nuclear ambitions but also to potentially catalyze internal regime change. **Richard Falk** further contextualized these actions within a pattern of US imperialism and Israel’s strategic role as a regional proxy. The analysts note that while the strikes have intensified divisions within Iran, they have also exposed the fragility of US intelligence consensus under political pressure, particularly during the Trump administration. The majority view among the analysts is that these actions are likely to prolong instability in the region, with a high chance of further escalation if diplomatic channels remain sidelined.
  
  Meanwhile, the Gaza Tribunal’s recent activities, including the issuance of the Sarajevo Declaration, signal a growing movement within global civil society to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Tribunal, as reported by **Richard Falk**, seeks to fill the accountability gap left by international legal bodies such as the ICJ and ICC, which have struggled to enforce compliance with their rulings. The Sarajevo Declaration reaffirms solidarity with the Palestinian people and calls for collective action to end the violence and promote justice. This initiative is gaining traction, with increasing endorsements and participation from international supporters.
  
  On the legal and normative front, the discourse around resistance as a human right is gaining renewed attention. The foreword to Shannonbrooke Murphy’s new book, as highlighted by **Richard Falk**, frames resistance to public authority as a universal right, with particular resonance in the context of Palestine. The October 7 attack on Israeli border villages is cited as a turning point, underscoring the complexities of resistance politics and the divergent agendas of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
  
  **Trends and Predictions:**  
  The majority of independent analysts agree that the region is entering a period of heightened volatility, with the potential for further military confrontations involving Iran, Israel, and the US. The persistent humanitarian crisis in Gaza is likely to drive increased international advocacy and civil society mobilization, as exemplified by the Gaza Tribunal. There is a high chance that these grassroots efforts will continue to gain momentum, putting additional pressure on governments and international institutions to address the underlying causes of conflict and to pursue accountability for alleged war crimes. The situation remains fluid, but the prevailing expert consensus is that without substantive diplomatic engagement, both the Iranian and Palestinian crises will remain unresolved and could escalate further.

    text: '[Prefatory Note: The post below is the text of an interview with Lawrence
      Davidson, Stephen Zunes, and myself on the wider meanings to be attributed to
      the aggressive attack of June 13, 2023 by Israel and the US on Iran’s nuclear
      sites in response to contested claims by Israel of a rising Iranian threat of
      crossing the line, and becoming a nuclear weapons-possessing state. This latter
      claim was initially denied by Tulsi Gabbard the US Director of National Intelligence,
      but altered after being overridden by the White House and Pentagon in explaining
      their partnering with Israel in the Iran War. Under prodding from Trump a ceasefire
      was established and so far respected by Israel and Iran with warnings from both
      governments that if conditions change, a resumption of hostilities will occur.
      On the Israeli side it was never clear whether additional to the priority of destroying
      Iran’s nuclear program, it was also seizing the opportunity to promote and assist
      a movement for regime change from within. Iranians seem divided as to whether
      the Tehran government enjoyed widespread support during the attack or whether
      secular opposition forces in Iran were encouraged to renew their attempt to escalate
      opposition. The text below was published by CounterPunch on July 1 as edited by
      Daniel Falcone, a highly respected independent journalist.] Hegemony, Escalation
      & Resistance: US Foreign Policy Toward Iran A Conversation with Leading Analysts
      In this latest and extensive discussion on US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites,
      CounterPunch features international relations scholar Stephen Zunes , Middle East
      historian Lawrence Davidson , and legal expert and former UN rapporteur Richard
      Falk , to explain the fundamental dynamics of US foreign policy in the Middle
      East, with a particular focus on the Trump administration. This conversation addresses
      several key themes, including: the continuity of US imperialism in the region,
      the strategic use of Israel as a proxy power, the decline of democratic accountability
      in war-making decisions, the erosion of international law and human rights discourse,
      the challenges facing civil society in resisting militarism, and the need to construct
      a more ethical and consistent framework for evaluating foreign policy. Daniel
      Falcone: Can you explain the ways that Trump and American foreign policy toward
      the Middle East and Iran has continued its colonial path in distributing hard
      and soft power to the region? What might escalation look like? Lawrence Davidson:
      Despite the isolationist mood of a segment of Trump’s supporters, the assumption
      among most of the “ruling economic class” is still that the U.S. must assert control
      over markets and resources. Thus, there is no reason to expect a significant diminishment
      in overseas adventures (though as explained below, how these are prioritized in
      the U.S. is a function of lobby power). Indeed, Trump’s rather disgusting mimicking of
      Mussolini and Hitler by asserting unilateral claims to the Panama Canal, Greenland
      and even Canada is just a modern twist, albeit an embarrassing one, on U.S. colonialism.
      Stephen Zunes: The bombing of Iran is the logical extension of the 2002 U.S. National
      Security Strategy which essentially made the case that the United States would
      not tolerate regional powers challenging its hegemony in important regions like
      the oil-rich Middle East. After the overthrow of Saddam in Iraq in the 2003 U.S.
      invasion and the ouster of Assad in Syria by his own people last year, Iran is
      the only recognized state to resist effective U.S. control of the entire region.
      When we think of the obsession U.S. policy makers have had with Cuba for the past
      65 years and with Nicaragua and Chile in previous decades due to their resistance
      to U.S. domination, it’s not surprising that a large, relatively powerful, and
      resource-rich country like Iran would become such a focus. And, given the reactionary
      and authoritarian nature of the regime, its isolation in the region, and its unpopularity
      among its own people, it has become a perfect foil. Let’s remember that Trump
      was never antiwar; he just opposed other people’s wars. He has always believed
      in war making to advance U.S. hegemony. His claims of being antiwar were as disingenuous
      as his claims he would stand up against Wall Street—he recognized that it was
      the best way to win over white working-class voters who had seen how Democratic
      hawks like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden supported sending their kids to die in
      Middle Eastern conflicts. Israel and its supporters are useful allies in implementing
      this policy, but they are not the source of it. Given the Iraq debacle, Israel
      has been utilized as a surrogate in a manner similar to the ways in which the
      U.S. tried to use the Shah in the 1970s, advancing U.S. interests through wars
      without sacrificing American lives. Israel’s attacks on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria,
      Yemen, and Iran make it so the United States only needs to intervene directly
      in extraordinary circumstances, such as in delivering 30,000-pound bombs safely
      from a high altitude. As German Chancellor Friedrich Merz put it, “Israel is doing
      the dirty work for all of us”—a disturbing description in that it conjures up
      how, during the Middle Ages and other times in European history, the ruling class
      used some Jews to do the “dirty work” (i.e., money-lenders, tax collectors) so
      they could later be scapegoated rather than allow the masses to go after those
      who really had the power. Using Israel to attack the West’s enemies in the Middle
      East follows this pattern. Already, we are hearing some war critics insist that
      “the Zionists” are somehow forcing an otherwise reluctant United States and Europe
      to support wars of aggression rather than recognizing Israel’s role as that of
      a proxy for Western imperialism, a chorus which will likely increase should the
      United States be dragged down in an ongoing military conflict with Iran. Washington
      has long acknowledged Israel’s role of a surrogate. President Biden has stated
      that “If it weren’t for Israel, we’d have to invent them.” Former Secretary of
      State Alexander Haig referred to Israel as our “unsinkable aircraft carrier.”
      If the goal was simply to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, which was
      the focus of the Obama administration, Trump would not have abrogated the Joint
      Comprehensive Program of Action (JCPOA, or “the Iran nuclear deal.”) By pulling
      out and reimposing sanctions, Trump effectively provoked Iran into enriching uranium
      to a degree that could someday potentially lead to weaponization and thereby provide
      a pretext for war. The actual goal, therefore, has been to weaken Iran as much
      as possible, and Israel was quite willing for its own reasons to play along as
      well. Indeed, Israeli air strikes have gone well beyond targets related to its
      nuclear program and Washington has supported them in doing so. I met with then-Iranian
      Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in Tehran in 2019. He explained how it took nearly
      a decade of posturing and two years of intense negotiations to create the JCPOA,
      signed by seven governments and endorsed by the United Nations. He noted how he
      met with then-Secretary of State John Kerry no less than 50 times to go over the
      draft line by line. The idea that Trump could impose an even more restrictive
      agreement simply by demanding it was at best naïve and more likely just an excuse
      to go to war. Indeed, nuclear talks had resumed and were ongoing when the U.S.-backed
      Israeli war on Iran began. Neither the United States nor Israel wanted them to
      succeed. The U.S. bombing of Iran, therefore, is not ultimately about nuclear
      policy or about Israel. It’s about hegemony. Thus, there is a serious risk of
      escalation. The United States has 40,000 troops within a couple hundred miles
      of Iran, easily within range of not just Iranian missiles, but drones and other
      weaponry. Iranian proxy militia in Iran could target U.S. bases. The U.S. Navy
      is just off the Iranian coast, which could also be targeted, and the Iranians
      could attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz, crippling the world oil supply and
      threatening the global economy. Trump, meanwhile, explicitly threatened to unleash
      “a tragedy for Iran far greater than we have witnessed over the last eight days”
      if Iran retaliates. It’s possible that Iran’s military capabilities have been
      damaged enough to limit their response, but it is hard to imagine that Saturday’s
      night air strikes are the end of U.S.-Iranian fighting. Richard Falk: To gain
      perspective on the present alarming situation, I begin my response by taking note
      of the US foreign policy response to the Suez Operation of Israel, UK, and France
      during the Eisenhower presidency in 1956. This was both the first, last, and only
      occasion on which the US Government adopted a position that distanced itself from
      a colonialist initiative in the Middle East or anywhere. It was represented the
      only foreign policy challenge in which the US gave priority to its legal commitment
      to uphold the UN Charter even when its constraints were inconsistent with its
      geopolitical alignments both with its NATO partners and Israel since the end of
      World War II and remains so fifty years later. It was particularly impressive
      at the time because Nasser’s Egypt was hostile to the West and a harsh critic
      of Israel statehood at the expense of Palestine, and beyond all this was on friendly
      terms with the Soviet Union at a time of rising Cold War tensions. In a superficial
      sense, the US response to the Suez Operation demanding withdrawal from Egyptian
      territory was consistent with its leadership in the UN after North Korea attacked
      South Korea or at least seemed so at the outset of the Korean War as the defense
      of South Korea was given legal authorization by the UN, including the Security
      Council. This was only possible because the Soviet Union was boycotting the UN
      at the time because of its refusal to seat China’s Peoples Republic as representing
      China, and could not cast its veto to block UN support for South Korea. The Soviet
      Union learned its lesson, returned to the Security Council, and never again boycotted
      the Organization. Yet the Korean precedent is quite different as the US tends
      to resort to a legalistic approach whenever its adversaries violate Charter norms
      on the use of international force, and no time else. North Korea as a hard-core
      Communist country was an adversary and for this reason prappeals to the UN appeals
      by the West, similar to the US immediate reaction to the 2022 Russian attack on
      Ukraine. Both in the Korean and Ukrainian wars recourse to force was provoked
      by the West-oriented governments, especially the US, but covered up by influential
      international media platforms. It is notable that the deep state, and its visible
      manifestations in the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington think tanks,
      faulted this US response in 1956 because it mistakenly adhered to international
      law at the cost of weakening its alliance relations, which was interpreted to
      mean weakening strategic national interests that were associated with the central
      issue of unconditionally opposing the Soviet Union and all direct and indirect
      extensions of its influence beyond its geopolitical borders. This post-mortem
      critique of US statecraft prevailed, and the US Government never again sacrificed
      its strategic interests out of deference to international law or the UN in the
      Middle East, or elsewhere. In the early stages of Israel’s existence it meant
      balancing relations with Israel as a settler colonial exception to decolonizing
      historical worldwide trends against the pragmatic priority of securing for the
      West assured access to Gulf oil at stable prices, which meant a maximum effort
      to minimize Soviet influence even at the risk of major warfare and also a maximum
      effort to avoid antagonizing the anti-Israeli stance of Arab governments during
      the remainder of the 20 th century. Long before the Suez Crisis the colonialist
      penetration of the region was introduced in a somewhat disguised Orientalist form
      by the Balfour Declaration of 1917 in which the British Foreign Secretary pledged
      support for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine without even a
      pretense of consultation with the resident Arab population of post-Ottoman Palestine.
      The Balfour Declaration represented an expression of overt colonialist arrogance
      to solve European problems associated with antisemitism at the sacrifice of Palestinian
      rights of self-determination undertaken without any show of concerns about the
      impassioned grander ambitions of the Zionist Movement that went far beyond establishing
      a non-governing homeland in a foreign sovereign state even at this early stage.
      British motivations included a typical application of the divide and rule tactics
      of colonial governance through encouraging Jewish immigration as a check on rising
      Palestinian nationalism. It backfired as anti-colonial nationalism flourished,
      the Zionist Movement shifted its focus from gratitude to Balfour to the adoption
      of armed struggle against the British colonial administration in Palestine. The
      legacy of these several varieties of colonialism policy was to inflict on post-1945
      Middle East life a continuous series of wars, prolonged tensions that solidified
      Israeli autocratic rule dependent on the US, and worst of all, the embodiment
      of the Zionist domination of the Israeli state which entailed systemic human rights
      violations, ethnic cleansing, culminating in apartheid and genocide, and the establishment
      of a sophisticated and ruthless settler colonial state that made Palestinians
      persecuted strangers in their own homeland, victimized by a lethal fusion of apartheid
      and genocide. This balancing of strategic interests was tested, and reaffirmed
      in the context of the 1967 War in which Israel lost its identity as a strategic
      burden worth protecting for a variety of political reasons to become a highly
      valued partner in ensuring Western control of the region despite the formal independence
      achieved by Arab national movements in the MENA region that included the North
      African states. From this time forward to the present the US never challenged
      Israel’s use of force in the region, including its flagrant violations of the
      Geneva Conventions in its administration of the Palestinian territories of East
      Jerusalem, West Bank, and Gaza occupied by force during the 1967 War. There was
      a naive attempt to find a solution to the Israel/Palestinian conflict by way of
      the framework set forth in Security Council Resolution 242 adopted shortly after
      the war end, which wrongly anticipated Isreal’s early withdrawal from these Palestinian
      territories after minor border adjustments. As we now know more than half a century
      later this withdrawal never happened and was probably never contemplated by the
      Zionist leadership that held sway in Tel Aviv. Given this unfinished nature of
      the expansionist Israeli agenda as marching in lockstep with the imperial nature
      of the US approach to the Middle East. The result was a gradual normalization
      of these realities that achieved a bipartisan consensus second in solidity only
      to the anti-Communism of the Cold War. In effect, the US became the replacement
      for the UK and France colonial management of Western political and economic interest
      in the Middle East, whose policies were increasingly at odds with support for
      international law, UN majority sentiments, and the essential decolonizing ethos
      of national self-determination. The growing dependence of Gulf Arab governments
      on stabilizing relations with the US became evident in the aftermath of the 1973
      War in which the temporary prohibition of oil sales to the West gave rise to long
      lines at US gas stations and reactive scenarios of US intervention dramatized
      on the cover of a leading national magazine with an image of American commandos
      parachuting in Gulf airspace to take over the production and distribution of oil
      and natural gas to the West. Subsequently, the leading Arab governments and the
      US, and even Israel, informally made a mutual accommodation, acknowledging a Palestinian
      right to statehood, but turning a blind eye to Israel occupation settlement policies
      designed to make the establishment of a viable Palestinian state impossible, dismissed
      by Palestinian liberation politics as ‘breadcrumb diplomacy’ or a new version
      of South African bantustans. Daniel Falcone: What do you foresee the role of civil
      society and intergovernmental organizations in the coming days and weeks regarding
      Iran? Lawrence Davidson: There will be some protests and much analysis. However,
      it may be that the die is cast. It will be a hard sell to make international law
      and human rights effective guides for state behavior. If the historical record
      is predictive, they will not again serve as guides until we experience some sort
      of sobering catastrophe. As to Iran specifically, its war of attrition with Israel
      will continue. Despite the spin of U.S. reporting, Israel will be the first to
      face a real crisis. This will force the U.S. back into the war–in order to halt
      Iranian attacks. The Zionist lobby will insist on this. The Zionists will not
      draw any of the obvious lessons from the Iranian attacks. Stephen Zunes: Unlike
      the Bush administration and its allies in the media, who put great effort into
      convincing Americans to support the war on Iraq, Trump has put little energy into
      convincing Americans to support war on Iran. His speech Saturday evening seemed
      largely improvised and lasted only four minutes. It’s as if the U.S. has become
      so deindustrialized they can’t even manufacture consent anymore. On the positive
      side, polls prior to the U.S. bombing showed overwhelming majorities opposing
      the United States entering the war, with barely 15% supporting it. Unlike the
      first couple years of the Vietnam War and the first several months of the Iraq
      War, we don’t have to work to get most Americans on our side. They already are.
      Even some pro-Israel groups (i.e., J Street, New Jewish Narrative) have come out
      against war with Iran, demonstrating there are divisions even among Zionists.
      Unfortunately, American civil society is badly distracted simply in defending
      itself from an increasingly authoritarian state and the havoc it has unleashed
      against minorities, immigrants, education, the environment, and government itself.
      Mobilizing against a war, particularly one that does not involve American ground
      troops, in the face of all the other political crises could be challenging. Furthermore,
      unlike the 1980s when activists were inspired to defend a promising if imperfect
      socialist experiment in Nicaragua against a U.S. assault, Iran is a decidedly
      reactionary regime which most of its own people would like to see toppled (albeit
      not by a foreign power). Little can be expected from intergovernmental organizations
      either. There is obviously the threat of a U.S. veto of anything the UN Security
      Council would try to offer. More generally, Iran is seen in the region and beyond
      as a something of a pariah state, so few nations, particularly in the West, can
      be expected to stick their necks out in defense of international law, even if
      Iran’s grievances are valid. Richard Falk: If interpreting this question as pertaining
      to Europe and North America, as well as Israel and Palestine, it is anticipated
      that anti-war civil society organizations will be very active in opposing the
      attacks on Iran’s nuclear program and its facilities devoted to enrichment of
      uranium. If the war goals are extended to regime change by Israel and supported
      by the US such opposition might be expected to grow. Trump’s foreign policy identity
      was established by opposition to any future US involvement in ‘forever wars’ and
      state-building undertakings (that failed at great expense most spectacularly in
      Iraq and Afghanistan) by invoking a neo-isolationist foreign policy sloganized
      as ‘America First,’ while being sustained by militarist domestic rule and neo-fascist
      ideology incorporating unconditional support for whatever Israel undertakes, however,
      unlawful, cruel, and risky. In the context of the evolving unprovoked aggressive
      war against Iran, civil society and the UN are confronted by an almost total inversion
      of the posture taken in the Suez Crisis. With respect to Iran, the violation of
      UN Charter red lines designed to uphold war prevention commitments, the US and
      the West dismissive attitude toward the relevance of international law in the
      event of recourse to non-defensive warmaking. Here the rationalization for Israel’s
      aggression, addressed sympathetically in Western media, is based on alleged threat
      perception relating to an apprehended Iranian possession of nuclear warheads.
      A more reasonable view of the nuclear dimension of national security would situate
      the threat on Israel’s side of the bright red line. After all Israel has a covertly
      acquired nuclear weapons arsenal of 300-400 warheads as facilitated by Western
      secret assistance and as purged from the periodic nonproliferation review program
      agendas. While Iran is a generally complying party to the NPT Israel has never
      joined, and has rejected efforts to establish a nuclear free zone in the Middle
      East, a proposal ardently supported in the past by both Iran and Saudi Arabia.
      Sich a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East was repeated rejected by Israel
      and its Western backers. It would at least readjust the international debate if
      NGOs and the UN brought these realities into the light of day. As it is, the nuclear
      path chosen by North Korea would serve as a national security tutorial on the
      benefits of proliferation in the Nuclear Age. Despite hostility to North Korea
      and its acquisition of nuclear weapons capability, its nuclear program and nuclear
      weapons arsenal were never attacked. In contrast, Libya, Ukraine, and now Iran
      have been presumably attacked because they lacked a nuclear retaliatory capability.
      The lessons to be drawn are ominous. Beyond the nuclear dimension, it would be
      important to understand that US support for Israel in relation to Iran is partly
      based on a racist containment rationale that carried into practice Samuel Huntington’s
      1990s anticipation of a ‘clash of civilizations’ along the faultlines of the Middle
      East separating Islam from the white West. From this perspective Israel is integral
      to Western post-colonial imperialism, manning the frontline of Islamic containment,
      and doing the dirty work of the West backed up by the US to the extent necessary.
      Iran to an extent conspired by vowing to destroy Zionist governance in Israel
      and encouraging street chants along the lines of ‘death to Israel, death to America.’
      Daniel Falcone: To what extent does domestic political pressure, such as lobbying
      from interest groups or bipartisan consensus, limit the critical reassessments
      of the US war machine? Lawrence Davidson: I don’t think that the elected leaders
      of the U.S. consciously say to themselves, “We are colonialists and that is our
      path.” True, they are racists: personified in a series of recent elected leaders
      such as Reagan, the Bush boys, Biden and now Trump. But remember in many ways
      Trump and the others are “us.” After all, these horrific “leaders” were all elected
      by an appreciable subset of the US population. But once elected they were all
      enveloped in a system wherein policy is the product of dominant interest groups.
      The most dominant one, in terms of foreign policy, is the Zionists. It has been
      over 80 years since the U.S. government as such has overseen its own Middle East
      policy, The Zionist lobby is in charge, because that is how our modern system
      works. The same special interest domination is to be found in the foreign policy
      toward Cuba, and, for that matter, the domestic policy toward gun control, abortion,
      etc. Each has its own dominant lobby. Want to change policy? Well, it is insufficient
      to change the leader or the party. One must destroy the relevant special interest.
      Stephen Zunes: When U.S. intelligence reports reiterated that Iran was not in
      fact working to building nuclear weapons, instead of taking the Bush administration
      approach of rewriting the intelligence to conform with his policy, Trump simply
      insisted that it was wrong. He even repeated the long-bunked argument that Iran
      was responsible for a thousand American deaths in Iraq. There hasn’t, therefore,
      been much pressure from the military and traditional national security establishment
      to go war. Unfortunately, few Democratic leaders in Congress have challenged the
      Trump administration’s talking points either. As with Israel/Palestine, there
      is a huge gap between the views of Democratic voters and their elected officials.
      Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and other Democratic leaders came out in support
      of Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran, insisting it was for “self-defense.” Their
      repeated mantra that “Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon” without
      simultaneously demanding a return to the JCPOA would seem to indicate an openness
      to military solutions over diplomatic ones, apparently believing that Obama’s
      approach (a binding international treaty Iran already agreed to that would make
      it physically impossible for Iran to ever build a nuclear weapon) is inadequate
      while Trump’s approach (make war, even if it doesn’t actually prevent them from
      doing so) is somehow more valid. Given how most Congressional Democrats have had
      no problem with Netanyahu’s criminal warmaking in Gaza, it’s not surprising that
      Trump thought he could get away with launching an illegal war as well. Fortunately,
      he is getting some pushback from even the more hawkish Democrats, though primarily
      as a result of his refusal to abide by the War Powers Act, or even the U.S. Constitution,
      in ordering the attack without the required consent or even notification of Congress.
      It is questionable whether Congress will follow through with any concrete action,
      such as impeachment, which would be quite appropriate. Certainly, AIPAC and some
      other pro-Israel groups, including rightwing Christian evangelicals, have been
      pressuring for war with Iran for years, but their clout primarily has been with
      Congress, not the executive branch, and Congress has largely been frozen out of
      the decisions regarding Iran. There is little indication that they were decisive
      in Trump’s decision to join the war. Meanwhile, the calls and emails to Congress
      this past week have been overwhelmingly negative, serving as a reminder of the
      public mood and potentially laying the groundwork for a more proactive Congress
      on foreign affairs in the face of years of consolidation of power in the executive
      branch. Richard Falk: There is a rather unnoticed paradox that underlies US foreign
      policy in the Trump Era. On the one side Trump’s coercive maneuvers are opening
      the gates to the collapse of democracy and the onset of an American variant of
      fascism. On a second side, Trump as the overt and in-your-face autocrat seems
      captive to Zionist pressures as mounted by well-funded pro-Israeli lobbying by
      AIPAC, by the distinct worldview of Christian Evangelists that fuses unconditional
      support for Israel with exclusionist antisemitic motivations similar to the attitudes
      that underlay the Balfour Declaration, and by far right politics that admired
      Israeli Prussianism while demeaning the Global South. On a third side, private
      sector profitability among arms producers benefits from US engagement in foreign
      wars and regime change undertakings are seen as opportunities rather than costly
      misadventures. On a fourth side, group think in foreign policy advisory elites
      and the Potomac River think tanks exclude from their ranks even realist voices
      such as those of John Mearsheimer and Steven Walt who counsel prudence and a more
      nationalist and restrained conception of foreign policy. These factors in various
      ways obstruct critical reassessments of US militarist foreign policy, generating
      the amazing stability of bipartisan pro-Israel policy even when American arms
      are used to commit atrocities and Crimes Against Humanity. This gives rise to
      curiosity about the American deep state, centered in the CIA bureaucracy. Does
      it share the group think version of a realist US foreign policy, or is it more
      critical along Mearsheimer/Walt modes of thinking? It is beyond reasonable horizons
      of hopefulness to imagine that deep state operatives favor a more law-oriented,
      justice-driven US foreign policy agenda. Yet it might be deep state rising concerns
      about long-range global challenges, including unwanted, catastrophic recourse
      to nuclear war and global warming calamities of climate change, to favor a more
      cooperative approach to inter-governmental relations to achieve functional adjustments
      that if left unattended spell almost certain doom for the country, and even planet.
      Such a viewpoint if at all present among deep state regulars will surely draw
      lessons from the maladroit approach being taken by the US to Middle Eastern stability
      and global problem-solving. It is hard to estimate whether deep state insulation
      from special interest lobbying tends to produce a more knowledge-based approach
      to foreign policy or whether its orientation is as shortsighted as its elected
      leaders whose views are much affected by populist mood swings. Of course, Trump
      is an extreme instance of policy driven by political intuition, and contemptuous
      of experts and time-honored constraints on the exercise of power, above all recourse
      to war. Daniel Falcone: Given the battered state of global human rights discourse
      and international law, how can scholars and citizens alike construct a more ethical
      and consistent framework for evaluating foreign policy? Lawrence Davidson: I don’t
      have a very optimistic answer to this question. Most people are very local in
      their understanding of the world–local geographically and in temporal terms. In
      the face of this, it is our job to keep the memory and potential of international
      law and human rights alive. In this regard I think Richard Falk is a great example.
      Stephen Zunes: I never imagined back during my radical youth, with my idealist
      view of building a progressive egalitarian society, that I would today be fighting
      what may be a losing battle simply to save the liberalism of my parents’ generation—the
      belief that, through the establishment of the United Nations system, the nations
      of the world could prevent future aggressive war and that most of the world’s
      governments, at least among the liberal democracies, would recognize their obligation
      to uphold international law. In reality, as we have seen in the case of Iraq and
      subsequently, the U.S. government, often with bipartisan support, can get away
      with making war on countries on the far side of the world that are no threat to
      us. We have also seen how both the Trump and Biden administrations are willing
      to formally recognize the illegal annexation of territories seized by military
      force. By contrast, even Reagan was willing to support UN Security Council resolutions
      opposing Israel’s illegal annexation of Syria’s Golan region and supporting Western
      Sahara’s right to self-determination. Discourse on human rights and international
      law in Washington has swung way to the right in recent decades. The bipartisan
      support for Israel’s war on Gaza strongly suggests that if today’s Democrats were
      in power in the 1980s, they would have supported the death squads in El Salvador,
      the Contra terrorists in Nicaragua, and the genocidal war on the indigenous peoples
      in Guatemala. They would have probably attacked the International Court of Justice,
      other UN agencies, and Amnesty International for addressing human rights abuses
      by U.S. allies, as they have done in the case of Israel. Yet the American public,
      if polls are to be believed, feel even stronger about protecting human rights
      and the rule of law than ever. The double standards regarding Russian attacks
      on Ukrainian hospitals (and Iran’s attack on the Israeli hospital in Beersheva),
      for example, in light of the destruction of dozens of Palestinian hospitals in
      Gaza, are so flagrant that millions of Americans who might have used these other
      atrocities to embrace U.S. policy now respond with appropriate skepticism. The
      inadmissibility of expanding territory by force, used to justify U.S. support
      for Ukraine, rings hollow in light of U.S. recognition of Israel’s illegal annexation
      of Syria’s Golan Heights and Morocco’s illegal annexation of the entire nation
      of Western Sahara. Previous presidents at least pretended to care about human
      rights and international law, even if required extreme verbal gymnastics and flagrant
      double-standards to do so. Trump, by contrast, doesn’t ever pretend to care about
      them. This provides an opening for civil society to demand a renewed commitment
      to the international legal order, particularly given how the U.S. refusal to live
      up to these commitments have generally not ended well, e.g. Iraq. Indeed, if the
      United States, with its enormous military, economic, and diplomatic power, can
      refuse to play by the rules, why should anyone else? If the moral and legal arguments
      are not compelling enough, an enlightened utilitarianism, recognizing how U.S.
      failure to live up to these standards has provided an opening for despots and
      terrorists, might spark a renewed commitment to human rights and international
      law. Richard Falk: It is crucial that both scholars and citizens point to the
      Western abandonment of the war prevention and global security aspirations of the
      architects of the post-1945 world order. This abandonment began, of course, far
      earlier than the period since the Soviet collapse in the tactics deployed by both
      sides in the Cold War, involving state terror to defend spheres of interest and
      eliminate hostile political actors and movements. The embrace of Israel’s genocidal
      retaliation to the events of October 7 brought these geopolitics of lawless violence
      to a transparent climax accompanied by an unattended humanitarian emergency and
      now followed by the launch of an aggressive war against Iran. Despite rising civil
      society concerns the UN was kept on the sidelines, and Western offialdom has refrained
      from naming Israel behavior as ‘apartheid’ followed by ‘genocide,’ indeed selectively
      punishing those who shouldered burdens of talking truth to power. In the post-attack
      Iran context, the corporatized media gives ample outlets for Israeli spokespersons
      and advisors while virtually silencing global voices of conscience that bring
      to the fore concerns about war, law, justice, and human rights. Much of this recent
      weakening of democracy proceeds from what appears to be entirely voluntary self-censorship.
      Given the depth of global challenges, these unheard voices have a vital message
      that relates to species wellbeing, and possibly survival. It adds up to the imperative
      of a restorative push for global normative reform. The priorities of such a renewal
      of the global normative agenda could begin by focusing on denuclearization, empowerment
      of the UN General Assembly, the elimination of the Security Council veto, and
      decreeing compulsory recourse to the International Court of Justice at the behest
      of either party to an international dispute as well as the relabeling of ICJ ‘Advisory
      Opinion’ with new language implying ‘Authoritative Judicial Rulings.’ Timeline

    paragraph_summary: In an interview published by CounterPunch, analysts Stephen Zunes,
      Lawrence Davidson, and Richard Falk discuss the implications of the June 13, 2023,
      US and Israeli military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, prompted by Israel's
      claims of an escalating Iranian nuclear threat. The conversation highlights the
      shifting narratives surrounding US foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly
      under the Trump administration, where initial denials by US intelligence were
      overridden by the White House's alignment with Israel's aggressive stance. The
      analysts explore the dual objectives of the strikes—disrupting Iran's nuclear
      ambitions and potentially fostering internal regime change—while noting the divided
      opinions within Iran regarding the government's support during the conflict. The
      discussion emphasizes the ongoing themes of US imperialism, the strategic role
      of Israel as a proxy, and the broader geopolitical dynamics at play in the region.

    url: https://richardfalk.org/2025/06/16/ambivalence-toward-resistance-as-a-human-right-matters-of-law-and-policy/
    text: '[ Prefatory Note : I publish here my foreword to Shannonbrooke Murphy’s pathbreaking
      book on the right of resistance. Murphy provides readers with a comprehensive
      framework for thinking about resistance to public authority in a variety of settings
      without the controversial baggage of commentaries on such salient cases as Palestine,
      Ireland, Kashmir. Exempt from direct consideration is also self-defense instances
      of resistance, which are not treated except historically, and then as matters
      of the security rights of sovereign states rather than human rights. It may disappoint
      some readers that none of these three classic instances of popular resistance
      is discussed in the text and hence not even referred to in the index. The author
      fruitfully conceptualizes the right of resistance as a human right that has a
      universal, if amorphous, resonance in international law and in the constitutional
      foundations of legitimate national governance in all parts of the world. The manipulation
      of language in the context of the October 7 lethal attack on Israeli border villages
      by political forces living under a punitive siege in Gaza imposed in 2007 in response
      to a Hamas victory in internationally monitored elections held the prior year
      and supplemented by Hamas prevailing in an intra-Palestinian power struggle with
      its rival, the Palestine Liberation Organization (linked to the internationally
      recognized Palestinian Authority that shares partial administrative, collaborative
      control over the West Bank with Israel). It is widely believed that Hamas’ rise
      was due to its advocacy and practice of a politics of resistance in contrast to
      the politics of accommodation pursued by the Palestinian Authority and PLO. October
      7 is so pivotal for an appreciation of the contradictory agenda of Israel and
      the Palestinian people. On the side of the established order favored by governments
      and elites in the West and resting on the geopolitical primacy of the Global West
      in the Middle East, the attack on Israel was a terrorist disruption of order executed
      in a barbaric manner. On the side of the Palestinians and much of the post-colonial
      Global South, the attack was perceived as a justifiable action of resistance to
      a settler colonial project that had long denied Palestinian rights, above all,
      Palestine’s inalienable right to self-determination as enshrined in Article 1
      of both human rights covenants that frame recourse to resistance by reference
      to law. The commission of violations by the resisters during the attack were commingled
      with Israeli official justifications for an extreme response, articulated ‘legally’
      as ‘Israel’s right to defend itself’ or simply as an appropriate claim of self-defense
      or as ‘counterterrorism.’ It not surprising that in the ensuing six months influential
      media platforms of the West accepted the Israel approach, decontextualizing Israel’s
      pre-October 7 behavior toward the Palestinians in general and Gaza in particular.
      Only after months of devastating attack on Gaza did this simplistic portrayal
      of the attack begin to be challenged by referencing the historical background,
      civil society protest activity, daily atrocity images and witness testimony, genocidal
      tactics and intentionality, and by disclosure of territorial ambitions and an
      ethnic cleansing agenda. At this stage, only the firmest defenders of Israel’s
      conduct, forgo the rhetoric of genocide in describing the attacks, thereby subverting
      Western official posture of punishing the use of the word genocide as a hate crime,
      a mainstream taboo. An encroaching Palestinian right of resistance rarely is even
      considered. Instead, even peace-oriented groups often limit their goals to achieving
      a non-judgmental ceasefire. A careful application of Murphy’s way of analyzing
      the role of resistance claims and practice would produce a more balanced, less
      propagandistic and geopolitical tinged, battle of words as between terrorist violence
      and resistance, and between the security of sovereign states and the human rights
      of people considered both individually and collectively. The Ukraine War and the
      recently commenced Iran War are further illustrations of the degree to which mainstream
      normative discourse on armed struggle is not deployed as a source of objectively
      interpreted legal norms and principles in conflict situations but rather used
      as a policy instrument to condemn the actions of adversaries and lend protective
      support to friends and partners. Thus, Russia is condemned, without any account
      of NATO provocations, while Israel is given the benefit of the doubt despite its
      unprovoked aggression and its unacknowledged yet widely known, arsenal of nuclear
      weaponry. To gain a deeper, more constructive understanding of these and other
      issues, Shannonbrooke’s guidance is indispensable. Her book is available at all
      the usual places.] *************############%%%%%%%%% Foreword to Shannonbrooke
      Murphy, The Human Right to Resist in International and Constitutional Law , Cambridge
      University. As I read this jurisprudentially fascinating and exceptionally learned
      book, the media was consumed by its daily accounts of the massive military operation
      conducted by Israel against the Palestinian civilian population of Gaza. It was
      a gruesome story rationalized on one side as self-defense against Hamas cast as
      a terrorist organization that carried out a barbaric attack on October 7, 2023,
      and as such, could be legitimately situated outside the protection that international
      law by setting limits on the violence of warfare, although compliance was often
      problematic. On the other side, criticism mounted that what was being called self-defense
      would be better understood if interpreted as a deliberate and unabashed recourse
      to genocide by Israel whose slaughter of Gazans that amounted to a humanitarian
      catastrophe affecting the whole of the Palestinian people. By and large, political
      leaders in the West endorsed Israel’s shocking response to the horrific Hamas
      attack on 22 villages in southern Israel, which resulted in the death of an estimated
      1,400 Jewish civilians and soldiers, as well as the seizure of an estimated 240
      hostages, severe war crimes committed by Hamas that seemed to qualify as crimes
      against humanity. In contrast, were exceptionally large and aggressive public
      demonstrations in cities around the world, including in the United States, UK,
      and other governments whose governments were giving unconditional support to Israel.
      These street protests were denouncing the scope, targeting, intensity, severity
      of Israel’s response as amounting to the crime of crimes, genocide, although the
      milder events in the West tended to confine their demands to calls for an immediate
      ceasefire, which Israel and the United States opposed at the UN and in its diplomatic
      stance. Both views, however contradictory their political outlooks seem, were
      connected by invoking law to justify and explain their impassioned partisanship.
      A reading of Shannonbrooke Murphy’s timely and conceptually brilliant book, while
      itself demanding a reader’s sophisticated and dedicated attention, is the most
      illuminating treatment of these and kindred issues of how law can be used in good
      faith to uphold a politics of armed resistance while at the same time putting
      strict limits on the legally grounded human right of people to resist various
      forms of oppressive conditions. It is an unusual situation, but far from unprecedented,
      for law to exist in certain respects but still lacking sufficient clarity to offer
      definitive guidance to parties in conflict as to what is behaviorally permitted
      and what is not, enabling the more powerful actors to engage in lawfare as part
      of its strategic approach. Murphy does not examine specific cases of conflicts
      between the forces of order and the rights of resistance in trying to depict and
      improve upon the conceptual landscape that throughout history has surrounded this
      inherently controversial set of issues. Instead, she considers resistance from
      the perspective of human rights law as it currently functions in international
      law and constitutional law, while presenting a learned and relevant account of
      historical antecedents in the work of past celebrated jurists and other normative
      sources of reflection on the dual role of law in prohibiting and permitting resistance.
      A prominent feature of the human right to resist is that it functions as a right
      of exception to the normal duty to obey . It is a matter of varying circumstances
      that give rise to resistance in a variety of context because existing arrangements
      of governance are harming individuals, groups, and peoples in socially unacceptable
      ways, often reflecting changing or evolving societal values. Such a potential
      role for positive law affirms that the contested behavior in addition to being
      morally and politically deplorable, can be further stigmatized as sufficiently
      legally deplorable as to vindicate the existence and exercise of the human right
      of resist. Domestic law typically wrestles with such issues at the level of the
      individual or group. These issues may be features of governance (for instance,
      colonialism, apartheid) of characteristics of civil society (for instance, homophobia,
      racial and religious prejudice, patriarchy). Such a human right to resist became
      prominent in the United States in the 1960s due to the refusal of individuals
      to comply with the legal obligation to serve for a limited period of time in the
      U.S. armed forces during the Vietnam War. Western democracies had previously wrestled
      with this issue during World War II, generally granting individuals and groups
      such a right if it derived from religious convictions and was directed against
      all wars, or warfare as such. During the Vietnam War an increasing number of secularly
      motivated young Americans developed a legal argument that became known as ‘selective
      conscientious objection’ in which justification for the refusal to join the armed
      forces was based on moral/legal/political objections to this particular war in
      Vietnam. Revealingly, as the Vietnam War became more unpopular with the citizenry
      over time, courts in the U.S. looked with greater favor on this once novel secular
      rationale for conscientious objection. To be more attuned to Murphy’s conceptual
      clarity, this set of issues of political propriety is addressed as a ‘cognate’
      notion that influences but is distinct from the penumbra of the ‘human right of
      resistance.’ In such a spirit, Murphy subtly balances positivist concerns with
      achieving as much conceptual precision as possible against the importance of retaining
      enough flexibility to enable law to evolve as societal values and circumstances
      change. Her jurisprudential stance favors codification efforts that take sensitive
      account of changing conditions and societal values while recognizing the benefits
      of achieving maximum conceptual precision and stability with regard to prevailing
      expectations about the content of the human right to resist. The originality of
      this learned discussion of the human right to resist, which should be of particular
      interest to common law countries such as the United States, is the decision of
      the author not to address specific cases of collective resistance such as the
      Irish or Palestinian struggle for human rights, including some form of self-rule
      or even the radical forms of opposition to Nazi genocide. In this sense, Murphy’s
      jurisprudentially impressive study can be fruitfully read as a complement to Noura
      Erakat’s fine Justice for Some: Law and the Question of Palestine (Stanford University
      Press, 2019). What Erakat gains by way of readability and context is somewhat
      offset by her fully acknowledged substantive sympathies that become part of the
      policy analysis that underpins her critique of the ways international law has
      failed the Palestinian people. In this same sense, what Murphy, despite the lucidity
      of her prose, loses by way of readability is fully redeemed by a fundamental rethinking,
      with partisan undertones, of what is at stake when a right of exception is given
      to individuals, groups, and peoples to violate the law legally, but within a secondary
      framework of authoritative legal limits. I am a great admirer of both works, but
      for different, yet interlinked reasons. In Erakat’s case because I share her compelling
      concern for delegitimizing Palestinian victimization via lawfare, while in Murphy’s
      case because I am made far more aware of the complexity of the issues involved
      in legalizing resistance, taking account of its continuing evolution and persisting
      conceptual gaps, and explicating and exploring linkages to other kindred issues
      that bear centrally on limiting the power of the state. These linkages pertain
      both to incorporating the right to resist authority into domestic constitutional
      texts and by way of applicable international human rights standards that have
      evolved into moral aspirations to become legal obligations. In this latter instance,
      for instance, such crimes as apartheid and genocide are not conceptually insulated
      from legal accountability by invoking claims of unlimited sovereignty over territorial
      governance or by constitutional provisions that accord superiority to domestic
      sources of law whenever clashes with international law are present. In one important
      respect, Murphy’s positivist presentation of issues associated with resistance
      legality takes our attention away from the political contexts of enforcement.
      We could end up with an admirably coherent conceptual framework but with a useless,
      or even regressively opportunistically legalistic approach to various categories
      of grievances emanating from those who are deemed as class adversaries or international
      rivals. The authority of law has radically uneven limits in its functioning within
      and among sovereign states. For instance, such ‘legal’ developments as the Nuremberg
      and Tokyo war crimes trials accepted the taint of ‘victors’ justice’ because of
      foreclosing inquiry, much less accountability, into the crimes of the victors.
      Even more consequential for evolving a humane global rule of law was the right
      of veto inserted into the UN Charter, thereby both hampering and tainting the
      operations of the United Nations. International law is weak when it comes to vital
      issues because its implementation tends to be disrupted by and subordinated to
      the primacy of geopolitics, which rests protection of rights on such unreliable
      restraints as imposed by deterrence threats and prudence, if at all. This results
      in major resistance claims being manipulated to reflect the interest and policy
      priorities of powerful states and domestic elites. What is evident is that the
      selective implementation of human rights law in general creates images of moral
      hypocrisy and double standards as diluting the authority of and respect for international
      legal discourse. True, some creative tension has emerged internationally due to
      the collapse of European colonialism, although Israel is a reminder of what colonialism
      meant for oppressed native peoples and is expressed by the establishment of counter-hegemonic
      legal arenas, including among jurists as exemplified by TWAIL (Third World Approaches
      to International Law) scholarship reflecting the Global South’s experience of
      the hegemonic uses of international law relied on by colonial Europe in exploiting
      the resources and dehumanizing non-Western peoples. Resistance to colonialism
      has in the post-colonial era of international relations inspired the determined
      effort to generate support for a counter-hegemonic approach to international and
      constitutional law, which is expressed by the transnational bonding of Global
      South jurists in the TWAIL enterprise. Shannonbrooke Murphy is fully aware of
      the incompleteness of a purely positivist focus on the human right to resist,
      while here setting for herself this already Herculean challenge of conceptual
      clarification. Her contributions to contemporary jurisprudence are profound, and
      rendered in ways that permit and encourage diverse inquiries into other bodies
      of human rights pertaining to a range of topics, including rights of self-defense,
      freedom of expression and freedom of religion in relation to such sensitive policy
      questions as recourse to war, rights of secession by ethnic or religious minorities,
      as well as the more sensitive personal issues of gender parity and identity. Let
      the legal architects produce responsive blueprints. Let the debates begin! Fifty
      or so years ago a British graduate student at the Yale Law School, Rosalyn Higgins,
      who like me fell under the charismatic influence of Myres McDougal in studying
      international law, but was troubled by the subjectivity and seeming ideological
      bias of a jurisprudential approach that gave legal hegemony to the Cold War values
      prevalent in the West. I was also troubled, but on different grounds. I questioned
      the jurisprudential necessity for such an ideological bias and instead sought
      a contextually sensitive approach to law that was guided by the type of secular
      humanism that infuses the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Preamble
      to the UN Charter. Professor Higgins, who later became a distinguished judge at
      the International Court of Justice, organized a conference in London to explore
      these rifts between the British and American approaches to law. Without the benefit
      of Murphy’s conceptual mapping, I found the conference most intriguing because
      of the gathering of fine legal scholars for such an unusual conversation, yet
      intellectually unrewarding as it merely reproduced the tensions between a British
      insistence that the subjectivity of the New Haven School of International Law
      undermined the authority of law and the American claim that law without a political
      and ethical context is artificially cut off from reality. If we were to arrange
      such a meeting in the future, I would insist that Shannonbrooke Murphy’s book
      be required background reading believing that both sides could valuably learn
      from it. Also, I cannot imagine a better beginning for an advanced course in either
      human rights, resistance claims, or the interplay of international and constitutional
      law than by assigning this demanding, yet remarkably imaginative, erudite, and
      rigorously conceptualized contribution to an improved understanding of the interactions
      between law, resistance, and human rights in a variety of substantive contexts.

    one_sentence_summary: Shannonbrooke Murphy's book offers a comprehensive framework
      for understanding the right of resistance as a universal human right within international
      law and national governance, while intentionally avoiding controversial case studies
      and self-defense instances.
    paragraph_summary: In the foreword to Shannonbrooke Murphy's book on the right of
      resistance, the author outlines a comprehensive framework for understanding resistance
      to public authority across various contexts, deliberately avoiding contentious
      examples such as Palestine, Ireland, and Kashmir, as well as self-defense cases.
      The book conceptualizes the right of resistance as a human right with universal
      implications in international law and national governance, despite the absence
      of specific case studies in the text. The foreword highlights the significance
      of the October 7 attack on Israeli border villages, linking it to the broader
      dynamics of resistance politics, particularly the rise of Hamas in contrast to
      the Palestinian Authority's more accommodating stance. This event is portrayed
      as crucial for understanding the conflicting agendas of Israel and the Palestinian
      people, reflecting the geopolitical complexities of the region.

  - title: What Future for US/Israel Relations? Justifying the Gaza Tribunal, Addressing
      US Complicity
    url: https://richardfalk.org/2025/06/07/what-future-for-us-israel-relations/
    text: 'Tri [Prefatory Note: the post below is the text of an interview published
      in Italian in Il Manifesto on 6/7/2025. The interview was conducted by a journalist
      friend, Patricia Lambroso. It appears here in somewhat modified form, and is devoted
      to questions about the Gaza Tribunal.] 1. The GAZA Tribunal (civilian tribunal)
      was launched in November of 2024 in London following the failure by ICJ and ICC,
      the international tribunals in the Hague, leaders and governments around the world
      to stop Israel’s crimes against humanity in Gaza. The anti-war movement that arose
      during the Vietnam War and the worldwide anti-apartheid campaign against the racist
      South African government were your examples of civic mobilization that exerted
      pressure on governments to change their unlawful, criminal policies. Is this possible
      today in the setting of Gaza and with respect to the Palestinian people regarding
      the fulfillment of their right of self-determination? Response : It is not entirely
      fair to conclude that the ICJ and ICC ‘failed’ to stop the genocidal attack on
      Gaza or the crimes against humanity alleged to have been extensively committed
      by Israel and endorsed by its political leaders. The ICJ accepted its jurisdiction
      to resolve a submission by South Africa alleging violations of the International
      Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1951), and
      issued near unanimous interim rulings in January and May 2024 to the momentous
      effect that it was ‘plausible’ to regard the ongoing Israeli violence in Gaza
      after October 7 as genocide, although a definitive ruling on violations of the
      Genocide Convention would not be available for some years in the future. The ICJ
      in 2024 also ordered Israel to cease altogether interfering with the delivery
      to Gaza of humanitarian aid taking the forms of food, medical supplies, and fuel.
      Although Israel took part in the judicial proceedings, it refused to comply with
      these interim rulings and was supported in this non-compliant behavior by the
      main complicit governments, particularly the United States that blocked impulses
      toward UN enforcement by its right of veto and its dismissive attitude toward
      recourse to the ICJ, supporting Israel claim to be acting in self-defense. It
      is more accurate  to speak of an ‘enforcement gap’ in this situation that seemed
      to nullify ICJ action after it was clear that Israel would not act in the spirit
      of membership in the UN by voluntarily complying with an adverse decision and
      that the UN was helpless in view of the clash between the judicial outcome and
      the geopolitical interests of the three NATO  Permanent Members of the Security
      Council each of which is vested with authority to nullify ICJ rulings in the event
      of a refusal of voluntary compliance by the losing party. The ICJ should not be
      blamed. Instead it should be given enforcement powers to ensure the enhanced effectiveness
      of its pronouncements on matters of international law. Until then the failure
      of judicial approaches to global security and the protection of human rights should
      be mainly associated with the design of the UN, and world order generally, controlled
      by the winners of World War II in 1945 that acted to safeguard the primacy of
      geopolitics. In part this design defect was a reaction to the perceived failure
      to recognize this primacy in the design and operation of the League of Nations,
      resulting in the non-participation or exclusion of several key countries in the
      organization, and its failure to avoid developments that culminated in the outbreak
      of World War II. The ICJ issued an historically significant Advisory Opinion on
      July 19, 2024 that also  resulted in a near unanimous outcome in responding to
      a General Assembly Resolution seeking guidance as to objections to Israel’s role
      as Occupying Power in Gaza as supposedly regulated by the 4 th Geneva Convention
      on Belligerent Occupation.[Advisory Opinion on Occupied Palestinian Territory
      Including East Jerusalem, responding to request of General Assembly for guidance
      as to “Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in
      the OPT”]  The Advisory Opinion addressed various allegations of Israeli violations
      in Gaza, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. The ICJ rendered an authoritative judgment,
      despite the misleading label of ‘Advisory,’ concluding that Israel’s pervasive
      pattern of unlawfulness in administering the Occupying Territories since the 1967
      War required terminating Israel’s administrative presence as soon as practicable,
      including Gaza. Further that the UN and its member governments were put under
      legal obligation by the ICJ to implement this authoritative assessment. This legal
      evaluation of the Israeli obligation in the Occupied Palestinian territory did
      not extend specifically to the period of time elapsing since October 7 as the
      GA Resolution was adopted prior to the Hamas attack. Israel has given not the
      slightest sign that it would comply with this crucial Advisory Opinion main conclusion
      ordering the withdrawal of Israel’s presence from the Palestinian territories
      occupied in 1967, presumably relying on the supposedly ‘advisory’ nature of the
      ICJ authority in relation to UN requests for guidance on ‘legal disputes.’ Of
      secondary significance is the issuance by the ICC of ‘arrest warrants’ for the
      Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, and the former Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant,
      for a variety of alleged crimes of Israel, although not genocide. As neither Israel
      nor the US are members of the ICC, which is not part of the UN System, the prospects
      for enforcement are almost nil. This outcome gives attention to an ‘Accountability
      Gap’ as a supplemental weakness of international to the ‘Enforcement Gap.’ The
      US Government actually has imposed personal sanctions on the Chief Prosecutor
      and any officials that participated in the issuance of arrest warrans by the ICC
      allegedly for exceeding its lawful authority. The US also threatens to sanction
      anyone attached to the ICC who tries in the future to facilitate the detention
      of these Israeli leaders in accord with the arrest warrants. Also relevant is
      a ‘Complicity Gap’ in the behavior of the ICJ and ICC that has so far refrained
      from directly examine allegations of aiding and abetting the commission of international
      crimes by third party actors, especially governments and corporations. The single
      effort to raise complicity issues was undertaken by Nicaragua that submitted a
      complaint that Germany was violating international law by supplying arms to Israel.
      A final decision has yet to be rendered, although the ICJ rebuffed the allegation
      Germany on the grounds that its supply of arms to Israel was too small to be capable
      of constituting a violation of the Genocide Convention. It seems to be left up
      to UN members and international law scholars to encourage increased ICJ attentiveness
      to the Complicity Gap, which as here, is now integral to insulating the wrongdoing
      actors from enforcement. A final structural weakness of the judicial enforcement
      of international law by way of the UN System is what might be termed ‘a temporal
      lag,’ the long lapse of time between a submission and a final decision in situation
      where the victims of behavior need and deserve expedited relief. There must be
      an emergency procedure that allows the ICJ to reach a decision within days and
      weeks, even if later in the proceedings it is revised or even reversed. It might
      seem that international law is indeed useless in view of these gaps and the inability
      to protect a people victimized by international criminal conduct but that is a
      misinterpretation. As here, even when the formal judicial outcomes of international
      institutions are neither complied with nor enforceable, international law is nevertheless
      important. Its outcomes exert influences on many governments, media coverage,
      and civil society activism. In some settings these informal implementations of
      international law help achieve some degree of justice even in the context of the
      prolonged commission of ‘the crime of crimes,’ genocide. The victimization of
      the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza for more than 19 months has severely
      delegitimized. It is now widely viewed throughout the world as a pariah state
      whose behavior in Gaza has created the ‘moral crisis of our time’ for all peoples
      and governments Israel. Many argue that Israel’s defiant refusal to abide by international
      law and to respect the authority of the UN should result in its suspension from
      UN participation until Palestinian self-determination is achieved. Israel has
      responded to these proposed initiative principally by way of weaponizing antisemitism
      claiming that its opponents are motivated by ‘Jew hatred’ rather than the motives
      that they claim. This line of Israel defense has grown ineffective even in countries
      with the most complicit governments. And yet Israel’s daily actions continue after
      all this time to be unimpeded, because of the absence of the political will needed
      to mount an ad hoc protective intervention to alleviate the humanitarian emergency
      and provide safety for the surviving Gazan population. A public dismissal of international
      law because of these flaws in the global normative order would be a mistake. Even
      when not enforced, or its findings geopolitically nullified, the outcomes of legal
      controversy exert an influence on discursive perceptions of legitimacy, that is,
      on the shaping of the legal and moral high ground in relation to an underlying
      political conflict. Contrary to the beliefs of political realists who control
      the foreign policy processes of most governments, military capabilities no longer
      are the best predictors of which side will prevail to defeat settler colonial
      arrangements in political struggles for self-determination. This should have been
      the lesson learned by the United States from its involvement in the Vietnam War
      during which it militarily prevailed on the battlefield and yet lost the war.
      Thus pattern has been repeated in most colonial wars during the latter decades
      of the 20 th century. The agency of military superiority has declined in relation
      to typical 21 st century conflict situations, but the lesson remains unlearned.
      This is so because the defeats incurred are profitable for private sectors arms
      producers that wield great influence in the Global West, particularly in the United
      States. The Gaza Tribunal was formed against this background. It was conceived
      as a project of global civil society in the conduct of a Legitimacy War between
      Israel and the Palestinian people. Israel’s violent assault on Gaza that started
      shortly after October 7, resisted repeated UN calls for an Israeli ceasefire as
      well as defied the ICJ and ICC rulings, provoking a rising sense of moral outrage
      among the peoples of the world. The GT is gathering evidence and assessments from
      an assortment of qualified survivor witnesses, experts, as well as from three
      chambers each composed of about 10 specialists documenting the significance of
      international law in its several dimensions relevant to the situation in Gaza.
      The results will be presented in October of this yeard to a Jury of Conscience
      composed of persons with diverse experience reflecting prominence in law, political
      science, moral authority, and cultural expression who are made responsible for
      the preparation of oral and written responses. This result of the Gaza Tribunal
      is premised on the primacy of justice rather than the primacy of law or the primacy
      of geopolitics, and makes no pretense of being a normal court of law bound to
      give the accused state and non-state actors ample opportunities to mount a legal
      defense of their behavior. The GT does not mimic judicial tribunals that operate
      within strict technical limits and over long durations of time. It is openly partisan
      although objective with respect to evidence, and hopes to add leverage to those
      engaged in the Legitimacy War, proudly acknowledges itself as being responsive
      to the urgency of the Gaza humanitarian emergency, and seeks above all to prove
      itself relevant on the level of action . The GT relies on a variety of civil society
      solidarity initiatives to exert pressures on governments to close the enforcement,
      accountability, and complicity gaps. It also encourages nonviolent solidarity
      initiatives by civil society, including boycotts of sporting and cultural events
      that have Israeli participation; arms, trade, and  investment embargoes; and protest
      activity of all varieties. 2 The silence and complicity of Europe on this massacre
      for extinction of Gaza population today and beside hypocritical condemnation and
      people demonstrations in Italy and France Why? How the Holocaust  is weaponized 
      by some like Germany to be accused of antisemitism, but France and Italy have
      a different history (Vichy and Mussolini and Nazi fascism)? Response : As your
      question suggests, history helps us understand and explain the complicity of democratic
      governments in Europe with Israel’s recourse to genocide and crimes against humanity
      in Gaza. There exist two principal lines of explanation for this stance so contrary
      to the values proclaimed from the rooftops by liberal societies in the West .
      The first, and most obvious, is embedded sentiments of guilt about the long tradition
      of European antisemitism, culminating in the Holocaust. Especially, Germany is
      acutely sensitive to this allegation and politically has unfortunately opted for
      the view that to overcome its past it is better to stand with Israel than to side
      with the Palestinians who like the Jews of the Hitler period are enduring a horrific
      genocide. In other words, the renunciation of genocide in the pledge pertains
      exclusively to the past victimized people, here the Jews, rather than to a repudiated
      pattern of behavior, here genocide, regardless of the identity of the victim.
      The Srebrenica genocide of 1995 tested the pledge because the events in Bosnia
      tested whether ‘never again’ was ethnic or geographical, of relevance only if
      Europe was the scene. The second strand of explanation, implicit on the right
      end of the political spectrum in Europe, insists that the Nazi genocide was also
      a matter of racial purification and religion, not just Jewish identity. In this
      sense, the Jews in relation to the Islamic world of the Middle East are bearing
      the torch of white supremacy, a reenactment of the Crusade under different flags
      in the context of modernity. In this post-Cold War period Israel is on the Islamic
      containment fault line of ‘a clash of civilizations,’ in effect ‘a second coming
      of Samuel Huntington’ fatalistic warning that the end of the Cold War was not
      a gateway to global peace, but rather a shift in conflict patterns from Communism
      to Islamism. In this sense, the emergent ‘enemy’ of these European countries is
      Iran, a non-Arab country that manifests hostility to the white and secular West,
      and which also happens to regard Israel as its principal enemy. In this sense,
      the opposition to the West from the Iranian perspective is anti-imperial and political,
      more than it is civilizational, although its deep roc ots are difficult to disentangle
      from the historical interaction, especially vivid memories of a CIA-engineered
      coup in 1953 that forcibly restored the autocratic modernizing monarchy to the
      Pahlavi throne. 3. Trump touring the Gulf States could have political consequences
      for Gaza? Response : There is no doubt that Trump’s May 2025 visit to the Gulf
      States will have consequences for Gaza, but their nature remains obscure at this
      time. On one side, it could be the first stage of a more transactional relationship
      with Israel than the kind of blind support given during the Biden presidency.
      In this sense an altered posture toward regional war prevention might result in
      a greater willingness to forego an attack on Iran, and more readiness to seek
      a negotiated solution with Tehran as to their nuclear program, a course of action
      disquieting to Israel, and shaking Tel Aviv’s confidence in unlimited support
      for their preferred endgame in Gaza. It might also encourage the US Government
      to seek to strengthen Trump’s patently absurd candidacy for a Nobel Peace Prize,
      reportedly high among his narcissistic phantasies. As strange as it seems, this
      image of Trump as a peacemaker concretely express incentives and exert real pressure
      on Israel to stop finally the genocidal assault on Gaza. It might even push the
      US to back a two-state endgame that subverts Israel’s obvious ambition to terminate
      the Zionist Project by annexing the West Bank on its way to establishing an Israeli
      one-state. Even more radical would be a shift away from further tolerance of Israel’s
      secret acquisition on a nuclear weapons capability achieved with Western complicity
      to a position of backing regional denuclearization, but the long silence makes
      even this sensible contribution seem utopian as far as the prospects of its adoption
      is concerned. But which of the nine nuclear powers has shown less respect for
      international law and the constraints of the UN Charter than Israel when it comes
      to the use of force? Contrariwise, May trip to the Gulf energy-rich monarchies
      may have convinced Trump that he could combine positive relations with these Gulf
      regimes and yet give Netanyahu what he wants in Gaza. There is reason to believe
      that the main Arab leaders want Hamas destroyed as much as do the Israeli leaders
      in Tel Aviv, and could be persuaded to join hands with the US, and even Israel,
      by adopting a shared counter-terrorism orientation that might prove compatible
      with the forced displacement of Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank,
      ideally to be dumped in a remote African country where it is falsely assumed by
      advocated that in time those displaced by the second Nakba event will stop dreaming
      of and disengage from struggles to liberate Palestine from the clutches of settler
      colonialism, no matter how long it takes. Israel has lost legitimacy by carrying
      their attack on the civilian population of Gaza beyond the outer limit of decency
      by recourse to deliberate tactics of prolonged starvation. Israel’s pariah identity
      will be hard to overcome with the peoples of the world, including the citizenries
      of the liberal democracies in the Europe and North America. Trump’s trip sidelining
      Israel diplomatically, at least for the moment, and Netanyahu’s arrogant launch
      of the Gideon’s Chariot, Israel’s new military operation, may signal a more problematic
      phase in Israel/US relations or turn on whether maintaining harmony with Israel
      strengthens or weakens the Trump agenda of the next few years. Given the singling
      out of Palestinian Support on American campuses as a target for the ultra-right
      agenda of Project 2025 I would still expect that US support for Israel to remain
      unaffected in the near future as the levers of Zionist influence (e.g. AIPAC,
      donor deference) are still strong in the United States'

      due to the inaction of international courts regarding Israel's actions in Gaza,
      aims to mobilize civic pressure for the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.
    paragraph_summary: The GAZA Tribunal, established in November 2024 in London, emerged
      in response to the perceived inadequacies of the International Court of Justice
      (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in addressing alleged crimes
      against humanity committed by Israel in Gaza. In an interview, the tribunal's
      proponents argue that while the ICJ acknowledged the plausibility of genocide
      in its interim rulings, Israel's non-compliance with these orders highlights the
      challenges of enforcing international law. The tribunal seeks to mobilize civic
      pressure akin to historical movements against apartheid and the Vietnam War to
      advocate for Palestinian self-determination and to hold Israel accountable for
      its actions, despite the complexities of international legal frameworks and the
      ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

    url: https://richardfalk.org/2025/06/02/trump-v-netanyahu-transactional-or-ideological/
    text: Trump’s second term as US President has been mercurial, with lots of bobbing
      and weaving more bearing resemblance to a boxer’s opening round in which the point
      is to feel out the opponent rather than to land decisive punches. The pragmatism
      of the deal or the inflexibility of firm commitments premised on images of world
      order and national interest as reflective of hard power calculations in a world
      of states that political realists perceive as divided among friends, enemies,
      and those that don’t count. In the case of Israel, this early rhythm of Trump’s
      second term is notable mainly for its uncertainty, contrasting with the tight
      brotherly embrace of Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, who tried from time to time
      to adjust this image ever so slightly by  gestures of humanitarian concern that
      Netanyahu seemed to misconstrue as serious US efforts to constrain Israel’s genocidal
      assault on Gaza. As the quickly faded red line in Gaza illustrated Biden’s gentle
      warnings to Israel were mainly for show in response to public relations concerns
      arising in the US in response to the American protest activity and liberal media
      criticisms of Israel’s behavior in Gaza that struck more and more observers as
      ‘genocide,’ although most influential media platforms shied away from calling
      a spade a spade, that is, naming Israel’s Gaza violence as genocide. This inhibition
      on any governmental naming of the crime persists under Trump and is combined with
      the intensification of the repressive campaign inherited from Biden to treat support
      for the Palestinian pursuit of their basic rights and criticisms of Israeli excesses
      as ‘antisemitism,’ as a ‘hate crime against the Jewish people.’ Siding with the
      victim of flagrant crime is transformed by the magic of language into itself being
      the crime. This turn of phrase also offers Trump a pretext for advancing his generalized
      attacks on knowledge-based policy making of experts and reflecting scientific
      research as typified by elite universities, which are themselves epitomized by
      Harvard. Trump’s moves against Harvard involving defunding of research and challenging
      the immigration status of foreign students amount to an pedagogical assault on
      the accepted modern learning paradigm flavored by appeals to xenophobia rampant
      among the MAGA base. This campaign is vintage Trump, who combines his trust in
      belief-based action as fused with professions of ultra-nationalism. Trump, despite
      shifts against Israel in US and European civil society sentiments never wastes
      words by making even the slightest display of empathy for the extrem suffering
      of the Palestinian people. He seems almost pathologically dazzled by prospects
      of access to the extreme wealth and geopolitical grandeur of the Gulf monarchies,
      carried to absurd extremes by proposing a US takeover of Gaza with the surreal
      promise of establishing ‘the Riviera of the Middle East,’ which included a proviso
      undoubtedly comforting to Tel Aviv that the reconstruction plan would be preceded
      by the forced departure of its surviving Palestinian population. It remains unclear
      to this day whether Trump was seeking a deal in which the financial burden would
      be shifted to the Arab world while the political administration of post-genocide
      Gaza, purged of Palestinians, would be entrusted to US administrative supervision,
      which is a double gain for Israel (no Palestinians, no UN). As such, more than
      his predecessors Trump seemed at first to support unconditionally even Israel’s
      regional game plan of eliminating or weakening by military means potential threats
      to its future security by states and movements in its region. Despite likely swerves
      on the road ahead Trump seems at this stage determined to avoid Israeli distractions
      from the pursuit of his own separate primarily transactional goals in the Middle
      East that are of a primarily economistic character. Trump’s transactional mindset
      can be reduced to the  pursuit of national gains with respect to trade and investment
      as awkwardly combined with corrupt personal and family enrichment schemes. Above
      all such a course of action presupposes the US being not too overtly seen as aiding
      and abetting Netanyahu’s resolve to complete the Zionist Project of establishing
      an Israeli one-state solution that displaces Palestinians from the land and Palestine
      from maps of the Middle East. It should be noted that long before October 7 and
      years prior to Netanyahu extremist coalition that assumed governing authority
      at the start of 2023 the Israeli Knesset formally enacted into law the claim of
      exclusive Jewish supremacy without the slightest adverse reaction from Washington.
      [Israel’s Basic Law of 2018]. Netanyahu was Prime Minister at the time heading
      a less extreme governing leadership in Israel, yet committed to Israel sovereignty
      from the river to the sea, achieved by relying on a long tradition of patient
      reliance on salami tactics, taking small steps toward the fulfillment of the Zionist
      Project. What the new 2023 Netanyahu team brought to the table was an acceleration
      of this consensus ‘solution’ to Palestinian resistance and resilience by disclosing
      its endgame agenda of violent dispossession and provocation.  Trump will face
      a foreign policy dilemma of either opposing the revival of the UN-backed two-state
      negotiated solution or siding with Israel, concluding that the time has come to
      legitimize Israel’s one-state genocidally engineered outcome that included permanent
      statelessness for the Palestinian people, which entailed repudiating their inalienable
      right of self-determination. The most revealing near-term regional measure of
      geopolitical affinity with Israel is whether American foreign policy chooses to
      normalize relations with Iran by reaching agreement about its nuclear program
      or eventually goes along with, and possibly even joins, Israel’s strong push for
      a major miliary strike aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities and Iran’s
      large-scale long-range missile response, and possibly sparking regime change in
      Tehran. Iranian diplomacy seems flexible about accepting enrichment limits and
      international inspection, although a recent UN inspection concluded that Iran
      was heightening its enrichment output to near weapons’ grade uranium, presumably
      devising its own weak form of deterrence to the overt threats to its security
      constantly being made. Trump seems likely to be tempted, for regional and geopolitical
      reasons, to explore options for an agreement with Iran, especially if it looks
      like a win for Washington’s diplomacy. If this is only speculatively accurate
      Trump would come to resent Israel’s effort to discourage ending Iran’s isolation
      without first getting rid of its anti-Israeli government. If Israel is antagonized
      in its regional security plan of neutralizing hostile threats by weakening the
      unity and capabilities of all Middle East actors, movements as well as states,
      an open break could occur, however improbable that now seems. There are many unknowns
      that will impact upon regional developments, not least of which is Trump’ susceptibility
      to embarking on drastic changes in policy maneuvers as he or his entourage of
      submissive advisors perceive and juggle their options. Nevertheless, there are
      reasons at this time to accord serious attention to contrasting normalization
      and warmaking scenarios. The world is experiencing the dawn of a new phase of
      international relations in a less unipolar world order marking a terminal phase
      of international history best understood as ‘the aftermath of the Cold War’ that
      followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. Among the transitional uncertainties
      are shifts in geopolitical alignments, alliance relationships, and financial hierarchies.
      The yet undefined yet ascendant roles and ambitions of China and Russia, and possibly
      India, are likely to challenge the prior era of undiluted US geopolitical primacy.
      A major uncertainty is whether the US will adapt to multipolarity or seek at great
      cost to perpetuate its post-Cold War dominance that it achieved from 1992 to 2022.
      To do the latter would mean focusing on nullifying the geopolitical challenges
      of not only Russia and China, but also a more activist and coherent Global South.
      It would also mean sacrificing the wellbeing of Americans, the ravages of climate
      change, allowing public indebtedness to reach untenable levels, and letting the
      national infrastructure to deteriorate even further. A related uncertainty is
      whether this new phase of multipolarity would be more conflictual or more cooperative
      than the world order of the past three decades. Would the less unified West embark
      upon an all-out worldwide Cold War as was done in the years after 1945 in greatly
      altered global circumstances? Or would it seek some form of geopolitical collaboration
      that prepared the way toward problem-solving cooperative relations within reconfigured
      geopolitical spheres of interest that accorded primacy to political tradition
      and geographic proximity. The reinvention of viable 21 st century spheres of influence
      and agreed fault lines should preoccupy ‘the best and the brightest’ among foreign
      policy gurus in the US, Russia, and China. It is untested whether Trump’s leverage
      over Netanyahu is sufficient to induce Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire
      in exchange for the return of the hostages. It is partly a matter of how much
      Trump is prepared to weaken US domestic support in the US for his presidency in
      Zionist and Evangelical circles by putting visible pressure on Israel to discontinue
      its genocidal policies in Gaza, coupled with the Gazification of West Bank policy.
      Trump currently appears far more concerned about avoiding open war with Iran than
      stopping the violence in Occupied Palestine. Of course, Trump is the most quixotic
      leader on the present world scene, and so it may be that he is personally offended
      by Netanyahu’s refusal to do what he proposes on behalf of wider US strategic
      interests in the region, and would be prepared to accept an open break with Israel,
      which would have unpredictable impacts on the governability of the US. At odds
      with such transformative prospects for world order are the concrete indications
      that even give Trump’s ambivalence toward Netanyahu’s approach he is complicit
      in its recent unfolding. It takes the form of insinuating an American presence
      in a politically motivated humanitarian aid plan that is managed by an American
      private security company (SRS) that provides mercenaries to oversea the distribution
      centers for the dispensing of aid. The whole scheme is disguised by deceptive
      language of humanitarianism. Even if it ran according to its announced plan, it
      would bypass the neutral auspices of UN-administered aid as bolstered by international
      civil society humanitarian aid as well as explicitly collect surveillance information
      designed to track Palestinian aid recipients. So far, this relief effort directed
      as alleviating a humanitarian emergency has made ‘starvation’ the lesser of evils
      when compared to the massacres of those lured to the distribution centers, and
      then killed and wounded in large numbers by drones, tank fire, and indiscriminate
      shooting of helpless Palestinians caught by the cruel lure of food. Although the
      Israeli Occupation Forces deny the allegations, they have confirmed by numerous
      eye witnesses and journalists on the ground. It seems a particularly grotesque
      extension of the genocide to kill randomly starving civilians who Lost their lives
      while desperately seeking food and aid for their families. Turning to Netanyahu,
      the question is how much pressure would be needed to produce a change in Israel’s
      approach to Gaza. Over the course of almost two years Netanyahu has been notably
      stubborn and unyielding in response to critics at home and internationally, including
      in the US. He might expect that Trump would give Israel a bright green light to
      complete the end game of the Zionist Project by depopulating and partially occupying
      Gaza and annexing all or most of the West Bank. Also at issue is whether Netanyahu’s
      caving into Trump pressure on Gaza would result in the collapse of Israel’s fragile
      coalition government, and subject Netanyahu to resumed fraud prosecutions in Israel.
      In the end I think the safest prediction is a compromise, whereby a long-term
      ceasefire, less than permanent, is agreed upon coupled with renewedsupport for
      Israel’s expansion of the settler presence in West Bank (22 new settlements have
      been approved by the Knesset at the end of May) and accompanying annexationist
      moves. The whole outcome in Gaza may depend on how seriously Israel is about launching
      a strike designed to destroy Iran’s nuclear program as balanced is the Trump quest
      for a more advantageous deal than was negotiated in 2015 while Obama was president.
      In the background is the weakening support for Israel among the governments in
      western Europe partially reflecting the loss of Israeli support in civil societies
      around the world, including the US and Canada. Whether these countries and others
      will back up this recent wave of criticism with censure and sanctions is at this
      time unknown as is how this conjecture of a weakening of western support for Israel
      will impact US policy. Will it make Trump more or less insistent on backing Israel
      and move Netanyahu to become somewhat receptive to a ceasefire/hostages deal as
      a prelude to ending the Gaza ordeal. The weeks ahead will contain signs as to
      which way the wind is blowing both in the region and internationally. At present,
      the overall situation is in flux aggravated by these two leaders who are temperamentally
      autocratic, but one bends with the wind and the other is as rigid as brainless
      robot.
    one_sentence_summary: Trump's second term as President has been characterized by
      a cautious and uncertain approach to foreign policy, particularly regarding Israel,
      contrasting sharply with Biden's more empathetic yet ultimately ineffective attempts
      to influence Israeli actions in Gaza.
    paragraph_summary: Trump's second term as US President has been characterized by
      a cautious and unpredictable approach to foreign policy, particularly regarding
      Israel, contrasting sharply with Joe Biden's more overtly supportive stance. While
      Biden's administration attempted to balance support for Israel with humanitarian
      concerns over its actions in Gaza—often perceived as genocidal—Trump's administration
      has maintained a more ambiguous position, avoiding direct condemnation of Israel's
      actions. This ambiguity is compounded by a broader trend of labeling criticism
      of Israeli policies as antisemitism, which serves to stifle discourse on Palestinian
      rights and reinforces a narrative that frames support for these rights as a crime.
      Trump's approach reflects a skepticism toward expert-driven policy-making, aligning
      with a populist rejection of established norms in international relations.

    text: '[ Prefatory Note : the post below is The Sarajevo Declaration of the Gaza
      Tribunal, a consensus document prepared in conjunction with participants in the
      first of two Public Sessions of the Gaza Tribunal, released on May 2 9 , 2025.
      The second session of the tribunal is scheduled for late October. The proceedings
      in Sarajevo consisted of survivor testimony from Gaza, invited expert speakers,
      a roundtable on media complicity, and the reports of three chambers tasked with
      documenting evidence and consequences of alleged genocide and crimes associated
      with forcible application of the Settler Colonial Project to Gaza following October
      7, as well as the failure of the UN, growing public protests, and of leading governments
      to bring the genocide to an end in accordance with international law and hold
      the perpetrators accountable. The Sarajevo Declaration is a comprehensive text
      intended to convey the orientation, broad scope of the goals of civil society
      solidarity activation and reflecting the diversity of concerns among members of
      the Gaza Tribunal community . Sarajevo was our chosen site to express symbolic
      solidarity with an earlier genocide at Srebrenica that occurred 30 years ago.
      Encourage wide sharing of the Sarajevo Declaration. It is my honor to serve as
      president of the GTP in concert with dedicated scholars, witnesses, and activists
      from around the world, including the inspiring participation of our Palestinian
      sisters and brothers.] The Sarajevo Declaration of the Gaza Tribunal 28 May We,
      the members of the Gaza Tribunal, having gathered in Sarajevo from 26 to 29 May
      2025, declare our collective moral outrage at the continuing genocide in Palestine,
      our solidarity with the people of Palestine, and our commitment to working with
      partners across global civil society to end the genocide and to ensure accountability
      for perpetrators and enablers, redress for victims and survivors, the building
      of a more just international order, and a free Palestine. We condemn the Israeli
      regime, its perpetration of genocide, and its decades-long policies and practices
      of settler colonialism, ethno-supremacism, apartheid, racial segregation, persecution,
      unlawful settlements, the denial of the right to return, collective punishment,
      mass detention, torture and cruel and inhuman treatment and punishment, extrajudicial
      executions, systematic sexual violence, demolitions, forced displacement and expulsions,
      ethnic purges and forced demographic change, forced starvation, the systematic
      denial of all economic and social rights, and extermination. We are horrified
      by the Israeli regime’s systematic devastation of Palestinian lives, lands, and
      livelihoods, including its intentional destruction of all sources and systems
      for food, water, healthcare, education, housing, culture, as well as mosques,
      churches, aid facilities, and refugee shelters, and its targeting of medical personnel,
      journalists, aid workers, and United Nations staff, and its direct targeting of
      civilians, including children and older persons, women and men,  girls and boys,
      persons with disabilities and those with medical conditions. We demand an immediate
      withdrawal of Israeli forces and an end to the genocide, to all Israeli military
      action, to forced displacement and expulsions, to settlement activities, to the
      siege of Gaza and restrictions on movement in the West Bank. We call for the immediate
      and unconditional release of all prisoners, including the thousands of Palestinian
      women, men and children held in abusive Israeli detention facilities. We insist
      on the immediate resumption of massive humanitarian aid to all of Gaza without
      restriction or interference, including food, water, shelter, medical supplies
      and equipment, sanitary equipment, rescue equipment, and construction materials
      and equipment. We call as well for a complete withdrawal of all Israeli forces
      from all Lebanese and Syrian territory. We call for an end of the smearing of
      UNRWA and other humanitarian workers, for the free and unhindered access of UNRWA
      and all other United Nations and humanitarian organizations in all areas of Gaza
      and the West Bank, for full compensation by the Israeli regime for damage caused
      to UN and humanitarian facilities, alongside full compensation and reparations
      to the Palestinian people, and for full accountability for the harassment, abduction,
      torture, and murder of UNRWA and other humanitarian workers and their families.
      We call on all governments and on regional and international organizations to
      end the historic scandal of inaction that has characterized the past nineteen
      months, to urgently respond with all means at their disposal to end the Israeli
      assault and siege, to uphold international law, to hold perpetrators to account,
      and to provide immediate relief and protection to the people of Palestine. We
      denounce the continued complicity of governments in the perpetration of Israeli
      war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Palestine, and the shameful
      role of many media corporations in covering up the genocide, dehumanizing Palestinians,
      and in the dissemination of propaganda fueling anti-Palestinian racism, war crimes,
      and genocide. We equally denounce the wave of persecution and crackdowns on human
      rights defenders, peace activists, students, academics, workers, professionals,
      and others, perpetrated by Western governments, police agencies, the private sector,
      and educational institutions. We honor those who, despite this persecution, have
      had the courage and moral convictions to stand up and speak out against these
      historic horrors, and we insist on the full protection of the human rights of
      free expression, opinion, assembly, and association, as well as the right to defend
      human rights without harassment, retaliation, or persecution. We reject the unjust
      tactic of smearing as “antisemites” or “supporters of terrorism” all those who
      dare to speak up and act to defend the rights of the Palestinian people and to
      condemn the injustices and atrocities of the Israeli regime and its perpetration
      of apartheid and genocide, or those who criticize the ideology of political Zionism.
      We stand in solidarity with all those who have been smeared or punished in this
      way. We are convinced that the struggle against all forms of racism, bigotry,
      and discrimination necessarily includes the equal rejection of Islamophobia, anti-Arab
      and anti-Palestinian racism, and antisemitism. It also includes an acknowledgment
      of the horrific effects that Zionism, apartheid, and settler-colonialism have
      had and continue to have on the Palestinian people. We commit to fighting all
      such scourges. We also reject the destructive ideology of political Zionism, as
      the official state ideology of the Israeli regime, of the forces that colonized
      Palestine and established the Israeli state on its ruins, and of pro-Israel organizations
      and proxies today. We insist, in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human
      Rights, that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and
      that there are no exceptions to this rule. We call for decolonization across the
      land, an end to the ethno-supremacist order, and the replacement of political
      Zionism with a dispensation founded on equal human rights for Christians, Muslims,
      Jews, and others. We are inspired by the courageous resistance and resilience
      of the Palestinian people in the face of over a century of persecution, and by
      the growing movement of millions standing in solidarity with them around the world,
      including the principled advocacy and nonviolent action of thousands of Jewish
      activists who have rejected the Israeli regime and its ethnonationalist ideology,
      and have declared that the Israeli regime neither represents them nor acts in
      their name. We recognize the right of the Palestinian people to resist foreign
      occupation, colonial domination, apartheid, subjugation by a racist regime, and
      aggression, including through the use of armed struggle, in accordance with and
      as recognized in international law and as affirmed by the United Nations General
      Assembly. We recall that the Palestinian right to self-determination is jus cogens
      and erga omnes (a universal rule not subject to exception and binding on all states)
      and is non-negotiable and axiomatic. We recognize that this right includes political,
      economic, social, and cultural self-determination, the right to return and full
      compensation for all harms suffered in a century of persecution, to permanent
      sovereignty over natural resources, and to non-aggression and non-intervention.
      We respect Palestinian aspirations and full Palestinian agency and leadership
      over all decisions affecting their lives, and we stand in solidarity with them.
      We are gravely concerned at the direction of international relations, international
      politics, and international institutions, and by attacks on those international
      institutions that have challenged genocide and apartheid in Palestine. We believe
      that the normative foundations of the global order, grounded in human rights,
      the self-determination of peoples, peace, and the international rule of law, are
      being sacrificed at the altar of ruthless political realism and obsequious deference
      to power, with the people of Palestine left undefended and vulnerable on the front
      lines. We insist that another world is possible and intend to fight to bring it
      about. We fear that the nascent and flawed international normative order, built
      up since the Second World War, with human rights at its center, is at risk of
      collapse as a result of the sustained attack waged on the system by the Israeli
      regime’s Western allies in their quest to buttress Israeli impunity. We pledge
      to oppose this attack and to work to protect and advance the project of building
      a world in which human rights are governed by the rule of law, beginning with
      the struggle for Palestinian freedom. And we believe that the weaknesses and inequities
      hard-wired into the international system from the start, including the geopolitical
      right of exception codified in the United Nations Security Council veto, the disempowerment
      of the General Assembly, and the structural obstacles that mitigate against the
      enforceability of International Court of Justice (ICJ) decisions, must be reformed
      and rectified. We demand immediate action to isolate, contain, and hold accountable
      the Israeli regime through universal boycott, divestment, sanctions, a military
      embargo, suspension from International organizations, and the prosecution of its
      perpetrators, and we commit ourselves to this cause. We equally demand individual
      criminal accountability for all Israeli political and military leaders, soldiers,
      and settlers implicated in war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, or gross
      violations of human rights, as well as accountability for all persons and organizational
      actors guilty of complicity in the regime’s crimes, including external proxies
      of the Israeli regime, government officials, corporations, arms manufacturers,
      energy companies, technology firms, and financial institutions. We applaud the
      International Court of Justice (ICJ) for its ongoing historic genocide case against
      the Israeli regime and for its landmark advisory opinion findings on the illegality
      of the Israeli occupation, of the apartheid wall, and of the Israeli practice
      of apartheid and racial segregation, and its findings that the rights of the Palestinian
      people are not dependent upon or subject to negotiation with their oppressor and
      that all states are obliged to abstain from treaty, economic, trade, investment,
      or diplomatic relations with Israel’s occupation regime. We celebrate the principled
      action of South Africa in bringing to the ICJ the historic genocide case against
      the Israeli regime. We call on all states to ensure the implementation of all
      provisional measures adopted by the ICJ in the genocide case against Israel, to
      fully respect the findings of the ICJ in its advisory opinion of July 2024, to
      comply with all elements of the United Nations General Assembly resolution of
      13 September 2024 (A/ES-10/L.31/Rev.1), ending all arms trade with and implementing
      sanctions on the Israeli regime, and to support accountability for all Israeli
      perpetrators.  We urge civil society organizations and social movements around
      the world to initiate and strengthen campaigns to support the ICJ’s decisions
      and opinions on Palestine, and to press their own governments to abide by them.
      We similarly applaud the International Criminal Court for (albeit belatedly) issuing
      arrest warrants for two senior Israeli regime leaders and call on the ICC to both
      expedite action on these cases and to issue further warrants for other Israeli
      perpetrators, both civilian and military.  We call on all ICC State Parties to
      urgently act on their obligations to arrest these perpetrators and hand them over
      for trial, and we demand that the United States lift all ICC sanctions and cease
      all obstruction of justice. We express our gratitude and admiration to the independent
      special procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council for their expert
      contributions and for their strong and principled voices in holding the Israeli
      regime to account and defending the human rights of the Palestinian people. They
      have shown themselves to be the conscience of the organization, and we call on
      the United Nations and all member states to defend and support these mandate holders
      without fail. We applaud, as well, the principled action of those United Nations
      agencies that have acted to defend the rights of the Palestinian people and to
      provide aid and relief to the survivors of genocide in Palestine in the face of
      unprecedented risks and obstacles, foremost among them, UNRWA. We believe that
      the world is approaching a dangerous precipice, the front edge of which is in
      Palestine. Dangerous forces in both the public and private spheres are pushing
      us toward the abyss. The events of the past nineteen months, and our own deliberations,
      have convinced us that both key international organizations and most countries
      of the world, whether acting individually or collectively, have failed in defending
      the human rights of the Palestinian people and in responding to the Israeli regime’s
      genocide in Palestine. We are convinced that the challenge of justice now falls
      to people of conscience everywhere, to civil society and to social movements,
      to all of us. As such, our work in the coming months will be dedicated to meeting
      this challenge. Palestinian lives are at stake. The international moral and legal
      order is at stake. We must not fail. We will not relent. * * * * * * * *'

    text: 'Opening Remarks, Richard Falk, Sarajevo Public Session of Gaza Tribunal,
      26 May 2025 Members of the Gaza Tribunal, Ladies and Gentlemen, Persons of Conscience
      Throughout the World, and Rector Ahmed Yildirim. It is my honor to welcome you
      to the opening day of the Sarajevo Public Session of the Gaza Tribunal. It is
      with great regret that I am not physically present in Sarajevo. I wish that I
      could be with you in person, but an unforeseen family accident disrupted my travel
      plans. The purpose of the Gaza Tribunal is to add credibility to the torment and
      outrage of people throughout the world and do are part to bringing the Gaza ordeal
      of death and devastation to an end. Among our goals is to motivate nonviolent
      action performed with a goal of exerting pressure on Israel to desist from genocide.
      We commit ourselves to this goal in the name of our common humanity. We are most
      grateful to the International University of Sarajevo, and particularly Rector
      Yildirim for hosting our presence on this historic campus. We are of course mindful
      of Sarajevo’s and Bosnia’s recent past and its symbolic relevance to the tragic
      fate that has befallen the Palestinian all of whom have are living as permanent
      refugees or as persecuted strangers in their own homeland. In the spirit of solemn
      acknowledgement, we should pay homage today 30 years after the willful massacre
      of 8,000 male Bosnians at Srebrenica for no reason other than their nationality
      and religion. In the present period already lasting more than 19 months the eyes
      and ears of the world have been exposed to daily atrocities victimizing the besieged
      crowded, impoverished, and tiny Gaza Strip. Earlier genocides, including the Holocaust,
      were mostly known in retrospect by way of survivor stories and reconstructed images
      of the horrors experienced by the victims. This was a macabre contrast to the
      devastation of Gaza reported by the hour in words and images. Day after day the
      unspeakable suffering of Palestine’s remarkably resilient and resisting people
      disoriented persons of conscience by its transparent spectacles of evil. This
      impact was worsened by being brought to human awareness in real time. Shamelessly,
      Israel made little attempt to hide its genocidal intentions or disguise its genocidal
      tactics. Its leaders and pro-government activists openly declared their goals
      as killing and maiming Palestinians, whether by bombs or by way of terrifying
      refusals to allow Gazans to obtain desperately needed food and medical supplies.
      Its leaders on some occasions sought to justify their behavior be referencing
      Biblical stories of genocide. Presumably, this was done to provide a hallowed
      religious precedent for their current operations in Gaza of mass extermination.
      Israel’s minimum goals were to induce large-scale departures from Occupied Palestine
      to places as distant as possible from their homeland that has been rendered virtually
      uninhabitable by repeated bombardment and artillery shelling. The genocidal cast
      of mind accompanying the military onslaught was manifest. Prominent Israeli citizens
      and government officials openly compared the mentality accompanying the killing
      Palestinians to that experienced while killing of cockroaches. Some high-profile
      Israelis even advocated dropping a nuclear bomb on the densely populated and totally
      vulnerable people of Gaza. Despite some pretensions to the contrary, the Israeli
      hostages held by Hamas did not restrain Israel’s violence or move the government
      toward accepting a permanent ceasefire even after the fury of its campaign went
      on month after month without achieving its purported original objective of destroying
      Hamas. The pleas and warnings of the world’s leading moral authority figures went
      unheeded by Israel or its supporting governments. These including dedicated pleas
      from Pope Francis and Pope Leo XIV as well as from the UN Secretary General, Antonio
      Guterres, and several Nobel Peace Prize winners. These varied revered voices were
      defiantly scorned by Israel’s government and citizenry, and the massacres in Gaza
      continued unabated, and even spread to the West Bank. The UN despite making a
      variety of responses has not been able to stop the killing, let alone protect
      the victimized people of Gaza, even its children, women, disabled, and elderly
      comprising an estimated 70% of Palestinian casualties. The UN has been blocked
      from taking decisive action by the diplomatic complicity of the North American
      and European liberal democracies. It has become obvious to all that the UN lacks
      the independent political will, authority, and capability to override the kind
      of geopolitical and material impunity given to Israel by the US. As the Israeli
      rogue behavior persisted the peoples of the world, including in the countries
      whose governments were openly aligned with Israel, mounted increasingly militant
      protests. However, the governments that could have made a difference watched the
      carnage of bodies and rubble pile up without making moves to stop it, and this
      sadly includes the governments of Israel’s Arab neighbors whose peoples ardently
      supported the Palestinian liberation struggle while their regimes remained passive.
      In many instances even maintained positive economic and political links with Israel
      belying their pretenses of neutrality or verbal opposition. It is against this
      background that Gaza Tribunal was established some months ago, launched in London
      in November of 2024. Since then working with dedication to prepare as well as
      possible for this public session in Sarajevo. The undertaking can be grasped from
      the appended ambitious Program of the Tribunal that will unfold over the next
      four days. The GT draws inspiration from prior peoples tribunals, most especially
      from the Russell Tribunal addressing the unlawfulness of US intervention in the
      Vietnam War, from the Iraq War Tribunal that was prompted by the 2003 regime-changing
      aggression that brought chaos and misery to the Iraqi people, and from the tireless
      work of the Permanent Peoples Tribunal of Rome that sponsored and organized comparable
      civil society inquiries into the leading injustices in the world. This legacy
      of earlier peoples tribunals had a common core rationale for coming into existence.
      This rationale also defines the mission of the Gaza Tribunal and can be explained
      concisely: It is the failure of organized international society to respond to
      severe injustices by enforcing international law and holding perpetrators and
      accomplices accountable. In short, these tribunals arise when the governments
      of leading states and inter-governmental institutions fail or neglect to address
      severe injustices, especially bearing on war and peace. In essence, people only
      act in response to international issues when the established order exhibits its
      moral and legal depravity from the perspective of justice. It needs to be appreciated
      that the funding and organization of a people’s tribunal is a daunting challenge
      for ordinary citizen. Its inherent posture of radical opposition to governmental
      policy will be rejected harshly by establishment elites, including the corporate
      media, and often give rise to punitive reactions. That is to say, the reality
      of the Gaza Tribunal was a project not lightly undertaken by its principal organizers
      or by participating activists. Gaza is the leading example, as well as a metaphor
      for the dying of settler colonialism, and is thus perceived as a dagger struck
      to the heart of anti-colonial national liberation. It prompted a few countries
      of the Global South to have recourse to the International Court of Justice and
      the International Criminal Court, hoping to find formal and authoritative judicial
      support for their well-documented allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity.
      Even this progressive reliance on a ‘law and order approach’ turned out to be
      of little practical benefit in stopping the genocide. The near unanimous rulings
      and decisions of the ICJ proved to be as unenforceable as were the prior General
      Assembly ceasefire resolutions. And thus the genocide continue, perpetrators retain
      de facto impunity, and the complicit governments have the audacity to seek control
      over day after negotiations. Yet for opponents of Israel’s policies even these
      disappointing realities of judicial futility are helpful in this context because
      authoritative pronouncements of relevant law add symbolic force to the claim that
      Israel and its supporters have been driven from the high moral and legal ground
      despite their commanding influence over public discourse by virtue of hasbara
      manipulations and sympathetic major Western media outlets. Further, since 1945
      the side in political conflicts that wins the main legality battles also wins
      the legitimacy war that informally adjudicates right and wrong. These symbolic
      victories have turned out to be historically relevant to shaping political outcomes.
      From the Vietnam War forward the side with military superiority has rarely controlled
      political outcomes in anti-colonial warfare, however much death and devastation
      it inflicts in trying for victory. Whether Palestinian resilience, extraordinary
      as it is,  has the capability to withstand the relentless pressure of Israeli
      genocide insulated from the enforcement of legal obligations by geopolitical protection,
      and prepared for by decades of apartheid governance and ethnic cleansing that
      encountered hardly any pushback from the UN aside from contributions to Palestinian
      victories in the battlefields of the legitimacy war. In the coming days we will
      try to vindicate the establishment of the Gaza Tribunal by striving to add our
      efforts to rising global opposition to the brutal crimes of a continuing genocide.
      Can we do otherwise? Only two days ago Israel’s IDF reportedly knowingly targeted
      the home of two doctors married to one another. The IDF allegedly acted on the
      basis of surveillance technology that conveyed the knowledge that the house was
      full of children. While the mother, Alaa de-Najjar, a pediatrician was on duty
      at the nearby Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, her home was bombed and nine of
      her ten children were killed by the fire caused by the explosion. The nine bodies
      of her children were brought to her at the hospital, while her husband critically
      wounded by the bomb and the singly surviving child, aptly named Adam, were struggling
      to stay alive. Can any of us rest while such barbarous behavior goes on and on?
      Desperate for an end to this genocide I hope many will join me in calling for
      ‘the gravitas of awakened people’ to do what governments have failed to do, namely,
      to do all in our power to bring this Palestinian ordeal to an end We are gathered
      here in Sarajevo to respond as effectively as we can to what is being increasingly
      identified as ‘the moral challenge’ of our time. The Gaza ordeal has cast its
      dark shadow across the entire planet. Our endeavor is to make the experience of
      the Gaza Tribunal a glimmer of light, an expression of hope against hope. GAZA

    paragraph_summary: In his opening remarks at the Sarajevo Public Session of the
      Gaza Tribunal on May 26, 2025, Richard Falk expressed his regret for not being
      able to attend in person due to a family emergency. He emphasized the tribunal's
      mission to amplify the voices of those suffering in Gaza and to advocate for nonviolent
      actions aimed at pressuring Israel to cease what he termed genocide. Falk acknowledged
      the historical significance of Sarajevo, reflecting on its own tragic past, particularly
      the Srebrenica massacre, and drew parallels to the ongoing humanitarian crisis
      in Gaza, where daily atrocities have been documented. He highlighted the importance
      of recognizing the plight of Palestinians, who continue to endure immense suffering
      and displacement, and called for a collective commitment to address these injustices
      in the name of humanity.

    text: '[ Prefatory Note: The Gaza Tribunal will hold its first public session, starting
      Monday, 10:00 AM GMT;  it presents extensive reports on various dimensions of
      the Gaza Ordeal endured for more than 19 months by the population of the Gaza
      Strip, killing more than 50,000, wounding more than 100,000, and traumazing the
      entire population estimated at 2.3 million on October 7, 2023. As this meeting
      gets underway the surviving Palestinian population is being subjected to tactics
      of deliberate denial of food and medical supplies, and Israel leaders and public
      opinion is calling for extermination tactics as supplemented by forced exclusion
      or ethnic cleansing, not only in Gaza, but also in the West Bank. The Gaza Tribunal
      was formed as a civil society initiative after it became clear that neither the
      UN nor its member states possessed the political will or operational capabilities
      to stop the killing and devastation. Its intention is lend legitimacy to nonviolent
      civil society solidarity initiatives in support of the Palestinian struggle for
      basic rights. Links are available to access the streaming of the Sarajevo proceedings.

    text: '[ Prefatory Note: SHAPE is an international network of persons sensitive
      to the imperatives of human unity and the guardianship of the natural habitat
      in accordance ecological wisdom that illuminates paths of resilience and adaptation.
      In this era of predatory capitalism, imperial geopolitics, and surging fascism
      we as a leaspecies need to think, feel, and act differently to avoid catastrophe,
      and do so in a spirit of urgency. Please distribute this statement and contact
      us if you wish to endorse and join our efforts.] In the name of humanity, the
      barbarism in Gaza must stop Over the last eighteen months the world has witnessed
      undiluted militarised cruelty targeting the entire population and the supportive
      natural habitat of Gaza – with not so much as an ounce of mercy or compassion,
      let alone justice, or sensitivity to issues of ecological viability. No one has
      been spared in this onslaught: not civilians, not children, women or the elderly,
      not humanitarian workers or UN personnel overseeing the distribution of aid, not
      homes, schools, places of worship, or hospitals. No logic can begin to explain
      or justify this genocidal policy of indiscriminate maiming and killing, or the
      calculated and systematic starvation of the already traumatized Palestinian population.
      These and other unspeakable atrocities leave us with just two words to describe
      the conduct of the cabal presently ruling the State of Israel : pure evil Faced
      with such vicious behaviour, humanity has but one option: to call out the evil
      and take appropriate action to put an end to such outrageous conduct. In the name
      of humanity we therefore call on all peoples and governments to: Terminate all
      transactions with the State of Israel that relate to military capabilities until
      a just and lasting peace settlement has been reached, which gives effect to the
      inalienable right of Palestinian self-determination. This embargo should include:
      A ban on the export of all weapons and dual-use equipment as well as ammunition,
      whether supplied directly or through a third party A ban on the import of all
      Israeli weapons and military technology A cessation of all other forms of military
      cooperation, including joint operations/exercises/logistics and communications
      initiatives, intelligence cooperation and sharing, and expert exchanges and visits
      A ban on all financing arrangements designed to facilitate the above activities.
      Break diplomatic relations with the State of Israel until a complete and durable
      ceasefire has been established across all the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
      Seek the exclusion of Israeli participation in international cultural and sporting
      events and call for national boycotts of foreign and domestic cultural and sporting
      happenings until a complete and durable ceasefire has been established across
      all the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Apply maximum pressure on those governments
      that have been Israel’s primary backers, notably the United States, Britain and
      Germany, to cease forthwith any support of Israel’s inhuman conduct in Gaza and
      Palestine as a whole. Support and financially contribute to the Arab plan for
      Gaza’s reconstruction formally adopted by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation
      in March 2025, and to this end call for an immediate UN-sponsored international
      summit, open to all supportive governments, relevant regional organisations and
      sympathetically disposed civil society, philanthropic and business organisations.
      The reconstruction process in Gaza and the proposed international summit should
      be mindful of Palestinian rights, especially the right of self-determination as
      applicable to all developments pertaining to Israeli Occupied Palestine. Encourage
      nonviolent solidarity initiatives by civil society, both individual and collective
      action of the sort that proved helpful in the struggle against apartheid in South
      Africa. A mobilized people can change history, and bring political evil to an
      abrupt end, especially where, as is the case in Gaza, a severe humanitarian emergency
      exists. Such measures on the part of states need to be complemented and reinforced
      by resolute, collective action at the UN General Assembly. A special session of
      the General Assembly should be urgently called to denounce the heinous crimes
      being committed in Gaza and the West Bank and the constant threats to cleanse
      Palestine of its people by measures of forced displacement. The General Assembly
      should consider and adopt a series of resolutions which demand: An immediate ceasefire
      in all parts of Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and adjacent areas The establishment
      of  a UN peacekeeping contingent of sufficient strength to monitor and supervise
      the ceasefire and deter in timely fashion actions that would lead to a renewal
      of violence The unimpeded flow of water, food, fuel and medicines to Gaza Strong
      measures designed to protect humanitarian aid workers, health and medical personnel,
      and agencies and institutions engaged in the running of hospitals, clinics, kitchens
      and other essential services Decisive measures to enable journalists and media
      personnel to carry out their duties in safe and secure environments. We also request
      the world’s religious organisations to issue a call addressing from a spiritual
      and ethical perspective the evil of genocide as it continues to unfold in Gaza.
      They are uniquely placed to set forth the ethical criteria that should govern
      an agreement on the cessation of all military hostilities in the Occupied Territories
      and the creation of just and durable peace in Palestine. Since October 2023, millions
      have exposed and protested against Israel’s conduct in Gaza. They have succeeded
      in raising the level of global public awareness even though their cries for humanity
      and justice have thus far gone unheeded. The complicity of the rich and the powerful
      have stood in the way. People of good will everywhere must now redouble their
      efforts in solidarity with the Palestinian people. They must peacefully and resolutely
      unite their voices and work closely together for as long as it takes. A powerful
      global dialogue for a just peace in Palestine that brings together people of diverse
      social, cultural and religious background is a primary ethical imperative of our
      time. So is accountability, which means punitive action against leaders of the
      State of Israel and the complicit enabler governments, including imposing obligations
      to pay reparations to the victimised population of Gaza and contributions to the
      funding of reconstruction. Issued on behalf of SHAPE and its Coordinating Committee

    text: '[ Prefatory Note: The post below is the text of foreword to a very special
      book on the Palestinian Ordeal, written in the form of short pieces from 2009
      to the present. Banging on the Walls of the Tank, is especially illuminating by
      its portrayal of the contrast between the Israeli oppressive occupation before
      October 7 and after. It underscores a contrast between the earlier Israeli approach
      as ‘incremental genocide’ as opposed to ‘accelerated’ genocide after the Hamas
      attack. Copies of this book may be ordered from Amazon, and other booksellers.
      Eid is in the best traditions of journalism, scholarship, and engaged citizenship].
      The Political Is Inevitably Personal I have read many discerning and moving books
      on Palestine over the last fifty years but none has spoken to me as forcefully
      and persuasively as this short volume of opinion pieces written by Haidar Eid
      from 2009 to the present. The prophetic insight of these dispatches and their
      cumulative impact offer readers a vivid Palestinian narrative of tragic suffering
      and the heroic resistance of the Gazan population to Israel’s occupation, settler
      colonialism, apartheid, and genocide, as well as a pervasive Israeli reliance
      on collective punishment of Palestinians. Banging on the Walls of the Tank , a
      reliable interpretation not filtered and distorted by Western mainstream media,should
      be read by all those in the West who seek to understand the bitter realities of
      the Israel/Palestine struggle. Almost every page is enlivened by the author’s
      uncannily memorable formulations of the true and awful nature of the Palestinian
      plight, which was desperate long before the horrifying real-time genocide that
      has unfolded in the form of daily atrocity spectacles ever since October 7. In
      his readable style and with the skill of a trustworthy storyteller, Eid offers
      insights rooted in his direct experiences as a Gaza refugee, expositor of Palestinian
      steadfastness, resistance activist, witness, and survivor. Contextualizing October
      7 These dispatches, written since 2009 in response to the evolving bloody tactics
      and criminality of the Israeli occupation, are both an anticipation of the October
      7 attack and a condemnation of the Israeli genocidal response. An aspect of the
      originality and significance of Eid’s presentation is ti convincingly demonstrate
      that Israel has harbored an apartheid ideology and practice from the time of its
      birth. This is long before the most influential human rights organizations (including
      Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International) dared issue reports, as they did
      in 2021, that fully documented the allegations that Israel was systematically
      applying apartheid policies and practices to administer the occupation. Israel
      also relied upon discriminatory internal regulatory laws to subjugate all Palestinians
      who were directly subject to Israeli sovereignty, including those living in post-1948
      Israel as citizens. These domestic laws were supplemented by exclusionary nationality
      laws and practices relied upon by Israel to deny Palestinian refugees a right
      of return as bestowed by international law and confirmed by the United Nations
      General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 194 (11 Dec 1948) while at the same time granting
      birthright Jews an unlimited rights of return no matter whether they had any link
      to Israel or not. Eid’s dissent from pro-Israeli orthodoxy in Europe and North
      America extends to his important assessment that Israel’s supposed “disengagement”
      from Gaza in 2005 was deceptively presented to the world as a move toward peace.
      What was not told was that this Israeli unilateral initiative was coupled with
      Israeli administered border control that effectively imprisoned 2.3 million Gazans
      in their own homeland. Such confinement was later cruelly reinforced by a punitive
      siege that converted Gaza into what became known as the world’s largest ever concentration
      camp. The impact over time of these oppressive conditions are characterized by
      Eid, borrowing from historian Ilan Pappe, [1] as “incremental genocide.” This
      importantly demarcates the “before” and “after” of October 7 as one of continuity
      rather than as totally discontinuous, coming out of the blue, as Israel, followed
      by the West, desperately wants us to believe up to this day. It is obvious that
      Israel devoted much attention to decontextualizing October 7 to avoid the implications
      of the pre-October 7 realities of apartheid and incremental genocide so persuasively
      delineated by Eid being taken into account when evaluating the Hamas attack. Eid
      is writing as a victim/survivor/activist as well as a journalist/intellectual
      of the before and after of the Gaza ordeal. For him, the sixteen months of direct,
      undisguised genocide that has preoccupied the world to an unprecedented degree
      was nothing fundamentally new but rather an intensification of what Gazans had
      been experiencing ever since 1967 in more attenuated forms. There is no doubt
      that incremental genocide would be virtually impossible to establish in a court
      of law as a distinct crime because of the difficulty of proving genocidal intent
      as compared to criminalizing what followed after October 7 as a violation of the
      Genocide Convention. The numerous undisguised assertions by Israel’s top leaders
      easily met the rigorous legal standards of genocidal intent insisted upon by objective
      jurists. These words of genocidal incitement were combined with the crude, often
      sadistic, Israeli Defense Forces combat tactics relied upon to bring its helpless
      Palestinian adversary agonizingly close to the brink of extinction. The Israeli
      discourse on October 7 also points its finger at Hamas, seeking its complete delegitimation
      by treating its attack as pure “terrorism,” justifying an exterminist response,
      and relieving Israel of pressure to obey the laws of war in its response. Eid
      challenges this Israeli rationalization by regarding the attack as both a justifiable
      and a legitimate form of resistance, especially in view of the context, which
      includes the Netanyahu performance at the UNGA a few weeks earlier during which
      he displayed a map with no Palestinian entity, an erasure of Palestine alongside
      the presumed establishment of Greater Israel. By taking these factors into account,
      Eid produces a revisionist view of October 7 that is more realistic and reflective
      of the values at stake. There is a deeper significance to the way Eid establishes
      the context accounting for October 7. His approach is a necessary antidote to
      the Western hegemonic discourse, which denounced any assertion that the Palestinian
      attack was justifiable resistance to the provocative criminality of apartheid,
      several terrifying militarily inflicted massacres, and sixteen years of a cruelly
      punitive blockade whose constraints on imports could not be plausibly justified
      as a security measure while guaranteeing the misery of Palestinian lives in Gaza.
      Eid’s book should be read as a corrective to the disgraceful performance of a
      mainstream media in the West that excluded all considerations of context from
      its evaluation of the events of October 7 and declared justificatory acceptance
      of Israel’s claimed entitlement to act in self-defence, echoing its coverup of
      overt recourse to genocide as nothing other than a necessary “security operation.”
      This is a deliberate attempt to banish the word “genocide” from use in Western
      public discourse and mainstream media when reporting on Israel’s totally dominant
      military capabilities in executing its indiscriminate rampage against the completely
      helpless civilian population of Gaza. Despite this effort to restore the discipline
      of pro-Israeli discourse, describing the Israeli violence as “genocide” has been
      gradually normalized in many societal and media venues, but not yet all. Failures
      of Implementation: International Law and Universal Moral Standards This linkage
      between what daily occurs on the ground in Gaza and the broader issues of toxic
      dysfunction that have long poisoned the Palestinian experience exposes the willful
      impotence of what Eid generously terms the “international community,” as if there
      was one.  It is intolerable for Eid that outsiders, whether governments, international
      institutions, media, or even individuals, remain spectators, or worse, render
      aid and comfort to the perpetrators and their accomplices in carrying out this
      “crime of crimes.”  Along the way, Eid acknowledges that the Nazi Holocaust against
      Jews was similarly internationally tolerated, especially by the Western liberal
      democracies that have, since 1945, alleviated their guilt at the expense of the
      Palestinians, who pay for moral shortcomings for which they had no responsibility.
      Two massive wrongs never make things right; rather, as the poet Auden teaches,
      “those to whom evil is done / do evil in return.” [2] Israel’s official occupation
      policy after 1967 stressed putting the people of Gaza “on a diet,” with just enough
      food to avoid death by starvation but not enough to enable nutritional health.
      Eid emphasizes the long denial of the right of return enjoyed by refugees after
      1948 as affirmed in the UNGA Resolution 194. Any process of satisfying the requirements
      of international law would also necessitate the dismantling of the apartheid regime
      of control and ethno-religious claims of a Jewish supremist state. Eid’s Vision
      and Its Enemies As Eid articulates his vision of a benevolent future for the Palestinian
      people, he sets forth its simple but far-reaching governance implications: A single
      secular state for both peoples from the river to the sea with equal rights for
      all resident ethnicities. For Eid, this is the one and only solution, an indirect
      repudiation of the two-state delusion as well as his complete rejection of an
      Israeli one-state apartheid Greater Israel. Eid does far more than relate the
      horrors of incremental genocide. He condemns not only the Israeli perpetrators
      but severely incriminates their complicit supporters who supplied weaponry and
      funding that sustains the mighty military capabilities of Israel and give diplomatic
      credence to it is flagrant defiance of international law. This is more than critique,
      it is also a rejection of the only pathway Eid envisions as leading to peace with
      justice for the Palestinians, and even Jews. Such a solution, which will strike
      many jaded souls as “utopian” or both unattainable and unacceptable, rests on
      the simple major premise of fulfilling Palestinian rights under international
      law. In the Palestinian case, this means, among other policy alterations, lifting
      the draconian blockade of Gaza that has made the daily existence of inhabitants
      of Gaza (two-thirds of whom are refugees) a life of misery, one deliberately “engineered”
      by Israeli tacticians who “mow the lawn,” a term officials in Tel Aviv use to
      refer to Israel’s massive military attacks that are properly undertaken whenever
      Gaza seems to pose security threats by the vitality of its resistance activism,
      regardless of whether by armed struggle or nonviolent civil action. Eid’s dispatches
      are written with the passion and experience of someone who has lived as a refugee
      since 1964, when he was born in Gaza. His parents lived in the Nuseirat Refugee
      Camp after they were forced, in 1948, to leave their home in the Palestinian village
      of Zarnouga. As the decades passed, they never gave up their expectation on one
      day returning to Zarnouga, even knowing it had been demolished. As they faced
      death, Eid’s parents last wish was that at least their bodies could be returned
      to their village for burial; a wish that was denied; a wish that, even if granted,
      would be far from fulfilling the kind of return envisioned by international law.
      That he grew up in a refugee household helps explain Eid’s preoccupation with
      the exercise of the right of return of the five or six million Palestinians living
      as refugees as a necessary feature of any sustainable and acceptable peace process.
      And as such, it undoubtedly informs why he shows such contempt for the Oslo diplomacy
      initiated in 1993, a diplomacy that totally ignored, and implicitly rejected,
      this basic right embodied in international law. On other grounds, as well, Oslo
      justifiably reinforced his rejection of a Palestinian leadership that failed to
      insist on affirming the Palestinian entitlement to the most fundamental of human
      rights in the post-colonial era, the inalienable right of self-determination possessed
      by all peoples and claimed on behalf of every nation on the planet. Eid adopts
      a cynical view of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which, by accepting
      the Oslo framework, sacrificed the future of Palestine for a seat at the far end
      of the negotiating table and the dubious ‘reward’ of a photo op on the White House
      lawn; the photo was used by the West to show the world the much celebrated, but
      deeply misleading Arafat/Rabin handshake as a historic reconciliation that was
      never to be implenmented . What followed the publicized initiation of Oslo diplomacy
      was, at best, a charade that dragged on long enough for Israel to expand its settler
      population to a politically irreversible level. Throughout, Israel has benefited
      from a ‘peace process’ that was never about peace, and which while running its
      course seriously harmed the Palestinians. The supervision of the negotiations
      by the overtly partisan US government should never have been accepted by the designated
      representatives of the Palestinian people who defied reason by not insisting on
      neutral auspices. As Rashid Khalidi, among others, have shown, the United States
      never even pretended to be an honest broker of the Oslo Process, but made no secret
      of situating itself in Israel’s corner. [3] Eid’s perspective is formed by a blend
      of his multiple identities as victim, witness, survivor, activist, humanist, writer
      and journalist, university teacher, and public intellectual. This rare combination
      of experience and commitment contributes to making Eid an exemplary interpreter
      of the ongoing Palestinian ordeal. He is decidedly not a neutral observer; he
      is an undisguised and fully engaged “honest partisan” who develops a compelling
      Palestinian account of why the Palestinian ordeal came about and was allowed to
      happen. While his observations are avowedly one-sided, this lack of balance, oddly,
      provides a more objective approach because it is congruent with the realities
      of Gaza if tested by the evidence, regulative norms of law and morality, and proclaimed
      values at stake. As such, it presents readers with a happy contrast to the brainwashing
      pretensions of such influential media platforms as the New York Times or The Economist
      , which claim balance but, when it comes to reporting on Israel/Palestine, are
      more accurately perceived as sophisticated instruments of state propaganda. Even
      without the benefit of being confronted by the pre-October 7 historical, legal,
      and ethical context, public protest began to mount, including in the centers of
      Israeli support in North America and Western Europe, as Israel continued the genocide
      unabated, refusing to heed growing public calls for ceasefires and constraint.
      Pro-Palestinian protests erupted on many university campuses but were quickly
      countered by Israeli donor leverage and governmental pressures, especially in
      the US. With the advent of Trump in 2025, pro-Palestinian activism on campuses
      and elsewhere faced renewed challenges, and not only in the US but also throughout
      Europe, reflecting a political swing to the ultraright. Valuing and Learning from
      the Eid Perspective What also makes Eid’s commentary exceptional is the authenticity
      of his voice, shaped by his intense experiences since his birth in 1964. His work
      is further informed by channeling the wisdom of profound and enraged Palestinian
      cultural icons, referencing the insights of Ghassan Kanafani, Mahmoud Darwish,
      and Edward Said, as well as making good use of anti-colonial writings drawn from
      authors in the Global South. It should be instructive for all readers that Eid
      derives his inspirational political guidance from these cultural sources rather
      than from the Palestinian political leaders that he holds co-responsible for misleading
      their own people in various self-destructive ways. Eid is appalled by the willingness
      of the Palestinian leaders anointed by the West to accept what he calls “bread
      crumbs” rather than insisting on liberation and basic rights as conferred by international
      law; law that is never acknowledged by Israel or enforced by either the UN or
      responsible geopolitical statecraft as ineptly overseen by the United States since
      the end of the Cold War that tended to favor geopolitical and strategic interests
      to legal, moral, and even prudent restraint. The most tainted bread crumb, in
      Eid’s reflections, is the idea of the acceptance of a permanently demilitarized
      Palestinian statehood on 22 percent of historic Palestine, especially considering
      that, in 1947, Palestinians rejected the dubious UN partition resolution that
      split the country – but at least awarded Palestinian with 45 percent of the land.
      Eid is deeply influenced by the successful, analogous struggle against the hegemonic
      racism and settler colonialism of apartheid South Africa. He believes that the
      lessons of this earlier struggle can be adapted and applied to Palestinian circumstances,
      embracing the famous dictum, often attributed to Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci,
      “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will,” which distinguishes the rational
      understanding of political injustices from an emotional reassurance that a just
      outcome will emerge from the struggle of the Palestinian people. In addressing
      this tension from my outlook, my rational self is less confident than Eid about
      the sufficiency of the South African model of liberation. I believe that Palestinian
      liberation will remain impossible unless it overcomes the primacy of adverse geopolitics
      (shaped by strategic interests rather than by a willingness to respect the rule
      of law and universally affirmed moral notms). These currently unregulated forces
      empower the Islamophobic complicity of the white West and are currently aligned
      with the Zionist networks in the West that have exerted an unhealthy influence
      over policy formation at national, regional, and global levels. Giving equal attention
      to matters of political will, I am also encouraged by anti-colonial success stories.
      This reading of the recent historical record echoes Eid’s interpretations and,
      before him, Said’s. Both thinkers deeply theorized a belief that the side that
      controls “the high moral ground” in the end prevails politically over the side
      that dominates the battlefield due to its military superiority. In my terminology,
      and in keeping with Eid’s assessments, Palestine is winning this Legitimacy War
      and is on its way to an emancipatory future, although with much suffering and
      devastation on the road to such a political outcome. This guardedly hopeful outlook
      assumes Palestinian perseverance for as long as it takes, which Israel is ceaselessly
      working to undermine and weaken by its recourse to the most extreme methods of
      violence in the combat zones and to dirty tricks overseas, including “weaponizing
      antisemitism” as a policy tool of combat. In Conclusion The title of Eid’s book,
      borrowed from a poignant line in Kanafani’s novel Men in the Sun , would strike
      most international readers as enigmatic and obscure. Eid informs us that these
      words have become a popular slogan of Palestinian resistance fighters, conveying
      the vital message, “If you want to live, make noise”; that is, resist, but if
      ready to die in body or spirit, stay quiet. Such is Eid’s fighting spirit. His
      noise is a challenge to all everywhere to act on behalf of the Palestinian struggle
      within our respective spaces before it is too late. And as a fitting indictment,
      Eid’s last words in the epilogue again echo those of Kanafani: “Gazans have been
      banging on the walls of the Gaza concentration camp since 1948,” and still nothing
      happens by way of rescue, much less liberation. Silence almost everywhere, especially
      shameful among Arab regimes neighbouring besieged Gaza is reinforced by the timidities
      of the Arab League. For Eid, Arab silence is not broken by uttering words of condemnation
      unless accompanied by coercive actions. In this sense, Eid’s own journey has led
      him and his family to take refuge in South Africa in recent months, the country
      that has acted more substantively than any other against Israel since October
      7E by submitting a graphic complaint to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
      alleging Israeli violations of the Genocide Convention. Unsurprisingly, Eid in
      exile insists that Palestinian liberation must take the form of a single secular
      constitutional and democratic state with recognized borders encompassing the whole
      of mandate Palestine. This affirmation is coupled with a total rejection of the
      dangerous fiction of co-existence and accommodation that is based on the mutual
      acceptance of a neutered Palestinian mini state that would be permanently demilitarized
      and otherwise left at the mercy of a highly militarized and racist Israel. [AC1]
      Secondly for Eid, a present grounding of realistic hope in this particular liberation
      struggle must be predominantly based on the activation of people rather than the
      good will and energies of governments and their institutions. This leads Eid to
      stress the role of solidarity initiatives to be with a sense of urgency throughout
      the world as typified by the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign. He strongly
      endorses BDS as a principal modality of Palestinian prospects ever since its initiation
      in 2005, when it began as a collective action with the backing of 170 Palestinian
      civil society organizations. In effect, liberation from settler colonialism in
      the historical presence can move toward victory only when people in strategic
      countries around the world are sufficiently mobilized to exert transformative
      pressures on governments and the international community to undo the political
      and economic ties that bind them to the oppressor. Eid is lucidly persuasive in
      his refusal to accept the common refrain that there are “two sides” in recent
      debates about Israeli tactics and goals. Zionist liberals especially would have
      us so believe, evading the central reality that this a classic struggle, with
      distinctive features of the oppressed against the oppressor and its complicit
      allies. Eid is seeking a crucial rectification of the asymmetrical nature of the
      struggle. Suc continues to be highly controversial in the West, but seems vital
      to act upon if non-Palestinians are to support a genuinely just and sustainable
      peace. This view expresses a radical challenge to the status quo as its realization
      requires the rejection of the Zionist Project of Jewish supremist prerogatives
      in a distinct state as the essential precondition could enable the two peoples
      to live together as equals. Eid’s vision of liberation does not include the forced
      departure (in effect, an ethnic cleansing) of Jews or the destruction of Israel
      as a state, but it does require major adhustments: a fundamental reconstruction
      of its internal race relations; an abandonment of Zionist ideology; ethnic equality
      of treatment in nationality and citizenship laws; and quite likely the naming
      of the emergent one-state entity to signify the rejection of an ethnic statehood
      for either people. Gruesome patterns of Israeli abuses over the years are further
      confirmed by Eid’s own existential encounters with Israel’s prolonged dehumanizing
      and sadistic treatment of the people of Gaza, especially its children. His prose
      is written not with ink but with the blood of the innocents, undoubtedly a tearful
      recounting of very concrete incidents involving family members, close friends,
      neighbours. Eid is unflinching in his determination to bring Israel’s brutalizing
      behaviour out into the open by bearing anguished witness to targeted killings
      of innocent children by Israeli snipers, as well high tech weapons of war that
      killed whole families trapped in their homes and devastated entire residential
      neighbourhoods during Israel’s massive incursions, characterized as “massacres,”
      in 2008–09, 2012, 2014, 2018, and frequently, on a smaller scale, in the leadup
      to the full-scale genocidal response to October 7. In a significant conceptual
      move, Eid follows Pappe in presenting these years preceding that pivotal day as
      “incremental genocide.” This reality posed for every Palestinian an ultimate choice
      between the dangers of resistance and the humiliations of submission to the harsh
      apartheid constraints of Israeli control. What makes this book truly groundbreaking,
      aside from its chronicling of witnessing in ways that impressively counteract
      the propagandistic decontextualization of October 7, is its clarity when it comes
      to a critique of the mainstream diagnosis of the Palestinian struggle and accompanying
      positive prescriptions about the path to a Palestinian victory emerging from the
      piles of rubble signifying Gaza after enduring these months of genocide. Even
      though the provisional rulings of the ICJ on January 26, 2024, did nothing to
      change the facts on the ground, it should be read as an authoritative affirmation
      of the legitimacy of the Palestinian struggle and a heartfelt juridical lament
      for the accompanying humanitarian catastrophe still befalling Gaza. It undoubtedly
      helped motivate Eid to express the optimism of his will by the dramatic assertion
      in the epilogue that “Israel is now on the verge of collapse.” Richard Falk Santa

    paragraph_summary: '"Banging on the Walls of the Tank" is a compelling collection
      of opinion pieces by Haidar Eid, chronicling the Palestinian experience from 2009
      to the present. The book contrasts the Israeli occupation''s earlier "incremental
      genocide" with the "accelerated genocide" that has emerged following the Hamas
      attack on October 7. Eid''s writings provide a poignant narrative of the suffering
      and resilience of the Gazan population, highlighting themes of occupation, settler
      colonialism, apartheid, and collective punishment. His insights, drawn from personal
      experiences as a Gaza refugee and resistance activist, offer a powerful perspective
      that challenges mainstream Western media portrayals of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
      The book serves as an essential resource for those seeking to understand the harsh
      realities faced by Palestinians.'
